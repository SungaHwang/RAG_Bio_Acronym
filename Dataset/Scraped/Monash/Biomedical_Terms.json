{"Word":"Action Potential","Definition":"A rapid series of changes in the resting membrane potential (RMP) of a neuron or muscle cell, caused by stimulus-triggered, selective opening and closing of voltage-sensitive gates in Sodium and Potassium ion channels and, in some cells, involving other ions such as Calcium. The AP is produced in response to a stimulus or input that causes the RMP to reach a threshold level. If this is reached, the Action Potential (AP) occurs, commencing with a depolarization phase when the RMP becomes progressively less negative and eventually goes past (overshoots) 0 milliVolts to reach a positive value (i.e., the inside of that point of the cell membrane now becomes positively charged compared to the outside). This is followed by a repolarization phase where the membrane potential returns to its resting value (i.e., the inside of that point of the cell membrane once again is negatively charged compared to the outside), an undershoot phase when the membrane potential may transiently become more negative than the resting level, and finally by a gradual return of the membrane potential to the resting level. As noted above the AP is produced if the RMP reaches a threshold level. At this threshold level, voltage-gated Na+ channels open allowing an influx of Na+ ions down its electrochemical gradient, thereby causing the depolarization phase. Repolarisation occurs when these channels close and voltage-gated K+ channels open to allow the efflux of K+ down its electrochemical gradient and (generally) this is also responsible for the undershoot. An active Na+\/K+ ion pump (see Primary Active transport systems: ATPase-ion pumps) is responsible for re=establishing the resting membrane potential by re-establishing the resting ionic concentrations. Note that there are many nuances of this basic description of the factors underlying an AP, e.g., in cardiac cells Ca++ ions play a role in maintaining a plateau of depolarisation, etc."}

{"Word":"Activity based proteomics (or Activity based protein profiling)","Definition":"A functional proteomic technology that uses specially designed chemical probes that react with mechanistically-related classes of enzymes. The basic unit of ABPP is the probe which typically consists of two elements: a reactive group (RG) and a tag. Additionally, some probes may contain a binding group which enhances selectivity. The reactive group usually contains an electrophile that gets covalently-linked to a nucleophilic residue in the active site of an active enzyme. An enzyme that is inhibited by enzyme inhibitors or post-translational modifications will not react with an activity-based probe. The tag may be either a reporter such as a fluorophore or a handle such as biotin or an alkyne or azide for use with the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (also known as click chemistry).A major advantage of ABPP is the ability to monitor enzyme activity directly, rather than being limited to protein or mRNA abundance. With classes of enzymes such as the serine proteases and metalloproteases that often interact with endogenous inhibitors or that exist as inactive zymogens, this technique offers a valuable advantage over traditional techniques that rely on abundance rather than activity.Finally, in recent years ABPP has been combined with tandem mass spectrometry enabling the identification of hundreds of active enzymes from a single sample. This technique, known as ABPP-MudPIT is especially useful for profiling inhibitor selectivity as the potency of an inhibitor can be tested against hundreds of targets simultaneously."}

Adjacent-1 segregation is the usual type of adjacent segregation, consisting of segregation of non-homologous centromeres during meiosis in a reciprocal translocation heterozygote such that unbalanced gametes with duplications and deficiencies are produced. Adjacent-2 segregation is rare, consisting of the segregation of homologous centromeres during meiosis in a translocation heterozygote such that unbalanced gametes with duplications and deficiencies are produced."}

{"Word":"Adjusted response (in assasys)","Definition":"The raw response of a sample, adjusted to remove signal variation. It is a measurement of the total ligand binding of the sample. The adjusted response is obtained by multiplying the raw response times the multiplying factor for that assay run. The multiplying factor is calculated by dividing the relative activity entered in Test Method Setup by the average of the tracer activity raw responses. By adjusting the tracer activity (sometimes termed total count in isotopic assays) to the relative activity, signal variation (differences from assay run to assay run due to decay, enzyme\/substrate deterioration, instrument drift, etc.) can be factored out from binding variation, (differences from assay run to assay run due to binder deterioration, incubation differences, buffer changes, etc.). An arbitrary value (relative activity) is entered to which the average tracer activity's response will be adjusted. This value is defaulted to 100,000 CPM for isotopic and chemiluminescent assays, and to 2 for colorimetric test methods. If tracer activity samples are assayed, StatLIA will adjust all raw responses to this value to remove signal variation. These adjusted responses will then be used for all computations.. If tracer activity samples are not assayed, no adjustment will be performed and the raw responses will be used for all computations."}

{"Word":"Alzheimer's Disease","Definition":"A neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive memory loss and severe dementia in advanced cases. Alzheimer's Disease is associated with certain abnormalities in brain tissue, involving a particular protein, beta-amyloid. The gene encoding amyloid has been located and cloned from chromosome 21.AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease which shows the clinical symptoms of memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioural changes. AD is an age-associated disease; the prevalence of AD increases with age, from 6% of the population aged 65 years and over, to over 40% of individuals aged 85 years and over. Diagnosis of AD is confirmed post mortem by neuropathological examination. The main neuropathological features of AD are: neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) caused by a hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau, formation of extracellular deposits of -amyloid termed senile plaques, reactive astrocytosis, granulovacuolar degeneration, and neuronal loss. The last-mentioned is related to the clinical symptoms of memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioural changes through the disruption of synaptic connectivity. No cure has yet been found, and current treatment is associated with modest symptomatic improvement in some patients. Alzheimer pathology is not distributed uniformly throughout the brain. Certain areas are more susceptible to the proteinaceous aggregations of -amyloid in extracellular plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), the loss of synapses and neurones, and the reactive proliferation of astrocytes. These major hallmarks of Alzheimer pathology are progressive in severity, but not all are in synchrony with the advance of clinical symptoms. Loss of synapses and synaptic proteins measured post mortem show the closest correlation with declining ante mortem cognitive test scores. Accumulating NFT pathology correlates with cognitive decline but -amyloid (A) plaque load does not. A major aim of this project is to contrast different aspects of Alzheimer pathologies in both spared and susceptible regions of the brain and to compare the severity of the pathologies with cognitive test scores and the rates of decline. The region-specific loss of synapses could be the substrate for the cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD.Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and operates in more than 70% of synapses, including afferents to hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal neurons, the major neurone classes lost in AD 7. Three vesicular glutamate transporter isoforms (VGLUT13) have been cloned and characterised; specific antibodies are available. VGLUT1 and 2 divide distinct subpopulations of excitatory synapses 8. VGLUT3 overlaps in distribution with the other two isoforms, and colocalises with markers of cholinergic and serotonergic synapses in some areas. The VGLUTs are ideal choices as markers of glutamatergic terminals. Significantly lower VGLUT1, but not VGLUT2, immunoreactivity has been reported in parietal and occipital cortical regions of AD brain that correlated with NFT load, a marker of pathological severity 10. The decline in VGLUT1 and 2 was also correlated with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score in the prefrontal dorsolateral cortex in AD cases 11. There was a further reduction of VGLUT1 levels in cases with comorbid depression. Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies of the VGLUTs will help to determine whether these proteins are lost from otherwise intact glutamatergic terminals. The major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, -amino butyric acid (GABA), is packaged into presynaptic vesicles by the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT). This transporter has not been studied in AD, but A140 was found to reduce the levels of VIAAT in hippocampal cell culture, reflecting the decrease in GABAergic input despite more, albeit shorter, dendrites. VIAAT complements the VGLUTs and serves as an excellent marker of presynaptic inhibitory terminals.Excitatory synapse formation and maintenance may be of particular importance to the clinical symptoms, damage, and\/or regrowth of synapses in AD. N-cadherin belongs to a large family of cell adhesion proteins. It is implicated in neurite outgrowth, synaptic junctional complex formation, and maintenance of the synapse. It is located both in the presynaptic terminal and on the postsynaptic membrane, and colocalises with synaptophysin, synapsin I, PSD95, and GluR1.Immunological staining of N- (neural) and E- (epithelial) cadherin is mutually exclusive; some synapses are negative for both. In cultured hippocampal cells, N-cadherin segregates from general to excitatory synapses during maturation, suggesting that it would be a good candidate as an excitatory synaptic marker. In AD, N-cadherin is associated at the synaptic junction with presenilin1 (PS1), a protein encoded by the most commonly mutated gene in familial AD. In cultured cells, mutant forms of PS1 suppress N-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion by subcellular misplacement. -catenin binds to N-cadherin and mediates its interaction with the cytoskeleton. -catenin has a multifaceted r\u00f4le not only in synapse formation but also in activation of transcription factors through the Wnt signaling pathway. -catenin is reportedly associated with PS1 and GSK3, a kinase involved in the putative hyper-phosphorylation of tau to form NFTs. N-cadherin and -catenin levels were higher in AD than controls. Excitatory synaptic terminals in adult mammalian CNS are held in place by an asymmetric junctional complex. The protein PSD95 (SAP90) binds to the NR1 subunit of the glutamate-NMDA receptor. It has been implicated in the assembly of some of the components of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and in receptor targeting and localization. PSD95 levels are reportedly lower in AD superior temporal cortex than in controls, a finding replicated in our laboratory (see results to date). EAAT3 is a glutamate transporter located on the postsynaptic membrane. Reports on the levels of EAAT3 in AD are conflicting. One study reported no loss of EAAT3 in AD frontal cortex, while another study showed an accumulation of detergent-insoluble EAAT3 in AD hippocampus. Together with the following markers of excitatory postsynaptic terminals, EAAT3 is a good candidate for study. A tubulin binding protein, gephyrin, is associated with glycine and GABA receptors and anchors them in clusters at the postsynaptic membrane. Gephyrin levels are significantly reduced in AD. Aberrant levels of these proteins could alter the glutamate and\/or GABA receptor populations at the postsynaptic terminal."}

The poly-D-glutamic acid capsule is nontoxic by itself, but plays an important role in protecting the organism from being killed by phagocytes. Anthrax toxin consists of three distinct proteins: lethal factor, oedema factor, and protective antigen. The lethal factor is a protease that cleaves members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) family, thereby interrupting the signaling pathways. The edema factor is an adenylate cyclise. The protective antigen mediates the delivery of these two enzymatic components by binding to a cellular receptor.The Bacillus anthracis spore is quite stable and can exist in soil for many years. However, naturally occurring anthrax is very rare. The bacterial spores usually clump together and are hard to suspend in air. To make them deadly, they have to be separated and combined with fine dust particles to increase the time of floating in air."}

{"Word":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)","Definition":"A behavior disorder originating in childhood in which a child exhibits signs of developmentally inappropriate hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. Although most individuals have symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, one or the other pattern may be predominant. These characteristics are usually present before the age of 7. ADHD is similar to \"Attention Deficit Disorder\", except emphasis is placed on the hyperactivity. Believed to be a condition which affects those parts of the brain which control attention, impulses and concentration. Argued to affect 3 to 7% of school age children; the disorder is more frequent in males than females.. A child who suffers from this condition shows disruptive behaviours, which cannot be explained by any other psychiatric condition and are not in keeping with those of the same-aged people with similar intelligence and development.Children with ADHD have difficulty focussing their attention to complete a specific task. Additionally they can be hyperactive and impulsive and can suffer from mood swings and social clumsiness. They are believed to tend to display the following behaviours: - Hyperactivity Impulsive behaviour Inattention Social clumsiness Poor coordination Disorganisation Mood swings Specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia, language problems, difficulties with handwriting \/ written work. Children with ADHD are restless and cannot sit still or do any one thing for very long. They are easily distracted and, because they find it so hard to pay attention, they may often be criticised for being careless and making too many mistakes at school. They appear not to listen when someone is talking to them, they find it hard to wait their turn and they can be disruptive in play. In people with ADHD, behavioural problems are seen in several places i.e. not just at school. Some children with ADHD have significant problems with concentration and attention but are not necessarily overactive or impulsive.These behaviours are usually first noticed in early childhood, and they are more extreme than simple misbehaving.Symptoms often attenuate during late adolescence although a minority experience the full complement of symptoms into mid-adulthood."}

Usually performed by an audiologist using an instrument called an audiometer.In the audiogram hearing sensitivity is expressed not as some absolute level but as decibel Hearing Level (dB HL) in which the hearing of the person is measured relative to normal hearing sensitivity (determined previously from a large normative population). Thus, on the audiometer a value of 0 dB HL represents not some absolute sound pressure level of 0 but rather the sound pressure level corresponding to mean hearing level at that frequency in the normal population.Audiometers are pre-calibrated so that the value of 0 dB HL at each frequency is equal to the sound pressure level corresponding to mean hearing level at that frequency in the normal population.

Moreover, if there is not excess air in the stomach, the act of belching actually may cause more air to be swallowed. \"Burping\" infants during bottle or breastfeeding is important in order to expel air in the stomach that has been swallowed with the formula or milk."}
{"Word":"Benchmarking","Definition":"Benchmarking (of computers) consists of defining one or several variables that describe a computer system's performance, and to measure these variables. There is no standard or generally accepted measure for computer system capacity: ``capacity'' is a mix of multiple parameters like cycle time, memory access time, architectural peculiarities like parallelism of processors and their communication, instruction parallelism or pipelining, etc. Usually, benchmarks should include system software aspects like compiler efficiency and task scheduling. Potential buyers of computer systems, in particular large and parallel systems, usually have to go to more or less detailed understanding of systems, and perform benchmark tests, i.e. they execute performance measurements with their own program mix, in order to assess the overall performance of candidate systems. Attempts to express computer capacity in a single or a few numbers have resulted in more or less controversial measures; conscientious manufacturers advertise with several or all of these. MIPS is an acronym for Million Instructions Per Second, and is one of the measures for the speed of computers. It has been attempted, theoretically, to impose an instruction mix of 70% additions and 30% multiplications (fixed point), and architectural factors as much as efficiency of scheduling or compilation should be entirely ignored. This makes the measure a simple and crude one, barely superior to cycle time. In practice, vendors usually make some corrections for such factors, and the results found are considered more or less controversial. Sometimes a floating point instruction mix is used; the unit is then called MFLOPS, clearly not a useful measure for some types of programs. The Whetstone benchmark (like a later relative, Dhrystone) is a group of synthetic (i.e. artificially defined) program pieces, meant to represent an instruction mix matching the average frequency of operations and operands of ``typical'' program classes. A different effort resulted in the SPEC benchmarks: a grouping of major workstation manufacturers called the System Performance Evaluation Cooperative agreed on a set of real programs and inputs, against which to measure performance. Real programs such as a mix of Linpack (linear algebra) operations are also frequently used for benchmarks."}

{"Word":"Binning (of data)","Definition":"The process of grouping measured data into data classes or histogram bins. Discretization, quantization, or digitizing are very similar concepts. After binning, the fine-grain information of the original measured values is lost, and one uses only bin contents. The amount of information lost in this way is negligible if the bin widths are small compared with the experimental resolution. Many statistical methods, notably those based on the chi-square distribution, require that data be binned, and that the bins satisfy certain constraints, namely that the number of events in each bin be not less than a certain minimum number so that the distribution of expected events per bin is approximately Gaussian. Opinions differ on the minimum number of events required, but this is usually taken as being between five and ten, provided only a few bins have this minimum number. There is no reason why bins should be of equal width, except for convenience of computation (e.g. in image processing), and many studies indicate that the statistically optimal binning is that which gives equally probable bins. Where the amount of data is so small that wide bins are necessary, it is preferable to avoid binning by using other methods if possible. For example, use the maximum likelihood fit instead of the least squares fit, and use the Kolmogorov test or the Cramer-Smirnov-Von-Mises test rather than the one-dimensional chi-square test."}

These closely packed capillaries supply blood to the brain and spinal cord. The BBB serves to prevent the passage of large molecules and cells into the CNS. Large molecules cannot permeate through the narrow spaces, however fat soluble (lipophilic) molecules can dissolve through the capillary cell membranes and are absorbed into the brain.

Systolic blood pressure, the pressure measured during contraction of the ventricles, averages about 120 mm Hg in arteries of the systemic circulation (for healthy, young adults). The diastolic blood pressure, measured during ventricle relaxation, is about 80 mm Hg in these arteries. As blood travels through the arterial system, resistance from the walls of the blood vessels reduces the pressure and velocity of the blood. Blood pressure drops sharply in the arterioles and falls to between 40 and 20 mm Hg in the capillaries. Blood pressure descends further in the venules and approaches zero in the veins."}
{"Word":"Blotting","Definition":"A technique for transferring a specific protein or nucleic acid from an electrophoresis gel matrix to a microporous membrane, for detecting one RNA within a mixture of RNAs (a Northern blot) or one type of DNA within a mixture of DNAs (a Southern blot)..A blot can prove whether that one species of RNA or DNA is present, how much is there, and its approximate size. Basically, blotting involves gel electrophoresis, transfer to a blotting membrane (typically nitrocellulose or activated nylon), and incubating with a radioactive probe. Exposing the membrane to X-ray film produces darkening at a spot correlating with the position of the DNA or RNA of interest. The darker the spot, the more nucleic acid was present there. The DNA is first transferred from the gel to a membrane by capillary action. Fluid wicks from the gel through the blotting membrane to several layers of absorbent paper, but the nucleic acids stick to the membrane. Baking the filter fixes the DNA or RNA to the filter.Then specific bands are detected by hybridization. The filter membrane is incubated with radioactive probe, which hybridizes to some bands. After the filter is washed (to remove unused probe), an X-ray film exposed to the filter will show which bands have hybridized."}

{"Word":"Caspase","Definition":"A type of enzyme known as proteases, which play essential roles in apoptosis (cell death) and inflammation. Caspases are characterized by their unusual ability to cleave proteins at specific sites. Active caspases can often activate other caspases, leading to a cascade of protein degradation. As proteases, they are enzymes that cleave (cut) other proteins. They are called cysteine proteases, because they use a cysteine residue to cut those proteins, and called caspases because the cysteine residue cleaves their substrate proteins at the aspartic acid residue. Caspases are essential in cells for apoptosis, one of the main types of programmed cell death in development and most other stages of adult life, and have been termed \"executioner\" proteins for their roles in the cell. Some caspases are also required in the immune system for the maturation of cytokines. Failure of apoptosis is one of the main contributions to tumour development and autoimmune diseases; this coupled with the unwanted apoptosis that occurs with ischaemia or Alzheimer's disease, has boomed the interest in caspases as potential therapeutic targets since they were discovered in the mid 1990s. Eleven caspases have so far been identified in humans. There are two types of apoptotic caspases: initiator (apical) caspases and effector (executioner) caspases. Initiator caspases (e.g. CASP2, CASP8, CASP9 and CASP10 cleave inactive pro-forms of effector caspases, thereby activating them. Effector caspases (e.g. CASP3, CASP6, CASP7 in turn cleave other protein substrates within the cell resulting in the apoptotic process. The initiation of this cascade reaction is regulated by caspase inhibitors. CASP4 and CASP5, which are overexpressed in some cases of vitiligo and associated autoimmune diseases caused by NALP1 variants, are not currently classified as initiator or effector in Mesh. This is because they are inflammatory caspases, which in concert with CASP1, are involved in cytokine maturation. CASP14, is not involved in apoptosis or inflammation, but instead is involved in skin cell development. Caspases are regulated at a post-translational level, ensuring that they can be rapidly activated. They are first synthesized as inactive pro-caspases, that consist of a prodomain, a small subunit and a large subunit. Initiator caspases possess a longer prodomain than the effector caspases, whose prodomain is very small. The prodomain of the initiator caspases contain domains such as a CARD domain (e.g. caspases-2 and -9) or a death effector domain (DED) (caspases-8 and -10) that enables the caspases to interact with other molecules that regulate their activation. These molecules respond to stimuli which cause the clustering of the initiator caspases. This allows them to autoactivate, so that they can then proceed to activate the effector caspases. The caspase cascade can be activated by : Granzyme B (released by cytotoxic T lymphocytes) which is known to activate caspase-3 and -7; death receptors (like FAS, TRAIL receptors and TNF receptor) which can activate caspase-8 and -10; the apoptosome (regulated by cytochrome c and the Bcl-2 family) which activates caspase-9. Some of the final targets of caspases include: nuclear lamins, ICAD\/DFF45 (Inhibitor of Caspase Activated DNase or DNA Fragmentation Factor 45), PARP (Poly(ADP) Ribose Polymerase), and PAK2 (P21-Activated Kinase 2). The exact contribution that the cleavage of many caspase substrates makes to the biochemistry and morphology of apoptosis is unclear. However, the function of ICAD\/DFF45 is to restrain the enzyme CAD (Caspase Activated DNase). The cleavage and inactivation of ICAD\/DFF45 by a caspase allows CAD to enter the nucleus and fragment the DNA, causing the characteristic 'DNA ladder' seen in apoptotic cells."}

The protein of interest could for example be a transcription factor, or a specific modified histone, or any other DNA binding protein. This procedure requires an antibody to that protein of interest. The chromosomal material is isolated with all the proteins still bound to the genomic DNA. After fragmenting the DNA, the antibody is used to immunoprecipitate all chunks that contain the protein of interest. Isolate the DNA from those chunks, and it is possible to characterize the specific DNA sites to which the protein was bound. There are two common ways to characterize the DNA so isolated: ChIP-chip (or \"ChIP-on-chip\") or ChIP-seq. ChIP-chip: In this variant, the DNA isolated from a ChIP experiment is characterized by labeling it with a fluorescent dye, then hybrizidizing it to a DNA array (an oligonucleotide array, for example). Array spots that \"light up\" are taken as evidence that their specific sequence is present in your ChIP product. Unfortunately, designing these arrays requires that you have some idea what to expect in your ChIP isolates. ChIP-seq: A newer variant for characterizing ChIP results, one can simply sequence everything that immunoprecipitated with the antibody. It requires no fore-knowlege of the expected products, as would ChIP-chip."}

Prokaryotes have usually one large circular chromosome carrying the entire genome, and one or more small circular extra-chromosomal DNA (plasmids). Eukaryotic genomes consist of a number of chromosomes (several to several dozen) whose DNA is associated with different kinds of proteins. In humans (or eukaryotes), the DNA is supercoiled, compacted, and complexed with accessory proteins, and organized into a number of such structures. Normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes (except the germ cells, egg and sperm) comprising two sets of 23 chromosomes: 22 homologous pairs of autosomes and the sex-determining X and Y chromosomes (XX for females and XY for males).

It allows analysis of large regions of DNA, in which a each end of a large single cloned DNA fragment is used separately to screen recombinant DNA genome library for other clones containing neighbouring sequences. You screen a genomic library for all clones hybridizing with the probe, and then figure out which one extends furthest into the surrounding DNA. The most distal piece of this most distal clone is then used as a probe, so that ever more distal regions can be cloned. This has been used to move as much as 200 kb away from a given starting point (an immense undertaking).

(3) As a verb, to make one or more genetic replicas of an individual or cell; Cloning is the process of producing a genetically identical offspring or copy.. In reference to DNA: Cloning can also refer to the technical process of duplicating genetic material in the laboratory, for instance through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To clone a gene, one finds the region where the gene resides on the DNA and copy that section of the DNA using laboratory techniques. The it would be inserted into some type of vector (say, a plasmid) and the resultant construct put into a host (usually a bacterium) so that the plasmid and insert replicate with the host. An individual bacterium is isolated and grown and the plasmid containing the \"cloned\" DNA is re-isolated from the bacteria, at which point there will be many millions of copies of the DNA - essentially an unlimited supply. Actually, an investigator wishing to clone some gene or cDNA rarely has that DNA in a purified form, so practically speaking, to \"clone\" something involves screening a cDNA or genomic library for the desired clone. In reference to cells grown in a tissue culture dish: a clone is a line of cells that is genetically identical to the originating cell. This cloned line is produced by cell division (mitosis) of the original cell. In reference to organisms: Many natural clones are produced by plants and (mostly invertebrate) animals. Cloning is a natural process that underlies asexual reproduction that include the binary fission of prokaryotic cells (bacteria and archaea) and mitotic cell division of eukaryotic cells. Mitosis occurs continuously in the human body due to growth and tissue repair (wound healing) and maintenance (skin regeneration, hair growth). The term clone may also be used to refer to an animal produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) or parthenogenesis."}

{"Word":"Coagulation (of blood)","Definition":"The clotting of blood. A complex process by which blood forms solid clots. It is an important part of hemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel) whereby a damaged blood vessel wall is covered by a platelet- and fibrin-containing clot to stop bleeding and begin repair of the damaged vessel. Disorders of coagulation can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and\/or clotting and embolism.Coagulation is highly conserved throughout biology; in all mammals, coagulation involves both a cellular (platelet) and a protein (coagulation factor) component. The system in humans has been the most extensively researched and therefore the best understood.Coagulation is initiated almost instantly after an injury to the blood vessel damages the endothelium (lining of the vessel). Platelets immediately form a hemostatic plug at the site of injury; this is called primary hemostasis. Secondary hemostasis occurs simultaneously proteins in the blood plasma, called coagulation factors, respond in a complex cascade to form fibrin strands which strengthen the platelet plug.Platelet activationDamage to blood vessel walls exposes collagen normally present under the endothelium. Circulating platelets bind to the collagen with the surface collagen-specific glycoprotein Ia\/IIa receptor. This adhesion is strengthened further by the large multimeric circulating protein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which forms links between the platelet glycoprotein Ib\/IX\/V and collagen fibrils.The platelets are then activated and release the contents of their granules into the plasma, in turn activating other platelets. The platelets undergo a change in their shape which exposes a phospholipid surface for those coagulation factors that require it. Fibrinogen links adjacent platelets by forming links via the glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa. In addition, thrombin activates platelets.The coagulation cascade. The coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis has two pathways, the Contact Activation pathway (formerly known as the Intrinsic Pathway) and the Tissue Factor pathway (formerly known as the Extrinsic pathway) that lead to fibrin formation. It was previously thought that the coagulation cascade consisted of two pathways of equal importance joined to a common pathway. It is now known that the primary pathway for the initiation of blood coagulation is the Tissue Factor pathway. The pathways are a series of reactions, in which a zymogen (inactive enzyme precursor) of a serine protease and its glycoprotein co-factor are activated to become active components that then catalyze the next reaction in the cascade, ultimately resulting in cross-linked fibrin. Coagulation factors are generally indicated by Roman numerals, with a lowercase a appended to indicate an active form.The coagulation factors are generally serine proteases (enzymes). There are some exceptions. For example, FVIII and FV are glycoproteins and Factor XIII is a transglutaminase. Serine proteases act by cleaving other proteins at specific sites. The coagulation factors circulate as inactive zymogens.The coagulation cascade is classically divided into three pathways. The tissue factor and contact activation pathways both activate the \"final common pathway\" of factor X, thrombin and fibrin. Tissue factor pathway: The main role of the tissue factor pathway is to generate a \"thrombin burst,\" a process by which thrombin, the single most important constituent of the coagulation cascade in terms of its feedback activation roles, is released instantaneously. FVIIa circulates in a higher amount than any other activated coagulation factor. Following damage to the blood vessel, endothelium Tissue Factor (TF) is released, forming a complex with FVII and in so doing, activating it (TF-FVIIa). TF-FVIIa activates FIX and FX. FVII is itself activated by thrombin, FXIa, plasmin, FXII and FXa. The activation of FXa by TF-FVIIa is almost immediately inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). FXa and its co-factor FVa form the prothrombinase complex which activates prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then activates other components of the coagulation cascade, including FV and FVII (which activates FXI, which in turn activates FIX), and activates and releases FVIII from being bound to vWF. FVIIIa is the co-factor of FIXa and together they form the \"tenase\" complex which activates FX and so the cycle continues.Contact activation pathway: There is formation of the primary complex on collagen by high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), prekallikrein, and FXII (Hageman factor). Prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein and FXII becomes FXIIa. FXIIa converts FXI into FXIa. Factor XIa activates FIX, which with its co-factor FVIIIa form the tenase complex, which activates FX to FXa. The minor role that the contact activation pathway has in initiating clot formation can be illustrated by the fact that patients with severe deficiencies of FXII, HMWK, and prekallikrein do not have a bleeding disorder.Final common pathway: Thrombin has a large array of functions. Its primary role is the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the building block of a hemostatic plug. In addition, it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms covalent bonds that crosslink the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers.Following activation by the contact factor or tissue factor pathways the coagulation cascade is maintained in a prothrombotic state by the continued activation of FVIII and FIX to form the tenase complex, until it is down-regulated by the anticoagulant pathways.Cofactors: Various substances are required for the proper functioning of the coagulation cascade: Calcium and phospholipid (a constituent of platelet membranes) are required for the tenase and prothrombinase complexes to function. Calcium mediates the binding of the complexes via the terminal gamma-carboxy residues on FXa and FIXa to the phospholipid surfaces expressed by platelets as well as procoagulant microparticles or microvesicles shedded from them. Calcium is also required at other points in the coagulation cascade. Vitamin K is an essential factor to a hepatic gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that adds a carboxyl group to glutamic acid residues on factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as Protein S, Protein C and Protein Z. Deficiency of vitamin K (e.g. in malabsorption), use of inhibiting anticoagulants (warfarin, acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon) or disease (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma) impairs the function of the enzyme and leads to the formation of PIVKAs (proteins formed in vitamin K absence) this causes partial or non gamma carboxylation and affects the coagulation factors ability to bind to expressed phospholipid.Inhiibtors: Three mechanisms keep the coagulation cascade in check. Abnormalities can lead to an increased tendency toward thrombosis: Protein C is an important co-factor inhibitor, which degrades the co-factors FVa and FVIIIa. It is activated by thrombin with thrombomodulin and requires its co-enzyme Protein S to function. Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of either may lead to thrombophilia (a tendency to develop thrombosis). Impaired action of Protein C (activated Protein C resistance), for example by having the \"Leiden\" variant of Factor V or high levels of FVIII also may lead to a thrombotic tendency. Antithrombin is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that degrades the serine proteases; thrombin and FXa, as well as FXIIa, and FIXa. It is constantly active, but its adhesion to these factors is increased by the presence of heparan sulfate (a glycosaminoglycan) or the administration of heparins (different heparinoids increase affinity to F Xa, thrombin, or both). Quantitative or qualitative deficiency of antithrombin (inborn or acquired, e.g. in proteinuria) leads to thrombophilia. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits F VIIa-related activation of F IX and F X after its original initiation.Fibrinolysis: Eventually, all blood clots are reorganised and resorbed by a process termed fibrinolysis. The main enzyme responsible for this process (plasmin) is regulated by various activators and inhibitors."}

{"Word":"Code (in data entry)","Definition":"In most numeric data files, answers to questions are recorded with numbers rather than text and often even numeric answers are recorded with numbers other than the actual response. The numbers used in the data file are called \"codes.\" Thus, for instance, when a respondent identifies herself as a member of a particular religion, a \"code\" of 1 might be used for Catholic, a 2 for Jewish, etc. Likewise, a person's age of 18 might be coded as a 2 indicating \"18 or over.\" The codes that are used and their correspondence to the actual responses are listed in a codebook . The genetic code is the information needed to translate a nucleic acid (gene) sequence into an amino acid (protein) sequence. The code consists of triplet structures called codons such as UUG meaning two uracil and one guanine base along the messenger RNA template. This codon is recognized through base pairing by an anti-codon (triplet) on a transfer RNA. The transfer RNA is a specialized small ribonucleic acid that identifies genetic sequences on messenger RNAs (with the help of ribosomes) and carries one specific amino acid. An amino acid always matches one particular anti-codon. There are twenty amino acids to choose from for protein synthesis, and a total of 64 triplet codons (four bases in triplet sequence = 4x4x4 combinations). Thus there are 64 codons to match 20 amino acids, which means that some amino acids are coded by more than one codon. Which codons are responsible for which amino acid is evolutionarily conserved and most organisms have the same code or translation table. There are some alternate assignments found in mitochondrial genomes, viral genomes and some bacterial genomes. Yet, the fact that most organisms, bacteria, archaea and eukarya use the same genetic code explains the ability for recombinant DNA technology, i.e., to cut and past genetic elements from one organism into an other organism, since the assign amino acids to the same codons. Thus a human gene can be expressed in bacteria or yeast or jelly fish, and jelly fish genes can be expressed in bacteria, plants, fungi, animals and protists. There are almost limitless combinations possible. Read more about genetic codes at the National Center for Biotechnology Information and see the standard genetic code for humans and most organisms."}

The coefficient of determination is the ratio of the explained variation to the total variation. The coefficient of determination is such that 0 < r 2 < 1, and denotes the strength of the linear association between x and y. The coefficient of determination represents the percent of the data that is closest to the line of best fit. For example, if r = 0.922, then r 2 = 0.850, which means that 85% of the total variation in y can be explained by the linear relationship between x and y (as described by the regression equation). The other 15% of the total variation in y remains unexplained. The coefficient of determination is a measure of how well the regression line represents the data.

Data compression is the term to describe a variety of techniques to compress the volume of data, e.g., to represent large images with as few bits as possible, but to do so with minimum loss of information, according to some fidelity criterion The widespread, consumer-market use of information in the form of images has contributed much to the development of data compression techniques. All image compression techniques try to get rid of the inherent redundancy, which may be spatial (neighbouring pixels), spectral (pixels in different spectral bands in a colour image) or temporal (correlated images in a sequence, e.g. television). There are lossless methods, which are reversible, viz. do not sacrifice any information, and lossy methods which may be used if the quality of a compression-decompression sequence is judged by general criteria, like unchanged quality for the human visual system. Note that in image processing jargon, ``lossless'' is sometimes used in the sense of ``no visible loss''. Examples of lossless methods are run-length coding, Huffman coding , or the Lempel-Ziv-Welsh (LZW) method. In run-length coding one replaces runs , sequences of equal greyvalues, by their lengths and the greyvalues. Huffman and LZW coding are approximations to entropy encoding, i.e. frequently used sequences are replaced by short codes, rare sequences by longer codes. In Huffman coding, sequences are single greyvalues, for LZW they are strings of greyvalues. Of the many lossy coding techniques the simplest may be thresholding, applicable in some situations; the most important ones are predictive and transform coding. In predictive coding, one removes the correlation between neighbouring pixels locally, and quantizes only the difference between the value of a sample and a predicted value (Quantization). Transform coding decorrelates the whole signal, e.g. a block of 8x8 pixels in an image, as a unit, and then quantizes the transform coefficients, viz one sets insignificant coefficients to zero. Only complete sets of unitary transforms are considered, i.e. transforms with the property of equal energy in the spatial domain and in the transform domain. This compression works well if the energy is clustered in a few transform samples. One talks of zonal coding, if certain coefficients are systematically set to zero (e.g. frequencies in the Fourier domain), and of adaptive coding, if coefficients are set to zero according to some threshold criterion of significance ( e.g. rank reduction in principal component analysis) The following sets of unitary transforms are usually described in the literature:Karhunen-Loeve or principal component analysis,Discrete cosine transform,Fourier transform,Hadamard transform,Slant transform,Haar transform.They are listed above in order of decreasing energy compaction and computer time used. The popular JPEG algorithm for compression of colour images uses essentially the discrete cosine transform (DCT), followed by quantization and Huffman coding (JPEG, short for the original committee ``Joint Photographic Experts Group'', is a widely used compression standard for still images)."}
{"Word":"Data normalization","Definition":"A scaling process for numbers in a data array In normalization, typically data points in a set are divided by a reference value, to reduce any systematic error in data. Normalization is used where there is such great spread in the data as to render difficult any standard statistical analysis. The transformation of the data results in a new distribution of numbers that are more homogeneously spread within a defined range. The need for data normalization is determined by the user and depends on the application. Data are often normalized before any application processing and therefore data normalization is usually referred to as data pre-processing. The purpose of data normalization depends on the proposed data application and methodological approach. It includes the use of linear scaling to compress a large dynamic range, scaling the values to correct for large variations or for handling obscuring variations, removing systematic errors in data, or efficiently removing redundancy in non-linear models. Some data normalization methods include: Mean-corrected data (Covariance matrix): The mean value is subtracted from each data point to produce a new array of normalized data. Normalization by a maximum value: In this procedure, all un-normalized data are scaled so that they range between zero and one, with the maximum data point scaled to be one and the minimum to be zero and the other data points distributed between these end points. Normalization by standard deviation: Each data point is normalized by dividing the standard deviation of the data set. Logarithmic normalization: Each data point is divided by the mean value for that data set. Then the logarithm to base-two (log2) is calculated for that resultant value. The consequence of this logarithmic transformation is that there is a decrease in the variance of values as the transformation reduces the high values faster than the low ones. Unit total probability mass normalization (Total intensity normalization): Each data point is divided by the sum of all data points, and then multiplied by the mean for that data set. Standardizing data: Dividing the mean subtracted data (mean-corrected data; see above) by the standard deviation of the data set."}
{"Word":"Dataset","Definition":"The term dataset or \"data set\" is used in specific ways in different contexts.ICPSR defines a dataset as \"a collection of data records\" and uses this term to encompass a file or group of files associated with one part of a study.

{"Word":"Decibel","Definition":"A decibel (abbreviated dB) is a unit used to record the level of sound. A decibel is one-tenth of a bel and, since a bel is a logarithm to base 10, a decibel is a logarithm to base 100.1, i.e. a logarithm to base 1.259 (rounded to 3 decimal places).An increase in the intensity of sound of 1.259 times represents an addition of one decibel. A doubling of intensity represents an addition of 3 decibels [because 2 = (1.259)3]; a tripling of intensity represents an addition of about 5 decibels [because 3 = (1.259)5]. Ten times the intensity adds 10 decibels; one thousand times the intensity adds 30 decibels [because 1000 = (1.259)30]. The important thing to realise is that just a few extra decibels makes a substantial difference to the intensity of sound to which a person is exposed. Because decibels convert a multiplication to an addition, you can't add decibels in the usual way, e.g. 85dB + 85dB = 88dB (not 170dB).dB Sound Pressure Level (dB SPL): Measuring the level of a sound relative to a base level, set to be 20 Pascals (by convention worldwide):dB Sound Hearing Level (dB HL): Measuring the hearing sensitivity of a subject expressed relative to normal hearing sensitivity in a large normative database. Here thresholds from a large normal-hearing young population have been measured at each of a number of standard audiometric frequencies; at each frequency the mean value (in dB SPL) is then expressed as 0 dB HL. Then someone with a hearing level 20 dB worse than normal mean hearing sensitivity at (say 1 kHz) is said to have a hearing threshold of 20 dB HL at 1 kHz, etc."}

{"Word":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy","Definition":"A lethal muscle disease in humans caused by mutation in a huge gene coding for the muscle protein dystrophin; inherited as an X-linked recessive phenotype. The most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy. Dystrophic muscles are fragile, prone to injury, regenerate poorly after damage, and susceptible to Ca2+-overload and degeneration. Defective Ca2+ regulation has been implicated in these processes and it is widely accepted that dystrophic muscles have an elevated cytosolic [Ca2+] even at rest. DMD is an X-linked neuromuscular disease affecting ~1 in 3500 live born males from early childhood. It is caused by a variety of mutations and deletions in the dystrophin gene on chromosome Xp21. The disease is progressive and eventually affects all muscles such thatpatients become dependent on a wheelchair, usually before their teens, and have only 25% of the muscle mass of healthy children. The relentless muscle wasting leads to premature death from respiratory or cardiac failure. The primary abnormality is the absence of the dystrophin protein, which normally links the actin cytoskeleton to laminin in the extracellular matrix through the dystrophin associated protein complex (DAPC). The DAPC stabilises the membrane against shear stresses and plays a protective role against muscle damage caused by eccentric (lengthening) actions. In addition to its mechanical functions, dystrophin has been suggested to play a role in intracellular processes such as Ca2+ regulation and signal transduction. There is no cure and existing therapies are ineffective."}

They tell us the size of the experimental effect. Effect sizes are especially important because they allow us to compare the magnitude of experimental treatments from one experiment to another. Although percent improvements can be used to compare experimental treatments to control treatments, such calculations are often difficult to interpret and are almost always impossible to use in fair comparisons across experimental paradigms. Unlike significance tests, these indices are independent of sample size. ES measures are the common currency of meta-analysis studies that summarize the findings from a specific area of research. In general, ES can be measured in two ways: a) as the standardized difference between two means, or b) as the correlation between the independent variable classification and the individual scores on the dependent variable. This correlation is called the \"effect size correlation\""}

Eicosanoids include prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. The eicosanoids can collectively mediate almost every aspect of the inflammatory response. Two groups of eicosanoids, the prostaglandins (PGs) and the leukotrienes (LTs), have a wide range of varying effects that depend upon the nature of the target cell. Eicosanoid activity, for example, may impact blood pressure, blood clotting, immune and inflammatory responses, reproductive processes, and the contraction of smooth muscles."}

{"Word":"Electrical Impedance Scanning","Definition":"The electrical impedance scanning device, which does not emit any radiation, consists of a hand-held scanning probe and a computer screen that displays two-dimensional images of the breast. An electrode patch, similar to that used for an electrocardiogram, is placed on the patient's arm. A very small amount of electric current, about the same amount used by a small penlight battery, is transmitted through the patch and into the body. The current travels through the breast, where it is measured by the scanning probe placed over the breast. An image is generated from the measurements of electrical impedance. Different types of tissue have different electrical impedance levels (electrical impedance is a measurement of how fast electricity travels through a given material). Some types of tissue have high electrical impedance, while others have low electrical impedance. Breast tissue that is cancerous has a much lower electrical impedance (conducts electricity much better) than normal breast tissue. Breast tumors may appear as bright white spots on the computer screen.Electrical impedance scanning devices are used along with conventional mammography to detect breast cancer.This device can confirm the location of abnormal areas that were detected by a conventional mammogram. The scanner sends the image directly to a computer, allowing the radiologist to move the probe around the breast to get the best view of the area being examined. The device may reduce the number of biopsies needed to determine whether a mass is cancerous. It may also improve the identification of women who should have a biopsy. The scanner is not approved as a screening device for breast cancer, and is not used when mammography or other findings clearly indicate the need for a biopsy. This device has not been studied with patients who have implanted electronic devices, such as pacemakers. It is not recommended for use on such patients. (Source: NIH National Cancer Insitute)"}

The ECG (or EKG) represents a sum of all the concurrent action potentials produced by the heart as detected by the 12 (body surface) electrodes of the electrocardiograph. A single cardiac cycle produces a distinctive wave pattern, where peaks and valleys are indicated by the letters P, Q, R, S, and T. These are interpreted as: The P wave is a small wave that represents the depolarization of the atria. During this wave, the muscles of the atria are contracting. The QRS complex is a rapid down-up-down movement. The upward movement produces a tall peak, indicated by R. The QRS complex represents the depolarization of the ventricles.

These cells are oriented perpendicular to the cortical layers. In order to produce detectable waves in the EEG, many pyramidal neurons have to be activated in exact synchrony. The larger the waves the more synchronous are the activity of the pyramidal cells. By synchronising the EEG to certain sensory events, acts or decisions also allows the detection of patterns of electrical activity (electrical waves) which reflect the mass activity of neurones in specific brain areas. These are called evoked potentials, as they are electrical events evoked by a specific stimulus. By using large grids of electrodes, the spatial distribution of the evoked potential can be mapped."}

The neutrino is ejected from the atom's nucleus.Also called K-capture since the captured electron usually comes from the atom's K-shell. Electron capture is one process that unstable atoms can use to become more stable. Since an atom loses a proton during electron capture, it changes from one element to another. For example, after undergoing electron capture, an atom of carbon (with 6 protons) becomes an atom of boron (with 5 protons) Although the numbers of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus change during electron capture, the total number of particles (protons + neutrons) remains the same."}

The movement of electrically charged molecules in an electric field often resulting in their separation. Agarose and acrylamide gels are the media commonly used for electrophoresis of proteins and nucleic acids.Dissolved molecules in an electric field move at a speed determined by their charge:mass ratio. For example if two have the same mass and shape, the one with the greater net charge will move faster toward an electrode. The separation of small molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides, is one of the many uses of electrophoresis. A small drop of sample is deposited on a strip of filter paper or other porous substrate, which is soaked with a conducting solution. When an electric field is applied to the ends of the strip, small molecules dissolved in the conducting solution move along the strip at a rate corresponding to their magnitude of their charge."}

These signals are at least one order of magnitude, and sometimes two or more orders of magnitude, weaker than action potentials in neurons. The electrotonic spread of current is critical in understanding the generation of action potentials and current flow in neurons and other cells, and depends on four factors: 1. ro: the longitudinal electrical resistance of the extracellular medium; 2. ri: the longitudinal electrical resistance of the intracellular medium, i.e. the axoplasm; 3. rm: the transverse electrical resistance of the membrane, i.e. the neurolemma; 4. cm: the electrical capacity of the membrane. The flow of current electrotonically can be quantified by the equation: The space constant, l, is determined as: Thus if x = l, then the first equation becomes Vx = V0 e -1 i.e., l is the distance from the point at which current is injected into a cell to the point at which the electrotonic depolarisation has fallen to e -1, i.e. 0.37 (or 37%), of its original value (V0). l is a useful parameter for comparing electrotonus (the spread of electrotonic current) along neuronal processes of different types and size.

Though induction requires that the interacting parts come into close proximity, actual contact is not necessary. The inducing influence whatever it might be is a diffusible substance emitted by the activating cells (the inductor). The inducing substance of the mesoderm is a large molecule, probably a protein or a nucleoprotein, which presumably penetrates reacting cells, though direct and unequivocal proof of such penetration is still unavailable. Inducing substances are active on vertebrates belonging to many different classes; e.g., inductions of primary organs have been obtained by transplanting mammalian tissues into frog embryos or by transplanting tissues of a chick embryo into the embryo of a rabbit. Induction is responsible not only for the subdivision of ectoderm into neural plate and epidermis but also for the development of a large number of organ rudiments in vertebrates. The notochord is a source of induction for the development of the adjoining somites and nephrotomes; the latter appear jointly to induce development of limb rudiments from the lateral plate mesoderm. Further examples are mentioned below in connection with development of the various organs."}

In emphysema the walls of some alveoli have been damaged and the alveoli lose their elasticity and trap air. Since it is difficult to push all of the air out of the lungs, the lungs do not empty efficiently and therefore contain more air than normal. This air trapping causes lung hyperinflation. The combination of constantly having extra air in the lungs and the extra effort needed to breathe results in a person feeling short of breath. Airway obstruction occurs in emphysema because the alveoli that normally support the airways open cannot do so during inhalation or exhalation. (see Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)"}
{"Word":"Empirical Based Curve Fitting","Definition":"An empirical based standard curve is a method of data reduction which treats all data points as discrete elements and constrains the curve to pass through the mean of each standard response. Empirical methods make the assumption that each standard response mean is the true response of that standard. Each standard point has few degrees of freedom and a low level of statistical reliablility. Empirical methods cannot compensate for the decreased reproducibility at different regions of the standard curve. Empirical methods do not compensate at all for outlier error.

Important oil-in-water food emulsions, ones in which oil or fat is the dispersed phase and water is the continuous phase, include milk, cream, ice cream, salad dressings, cake batters, flavour emulsions, meat emulsions, and cream liquers. Examples of food water-in-oil emulsions are butter or margarine. Emulsions are inherently unstable because free energy is associated with the interface between the two phases. As the interfacial area increases, either through a decrease in particle size or the addition of more dispersed phase material, i.e. higher fat, more energy is needed to keep the emulsion from coalescing. Some molecules act as surface active agents (called surfactants or emulsifiers) and can reduce this energy needed to keep these phases apart."}

The internal system of chemical communication involving hormones, the ductless glands that secrete hormones, and the molecular receptors on or in target cells that respond to hormones; functions in concert with the nervous system to effect internal regulation and maintain homeostasis. Unlike exocrine glands, endocrine glands do not secrete substances into ducts but directly into the surrounding extracellular space. The hormones then diffuse into nearby capillaries and are transported throughout the body in the blood. Hormones circulating in the blood diffuse into the interstitial fluids surrounding the cell. Cells with specific receptors for a hormone respond with an action that is appropriate for the cell. Because of the specificity of hormone and target cell, the effects produced by a single hormone may vary among different kinds of target cells. (see Hormones, Hypothalamus, Pituitary gland)"}

For instance, if you prepare a test to measure whether students can perform multiplication and everyone you show it to agrees that it looks like a good test of multiplication ability, you have shown the face validity of your test. In face validity, you look at the operationalization (the translation of a concept or construct into a functioning and operating reality) and see whether \"on its face\" it seems like a good translation of the construct."}

{"Word":"Fascicular arrangement or Muscle Fiber Configurations","Definition":"The arrangements of the muscle fibers that make up a muscle give the muscle its characteristic appearance. The arrangement of fascicles determines range and power; example: parallel muscle - longer fascicles produce greater range of movement; example: multipennate muscle - more fascicles produce more power Muscles are described by the directions of the fibers compared to the long axis of the muscle, or the direction of the action it produces: Parallel - all muscle fibers are parallel to the long axis of the muscle. Because all the fibers go in the same direction and are parallel, when these muscles contract, they allow a greater movement of the insertion point. Convergent - In these muscles the origin is wider than the insertion. The direction of the fibers is toward the middle of the muscle, which narrows toward the insertion. When these muscles contract they concentrate a greater force on the insertion. Divergent - In these muscles the insertion is wider than the origin. The direction of the fibers is away from the center of the muscle. The contraction of these muscles allows for the greatest range of motion. Circular - In these muscles, the fibers go around in circles. They function to seal off bodily openings, and contract with a great deal of force. Pennate muscle - Fascicle forms an oblique angle to the tendon (like a feather). Unipennate muscle - short pennate fascicles run down one side of the tendon. Bipennate muscle - short pennate fascicles run down both sides of the tendon. Multipennate - muscle where the tendon branches within the muscle and short pennate fascicles are attached to each tendon branch."}

Used in acoustics to describe the frequency composition of a sound wave  e.g., in a complex sound, what are the simple sine wave components. Similar applications are made in other areas of science and engineering, to convert a complex wave into its simple sine wave components. Because of the transform from the time to the frequency domain, time information is lost  e.g., which frequencies in a complex signal occurred at what instants of time. Hence, often wavelet analyses are preferred as they retain time domain information"}

{"Word":"Fast twitch and slow twitch muscle fibres","Definition":"Muscle fibres differentiated on the basis of their energy metabolism and velocity of contraction Slow twitch fibres or type I fibres depend on oxidative (aerobic) metabolism, and have a slower velocity of contraction. Fast twitch fibres or Type II fibres, with a faster velocity of contraction, are differentiated into type IIA (which also depend on oxidative metabolism) and type IIB (which depend on glycolytic metabolism). The former is found in some mammals but is not abundant in humans. Oxidative (aerobic) metabolism, which produces large amounts of ATP, is dependent on the availability of oxygen while glycolytic metabolism, which uses the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP, is limited by the glycogen stores in the muscle fibre but is independent of the availability of oxygen. The velocity of contraction depends on the rate of hydrolysis of ATP by the myosin molecule and this depends on the myosin isoform present. Fast twitch fibres are employed for short, intense bursts of contraction while slow twitch fibres predominate in muscles that are continuously active. Most skeletal muscles are a mixture of fast and slow twitch fibres."}

{"Word":"F-box","Definition":"A protein motif of approximately 50 amino acids that functions as a site of protein-protein interaction. F-box proteins were first characterized as components of SCF ubiquitin-ligase complexes (named after their main components, Skp I, Cullin, and an F-box protein), in which they bind substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The F-box motif links the F-box protein to other components of the SCF complex by binding the core SCF component Skp I. F-box proteins have more recently been discovered to function in non-SCF protein complexes in a variety of cellular functions. There are 11 F-box proteins in budding yeast, 326 predicted in Caenorhabditis elegans, 22 in Drosophila, and at least 38 in humans. F-box proteins often include additional carboxy-terminal motifs capable of protein-protein interaction; the most common secondary motifs in yeast and human F-box proteins are WD repeats and leucine-rich repeats, both of which have been found to bind phosphorylated substrates to the SCF complex. The majority of F-box proteins have other associated motifs, and the functions of most of these proteins have not yet been defined."}

Cholesterol stones account for about 80 % of gallstones in N. America and Europe. Pigment stones have a high content of bilirubin and account for over 90 percent of gallstones in Asia. Gallstones can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. There can be just one large stone, hundreds of tiny stones, or any combination. Gallstones can block the normal flow of bile if they lodge in any of the ducts that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine. That includes the hepatic ducts, which carry bile out of the liver; the cystic duct, which takes bile to and from the gallbladder; and the common bile duct, which takes bile from the cystic and hepatic ducts to the small intestine. Bile trapped in these ducts can cause inflammation in the gallbladder, the ducts, or, rarely, the liver. Other ducts open into the common bile duct, including the pancreatic duct, which carries digestive enzymes out of the pancreas. If a gallstone blocks the opening to that duct, digestive enzymes can become trapped in the pancreas and cause an extremely painful inflammation called gallstone pancreatitis. If any of these ducts remain blocked for a significant period of time, severe damage or infections can occur, affecting the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas.Gallstone attacks often occur after eating a meal, especially a fatty one. Symptoms can include pain for up to several hours in the upper, back, or under the right shoulder together with nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating or indigestion. These symptoms can mimic those of other problems, including heart attack, so accurate diagnosis is important. Gallstones are more common among women, Native Americans, Mexican Americans, and people who are overweight. Laparoscopic surgery to remove the gallbladder is the most common treatment. The surgery is called cholecystectomy. Open surgery is done if there are obstacles to laparoscopy. The gallbladder is a dispensable organ. Without it, the bile flows directly into the small intestine, instead of being stored in the gallbladder."}

{"Word":"Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS)","Definition":"A method that combines the features of gas-liquid chromatography (see Chromatography) and mass spectrometry to identify different substances within a test sample. (see Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry). GC\/MS is used to identify organic materials such as resins, fats and waxes from their chemical composition. The technique requires a sample to be taken but this can be very small, often no larger than a pin-head. The sample is dissolved and injected into the instrument. The first part of the instrument, the gas chromatograph (GC) is an oven containing a very long, narrow glass tube with a polymer coating, called a column. The sample moves along the column in a stream of helium gas. The different chemical constituents of the sample interact with the polymer coating on the column, some more than others. Thus the different constituents take different lengths of time to reach the column's end. Each constituent emerges from the column and enters the detector where it is recorded as a peak, the size of which is relative to its abundance in the sample. The graph produced is called a chromatogram. Chromatogram: The chromatogram can be used as a 'fingerprint' for the material. However, ancient materials do not always have the same composition as modern ones because they are chemically altered by the effects of aging. In GC\/MS the detector is a mass spectrometer (MS). As well as detecting the constituents separated in the GC, the MS enables them to be identified. In the MS the chemical compounds are fragmented into ions. Each compound fragments in a different way. The range of fragmented ions and their relative abundance is recorded as a mass spectrum from which the compound can be identified. Spectrum: By using the mass spectra to identify peaks it is possible to identify mixtures of materials (eg. beeswax and pine resin) and to secure identifications for very degraded ancient materials.

Occurs after the blastocyst stage of embryonic development. The inner cell mass of the blastocyst goes through gastrulation, which is essentially a shifting or moving of the cell material of the embryo such that the inner cell mass becomes organized into the three distinct cell layers, called germ layers, the ectoderm, the mesoderm, and the endoderm. Gastrulation and the formation of the three germinal layers is the beginning of the subdivision of the mass of embryonic cells produced by cleavage. The cells then begin to change and diversify under the direction of the genes. The genes brought in by the sperm exert control for the first time; during cleavage all processes seem to be under control of the maternal genes. In cases of hybridization, in which individuals from different species produce offspring, the influence of the sperm is first apparent at gastrulation: paternal characteristics may appear at this stage; or the embryo may stop developing and die if the paternal genes are incompatible with the egg (as is the case in hybridization between species distantly related). The diversification of cells in the embryo progresses rapidly during and after gastrulation. The visible effect is that the germinal layers become further subdivided into aggregations of cells that assume the rudimentary form of various organs and organ systems of the embryo. Thus the period of gastrulation is followed by the period of organ formation, or organogenesis."}

{"Word":"Glaucoma","Definition":"A disorder in the eye characterized by high pressure inside the eyeball. Glaucoma is characterized by the slow, progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in the loss of axons that make up the optic disc (producing optic disc cupping) and a concomitant pattern of visual field loss. Although the mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration in glaucoma are complex, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) resulting in vascular insufficiency and HI (particularly at the optic nerve head) is considered a primary cause. Human risk factors for the development of glaucoma include chronic RGC hypoxia\/ischemia (HI) due to elevated IOP and homocysteinaemia, which can be caused by a number of lifestyle, genetic or disease conditions. These factors can increase reactive oxidative and nitrosative stress (RONS) in the retina, leading to inhibition of methionine synthase. Methionine synthase is essential for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and the regeneration of tetrahydrofolate (which is required for DNA synthesis). This key perturbation in one carbon metabolism could result in methylation stress caused by decreased concentrations of SAMe and increased levels of the potent methyltransferase inhibitor, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Deleterious downstream sequelae from methionine synthase inhibition include decreased creatine and glutathione synthesis in Mller cells, down-regulation of creatine transporter (CRT-1) activity and expression in RGCs, and escalation of RONS. Mitochondrial DNA damage caused by RONS would be exacerbated by a reduced capacity for DNA synthesis and repair, and may ultimately decrease the mitochondrial density in ganglion cells. A subsequent reduction in mitochondrial energy generation coupled with impaired energy buffering by creatine kinase in ganglion cells may be a primary cause of ganglion cell dysfunction and degeneration in glaucoma."}

{"Word":"G-proteins","Definition":"A heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein that relays signals from a plasma-membrane signal receptor, known as a G-protein linked\/coupled receptor, to other signal-transduction proteins inside the cell.When a G-protein linked\/coupled receptor is activated, it in turn activates the G protein, causing it to bind a molecule of GTP in place of GDP. This causes the G subunit to separate from the G\/ complex. 18 G subunits exist as 4 main families based on structural and functional homologies: Gi, Gs, Gq, G12. Each family signals through one of 3 main effectors, adenylyl cyclase (AC, Gi and Gs), phospholipase C (PLC, Gq) and rho kinase (G12). The precise actions of each of the G subunits (which have multiple members) may be tissue dependent and is further regulated by a range of other proteins including regulators of G-protein signalling' (RGS) or activators of G-protein signalling' (AGS). G\/ complexes mediate a wide range of effects; they lack specific inhibitors. Some G\/ effectors include PLC and AC are current targets. ERK1\/2 is commonly acvitated by G protein signalling causing its phosphorylation (G34). pERK1\/2 has many targets including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or phosopholipase A2. The name is short for guanine nucleotide binding protein. They are a class of membrane proteins which link the activation of a 7-helical receptor to the subsequent activation of its second messenger. They are heterotrimeric proteins, i.e. they have three different subunits (an alpha- subunit, and the beta- and gamma- subunits which are tightly bound to each other). More than 100 examples of at least 20 different types of G-protein have so far been cloned, of which many can be grouped into categories depending on which second messenger they predominantly control. Thus, Gs frequently activates adenylyl cyclase, whereas Gi inhibits it; Gq mediates the stimulation of phospholipase C and hence phosphoinositide turnover. However, these distinctions are not absolute: many G proteins do not necessarily couple to the same second messenger in different cells, and they may even couple to more than one in a single cell. Gs protein is irreversibly activated by cholera toxin. Subtypes of Gi protein have been identified, some of which are irreversibly inactivated by pertussis toxin. In both instances by ADP-ribosylation of the alpha-subunit."}
{"Word":"G-protein coupled receptors","Definition":"A signal receptor protein in the plasma membrane that responds to the binding of a signal molecule by activating a G protein.

As decribed above, hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP inactivates the G protein."}

High-throughput screening is a first-pass test affording a quick initial look at the efficacy of a compound.For example, when screening chemical compounds for potential use as a pharmaceutical, the goal often is to assess differences between diseased and (treated) cells; enabling identification of a pharmaceutical candidate that favorably impacts change in protein level (i.e., gene expression) which characterizes a diseased state, or some other gene expression marker (e.g., apoptosis).When screening compounds for potential use as herbicide active ingredients, the goal is to assess differences between normal and (treated) weed plant cells; enabling identification of a potential herbicide candidate that imparts desired (fatal) change.Although whole living cells or whole microscopic animals such as nematodes could be utilized in HTS, it is more common to use a proxy (e.g., receptors, enzymes, or STATs from applicable cells) whose interaction with candidate compounds can be inferred to cell (and\/or organism) effects."}
{"Word":"Hill analysis","Definition":"A method for analysing saturation or competition curves to determine whether the interaction between the ligand and the receptor is competitive. As with the Scatchard plot, the Hill plot has now largely been superseded by computer- fitting of the curves to a one- or multi-site model. The slope of the Hill plot (sometimes called the Hill coefficient or nH) should equal 1 if the ligand binds competitively and reversibly. Slopes significantly greater than 1 may indicate positive cooperativity in the binding; slopes less than 1 may indicate heterogeneity of binding sites or negative cooperativity. However, there are also many artefactual reasons why the slope can differ from the theoretical value. Fig. F: Hill plot from the saturation curve for a radioligand. The y axis represents the log of the proportion of receptors occupied by radioligand divided by the proportion not occupied (b = the amount of ligand bound, assuming that the NSB has been subtracted; Bmax = the maximal amount of specifically bound ligand).

Histones are responsible for the structure of chromatin, acting as spools around which the DNA winds (like the way cotton winds around a wooden spool), compacting the DNA so that it will fit inside the nucleus. They play important roles in gene regulation and, to some degree, the expression of proteins from the DNA, e.g., Acetylation, i. e., addition of acetyl molecular group) of histones results in some genes within the DNA looped around that histone to become (more) accessible to the cell's transcriptional \"machinery\"; thereby turning-on those genes. Methylation (i.e., addition of methyl molecular group) of a protruding amino acid (e.g., lysine) in a histone; thereby \"turning-on\"\/up-regulating those genes. Sumoylation (i.e., addition of SUMO protein group) of histones results in repression\/\"turning off\" those genes. Histone modification by acetylation and methylation has been shown to affect large scale changes in chromosome packing affecting the ability of cells to 'read' genes. The more packed, the less access the cell has to genes. This large scale modification is part of epigenetic control of gene expression, i.e., the making of proteins from DNA code."}

Caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat and inherited as a dominant trait. It results in degeneration of neurons in the basal ganglia.This degeneration causes uncontrolled movements, loss of intellectual faculties, and emotional disturbance. HD is a familial disease, passed from parent to child through a mutation in the normal gene. Each child of an HD parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the HD gene. If a child does not inherit the HD gene, he or she will not develop the disease and cannot pass it to subsequent generations. A person who inherits the HD gene will sooner or later develop the disease. Whether one child inherits the gene has no bearing on whether others will or will not inherit the gene. Some early symptoms of HD are mood swings, depression, irritability or trouble driving, learning new things, remembering a fact, or making a decision. As the disease progresses, concentration on intellectual tasks becomes increasingly difficult and the patient may have difficulty feeding himself or herself and swallowing. The rate of disease progression and the age of onset vary from person to person. A genetic test, coupled with a complete medical history and neurological and laboratory tests, helps diagnose HD. Pre-symptomic testing is available for individuals who are at risk for carrying the HD gene. In 1 to 3 % of individuals with HD, no family history of HD can be found."}

{"Word":"Hyperalgesia","Definition":"Hyperalgesia (from hyper greater + algesia pain-feeling) is characterised by a lowered pain threshold, increased pain from suprathreshold stimuli and occasionally spontaneous pain. Like all other sensory systems, pain receptors (nociceptors) adapt (reduce activity) to prolonged or repeated application of an adequate stimulus. In contrast to other sensory systems, the pain system is also capable of enhancing its responsiveness as a consequence of adequate stimulation. This sensitisation is characterised by lowered response threshold, induction of spontaneous activity and enhanced responses in the suprathreshold range. These changes cause the phenomenon of hyperalgesia and can even result in allodynia where even gentle, low threshold stimuli can elicit pain. Hyperalgesia follows several types of tissue injury and is a prominent feature of diseases of the nervous system and inflammation generally. There are two types according to the location relative to the injury site. (a) primary hyperalgesia refers to the site of injury and is characterised by enhanced responsiveness to mechanical and heat stimuli, and (b) secondary hyperalgesia refers to changes in surrounding undamaged skin and is characterised by enhanced responsiveness to mechanical stimuli only. The mechanisms for the two phenomena are different. Primary hyperalgesia appears to be due to local sensitization of the C-class of sensory neurons that signal polymodal nociceptive input. These fibres become sensitized by inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, formed naturally from plasma proteins following tissue damage, to heat and some other chemicals such as histamine. Secondary hyperalgesia appears most probably to be due to sensitization of the central processes (i.e, the endings in the central nervous system) of the A and C classes of sensory neurons that normally signal pain as well the A class of neurons that receive input from low-threshold mechanoreceptors that normally signal non-painful touch sensation (LTMs)."}

{"Word":"Hypothalamus","Definition":"The ventral part of the vertebrate forebrain; functions in maintaining homeostasis, especially in coordinating the endocrine and nervous systems; secretes hormones of the posterior pituitary and releasing factors, which regulate the anterior pituitary. An area at the base of the brain, just below the thalamus, that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions that control many internal body functions. The aim of this control is to maintain homeostasis, or maintaining the body's status quo. Factors such as blood pressure, body temperature, hunger, glucose concentration in the blood, osmolarity of the blood, reproductive function and other functions are controlled through means that include, as a critical component, the release of hormones. When deviations from homeostasis occur or when certain developmental changes are required, the hypothalamus stimulates cellular activity in various parts of the body by directing the release of hormones from the anterior and posterior pituitary glands. The hypothalamus communicates directives to these glands by one of the following two pathways: 1. Communication between the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary occurs through releasing and inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus and delivered to the anterior pituitary through blood vessels. The releasing and inhibiting hormones are produced by specialized neurons of the hypothalamus called neurosecretory cells. The hormones are released into a capillary network (primary plexus) and transported through veins (hypophyseal portal veins) to a second capillary network (secondary plexus) that supplies the anterior pituitary. The hormones then diffuse from the secondary plexus into the anterior pituitary, where they initiate the production of specific hormones by the anterior pituitary. Many of the hormones produced by the anterior pituitary are tropic hormones (tropins), hormones that stimulate other endocrine glands to secrete their hormones. 2. Communication between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary occurs through neurosecretory cells that span the short distance between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary. Hormones produced by the cell bodies of the neurosecretory cells are packaged in vesicles and transported through the axon and stored in the axon terminals that lie in the posterior pituitary. When the neurosecretory cells are stimulated, the action potential generated triggers the release of the stored hormones from the axon terminals to a capillary network within the posterior pituitary. Two hormones, oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), are produced and released in this way. (see Endocrine system, Pituitary gland)"}

{"Word":"Interferons","Definition":"A chemical messenger of the immune system, produced by virus-infected cells and capable of helping other cells resist the virus. A family of small (cytokines) proteins (produced by vertebrate cells following a virus infection) that interfere with (i.e., block) translation of viral DNA.Via that blocking, interferons prevent synthesis of proteins needed for viral reproduction, so interferons possess potent antiviral effects. Secreted interferons bind to the plasma membrane of other cells in the organism and induce an antiviral state in them (conferring resistance to a broad spectrum of viruses). Three classes of interferons have been isolated and purified, so far: a-interferon (originally called leukocyte interferon), -interferon (beta interferon or fibroblast interferon), and -interferon (gamma interferon or immune interferon, a lymphokine). These proteins have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), which has enabled large quantities to be produced for evaluation of the interferons as possible antiviral and anticancer agents. To date, interferons have been used to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, hairy cell leukemia, venereal warts, multiple sclerosis, and hepatitis. Alpha Interferon: Also written as a- interferon. One of the interferons, it has been shown to prolong life and reduce tumor size in patients suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancer that affects approximately 10 percent of people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome). It is also effective against hairy-cell leukemia and may work against other cancers. It has been approved by the U.S. FDA for use against certain types of sarcoma. Recent research indicates that injections of alpha interferon can limit the liver damage typically caused by hepatitis C, a viral disease. Beta Interferon: A protein that binds to a receptor located on the surface of T cells, slowing down the body's immune response (e.g., normally after the immune response has defeated an infection). Manmade beta interferon was approved by the US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) for use to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that is caused by an immune response that fails to ever shut down. Gamma Interferon: Produced by T lymphocytes."}

There are 3 classes of Direct or Primary active transport mechanisms: Ion pumps (also known ATPase Ion pumps)  transport of ions. There are 3 classes called P-, V-, and F- ATPase ion pumps. P class ion pumps have the simplest structure: 4 transmembrane subunits, two a and two b polypeptides. The larger a subunit is phosphorylated during transport, and the transported ions move through this subunit. Examples: Na+\/K+-ATPase pump in the cell membrane; Ca++-ATPase in membrane of muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. V and F classes of ion pumps are similar in structure to each other but unrelated to P-class pumps. They transport only protons. F-class pumps contain at least three kinds of transmembrane proteins & V-class pumps contain at least two kinds of proteins. Both contain at least five kinds of extrinsic polypeptides that form the cytosolic domain. V-class maintain the low pH of plant vacuoles and of lysosomes and other vesicles in animal cells by using the energy release by ATP hydrolysis to pump protons from cytosolic to exoplasm up the proton electrochemical gradient. F-class proton pumps are found in bacterial plasma membranes and in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In contrast to the V Pumps, they generally function to power synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi by movement of protons from exoplasm to the cytoplasm down the proton electrochemical gradient.All three classes have one or more binding sites for ATP on the cytosolic face of the membrane. All use the same basic mechanism: namely, a conformational change in proteins as they are reversibly phosphorylated by ATP. All are reversible, i.e. can be made to run backward. If pumped ions are allowed to diffuse back through the membrane complex, ATP can be synthesized from ADP and inorganic phosphate."}

{"Word":"Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)","Definition":"Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a major functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder affecting up to 10% of the population1. Symptoms of IBS include recurrent abdominal pain and discomfort due to heightened perception of mechanical events in the lower bowel. Remodelling of sensory pathways supplying the bowel is a key contributor to IBS symptom development and maintenance. An important question is where does this remodelling occur? Increased sensitivity of colonic afferent peripheral endings to mechanical stimuli is well documented in models of IBS. However, it is unknown how this increase in peripheral activity effects transmission into the CNS, specifically on colonic afferent central terminal activation of spinal cord neurons. Clinical studies suggest that an increase in sensory input contributes to the maintenance of sensitization in the spinal nociceptive pathways in IBS patients. Such sensitization leads to amplification of responses to both noxious (hyperalgesia) and innocuous (allodynia) mechanical stimuli.The receptors mediating synaptic release and activation of DH neurons by SP, CGRP and glutamate are neurokinin receptors (NKrs), CGRP receptors (CGRPr), ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) respectively. NKrs: NKrs (1, 2 and 3) are G-protein coupled receptors and regulate tachykininergic slow excitatory synaptic currents. There is a large body of work describing the role of NK1rs on nociresponsive DH neurons in mediating nociceptive signaling from the colon in normal and inflamed states. NKrs are not expressed by colonic afferent neurons, thus SP release is regulated by other ligands."}

At equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation, i.e. k1[D][R] = k-1[DR]or, rearranging, k-1 [D][R] ____ = KD = ______ k1 [DR]KD, the dissociation constant, may thus be defined either as the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants, or as the concentration of drug which, at equilibrium, occupies 50% of the receptors (i.e. [DR] = [R], so KD = [D])."}
{"Word":"Kinesin - 1","Definition":"A mechanochemical protein capable of utilizing chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical force. In the presence of ATP, Kinesin-1 can bind to and move on microtubules Previously referred to as conventional kinesin, kinesin heavy chain or KHC. The ability to translocate along the microtubule lattice has led to the classification of Kinesin-1 as a microtubule motor protein. Kinesin-1 is unrelated in sequence to the other known class of microtubule motor proteins, the dyneins, and is thought to perform functions in the cell distinct from the dyneins."}
{"Word":"Kinesin related proteins (KRPs)","Definition":"The KRPs are related to kinesin by sequence similarity to the motor domain, a region of ~340 residues that consists of an ATP-binding site and an adjacent microtubule-binding site. Proteins related to kinesin were first reported in early 1990, soon after the entry into the databases of the first kinesin protein to be cloned, kinesin heavy chain of Drosophila. The KRPs are related to kinesin by sequence similarity to the motor domain, a region of ~340 residues that consists of an ATP-binding site and an adjacent microtubule-binding site. The proteins typically show >35% sequence identity to the kinesin heavy chain motor domain but differ in amino acid sequence outside the motor domain. The sequence difference outside the motor domain is attributed to differences in function of the KRPs compared to kinesin. Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are well known to be involved in intracellular transport and cytokinesis. Several of the KRPs have been demonstrated to be microtubule motor proteins that bind to and move on microtubules in in vitro motility assays. The motility characteristics of many of the proteins differ significantly from kinesin: the proteins differ from kinesin in velocity, and some of them have been found to move on microtubules with the opposite polarity as kinesin, toward microtubule minus instead of plus ends. Reversed polarity has been reported for members of the C-terminal motor subfamily. The cellular functions of the KRPs differ from those of kinesin, based on mutant analysis and localization. Several of the kinesin subfamilies, including KHC, Unc-104 and KRP85\/95, have roles in vesicle\/organelle transport. Evidence for transport of different types of vesicles\/organelles by different classes of kinesin proteins is beginning to emerge. Strikingly, a large number of the KRPs are involved in spindle function and chromosome motility in mitosis and meiosis. These proteins could account for many of the movements of the spindle and chromosomes during cell division. A new member of this family, KIF26A, has a novel function in that it controls proliferation of enteric neural precursor cells by directly modulating GDNF-Ret signaling. Instead of playing a role in transport, this atypical kinesin regulates a cell growth signaling pathway."}

Refers to one of the following:The engineered alteration of a particular gene within an organism, so that organism loses a (specific) function (e.g., the ability to produce a given needed clotting factor in its blood, the ability to produce a given allergen in its seeds, etc.).The altered organism itself (i.e., in which the particular gene has been inactivated as detailed above).The engineered alteration of a particular protein (e.g., within an organism's cell) so that protein loses its biological activity. That can enable detailed study of which proteins within a cell are responsible for particular diseases, etc.This laborious method involves transfecting a crippled gene into cultured embryonic stem cells, searching through the thousands of resulting clones for one in which the crippled gene exactly replaced the normal one (by homologous recombination), and inserting that cell back into a mouse blastocyst. The resulting mouse will be chimaeric but, if lucky, its germ cells will carry the deleted gene. A few rounds of careful breeding can then produce progeny in which both copies of the gene are inactivated. 'Gene knockout' can be accomplished via any one of several different methods \/ technologies; such as gene silencing, cosuppression, site-directed mutagenesis (SDM), short interfering RNA (siRNA), etc. 'Protein knockout' can be accomplished via any one of several different methods\/technologies; such as laser inactivation, etc."}

At regular distances along the colon, the smooth muscle of the muscularis layer causes the intestinal wall to gather, producing a series of pouches called haustra. The epithelium facing the lumen of the colon is covered with openings of tubular intestinal glands that penetrate deep into the thick mucosa. The glands consist of absorptive cells that absorb water and goblet cells that secrete mucus. The mucus lubricates the walls of the large intestine to smooth the passage of feces.The rectum is the last 20 cm (8 in) of the large intestine. The mucosa in the rectum forms longitudinal folds called anal columns.The anal canal, the last 3 cm (1 in) of the rectum, opens to the exterior at the anus. An involuntary (smooth) muscle, the interior anal sphincter, and a voluntary (skeletal) muscle, the external anal sphincter, control the release of the feces through the anus.The functions of the large intestine includeMechanical digestion. Rhythmic contractions of the large intestine produce a form of segmentation called haustral contractions in which food residues are mixed and forced to move from one haustrum to the next. Peristaltic contractions produce mass movements of larger amounts of material.Chemical digestion. Digestion occurs as a result of bacteria that colonize the large intestine. They break down indigestible material by fermentation, releasing various gases. Vitamin K and certain B vitamins are also produced by bacterial activity.Absorption. Vitamins B and K, some electrolytes (Na+ and Cl), and most of the remaining water is absorbed by the large intestine.Defecation. Mass movement of feces into the rectum stimulates a defecation reflex that opens the internal anal sphincter. Unless the external and sphincter is voluntarily closed, feces are evacuated through the anus.(see Small Intestine)"}

{"Word":"Library","Definition":"A library might be either a genomic library, or a cDNA library. In either case, the library is just a tube carrying an unordered mixture of thousands of different clones - bacteria or l phages. Each clone carries an \"insert\" - the cloned DNA from a particular organism. The relationship of the clones to each other can be established by physical mapping. A cDNA library is usually just a mixture of bacteria, where each bacteria carries a different plasmid. Inserted into the plasmids (one per plasmid) are thousands of different pieces of cDNA (each typ. 500-5000 bp) copied from some source of mRNA, for example, total liver mRNA. The basic idea is that if you have a large enough number of different liver-derived cDNAs carried in those bacteria, there is a 99% probability that a cDNA copy of any given liver mRNA exists somewhere in the tube. The real trick is to find the one you want out of that mess - a process called screening (see \"Screening\"). A genomic library is similar in concept to a cDNA library, but differs in three major ways - 1) the library carries pieces of genomic DNA (and so contains introns and flanking regions, as well as coding and untranslated); 2) you need bacteriophage or cosmids, rather than plasmids, because... 3) the inserts are usually 5-15 kb long (in a l library) or 20-40 kb (in a cosmid library). Therefore, a genomic library is most commonly a tube containing a mixture of  phages. Enough different phages must be present in the library so that any given piece of DNA from the source genome has a 99% probability of being present."}

It also gives a quick, visual impression of the different forms of enzyme inhibition.The double reciprocal plot distorts the error structure of the data, and it is therefore unreliable for the determination of enzyme kinetic parameters. Although it is still used for representation of kinetic data, non-linear regression or alternative linear forms of the Michaelis-Menten equation such as the Eadie-Hofstee plot are generally used for the calculation of parameters.When used for determining the type of enzyme inhibition, the Lineweaver-Burk plot can distinguish competitive, noncompetitive and uncompetitive inhibitors. Competitive inhibitors have the same y-intercept as uninhibited enzyme (since Vmax is unaffected by competitive inhibitors the inverse of Vmax also doesn't change) but there are different slopes and x-intercepts between the two data sets. Noncompetitive inhibition produces plots with the same x-intercept as uninhibited enzyme (Km is unaffected) but different slopes and y-intercepts. Uncompetitive inhibition causes different intercepts on both the y and x axes but the same slope."}

{"Word":"Lung cancer","Definition":"Malignancy of the lung tissue. Lung cancers arise in the epithelium lining the bronchi (the branching complex of air passages), by which air passes to the lungs, or in the fine air sacs at the periphery. The most common forms arise in bronchial glandular epithelium that has been altered by long exposure to cigarette smoke to form less specialized squamous cells, which eventually evolve into squamous-cell carcinomas. Structurally, unaltered glandular epithelia of bronchi may also undergo malignant transformation to give rise to adenocarcinomas, but these tumours do not appear to be related to cigarette smoking. There are two basic kinds of lung cancer: small-cell carcinoma and non-small-cell carcinoma. The latter consists primarily of three types of tumour: squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma. Small-cell carcinoma, also called oat-cell carcinoma, accounts for about 20 to 25 percent of all lung cancers. It is characterized by cells that are small and round, oval, or shaped like oat grains. Small-cell carcinoma is the most aggressive type of lung cancer; it tends to spread quickly, before symptoms are apparent. Some 25 to 30 percent of primary lung cancers are squamous-cell carcinomas, also called epidermoid carcinomas. This tumour is characterized by flat, scalelike cells, and it often develops in the larger bronchi of the central part of the lung. Squamous-cell carcinoma tends to remain localized in the lung longer than other types of cancer and thus is generally more responsive to treatment. Worldwide, adenocarcinoma accounts for some 25 to 30 percent of lung cancers; it is the most common type of lung cancer in the United States. Cells of adenocarcinoma are cube- or column-shaped, and they form structures that resemble glands and are sometimes hollow. Tumours often originate in the smaller, peripheral bronchi; symptoms at the time of diagnosis often reflect invasion of the lymph nodes, pleura, or the other lung or metastasis to other organs. About 20 % of all lung cancers are large-cell carcinomas. There is some dispute as to whether it is a distinct type of cancer or merely a group of atypical squamous-cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Large-cell carcinomas generally originate in the peripheral areas of the lung."}

{"Word":"Macrophage","Definition":"A type of white blood cell that ingests dead tissue and cells and is involved in producing Interleukin 1; A phagocytic cell that is the counterpart of the monocyte. A monocyte which has left the bloodstream and has moved into the tissues. Macrophages have basically the same functions as monocytes, but they carry these out in the tissues. In summary, they engulf and kill microorganisms, present antigen to the lymphocytes, kill certain tumor cells, and their secretions (e.g., leukotrienes) regulate inflammation. Macrophages utilize nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide (which they synthesize) to kill the microorganisms they engulf (via oxidation), and the nitric oxide also helps to regulate the immune system.In the spleen, macrophages engulf and destroy old red blood cells. When they reside in the bone marrow they store iron and then transfer it to red blood cells. In the lungs and GI tract they are scavengers and keep tissues clean. They also serve as a reservoir for the AIDS virus. They (and other phagocytic cells) are largely responsible for the localization and degradation of foreign materials at inflammatory sites.Macrophages display chemotaxis (i.e., the sensing of, and movement toward or away from a specific chemical). For example, consumption (in food\/feed) of mannanoligosaccharides by mammals causes macrophages (within that mammal's bloodstream) to depart from the bloodstream and move toward the gastrointestinal tract (tissues) where those macrophages eliminate some pathogens (i.e., those growing\/reproducing in the gastrointestinal tract)."}

A set of molecules displayed on cell surfaces that are responsible for lymphocyte recognition and \"antigen presentation\". The Class I and Class II MHC molecules belong to a group of molecules known as the Immunoglobulin Supergene Family, which includes immunoglobulins, T-cell receptors, CD4, CD8, and others.The MHC is encoded by several genes located on human chromosome 6.The MHC molecules control the immune response through recognition of \"self\" and \"non-self\" and, consequently, serve as targets in transplantation rejection. It is important in regulating the activity of all immune responses involving T-lymphocytes, as the T-lymphocyte receptor requires the presentation of foreign antigen with a class of MHC molecule. Foreign MHC markers trigger T-cell responses that may lead to the rejection of transplanted tissues and organs.All cells express MHC class I but only a few specialised cells express MHC class II. These latter cells are termed antigen presenting cells and are important in controlling the extent to which an immunological reaction can be mounted. In the CNS, MHC class II expression is low and probably restricted to microglial cells.MHC I proteins (located on the surface of nearly all cells) present foreign epitopes (i.e., fragments of antigens that have been ingested; peptides) to cytotoxic T cells (killer T cells). MHC II proteins (located on the surface of immune system lymphocyte\/dendritic cells and phagocytes) present foreign epitopes to helper T cells. That presenting of epitopes induces the organism's immune response. MHC III proteins are components of the complement cascade. Genes in the MHC must be matched (between an organ donor and organ recipient) to prevent rejection of organ transplants."}

{"Word":"Michaelis-Menten equation\/kinetics","Definition":"Describes the kinetics of many enzymes, provided the concentration of enzyme is much less than the concentration of substrate (i.e., enzyme concentration is the limiting factor), and when the enzyme is not allosteric. The equation is:where P = product S = substrate Vmax = maximum velocity of the enzyme Km = Michaelis-Menten constant EO = Free enzyme in solution (not bound to substrate, which is expressed as ES) [ ] = concentrationThe modern relationship between substrate and enzyme concentration was proposed in 1903 by Victor Henri. A microscopic interpretation was thereafter proposed in 1913 by Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten, following earlier work by A V Hill. It postulated that enzyme (catalyst) and substrate (reactant) are in fast equilibrium with their complex, which then dissociates to yield product and free enzyme. The current derivation, based on the quasi steady state approximation, that the concentration(s) of intermediate complex(es) do(es) not change, has been proposed by Briggs and Haldane.To determine the maximum rate of an enzyme mediated reaction, the substrate concentration ([S]) is increased until a constant rate of product formation is achieved. This is the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme. In this state, enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate. Note that at the maximum velocity, the other factors that affect the rate of reaction (i.e., pH, temperature, etc.) are at optimal values.The speed V means the number of reactions per second that are catalyzed by an enzyme. With increasing substrate concentration [S], the enzyme is asymptotically approaching its maximum speed Vmax, but never actually reaching it. Because of that, no [S] for Vmax can be given. Instead, the characteristic value for the enzyme is defined by the substrate concentration at its half-maximum speed (Vmax\/2). This KM value is also called the Michaelis-Menten constant.Since Vmax cannot be reached at any substrate concentration (because of its asymptotic behaviour, V keeps growing at any [S], albeit ever more slowly), enzymes are usually characterized by the substrate concentration at which the rate of reaction is half its maximum. This substrate concentration is called the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM) a.k.a. Michaelis constant.For enzymatic reactions which exhibit simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and in which product formation is the rate-limiting step (i.e., when k2 << k-1) KMk-1\/k1=Kd, where Kd is the dissociation constant (affinity for substrate) of the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex. However, often k2 >> k-1, or k2 and k-1 are comparable, in which case nothing can be said about the enzyme affinity from the Michaelis constant alone.The equation may be analyzed experimentally with a Lineweaver-Burk plot or a Hanes-Woolf plot."}

{"Word":"MicroRNA (miRNA)","Definition":"Small non-coding RNAs that modulate diverse biological functions by post-transcriptional repression or degradation of target mRNAs. They regulate mRNA transcribed by up to two-thirds of human genes. many miRNAs lie within introns of protein-coding genes and are commonly transcribed by RNA polymerase II. A single variety of miRNA can regulate up to 200 target mRNAs. MicroRNA function consists of the following steps. Initially, primary (pri) miRNA is generated in a folded hairpin stem loop structure. A 60-80 nucleotide (nt) stem loop is excised and processed to a 70 nt hairpin-like premiRNA in the nucleus by a protein complex called microprocessor containing the RNAseIII Drosha and DGCR8 protein. After export into the cytoplasm by exportin 5 and RanGTP, double stranded pre-miRNA is loaded into a protein complex containing Dicer (which removes the loop and produces a miRNA duplex) and TRBP. It is then cleaved into a mature miRNA guide strand and the passenger or miRNA* strand which is usually degraded. Mature miRNA is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex, RISC, with its Argonaute (Ago) core proteins. Once loaded with the mature miRNA, the RISC complex has two functions. In case of perfect complementarity of the mature miRNA the target mRNA (typically within the 3'UTR) is cleaved and subsequently degraded. If complementarity with target mRNA is imperfect, the mRNA is not degraded but arrests at the initiation step of translation and therefore is not translated into protein (translational repression). The important region for complementarity is the seed region at the 5' end of mature miRNA. RISC complexes and target mRNAs accumulate in cytoplasmic foci called processing bodies or P-bodies. MiRNAs have been investigated in CNS function and neural development. They are critically involved in proper expression of a differentiated neuronal phenotype, but are largely dispensable for early neural fate decision. For example, MiR-134 promotes dendritic arborization in hippocampal neurons. Conversely, inhibition of miR-124 by the transcription factor, RE1, halts neuronal differentiation. MiRNAs have been linked to disorders like Rett syndrome, where the mutated MeCP2 gene is controlled by miR-132, and Parkinson's Disease since they maintain dopaminergic neuron integrity. These observations suggest that miRNAs can be key elements in the modification of neuronal phenotype."}
{"Word":"Microsatellite","Definition":"A microsatellite is a simple sequence repeat (SSR). It might be a homopolymer ('...TTTTTTT...'), a dinucleotide repeat ('....CACACACACACACA.....'), trinucleotide repeat ('....AGTAGTAGTAGTAGT...') etc. Due to polymerase slip (a.k.a. polymerase chatter), during DNA replication there is a slight chance these repeat sequences may become altered; copies of the repeat unit can be created or removed.

{"Word":"Microscopic","Definition":"The description of the behavior of individual molecules (at the molecular level). The behavior of an individual molecule may be very different from other identical molecules. In systems with a very large number of identical molecules, these individual deviations are negligible and contribute to the noise (random fluctuation) of a property of this system. The decay of a radioactive material is a good example of such an internal fluctuation. While the decay of isotopes can be predicted for a large clump of radioactive material (e.g. its half-life time, which is a macroscopic property), the actual time point of decay of an individual isotope cannot be predicted with accuracy and is random. However, we can assign a probability that it will decay within a certain amount of time (similar arguments can be made for individuals who have risk factors indicating the chance of developing a disease like cancer or a heart attack)."}

{"Word":"Mitochondrial disease","Definition":"Mitochondrial disease is a recently recognised category of human disease with the first human case being described in 1962. Initially thought to be a rare group of neurologic disorders predominantly affecting children, it is now known that affected patients can present with a wide range of symptoms at any age from infancy to well into adulthood. The pathological hallmark of mitochondrial disease in muscle is known as the ragged-red fibre, but other morphological changes such as cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency and ragged-blue fibres as identified by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining can also be observed. Although any or all of these histological features may be found in the muscle of patients with mitochondrial disease, it is now known that not all patients with mitochondrial disease will have these abnormalities. This lack of gold standard' for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease in addition to the heterogeneity in clinical manifestations has provided a diagnostic challenge to clinicians in this field of medicine. Whilst various diagnostic criteria have been proposed, none are entirely satisfactory and diagnosis rests on the synthesis of a complex array of clinical, pathological, biochemical and genetic data. Genetic abnormalities in mitochondrial disease: Mitochondria play a key role in cellular energy production, organ function and health. They produce energy via the respiratory chain, a series of multi-enzyme complexes that are encoded by both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA). Thus, mutations in both mtDNA and nDNA can cause mitochondrial disease. Given the presence of these pathogenic genetic mutations, mitochondrial disease can now be diagnosed by identifying genetic mutations in affected patients. Pathogenic mutations in mtDNA were first identified in 1988 and since then over 100 pathogenic mtDNA mutations have been described in the literature. A database of reported mtDNA mutations can be found at www.mitomap.org. In addition to mtDNA mutations, mutations in the nuclear genome (nDNA) have been reported to cause mitochondrial disease. Affected adults are more likely to have mutations in mtDNA, whereas affected children may have mutations in either genome. Mutations in POLG, Thymidine phosphorylase, ANT1 and TWINKLE are the commonest genes that cause mitochondrial disease (particularly CPEO phenotypes) in adultsCS. Prevalence of mitochondrial DNA mutations in Australia: Early epidemiologic studies estimated a minimum population prevalence of mitochondrial disease between 9.2-16.5 in 100 000. However, these prevalence estimates probably underestimated the true prevalence of the mitochondrial disease because they relied on diagnosed case referrals and calculations based on census data. Given that individuals with mitochondrial disease may not be accurately diagnosed (because they may have diverse or mild clinical manifestations), this approach is unreliable, as it assumes that all affected individuals will present for diagnosis and be accurately diagnosed."}

Blood flows through four chambers in the heart separated by one-way valves. The mitral (or atrioventricular) valve separates the upper and lower chambers on the left side of the heart. The mitral valve is so-called because it is shaped like an upside down Bishop's hat, a miter. If the flaps of this valve tear away due to disease, the process is called prolapse, \"a falling forward\". This results in leakage and backward flow called \"regurgitation\". Sometimes a valve is abnormally narrow causing partial obstruction constricting flow. Stenosis means \"a narrowing\"."}

A defensive protein produced by cells descended from a single cell; an antibody that is secreted by a clone of cells and, consequently, is specific for a single antigenic determinant. Antibody produced by a single population of identical cells that recognizes and binds to one specific region (epitope) of an antigen. Discovered and developed in the 1970s by Cesar Milstein and Georges Kohler.Monoclonal antiobodies are made by fusing myeloma cancer cells (which multiply very fast) with antibody-producing cells, then spreading the resulting conjugate colony so thin that each cell can be grown into a whole, separate colony (i.e., cloning). In this way, one gets whole batches of the same (monoclonal) antibody, which are all specific to the same antigen. Monoclonal antibodies have found markets in diagnostic kits, pharmaceuticals (e.g., trastuzumab, rituximab, bevacizumab, adalimumab, infliximab, etc.), imaging agents, and in purification processes.One example of a diagnostic use is the invention in 1997 by Bruno Oesch of a monoclonal antibody-based rapid test to detect the prion (PrP 5c ) that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle."}
{"Word":"Monocytes","Definition":"Also called monocyte macrophages. The round-nucleated cells that circulate in the blood. In summary they engulf and kill microorganisms, present antigen to the lymphocytes, kill certain tumor cells, and are involved in the regulation of inflammation. These cells are often the first to encounter a foreign substance or pathogen or normal cell debris in the body. When they do, the material is taken up and degraded by means of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymatic attack. Peptides that result from the degradation of foreign protein are then bound to a monocyte protein called class II MHC (major histocompatibility complex) and this self-foreign complex then migrates to the surface of the cell where it is embedded into the cell membrane in such a way as to present the peptide to the outside of the cell. This positioning allows T lymphocytes to recognize the peptide. Whereas self-peptides derived from normal cellular debris are ignored, foreign peptides activate precursors of helper T cells to further mature into active, lymphokine-secreting helper T lymphocytes, also known as TH cells. When monocytes move out of the bloodstream and into the tissues they are then called macrophages."}

Lifting a feather requires only a small amount of effort and so only small motor units need to be activated to the muscles of the finger lifting the feather. In contrast, lifting a heavy weight requires a large amount of effort and so both small and large motor units need to be activated to the muscles of the hand lifting the weight.

{"Word":"Muscle Fiber Configurations or Fascicular arrangement","Definition":"The arrangements of the muscle fibers that make up a muscle give the muscle its characteristic appearance. The arrangement of fascicles determines range and power; example: parallel muscle - longer fascicles produce greater range of movement; example: multipennate muscle - more fascicles produce more power Muscles are described by the directions of the fibers compared to the long axis of the muscle, or the direction of the action it produces: Parallel - all muscle fibers are parallel to the long axis of the muscle. Because all the fibers go in the same direction and are parallel, when these muscles contract, they allow a greater movement of the insertion point. Convergent - In these muscles the origin is wider than the insertion. The direction of the fibers is toward the middle of the muscle, which narrows toward the insertion. When these muscles contract they concentrate a greater force on the insertion. Divergent - In these muscles the insertion is wider than the origin. The direction of the fibers is away from the center of the muscle. The contraction of these muscles allows for the greatest range of motion. Circular - In these muscles, the fibers go around in circles. They function to seal off bodily openings, and contract with a great deal of force. Pennate muscle - Fascicle forms an oblique angle to the tendon (like a feather). Unipennate muscle - short pennate fascicles run down one side of the tendon. Bipennate muscle - short pennate fascicles run down both sides of the tendon. Multipennate - muscle where the tendon branches within the muscle and short pennate fascicles are attached to each tendon branch."}

{"Word":"Muscle tone","Definition":"The baseline level of muscle contraction (and force) produced even when a muscle is quiescent; Used in clinical practice to describe the resistance of a muscle to being stretched. Even when a whole muscle is not contracting, a small number of its motor units are involuntarily activated to produce a sustained contraction of the muscle fibers. The process gives rise to muscle tone. To sustain muscle tone, small groups of motor units are alternately active and inactive in a constantly shifting pattern. Muscle tone keeps skeletal muscles firm, but it does not result in a contraction strong enough to produce movement. When the peripheral nerve to a muscle is severed, the muscle becomes flaccid (limp). When nerve fibers in the brain or spinal cord are damaged, the balance between facilitation and inhibition of muscle tone is disturbed. The tone of some muscles may become increased and they resist being stretched - a condition called hypertonicity or spasticity."}

{"Word":"Myelin sheath","Definition":"In a neuron, an insulating coat of cell membrane produced by Schwann cells or Olgiodendrocytes. It covers the axon of the neuron, as a series of discontinuous sheaths along the length of the axon, interrupted between successive sheaths by unmyelinated regions called nodes of Ranvier. Not all neurons have this insulating myelin sheath and neurons possessing this sheath are called myelinated neurons. The myelin sheath is not a continuous structure over the entire axon of the neuron but is a series of discontinuous sheaths, each of which covers a segment of the axon.Each segment is produced by one Schwann cell or Olgiodendrocyte (the former in the Peripheral Nervous System and the latter in the Central Nervous System) that wraps itself around the neuron's axon over that segment and progressively squeezes itself tight around that segment of the axon membrane. As it does so, it squeezes all of the cytoplasm of that Schwann cell\/Oligodendrocyte to the outer part of the cell so that the axon membrane is now covered with whorls of the cell membrane of the insulating Schwann cell\/Oligodendrocyte.These whorls act to insulate the axon membrane from loss of current flow during transmission of an Action Potential, the mechanism whereby neurons transmit information.Between adjacent segments of this myelin sheath the axon is not myelinated and this uninsulated region is known as the node of Ranvier. The node is critical in regenerating the information flow during transmission of an Action Potential.The process of transmission of an Action Potential in such myelinated neurons is known as saltatory conduction, coming from the Latin word saltare which means to jump. This refers to the fact that the Action Potential appears to jump from one node to the next node along the length of the axon as the neuron transmits the information (in the form of Action Potentials) down the length of the axon.Saltatory conduction allows for faster transmission of information along the neuron since the Action Potential has to be regenerated less often (only at the nodes of ranvier) in a myelinated neuron than in an unmyelinated neuron. In the latter type of neuron it has to be regenerated very frequently because the absence of an insulating myelin sheath means that current leaks out as it flows along the neurons axon. Then, without regeneration, the current would be rapidly lost  i.e., the information that the neuron is trying to transmit would be lost very soon along it's length."}

Neddylation utilizes the E1 activating-enzyme complex composed of two subunits, APP-BP1 and UBA3, and the E2 conjugating-enzyme, UBC12 (Yeh, 2000). The only known substrates of neddylation are Cullin family proteins -- Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4A, Cul4B, and Cul5 -- which have been shown to be modified by Nedd8 in mammalian cells. Cullins directly interact with Roc1, a Ring finger protein, and the Cullin-Roc1 complex comprises the core module of a series of ubiquitin E3 ligases, which confer substrate specificity and therefore regulate the degradation process. Among Cullins, many studies focused on Cul1, an essential component of the SCF complex which functions as ubiquitin E3 ligase. The SCF complex consists of core subunits: Skp1, Cul1\/Cdc53, Roc1\/Hrt\/Rbx1, and a substrate-recognition F-box protein. Cul1 functions as a scaffold protein within the SCF complex; the N-terminal domain of Cul1 interacts with the adaptor protein Skp1 that links with the F-box protein, and the C-terminal domain interacts with Roc1 and the ubiquitin E2 enzyme"}

{"Word":"Noise signals","Definition":"A signal (e.g., a sound or a visual stimulus) containing a wide range of frequencies with a specific distribution of energy across these frequencies. Different noise signals can vary systematically in the range of frequencies and the energy distribution across these frequencies. A noise with a particular distribution of parameters is given a different colour in its name, e.g., White noise: Power density is constant over a finite frequency range. (See White Noise) Pink noise: power density decreases 3dB per octave with increasing frequency (density proportional to 1\/f) over a finite frequency range which does not include DC. Thus it contains more energy at lower frequencies than higher; however each octave contains the same amount of power (not a trivial filtering problem!) Red noise: Oceanic ambient noise (ie, noise distant from the sources) is often described as \"red\" due to the selective absorption of higher frequencies.\" Orange noise: quasi-stationary noise with a finite power spectrum with a finite number of small bands of zero energy dispersed throughout a continuous spectrum. These bands of zero energy are centered about the frequencies of musical notes in whatever system of music is of interest. Since all in-tune musical notes are eliminated, the remaining spectrum could be said to consist of sour, citrus, or \"orange\" notes. Orange noise is most easily generated by a roomfull of primary school students equipped with plastic soprano recorders. Green noise: A really long term power spectrum averaged over several outdoor sites. Rather like pink noise with a hump added around 500Hz. Supposedly the background noise of the world. Blue noise: Power density increases 3dB per octave with increasing frequency (density proportional to f) over a finite frequency range. This can be good noise for dithering. Purple or Violet noise: Power density increases 6dB per octave with increasing frequency (density proportional to f^2) over a finite frequency range. Differentiated white noise. Grey noise: Noise subjected to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve (such as an inverted a-weight curve) over a given range of frequencies, so that it sounds like it is equally loud at all frequencies. This would be a better definition of \"white noise\" than the \"equal power at all frequencies\" definition, since real \"white light\" has the power spectrum of a 5400K black body, not an equal power spectrum. Brown noise: Power density decreases 6dB per octave with increasing frequency (density proportional to 1\/f^2) over a frequency range which does not include DC. It is not named for a power spectrum that suggests the color brown, rather, the name is a coruption of Brownian motion. AKA \"random walk\" or \"drunkard's walk\" noise. Black noise: Power density is constant for a finite frequency range above 20kHz. Ultrasonic white noise. This black noise is like the so-called \"black light\" with frequencies too high to be perceived as sound, but still capable of affecting you or your surroundings."}

This means that all of the binding variation between assay runs, which is due to binder deterioration, incubation differences, buffer changes, etc., are included in the adjusted response. These binding differences between assay runs are factored out of the normalized response. This allows the integrity of the sample itself to be examined without being distorted by differences in the binding conditions."}

{"Word":"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)","Definition":"The selective absorption of very high-frequency radio waves by certain atomic nuclei that are subjected to an appropriately strong stationary magnetic field. Nuclei in which at least one proton or one neutron is unpaired act like tiny magnets, and a strong magnetic field exerts a force that causes them to precess in somewhat the same way that the axes of spinning tops trace out cone-shaped surfaces while they precess in the Earth's gravitational field. When the natural frequency of the precessing nuclear magnets corresponds to the frequency of a weak external radio wave striking the material, energy is absorbed from the radio wave. This selective absorption, called resonance, may be produced either by tuning the natural frequency of the nuclear magnets to that of a weak radio wave of fixed frequency or by tuning the frequency of the weak radio wave to that of the nuclear magnets (determined by the strong constant external magnetic field)."}
{"Word":"Nuclear run-on","Definition":"A method used to estimate the relative rate of transcription of a given gene, as opposed to the steady-state level of the mRNA transcript (which is influenced not just by transcription rates, but by the stability of the RNA).This technique is based on the assumption that a highly-transcribed gene should have more molecules of RNA polymerase bound to it than will the same gene in a less-active state. If properly prepared, isolated nuclei will continue to transcribe genes and incorporate 32P (radio-labelled phosphorus) into RNA, but only in those transcripts that were in progress at the time the nuclei were isolated. Once the polymerase molecules complete the transcript they have in progress, they should not be able to re-initiate transcription. If that is true, then the amount of radiolabel incorporated into a specific type of mRNA is theoretically proportional to the number of RNA polymerase complexes present on that gene at the time of isolation. A very difficult technique, rarely applied appropriately."}

A unit of genetic function common in bacteria and phages, consisting of coordinately regulated clusters of genes with related functions. An operon consists of an operator, promoter, regulator, and structural genes. The regulator gene codes for a repressor protein that binds to the operator, obstructing the promoter (thus, transcription) of the structural genes. The regulator does not have to be adjacent to other genes in the operon. If the repressor protein is removed, transcription may occur. Example: the Lac operon codes for b-galactosidase, for b-galactoside permease and for b-galactoside transacetylase. The genes of an operon are transcribed in one messenger RNA molecule and thus an operon could be defined as an aggregate of genes with a single messenger. Operons are either inducible or repressible according to the control mechanism. Both repression and induction are examples of negative control since the repressor proteins turn off transcription."}

{"Word":"Osmotic pressure","Definition":"A measure of the tendency of a solution to take up water when separated from pure water by a selectively permeable membrane. The hydrostatic pressure generated by a solution moving by osmosis across a selectively-permeable membrane (e.g., into or out of a cell) because of differences in concentration of non-permeating solutes. The hydrostatic pressure needed to offset the tendency for water to move from a region of high water potential\/concentration to one of low potential\/concentration. Osmotic Pressure can be determined by knowing the Osmotic concentration (or Osmolarity). Osmolarity depends strictly on number of particles per litre of solution, i.e., on [ ] of ALL solute particles in solution. So Osmolarity (in Osmolar units) = Concentration (in Molarity) x Number of particles (Note: salts dissociate in solution and each particle exerts an osmotic pressure).

{"Word":"Pain","Definition":"Pain is a subjective experience, the quality and magnitude of which can be difficult for the outsider to appreciate, yet there are certain features that allow it to be classified objectively. Its quality depends on the site of origin: the deep, dull ache of muscle or tendon pain is consistently different from the sharp or burning pain generated in the skin, despite the involvement of similar types of nociceptors. The experience of pain is not limited to the subject's perception: both the autonomic and somatic motor systems respond to pain, and it is believed that these physical responses differ according to the type of tissue from which the noxious inputs originate. It has been suggested that pain is part of a homeostatic mechanism that signals the presence of tissue damage and encourages the animal to alter its behavioural state. The sensory attributes of pain depend on the tissue of origin: superficial pain, originating in skin, is perceived as sharp and\/or burning and is limited to a small well-defined area, whereas deep pain, such as that originating in muscle, is dull and aching and difficult to localize. In addition to these differences in the quality of superficial and deep pain, it has been observed that pain originating in deep structures evokes very different behavioural and cardiovascular responses to pain originating in superficial structures. Pain originating in skin evokes a rise of pulse rate and a sense of invigoration whereas pain originating in deep structures evokes quiescence, a slowing of the pulse and falling of the blood pressure. Similar studies showed that muscle pain was associated with a fall in blood pressure and bradycardia in awake human subjects. Superficial pain causes a spinal reflex that results in a purposeful withdrawal of the body part from the offending stimulus. Conversely, deep pain elicits a passive, coping strategy aimed at promoting healing of the affected body part. Deep pain is more likely to transform into chronic pain than superficial pain."}

This can result in very stable recordings. In the voltage clamp technique, the membrane potential is held constant while measuring currents across the cell membrane. In some cases, the patch of membrane is sucked into the pipette, allowing a direct contact between the electrode solution and the intracellular medium.

{"Word":"Pepsinogen","Definition":"A digestive protease (EC 3.4.23.1) released by the chief cells in the stomach that functions to degrade food proteins into peptides. Pepsin is expressed as a pro-form zymogen, pepsinogen, whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids. In the stomach, chief cells release pepsinogen. This zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining. The hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and HCl from the stomach lining when food is ingested. HCl creates an acidic environment which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion, thereby generating pepsin (the active form). Pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin. Pepsin will digest up to 20% of ingested carbon bonds by cleaving preferentially after the N-terminal of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine and tyrosine. It will not cleave at bonds containing valine, alanine or glycine. Peptides may be further digested by other proteases (in the duodenum) and eventually absorbed by the body. Pepsin is stored as pepsinogen so it will only be released when needed, and does not digest the body's own proteins in the stomach's lining. Pepsin functions best in acidic environments, particularly those in a pH of 3. Pepsin denatures if the pH is more than 5.0. Pepsin is potently inhibited by the peptide inhibitor pepstatin."}

The DRGs also contain temperature sensors, itch sensors, cutaneous mechanoreceptors and mechanosensitive afferents from the musculature, none of which is normally nociceptive. Nociceptors can be divided into subclasses defined by their receptive properties, neurochemical profiles and central projections. Each subclass of nociceptive neurons responds to a characteristic range of acute stimuli, such as tissue damage, extreme temperature, or chemical insult. For reasons that remain poorly known, peripheral nerve damage can lead to neuropathic pain: the on-going perception of pain in the absence of any other tissue damage.Driven by transcription factors (TFs) including Islet1, Sox10 and Runx1, all nociceptors express TrkA, the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), during embryonic development. Postnatally, a subpopulation retains Runx1, extinguishes TrkA, and expresses Ret, the receptor for glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Unmyelinated TrkA+ nociceptors contain the peptides calcitonin-gene-related-peptide (CGRP) and\/or substance P (SP) whereas thinly myelinated TrkA- nociceptors bind the lectin I-B4 and express P2X3 receptors. Further differentiation of nociceptors establishes different subclasses defined by their receptive properties, neurochemical profiles and central projections. Each subclass of nociceptive neurons responds to a characteristic range of acute stimuli, such as tissue damage, extreme temperature, or chemical insult. However, for reasons that remain poorly known, peripheral nerve damage can lead to neuropathic pain: the on-going perception of pain in the absence of any other tissue damage."}

Preclinical study: Stage of drug research development, undertaken prior to the administration of the drug to humans. Consists of in vitro and in vivo screening, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and chemical upscaling.Phase I: If preclinical toxicity studies in animals reveal no harmful effects, a phase I study is usually then performed on a limited number of healthy human volunteers.These studies are designed on a small scale to show that the drug is safe in humans and set to determine the highest tolerated dose and to explore the safety, kinetics, interactions, and pharmacological effects of various doses. They seek to gain early evidence of effectiveness. Ultimately, all the information gleaned from a well designed Phase I trial will aid in developing a well designed Phase II trial. Phase Ia studies examine how the body reacts to a single, one-time dose of the drug in a monitored situation, usually involving healthy volunteers without the condition that the drug will be indicated for. As each dose is tested in a predetermined number of people, the trial progresses to the next dosing level with a different group of volunteers. Phase Ib trials examine how the body reacts to multiple doses of the drug over a period of time, from a few days to a few weeks. The average length of time that a compound is in Phase I testing is about one year.Phase II: Phase II testing looks at the efficacy of a drug, provided that it has proven safe in Phase I testing. Phase II testing is conducted in a relatively small number of patients having the condition the drug is indicated for, using several doses that, based on the data obtained in Phase I, are hypothesized to be efficacious doses. A placebo is also tested to obtain a baseline value for the comparison of drug effectiveness. Phase II testing takes from several months to 3 years. In clinical phase IIa studies, efficacy is tested on a limited group of patients, and the optimal administration regimen (dose, frequency) is determined. Often, a phase IIb study with a larger number of patients is required, or a combined phase IIb\/III, in order to be able to make statistically justifiable recommendations with regard to the administration regimen.Phase III: Here efficacy and safety of a single or a limited number of drug regimens are evaluated by applying them in a sufficiently large number of patients (usually a few hundred), who are more representative of the population as a whole. Efficacy and safety of the new treatment are compared with a placebo or with the existing standard treatment or to other approved drugs. Usually, several complementary phase III studies are performed simultaneously. The reports of the phase I to III studies are part of the drug registration file. Studies commenced after closing the registration file but before the product is released on the market are sometimes grouped under the name phase IIIb studies. Testing takes on average 24 months, with the FDA requiring a longer period for drugs to treat some indications.New Drug Application (NDA): When a drug has completed all three stages of testing, the company files an NDA with the FDA. Once the FDA has reviewed all the data from clinical testing, it can approve the NDA for the drug to be marketed and sold, or it can schedule a hearing to bring experts together to comment on the clinical data and the drug to be reviewed. Sometimes an additional study is requested to clarify the scientific data to show more proof that the drug works, or to compare the drug to existing medications for treating the disease.Phase IV: Begins when the product is approved for release on the market. Phase IV consists of post marketing surveillance studies conducted to learn more about the drug's risks, benefits, optimal use, and how it compares to competitors. Studies on large numbers of people may be helpful after a product is brought into circulation, for instance, in order to trace rare side effects."}

{"Word":"Plasmid","Definition":"Circular loop of DNA in prokaryotes. Eukaryotic DNA is organized into chromosomes. A small ring of DNA that carries accessory genes separate from those of a bacterial chromosome. Also found in some eukaryotes, such as yeast. Small DNA fragment found outside the chromosome, in almost all bacterial cells; autonomously replicating extra chromosomal circular rings of DNA present in monerans and some other organisms. Escherichia coli, the usual bacteria in molecular genetics experiments, has a large circular genome, but it will also replicate smaller circular DNAs as long as they have an \"origin of replication\". Plasmids may also have other DNA inserted by the investigator. A bacterium carrying a plasmid and replicating a million-fold will produce a million identical copies of that plasmid. Common plasmids are pBR322, pGEM, pUC18 These DNA molecules are distinct from the normal bacterial genome and are nonessential for cell survival under nonselective conditions. Some plasmids are capable of integrating into the host genome. A number of artificially constructed plasmids are used as cloning vectors. Plasmids carry between 2 and 30 genes. Some seem to be able to move in and out of the bacterial chromosome. They are self-replicating in a manner like the bacterial chromosome. Some plasmids can temporarily associate with the nucleoid and become incorporated in the bacterial chromosome; these are known as episomes. Plasmids carry non-vital genes which may or may not be useful to bacteria. Plasmids which do not confer any useful trait are called cryptic plasmids. Many plasmids have been recognized for E. coli, including the F plasmids (\"fertility factors\") and R plasmids (drug\/antibiotic resistance). The F plasmid contains 25 genes, some of which control the production of F pili (proteins which extend from the surface of F+, or male, cells to the surface of F-, or female, cells). The R plasmid conveys drug resistance on cells having it. As many as 10 resistance genes can be contained on a single R plasmid. The R plasmids can be transferred to other bacteria of the same species, to viruses, and even to bacteria of different species. Drug (antibiotic) resistance has been found among pathogens causing the diseases typhoid fever, gastro-enteritus, plague, undulant fever, meningitis, and gonorrhea. In addition to the more common modes of transfer, R plasmids may be passed through the cell membrane. The resistance genes appear to operate by either breaking down the antibiotics or by circumventing the block the antibiotic places on a key bacterial metabolic pathway. Plasmids are the principal tools for inserting new genetic information into microorganisms or plants."}

{"Word":"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)","Definition":"A powerful method for amplifying specific DNA segments in vitro which exploits certain features of DNA replication, by incubating with special primers, DNA polymerase molecules and nucleotides. A method of amplifying or copying a short sequence of DNA (DNA fragments) that is faster than cloning, in order to obtain sufficient amounts for diagnostic testing. PCR is the basis for a number of extremely important methods in molecular biology. It can be used to detect and measure vanishingly small amounts of DNA and to create customized pieces of DNA. It has been applied to clinical diagnosis and therapy, to forensics and to vast numbers of research applications. The technique derives its name from one of its key components, a DNA polymerase (to unzip the DNA helix by breaking the H-bonds between bases) used to amplify a piece of DNA. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is used as a template for replication. It is possible to amplify a single piece of DNA generating many copies.The technique involves combining DNA fragments with 5'- and 3'- primers, DNA polymerase, nucleotides, and other components to form a mixture in which the DNA is cyclically amplified.The method amplifies specific DNA base sequences by cycles of template denaturation, primer addition, primer annealing and replication using thermostable DNA polymerase. It uses a heat- stable polymerase and two 20- base primers, one complementary to the (+)- strand at one end of the sequence to be amplified and the other complementary to the (- )- strand at the other end. Replication requires a primer which is added to initiate the copying of each strand, along with nucleotides and Taq polymerase, and specificity is determined by the sequence and size of the primer. By cycling the temperature, the target DNA is repetitively denatured and copied. A single copy of the target DNA, even if mixed in with other undesirable DNA, can be amplified to obtain billions of replicates.The degree of amplification achieved is set at a theoretical maximum of 2^N, where N is the number of cycles, eg 20 cycles gives a theoretical 1048576 fold amplification. In addition to primers and DNA polymerase, PCR reactions must contain template DNA (the DNA to be amplified) and the DNA \"building blocks\", deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs, which include dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP). Because the newly synthesized DNA strands can subsequently serve as additional templates for the same primer sequences, successive rounds of primer annealing, strand elongation, and dissociation produce rapid and highly specific amplification of the desired sequence.PCR can be used to amplify RNA sequences if they are first converted to DNA via reverse transcriptase. This two-phase procedure is known as RT-PCR'. PCR also can be used to detect the existence of the defined sequence in a DNA sample."}
{"Word":"Polymerase slippage","Definition":"During replication, the slipping of DNA polymerase III from the DNA template strand at the repeat region and the subsequent reattachment at a more distant site.

(c) ATP-sensitive potassium channels ATP has been found to inhibit the opening of some potassium channels through which the IK(ATP) current flows. Such channels are inward-rectifying and voltage dependent. (d) Receptor-linked potassium channels Some potassium channels are opened by muscarinic receptor activation through coupling to a G-protein. The M-current is associated with such channels."}
{"Word":"Potency","Definition":"A measure of the concentrations of a drug at which it is effective. A much-abused, vague term which should always be further defined. For agonists, EC50, IC50, KA or pD2 are usually used, while pA2, KB or pKB are used for antagonists. Other terms are used in binding studies (see section 3) which do not distinguish between agonists and antagonists. It is important to realise that the potency of an agonist does not give any information about its affinity for the receptor, because the pharmacological response is rarely directly proportional to receptor occupancy (see efficacy)."}

{"Word":"Principal component analysis","Definition":"A special type of factor analysis. The principal component analysis or Karhunen-Loeve transform is a mathematical way of determining that linear transformation of a sample of points in L-dimensional space which exhibits the properties of the sample most clearly along the coordinate axes. Along the new axes the dimensions consist of a linear combination of variables, the sample variances are extremes (maxima and minima), and uncorrelated. The name comes from the principal axes of an ellipsoid (e.g. the ellipsoid of inertia), which are just the coordinate axes in question. By definition, the principal axes will include those along which the point sample has little or no spread (minima of variance). Hence, an analysis in terms of principal components can show (linear) interdependence in data. A point sample of L dimensions for whose L coordinates M linear relations hold, will show only (L-M) axes along which the spread is non-zero. Using a cutoff on the spread along each axis, a sample may thus be reduced in its dimensionality. The principal axes of a point sample are found by choosing the origin at the centre of gravity and forming the dispersion matrix . Principal component analysis has in practice been used to reduce the dimensionality of problems, and to transform interdependent coordinates into significant and independent ones. An example used in several particle physics experiments is that of reducing redundant observations of a particle track in a detector to a low-dimensional subspace whose axes correspond to parameters describing the track. In practice, non-linearities of detectors, frequent changes in detector layout and calibration, and the problem of transforming the coordinates along the principal axes into physically meaningful parameters, set limits to the applicability of the method."}

{"Word":"Protease","Definition":"An enzyme that hydrolyses (cleaves) peptide bonds that link amino acids in protein molecules. Proteases, also known as proteinases or proteolytic enzymes, are a large group of enzymes. Proteases belong to the class of enzymes known as hydrolases, which catalyse the reaction of hydrolysis of various bonds with the participation of a water molecule.They are currently classified into six groups:Serine proteasesThreonine proteasesCysteine proteasesAspartic acid proteasesMetalloproteasesGlutamic acid proteasesThe threonine and glutamic acid proteases were not described until 1995 and 2004, respectively. The mechanism used to cleave a peptide bond involves making an amino acid residue that has the cysteine and threonine (peptidases) or a water molecule (aspartic acid, metallo- and glutamic acid peptidases) nucleophilic so that it can attack the peptide carbonyl group. One way to make a nucleophile is by a catalytic triad, where a histidine residue is used to activate serine, cysteine or threonine as a nucleophile.Occurrence: Proteases occur naturally in all organisms and constitute 1-5% of the gene content. These enzymes are involved in a multitude of physiological reactions from simple digestion of food proteins to highly regulated cascades (e.g., the blood clotting cascade, the complement system, apoptosis pathways, and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase activating cascade). Peptidases can break either specific peptide bonds (limited proteolysis), depending on the amino acid sequence of a protein, or break down a complete peptide to amino acids (unlimited proteolysis). The activity can be a destructive change abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components; it can be an activation of a function or it can be a signal in a signalling pathway.Proteases are also a type of exotoxin, which is a virulence factor in bacteria pathogenesis. Bacteria exotoxic proteases destroy extracellular structures. Protease enzymes are also found used extensively in the bread industry in Bread improver.Proteases are involved in digesting long protein chains into short fragments, splitting the peptide bonds which link amino acid residues. Some of them can detach the terminal amino acids from the protein chain (exopeptidases, such as aminopeptidases, carboxipeptidase A); the others attack internal peptide bonds of a protein (endopeptidases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, papain, elastase).Proteases are divided into four major groups according to the character of their catalytic active site and conditions of action: serine proteinases, cysteine (thiol) proteinases, aspartic proteinases and metalloproteinases. Attachment of a protease to a certain group depends on the structure of catalytic site and the amino acid (as one of the constituents) essential for its activity.Proteases are used throughout an organism for various metabolic processes. Acid proteases secreted into the stomach (such as pepsin) and serine proteases present in duodeum (trypsin and chymotrypsin) enable us to digest the protein in food; proteases present in blood serum (thrombin, plasmin, Hageman factor, etc.) play important role in blood clotting, as well as lysis of the clots, and the correct action of the immune system. Other proteases are present in leukocytes (elastase, cathepsin G) and play several different roles in metabolic control. Proteases determine the lifetime of other proteins playing important physiological role like hormones, antibodies, or other enzymes -- this is one of the fastest \"switching on\" and \"switching off\" regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of an organism. By complex cooperative action the proteases may proceed as cascade reactions, which result in rapid and efficient amplification of an organism's response to a physiological signal.Inhibitors of proteases: The function of peptidases is inhibited by protease inhibitor enzymes. Examples of protease inhibitors are the class of serpins (serine protease or peptidase inhibitors), incorporating alpha 1-antitrypsin. Other serpins are complement 1-inhibitor, antithrombin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (coagulation, fibrinolysis) and the recently discovered neuroserpin.Natural protease inhibitors include the family of lipocalin proteins, which play a role in cell regulation and differentiation. Lipophilic ligands, attached to lipocalin proteins, have been found to possess tumor protease inhibiting properties. The natural protease inhibitors are not to be confused with the protease inhibitors used in antiretroviral therapy. Some viruses, with HIV among them, depend on proteases in their reproductive cycle. Thus, protease inhibitors are developed as antiviral means.Degradation: Proteases, being themselves proteins, are known to be cleaved by other protease molecules, sometimes of the same variety. This may be an important method of regulation of peptidase activity."}

Proteins are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the bodys cells, tissues, and organs, and each protein has unique functions. Examples are hormones, enzymes, and antibodies. Some amino acids can be manufactured in the body. Others must be supplied by the diet. The body breaks down food proteins into their amino acid constituents and reassembles the amino acids into the proteins needed for normal functioning. Proteins have many different functions: structure(collagen); movement (actin and myosin); catalysis (enzymes); transport (hemoglobin); regulation of cellular processes (insulin); hormones; and response to the stimuli (receptor proteins on surface of all cells).

Applied to image compaction, quantization describes a step of eliminating or reducing the relevance of coefficients that carry little information (a different, analogous quantization is found in the thresholding of coefficients in principal component analysis). A typical compression step used for images transforms a (sub-)image, e.g. an 8x8 pixel matrix, by a discrete cosine transform, then uses a quantization step which consists of a suitable linear combination of the transformed pixels (i.e. in the ``frequency domain''), and then uses Huffman coding for the resulting information. Except for quantization, these steps have a clearly defined inversion, so that in the definition of the quantization matrix the key criterion is the quality difference between the original and the encoded\/decoded image."}

Raman spectroscopy works by shining a laser beam onto the object's surface. Most of this light is reflected off unchanged. However a small proportion interacts with the molecules in the material and is scattered. The scattered portion of light, known as the Raman effect, is collected to produce a spectrum. Each material has a unique spectrum associated with it and therefore each one acts as a fingerprint with which to identify materials. However, the Raman effect is very small and until recently its use as an analytical tool was limited by a lack of suitable equipment. Recent advances, particularly the development of lasers, mean that Raman spectroscopy is now widely used to analyse a wide range of materials. These spectra can be used to identify a variety of materials from plastics to precious gemstones. Raman spectroscopy is totally non-destructive and by using a microscope, spectra can be recorded from very small samples. Special attachments on the laser Raman microprobes even allow analysis of tiny areas directly on the surface of objects. Source: British Museum)"}

{"Word":"Receptor reserve","Definition":"Because high-efficacy compounds need to occupy relatively few receptors to produce a maximal response, it is possible to inactivate a proportion of the receptors in a tissue (e.g. in the presence of an irreversible antagonist) without depressing the maximum of the concentration-response curve. (The curve is, however, shifted rightward along the x axis). There is said to be a receptor reserve (or, more colloquially, spare receptors) for that particular agonist in that particular tissue. There is no receptor reserve for a drug which acts as a partial agonist in the tissue. The receptor reserve may vary between tissues, depending on the number of receptors in the particular tissue and the efficiency of coupling between them and their effector mechanism. Consequently, a partial agonist in one tissue may appear to act as a full agonist in a tissue with a higher receptor reserve."}

{"Word":"Resting Membrane Potential (RMP or EM)","Definition":"A difference in electrical charge (i.e, a potential difference, pd) across the cell membrane of neurons, muscle cells, receptor cells and many other cells in the body. A difference in charge across the cell membrane that arises because the cell membrane is selectively permeable, i.e., it allows trans-membrane diffusion of certain molecules but not others. Generally the RMP is such that the inside of the cell is negatively charged with respect to the outside (i..e, there is a net excess of negative charge inside the cell compared to the outside, just across the cell membrane). The word Resting indicates that this difference in charge is present even when the cell is quiescent and not undergoing any major change in activity levels. In many cells, the RMP is due to the greater permeability of the cell membrane to K+ which, being at higher concentrations inside most cells, then will tend to diffuse out of the cell. However, it is important to note that the RMP is not just a simple diffusion potential. Rather, it is largely a diffusion potential with an added component of a few millivolts owing to the direct polarising effect of the electrogenic sodium\/potassium (Na+\/K+) pump which pumps K+ back into the cell and Na+ out of the cell. The pumping of these two ions is done in the ration of 3:2 and hence the pump contributes to the RMP.When the cell membrane is permeable to > 1 ion, the movement of all permeating ions needs to be considered and the RMP depends on different membrane permeabilities of the permeating ions and differences in their ionic concentration.As a general rule of thumb for the sign or polarity of a diffusion potential: The more mobile ion confers its sign on the region to which it is diffusing. (see also Equilibrium potential, Goldman equation, and Nernst equation)"}

These enzymes are naturally produced by bacteria that use them as a defense mechanism against viral infection. The enzymes chop up the viral nucleic acids and hence their function is destroyed. They help to protect cells from viral infection and are used in work with DNA. Discovered in 1970 by Werner Arber, Hamilton Smith, and Daniel Nathans, restriction endonucleases are an important tool in genetic engineering, enabling the biotechnologist to splice new genes into the location(s) of a molecule of DNA where a restriction endonuclease has created a gap (via cleavage of the DNA)."}
{"Word":"Restriction enzymes","Definition":"A degradative enzyme that recognizes and cuts up DNA (including that of certain phages) that is foreign to a bacterium. A series of enzymes (\"restriction endonucleases\"), generally isolated from bacteria, which are able to recognize, attach to, specific, short nucleotide sequences and cut DNA molecules at those sequences (\"restriction sites\") and cut both strands of DNA at those sites. An endonuclease that will recognize a specific target nucleotide sequence in DNA and break the DNA chain at the target; a variety of these enzymes are known, and they are extensively used in genetic engineering. Bacteria produce restriction enzymes for protection against invasion by foreign DNA such as phages. The bacteria's own DNA is modified in such a way as to prevent it from being clipped. For example, the restriction enzyme BamHI locates and cuts any occurrence of: 5'-GGATCC-3' |||||| 3'-CCTAGG-5'Note that both strands contain the sequence GGATCC, but in antiparallel orientation. The recognition site is thus said to be palindromic, which is typical of restriction sites. Every copy of a plasmid is identical in sequence, so if BamHI cuts a particular circular plasmid at three sites producing three \"restriction fragments\", then a million copies of that plasmid will produce those same restriction fragments a million times over. There are more than six hundred known restriction enzymes. Bacteria contain over 400 such enzymes that recognize and cut over 100 different DNA sequences."}
{"Word":"Restriction enzyme cutting site","Definition":"A specific nucleotide sequence of DNA at which a particular restriction enzyme cuts the DNA.

{"Word":"Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)","Definition":"Differences in DNA sequence on homologous chromosomes that result in different patterns of restriction fragment lengths (DNA segments resulting from treatment with restriction enzymes); useful as genetic markers for making linkage maps. Variation in DNA fragment banding patterns of electrophoresed restriction digests of DNA from different individuals of a species. Often due to the presence of a restriction enzyme cleavage site at one place in the genome in one individual and the absence of that specific site in another individual, i.e., are usually caused by mutation at a cutting site. Although two individuals of the same species have almost identical genomes, they will always differ at a few nucleotides. Some of these differences will produce new restriction sites (or remove them), and thus the banding pattern seen on a genomic Southern will thus be affected. For any given probe (or gene), it is often possible to test different restriction enzymes until you find one which gives a pattern difference between two individuals - a RFLP. The less related the individuals, the more divergent their DNA sequences are and the more likely you are to find a RFLP. Variation between individuals in DNA fragment sizes cut by specific restriction enzymes; polymorphic sequences that result in RFLPs are used as markers on both physical maps and genetic linkage maps. See also Variable-number-of-tandem-repeats (VNTR) locus."}

Retroviruses also include the enzyme reverse transcriptase with the viral RNA.An RNA virus that reproduces by transcribing its RNA into DNA and then inserting the DNA into a cellular chromosome; an important class of cancer-causing viruses.From the Latin word retrovir, which means \"backward man\". Oncogenic (i.e., cancer-producing), single-stranded, diploid RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses that contain (+) RNA in their virions and propagate through a double-helical DNA intermediate. They are known as retroviruses because their genetic information flows from RNA to DNA (reverse of normal). That is, the viruses contain an enzyme that allows the production of DNA using RNA as a template. Reverse transcriptase makes a single-stranded viral DNA copy of the single-stranded viral RNA. The single stranded viral DNA is subsequently turned into a double-stranded DNA. In the process of making the cDNA strand for the viral RNA, the enzyme also makes long terminal repeats (LTRs) sequences at the terminal ends of the cDNA. These LTRs may also make insertion of the viral DNA into the host DNA easier. The inserted viral DNA makes RNA transcripts which are packaged with viral protein coats and reverse transcriptase.When the viral DNA immediately takes over the host cell it begins making new viruses which eventually cause the rupture (lysis) of the cell, releasing those new viruses to continue the infection cycle. This cycle occurs when the viral DNA is incorporated into the host DNA as a prophage. When the cell replicates the prophage is passed along as if it were host DNA. Sometimes the prophage can emerge from the host chromosome and enter the lytic cycle spontaneously once every 10,000 cell divisions. Ultraviolet light and x-rays may also trigger emergence of the prophage. Retroviruses can only infect cells in which DNA is replicating, such as tumor cells (since they are constantly replicating) or cells comprising the lining of the stomach (since that lining must replace itself every few days)."}

{"Word":"RNA splicing","Definition":"RNA splicing is performed by small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) complexed to protein subunits to form small nuclear ribonuclear proteins (snRNPs) which are transported into the nucleus to catalyse alternative splicing. These form the core of the spliceosome: the cellular machinery responsible for pre-mRNA editing. Additional molecular components involved in RNA transcription and processing segregate to subnuclear structures such as Cajal bodies and gemini of coiled-bodies (gems). SMN is expressed in the cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus, where it localises to Cajal bodies and gems. SMN binds seven additional proteins, Gemins 2-7 and unr interacting protein (Unrip), to form the \"SMN complex\" which provides an assembly platform for the spliceosome. The SMN complex mediates binding of specific uridine-rich snRNAs to their partners, Sm core proteins, forming snRNPs. SMN also interacts with RNA polymerase II and small nucleolar RNPs, consistent with roles in transcription and ribosome formation. Finally, SMN modulates the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway since Gemins 3 and 4 associate with microRNP complexes and titrate away from the SMN complex. All the functions described in the previous paragraph require SMN to be located in the nucleus. Most proteins require active transport into the nucleus, which is mediated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Proteins to be transported, such as SMN, have nuclear recognition sequences which bind to cytosolic nuclear import receptors, importin- and importin- (IMP). This trimeric complex is transported across the NPC by binding to four key nucleoporins (Nup) and phosphorylation of the small GTPase Ran. Exit from the nucleus occurs in the reverse involving exportin (EXP) binding to nuclear export sequences within proteins and Ran GTPase activity. In addition to a cytoplasmic targeting sequence, SMN binding to heteronuclear RNPs (hnRNPs) also mediates its nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling: hnRNP binding is the same mechanism used by spliced mRNAs destined for ribosomes."}

Some bacterial SAM riboswitches can act as noncoding RNAs and regulate gene expression in trans. When bound to SAM, these RNAs directly bind to the 5' UTR of the virulence regulator PrfA in the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.

Enzyme labeled probe is detected by soaking the tissue in the substrate; the dye develops in sites where the transcript of interest was expressed."}
{"Word":"RNA interference (RNAi) (Also known as RNA silencing)","Definition":"The mechanism by which small double-stranded RNAs can interfere with expression of any mRNA having a similar sequence: what happens when short strands of (complementary) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are introduced into living cells. Those small RNAs are known as 'siRNA', for short interfering RNAs. The mode of action for siRNA appears to be via dissociation of its strands, hybridization to the target RNA, extension of those fragments by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, then fragmentation of the target. Importantly, the remnants of the target molecule appears to then act as an siRNA itself; thus the effect of a small amount of starting siRNA is effectively amplified and can have long-lasting effects on the recipient cell. That interaction can be done either by physical insertion of the dsRNA or by genetic engineering of the organism so the organism's cell(s) themselves produce that (new) dsRNA. For example, genetic engineers can utilize T7 RNA polymerase to cause the production of such dsRNA within living cells.Viral infection (i.e., insertion of viral dsRNA) and also micro-RNAs can also cause RNA interference. If those dsRNAs are relatively long, they are cleaved (cut) by enzymes known as dimeric RNase III ribonucleases [also called dicer enzymes] into segments approximately 19-21 bp (base pairs) in length; called siRNAs (short interfering RNAs or small interfering RNAs). That siRNA (i.e., specific to a selected gene's mRNA) causes specific cellular \"cutting enzymes\" in RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) to adhere to the transcribed-from-gene mRNA which the dsRNA was chosen to be specific to. Those \"cutting enzymes\" cut-up and mark for destruction the transcribed-from-gene mRNA; thereby negating the effects of that gene. That effect is known as gene silencing, and it persists even in the (first generation) offspring of that affected organism. RNAi is one methodology which can be utilized to cause gene silencing\/knockout. During 2002, Thomas A. Rosenquist and Gregory J. Hannon created \"knockdown\" mice via genetic engineering so those mice (continually) produced the dsRNA which silenced a selected gene. Later, the first-generation offspring of those knockdown mice also \"silenced\" that selected gene in their bodies. Under some conditions, RNAi can also inhibit gene transcription (i.e., causing formation of silent heterochormatin in some organisms). The RNAi effect has been exploited in numerous research programs to deplete the call of specific messages, thus examining the role of those messages by their absence."}

When the proper Scatchard model is chosen, the coefficients from a Scatchard analysis of a single assay provide direct measurements of the number of binding sites and the affinity constant of each binder subclass, which are then statistically compared to those from the reference assay set."}
{"Word":"Schild analysis","Definition":"Calculation of the potency of competitive antagonists according to the method of Arunlakshana and Schild (1959) This is a null method, i.e. it makes no assumptions about the nature of the coupling between receptor binding and the response, but simply assumes that any particular level of response is associated with a unique degree of occupation and activation of the receptors by the agonist. There are a number of other assumptions and criteria, the most important of which are that (a) the agonist acts only at a single receptor type; (b) the binding of both agonist and antagonist is competitive and reversible; (c) responses are measured when both agonist and antagonist are at equilibrium with the receptors; and (d) the antagonist causes parallel rightward shifts of the log agonist concentration-response curve with no depression of the maximum response. See Schild plot and Schild slope."}
{"Word":"Schild equation","Definition":"The equation: (conc. ratio - 1) = (antagonist conc.)\/KB where conc. ratio = concentration ratio for the agonist (see above) and KB = dissociation equilibrium constant for the antagonist. The Gaddum equation (see pKB) is the logarithmic transformation of this equation."}
{"Word":"Schild plot","Definition":"A graph of log (concentration ratio - 1) against log (antagonist concentration). An example is shown in Fig. C. The intercept on the log concentration axis is equal to the pA2 value, while the slope gives information about the nature of the antagonism."}
{"Word":"Schild slope","Definition":"The slope of a Schild plot should equal 1 if all of the assumptions underlying the method of analysis are fulfilled. A slope which is significantly greater than 1 may indicate positive cooperativity in the binding of the antagonist, depletion of a potent antagonist from the medium by receptor binding or non-specific binding (e.g. to glassware or partitioning into lipid), or lack of antagonist equilibrium. A slope which is significantly less than 1 may indicate negative cooperativity in the binding, or removal of agonist by a saturable uptake process, or it may arise because the agonist is acting at a second receptor type (this can also cause curved Schild plots). There are many other reasons why slopse differ from the theoretical value, but most of them are difficult to prove. See Kenakin (1987) for a thorough discussion. If the slope of a Schild plot is greater than 1, the calculated pA2 value will be an underestimate of the pKB value (i.e. the antagonist is less potent than expected). Conversely, if the slope is less than 1, the calculated pA2 value will overestimate the pKB value."}

For example, if you needed a cDNA clone of the pituitary glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit, you would need to make (or buy) a pituitary cDNA library, then screen that library in order to detect and isolate those few bacteria carrying alpha subunit cDNA. There are two methods of screening which are particularly worth describing: screening by hybridization, and screening by antibody. Screening by hybridization: involves spreading the mixture of bacteria out on a dozen or so agar plates to grow several ten thousand isolated colonies. Membranes are laid onto each plate, and some of the bacteria from each colony stick, producing replicas of each colony in their original growth position. The membranes are lifted and the adherent bacteria are lysed, then hybridized to a radioactive piece of alpha DNA (the source of which is a story in itself - see \"Probe\"). When X-ray film is laid on the filter, only colonies carrying alpha sequences will \"light up\". Their position on the membranes show where they grew on the original plates, so you now can go back to the original plate (where the remnants of the colonies are still alive), pick the colony off the plate and grow it up. You now have an unlimited source of alpha cDNA. Screening by antibody: is an option if the bacteria and plasmid are designed to express proteins from the cDNA inserts (see \"Expression clones\"). The principle is similar to hybridization, in that you lift replica filters from bacterial plates, but then you use the antibody (perhaps generated after olde tyme protein purification rituals) to show which colony expresses the desired protein."}

{"Word":"SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)","Definition":"A technique to separate proteins (and even DNA and RNA molecules) according only to their size. SDS is an anionic detergent which denatures secondary and nondisulfidelinked tertiary structures, and applies a negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass. Proteins are mixed with SDS. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in mass charge ratio, as each protein has an isoelectric point and molecular weight particular to its primary structure. This is known as Native PAGE. SDS binds to and unfolds the protein, giving a near uniform negative charge along the length of the polypeptide, i.e., complexes with fairly constant charge to mass ratios. The mixture is separated electrophoretically in a polyacrylamide gel (see Polyacrylamide gel) The electrophoretic migration rate through the gel is determined only by the size of the complexes. Molecular weights are determined by simultaneously running marker proteins of known molecular weight. Usually, smaller proteins migrate through the gel faster than larger proteins.

In all sensory systems nerve fibres from the receptor surface at the periphery (i.e., the skin, the ear, the eye, etc) do not carry information directly to the cortex that is responsible for perception. Instead information is relayed via a succession of sensory nuclei in the Central Nervous System to arrive at the cortex, and even then be relayed to multiple cortical areas. This serves to reduce the energetic demands on neurons which may otherwise have to be able to provide nutrients and other substances and remove waste products from very long axons. (Imagine a single neuron being responsible for relaying pain information from your toe all the way up to your cortex for perception.)

Because that degradation of mRNA thereby shuts-down (quells) production of the corresponding protein, siRNA (via RNAi) constitutes a pathway that cells utilize to regulate\/silence gene expression. Relevant promoters within the DNA are silenced via DNA methylation and\/or chromatin remodeling. The siRNA can be utilized by man to cause gene silencing\/knockout. In plants and nematodes, such RNA interference-induced gene silencing spreads (e.g., from the site of dsRNA entry-into-organism) throughout the organism; apparently via mediation\/transport by the transmembrane (i.e., through the plasma membrane) protein known as SID-1. In animals, such RNA interference tends to be localized at\/near site of dsRNA entry-into-organism. For example, relevant siRNA has been utilized to quell the (over)production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in laboratory animals; thereby helping prevent some age-related macular degeneration (AMD) damage. Relevant siRNA has been utilized to quell (over) production of apolipoprotein B in laboratory animals; thereby lowering serum cholesterol and bloodstream levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLP)."}

It extends up and around the shoulder joint at the rear to create a roof called the acromion and around the shoulder joint at the front to constitute the coracoid process. The shoulder joint is cushioned by cartilage that covers the face of the glenoid socket and the head of the humerus. The joint is stabilized by a ring of fibrous cartilage around the glenoid socket that is called the labrum . Ligaments connect the bones of the shoulder and tendons join these bones to surrounding muscles. The biceps tendon attaches the biceps muscle to the shoulder and helps stabilize the joint.

{"Word":"Sleep apnea","Definition":"The temporary stoppage of breathing during sleep, often resulting in daytime sleepiness. The most common form of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In obstructive sleep apnea, the muscles of the soft palate around the base of the tongue and the uvula relax, obstructing the airway. The airway obstruction causes the level of oxygen in the blood to fall (hypoxia), increases the stress on the heart, elevates blood pressure, and prevents the patient from entering REM sleep, the restful and restorative stage of sleep. In other words, sleep apnea causes deprivation of quality sleep. The symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include loud snoring and\/or abnormal pattern of snoring with pauses and gasps. Other symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, memory changes, depression, and irritability. In some patients sleep apnea can contribute to high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, and heart attack. Obstructive sleep apnea typically affects middle-age, overweight men, and may affect women in later years. It can be aggravated by alcohol, sleeping pills and tranquilizers taken at bedtime. Sleep laboratories monitor different stages of sleep, diagnose sleep apnea, determine the type (obstructive or central) and severity of sleep apnea, and design treatment. General measures in treating obstructive sleep apnea include losing excessive weight, avoiding alcohol and sedatives, sleeping on one side, and medications to relieve nasal congestion. CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is an effective treatment for sleep apnea. A mask is worn over the nose during sleep while compressed air is gently forced through the nose to keep the airway open. Different patients need different mask sizes and different pressure levels for optimal treatment results. Another type of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is ENT surgery. In an operation called UPPP, the surgeon removes excessive soft tissue from the back of the throat to relieve obstruction. (see Apnea)"}

{"Word":"Small intestine","Definition":"The region of the digestive system immediately after the stomach. It consists of three sections:The duodenum, about 25 cm (10 in) long, receives chyme from the stomach through the pyloric sphincter. Ducts that empty into the duodenum deliver pancreatic juice and bile from the pancreas and liver, respectively.The jejunum, about 2.5 m (8 ft) long, is the middle section of the small intestine.The ileum, about 3.6 m (12 ft) long, is the last section of the small intestine. It ends with the ileocecal valve (sphincter), which regulates the movement of chyme into the large intestine and prevents backward movement of material from the large intestine.The functions of the small intestine includeMechanical digestion. Segmentation mixes the chyme with enzymes from the small intestine and pancreas. Bile from the liver separates fat into smaller fat globules. Peristalsis moves the chyme through the small intestine.Chemical digestion. Enzymes from the small intestine and pancreas break down all four groups of molecules found in food (polysaccharides, proteins, fats, and nucleic acids) into their component molecules.Absorption. It is the primary location in the GI tract for absorption of nutrients:Carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and water-soluble vitamins. The components of these molecules are absorbed by facilitated diffusion or active transport. They are then passed to blood capillaries.Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 combines with intrinsic factor (produced in the stomach) and is absorbed by receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is then passed to the blood capillaries.Lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. Because fat-soluble vitamins and the components of lipids are insoluble in water, they are packaged and delivered to cells within water-soluble clusters of bile salts called micelles. They are then absorbed by simple diffusion and, once inside the cells, mix with cholesterol and protein to form chylomicrons. The chylomicrons are then passed to the lymphatic capillaries. When the lymph eventually empties into the blood, the chylomicrons are broken down by lipoprotein lipase, and the breakdown products, fatty acids and glycerol, pass through blood capillary walls to be absorbed by various cells.Water and electrolytes. About 90 percent of the water in chyme is absorbed, as well as various electrolytes (ions), including Na-, K-, Cl, nitrates, calcium, and iron.(see Large Intestine)"}

Named after ts inventor and developer, the British biologist Edwin M. Southern. High molecular weight DNA is digested, by restriction endonucleases into smaller fragments which are then separated into bands by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. A sheet of nylon or nitrocellulose membrane is applied against the agarose gel to transfer the DNA bands to the membrane. Depending on the type of membrane used, it is then baked at high temperatures (60-100 oC) or exposed to UV radiation to permanently covalently cross-link the DNA bands to the membrane. The membrane is then exposed to and incubated with a radiolabelled probe, a single-stranded DNA with the sequence of interest, so that the DNA on the membrane can hybridize with the probe. Excess (unbound) probe is washed away and the pattern of hybridization is visualized on X-ray film by autoradioghraphy. A Southern blot is routinely used to check for the presence of a DNA sequence in a DNA sample. It is particularly useful in detecting large gene rearrangements\/deletions and large trinucleotide repeat expansions. It is also used to determine the molecular weight of a restriction fragment and to measure relative amounts in different samples."}

Used to distinguish sexually reproducing organisms into groups. Individuals from two different species cannot have offspring. They are said to be reproductively isolated. The biologist Ernst Mayr formulated this definition of a species advancing our understanding of the mechanism of evolution of higher organisms. For microbes, the species definition does not properly apply, because they do not reproduce sexually, but have an efficient mechanism to exchange genetic material even between evolutionarily distant forms. This exchange of genes is known as horizontal gene transfer. Unlike sexual reproduction, it usually involves only a fraction of an organisms genome that is being transferred and is a mechanisms of increasing genetic variability among microorganisms that does not depend on cellular reproduction (cell division). However, the definition of a species is more difficult than one might think. Over the years, a variety of different species concepts have been proposed, and the debate about the most appropriate definition is ongoing. The biological test of a species is not always available, and so there is also a morphological species concept based on anatomical similarities, i.e., members possess similar anatomical characteristics."}

Thus the electrode \"hears\" spikes generated by many nearby neurons. Because the distance of each active neuron from the electrode is different and because the characteristics of each neuronal cell body may be slightly different, each action potential has its own signature in terms of its shape, size and timing. It is therefore often possible to use computer programs to \"sort\" the different spikes on the basis of a combination of these characteristics (e.g., the width of the action potential + the size + the rate of rise of the upstroke of the AP etc) so that action potentials from different neurons are separated from each other.

{"Word":"Sticky ends","Definition":"After digestion of a DNA with certain restriction enzymes, the ends left have one strand overhanging the other to form a short (typically 4 nt) single-stranded segment. This overhang will easily re-attach to other ends like it, and are thus known as \"sticky ends\". For example, the enzyme BamHI recognizes the sequence GGATCC, and clips after the first G in each strand: The overhangs thus produced can still hybridize (\"anneal\") with each other, even if they came from different parent DNA molecules, and the enzyme ligase will then covalently link the strands. Sticky ends therefore facilitate the ligation of diverse segments of DNA, and allow the formation of novel DNA constructs."}

A stochastic event is based on random behaviour. The occurrence of individual events cannot be predicted, although measuring the distribution of all observations usually follows a predictable pattern. These patterns can be described by statistical means. An example is the decay of radio active material, where a clump of matter has a measurable and thus predictable half-life time. It is impossible, however, to mark an individual atom and predict when it will decay and emit radiation. The latter process is a stochastic event."}

{"Word":"Stress shielding","Definition":"The removal of forces or stresses that normally act on bone. Stress shielding eventually leads to osteopenia. A common site for stress shielding is the proximal femoral diaphysis after placement of a femoral prosthesis. The more tightly the stem of the prosthesis fits into the distal medullary canal, the greater the shift of body weight to the prosthetic stem from the proximal femoral cortex. This causes loss of the normal remodeling forces above the level at which the stem is fixated against the endosteal surface of the medullary canal resulting in osteopenia of the proximal femoral diaphysis."}
{"Word":"Stringency","Definition":"A term used to describe the conditions of hybridization. By varying the conditions (especially salt concentration and temperature) a given probe sequence may be allowed to hybridize only with its exact complement (high stringency), or with any somewhat related sequences (relaxed or low stringency).

{"Word":"Subtype","Definition":"Subtypes of receptor are those which, in a single species, are activated by the same family of endogenous ligands but exhibit sufficient differences in their pharmacological properties or molecular structure to justify being classified separately. Traditionally, subtypes have been identified using drugs which can selectively activate them or antagonise the effects of agonists with markedly different potencies (the usual rule of thumb is that there should be at least a 10-fold difference in antagonist affinity, i.e. one log unit difference in pKB value, when postulating the existence of a novel receptor subtype (Kenakin et al., 1992)). Consequently, subtypes can only be identified when pharmacological tools are available. Molecular biological techniques have now determined the amino-acid sequence of many receptor proteins, and hence the degree of homology between receptor types to be measured. However, there is no established rule which differentiates receptor subtypes simply on the basis of the number of amino-acids which differ between them. Compare species homologue."}
{"Word":"Sucralose","Definition":"The only low-calorie sweetener that is made from sugar. It is approximately 600-times sweeter and does not contain calories.

{"Word":"Suction catheter","Definition":"A small flexible catheter that is used to suction the airway."}
{"Word":"Sugar alcohols","Definition":"Ingredients used to add sweet flavours to food. Those often used instead of sugars include sorbitol, mamitol, and xylitol. Many fruits and vegetables contain sugar alcohols naturally. They are also found in some sugarless gum, hard candies, jams and jellies. Besides adding sweetness, sugar alcohols also add texture, help foods stay moist, prevent browning when food is heated and give a cooling effect to the taste of food. They supply four calories per gram, but are absorbed slowly and incompletely and thus require little or no insulin for metabolism. They are not cavity-producing because they are not metabolized by bacteria that produce cavities."}
{"Word":"Sugar bloom","Definition":"Dry and hard to the touch, sugar bloom is the result of surface moisture dissolving sugar in the chocolate and subsequent recrystallization of the sugar on the chocolate surface.

{"Word":"Summation, Temporal or Spatial (of Post-synaptic potentials)","Definition":"Different ways of summing the Post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) produced by a cell in response to input from a neuron to sum. Temporal summation occurs when the PSPs that are summing are produced by repetitive closely-spaced (in time) input from a single pre-synaptic terminal. Spatial summation occurs when the PSPs that are summing are produced by repetitive closely-spaced (in time) input from many different pre-synaptic terminals. Summation of the PSPs produces a larger Grand Post-synpatic Potential that, in the case of Excitatory PSPs, can lead to an Action Potential being produced by the post-synaptic cell."}
{"Word":"Summation (of muscle contractions)","Definition":"The addition of individual muscle twitch contractions to produce a larger contraction and more force. Temporal summation occurs when the individual muscle twitches activated by a single input are activated so closely in time that the twitch contraction to an input occurs before the twitch contraction to a previous input has ceased. This results in a larger twitch contraction (i.e., more force). Multiple motor unit summation occurs when stronger stimuli (or more brain activation) results in the activation of more motor units, leading to the activation of more muscle fibres in a muscle and therefore a larger contraction of the overall muscle, and more force."}

The chemical synapse contains packaged neurotransmitters that can be released upon an electrical signal (action potential) reaching the synapse from the dendrites and cell body of the neuron, where action potentials originate (where synapses of other neurons interact with the signaling cell). A neuron can have multiple synapses, often with different signaling properties being excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Multiple synapses signaling to a receiving neuron or muscle can strengthen a stimulus or inhibition by activating some or all of the synapses through addition of signaling strength. In addition to chemical synapses, electrical synapses are propagating an action potential signal without a neurotransmitter, but directly by coupling membranes of adjacent cells using gap junctions. The feature of both chemical and electrical synapses allows the signal to propagate unidirectional. The signal cannot reverse. However, feedback signals between the signaling and receiving cell to strengthen or weaken the synaptic interaction, a process called synaptic plasticity."}

Tonicity tells us how a solution affects a cell because of water movement  i.e., if you place cells in that solution do they swell, or shrink, or not be affected at all? Tonicity depends on the effective [Non-penetrating particles] in a solution because if the particles don't penetrate & are at unequal [ ] in the cell versus the solution, then water will move and affect cell volume (since animal cells have a rigid shape are less able to accommodate volume changes). Iso-tonicity: Generally the intra-cellular [Non-penetrating particles] creates an osmotic pressure of ~280 mOsmolar (mOsm). So if extracellular [NPP] osmotic pressure = ~280 mOsm, then there will be no net water movement into or out of the cell and this solution is isotonic to that cell. Hypo-tonicity: If extracellular [NPP] osmotic pressure < ~280 mOsm, then there will be a net water movement into the cell as the extracellular solution has a higher [Water]. This solution is hypotonic to that cell. Hyper-tonicity: If extracellular [NPP] osmotic pressure > ~280 mOsm, then there will be a net water movement out the cell as the extracellular solution has a lower [Water]. This solution is hypertonic to that cell."}

Isotopic tracer activity samples contain the same amount of tracer that is added to each assay sample and are therefore higher in activity than any other sample. Nonisotopic tracer activity samples might not have the highest activity of all samples if, for example, the enzyme\/substrate mixture must be diluted to be measured. The bound raw response is then used to calculate the adjusted, normalized and y-axis responses. The variation in the tracer activity raw response from assay to assay is a measure of the label response variation. Label response variation is caused by anything which affects the raw response, such as instrument drift, enzyme\/substrate deterioration, and isotopic decay, that is not related to changing conditions in the ligand-binder reaction."}

A virus is a particle consisting of a nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) genome surrounded by a protein coat (capsid) and some animal viruses are also covered by a membrane. Smallest of all organisms and often not considered alive because they strictly depend on a cellular host organism (bacteria, plant, animal) to reproduce. Viruses have no metabolism of their own and depend on passive carriers to transport them around. A virus particle may exist free of its host cell but is incapable of replicating on its own. Viruses can replicate only after infecting a host cell. Inside the infected cell, the virus uses the synthetic capability of the host to produce progeny virus. Viruses are infectious particles with a DNA or RNA based small genome that can control the cellular mechanism of infected cells prompting the host cell to synthesize new viruses. Infections often cause mild to severe symptoms, yet some viruses do not cause any harm or not in all host organisms (called carriers).

{"Word":"Weight","Definition":"1. The force on an object due to the gravitational pull of a planet or other heavenly body. 2. In research, a number associated with a case or unit of analysis; the weight is used as a measure of the relative significance of the variables of that case when making estimates for the entire population. Weighting is a mathematical process which allows individual values in a data set to be given greater or less impact in an equation than their values alone would contribute When a probability sample is used, there is often a chance that some elements of the population are under or over represented in the sample. In order to allow more accurate estimates of a complete population, therefore, \"weights\" are assigned to each case and used to adjust the overall results to more closely conform to the total population. Thus, a weight is a mechanism of allocating confidence or strength to data point, i.e., it's a way of something how much confidence yo can place in that vale. If you don't allocate any weights to a set of data, in effect you're saying they all have equal weight (a weight say of 1) and that they are all equally reliable."}
{"Word":"Western blots","Definition":"A technique for visualization of antibodies directed against viral proteins that have been separated using some form of gel electrophoresis. A technique for analyzing mixtures of proteins to show the presence, size and abundance of one particular type of protein. Similar to Southern or Northern blotting (see \"Blotting\"), except that (1) a protein mixture is electrophoresed in an acrylamide gel, and (2) the \"probe\" is an antibody which recognizes the protein of interest, followed by a radioactive secondary probe (such as 125I-protein A). For WB analysis sufficiently separated proteins on an SDS-PAGE gel are transferred to a solid membrane using an electric current applied to the gel so that the separated proteins transfer through the gel and onto the membrane in the same pattern as they separated on the SDS-PAGE. All sites on the membrane which do not contain blotted protein from the gel can then be non-specifically \"blocked\" so that antibody (serum) will not non-specifically bind to them, causing a false positive result. Often the membrane is cut into strips to facilitate testing of a large number of samples for antibodies directed against the blotted protein (antigen). To detect the antigen blotted on the membrane, a primary antibody (serum) is added at an appropriate dilution and incubated with the membrane. If there are any antibodies present which are directed against one or more of the blotted antigens, those antibodies will bind to the protein(s) while other antibodies will be washed away at the end of the incubation. In order to detect the antibodies which have bound, anti-immunoglobulin antibodies coupled to a reporter group such as the enzyme alkaline phosphatase are added (e.g. goat anti-human IgG- alkaline phosphatase). This anti-Ig-enzyme is commonly called a \"second antibody\" or \"conjugate\". Finally after excess second antibody is washed free of the blot, a substrate is added which will precipitate upon reaction with the conjugate resulting in a visible band where the primary antibody bound to the protein. (see Electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis)"}
{"Word":"White Noise","Definition":"A signal made up by mixing waves of all frequencies, with equal energy at all frequencies. (In practise this may often mean all frequencies in the audible range or all frequencies in the visible range). The \"White\" part of the word comes from white light. A white light is a light consisting of electromagnetic waves of all frequencies. White noise is a signal consisting of waves of all frequencies with equal energy at all frequencies; thus a plot of the energy distribution across the frequency spectrum is a flat line (i.e., its power density is constant over the finite frequency range). It is therefore a form of signal of \"no statistical structure\" that can be easily implemented in labs, making it a widely used stimulus in neurophysiology. Physiologists sometimes put different weights on different frequencies so that the signal is no longer pure white noise (equal energy at all frequencies). This type of signal is called coloured noise (see Noise signals)."}

It is one of the most abundant DNA-binding motifs. Proteins may contain more than one finger in a single chain; each motif consists of 2 antiparallel beta-strands followed by by an alpha-helix. A single zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by conserved histidine and cysteine residues, stabilising the motif. Four Cys residues are found for each \"finger\" and one finger can bind a molecule of zinc. A typical configuration is: CysXxxXxxCys--(intervening 12 or so aa's) CysXxxXxxCys. Fingers bind to 3 base-pair subsites and specific contacts are mediated by amino acids in positions -1, 2, 3 and 6 relative to the start of the alpha-helix. Contacts mainly involve one strand of the DNA. Where proteins contain multiple fingers, each finger binds to adjacent subsites within a larger DNA recognition site thus allowing a relatively simple motif to specifically bind to a wide range of DNA sequences."}

{"Word":"Zymogens","Definition":"The enzymatically inactive precursors of certain proteolytic enzymes. The enzymes are inactive because they contain an extra piece of peptide chain. When this peptide is hydrolyzed (clipped away) by another proteolytic enzyme the zymogen is converted into the normal, active enzyme. The biochemical change usually occurs in a lysosome where a specific part of the precursor enzyme is cleaved in order to activate it. The amino acid chain that is released upon activation is called the activation peptide.The reason for the existence of zymogens may be to protect the cell, its machinery, and\/or the place of manufacture within the cell from the potentially harmful or lethal effects of an active, proteolytic enzyme. In other words, the strategy is to activate the enzyme only when and especially where it is needed Zymogens are sometimes referred to as proenzymes."}
