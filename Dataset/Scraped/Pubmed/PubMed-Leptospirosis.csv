37674827,"""We don't really do doctors."" messages from people diagnosed with occupational leptospirosis for medical professionals on infection, hospitalisation, and long-term effects.","Leptospirosis is largely an occupational disease for people working with livestock in Aotearoa New Zealand. Introduction of livestock vaccination and use of personal protective equipment has been associated with a reduction in the incidence. However, the incidence of occupational leptospirosis remains high, with significant burdens for affected families and healthcare system. For this article, a subset of thirteen participants from a nationwide leptospirosis case-control study (2019-2021) who were diagnosed with leptospirosis and worked with livestock at the time of illness were invited and agreed to a semi-structured interview. Interviewees reflected on their experiences as messages for medical professionals. The analysis of transcripts reveals widely shared experiences with infection, hospitalisation, and treatment, as well as long-term effects and recovery. Conclusions for medical professionals include that ill workers continue to have their diagnosis of leptospirosis delayed. This delay may contribute to more than half the people ill with leptospirosis hospitalised. Further, medical professionals' communication and relationship with ill people strongly colours the latter's experience, for good or for bad. Moreover, most interviewees experienced a recovery process that took several months of feeling tired, which undermined professional performance and emotional wellbeing.","['Prinsen G', 'Baker M', 'Benschop J', 'Collins-Emerson J', 'Douwes J', 'Fayaz A', 'Littlejohn S', 'Nisa S', 'Quin T', 'Yeung P']",2023,9,9,Heliyon,"Prinsen G, et al.

37672535,A cross-sectional investigation of Leptospira at the wildlife-livestock interface in New Zealand.,"There has been a recent upsurge in human cases of leptospirosis in New Zealand, with wildlife a suspected emerging source, but up-to-date knowledge on this topic is lacking. We conducted a cross-sectional study in two farm environments to estimate Leptospira seroprevalence in wildlife and sympatric livestock, PCR/culture prevalence in wildlife, and compare seroprevalence and prevalence between species, sex, and age groups. Traps targeting house mice (Mus musculus), black rats (Rattus rattus), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) were set for 10 trap-nights in March-April 2017 on a dairy (A) and a beef and sheep (B) farm. Trapped wild animals and an age-stratified random sample of domestic animals, namely cattle, sheep and working dogs were blood sampled. Sera were tested by microagglutination test for five serogroups and titres compared using a Proportional Similarity Index (PSI). Wildlife kidneys were sampled for culture and qPCR targeting the lipL32 gene. True prevalence in mice was assessed using occupancy modelling by collating different laboratory results. Infection profiles varied by species, age group and farm. At the MAT cut-point of ≥ 48, up to 78% of wildlife species, and 16-99% of domestic animals were seropositive. Five of nine hedgehogs, 23/105 mice and 1/14 black rat reacted to L. borgpetersenii sv Ballum. The sera of 4/18 possums and 4/9 hedgehogs reacted to L. borgpetersenii sv Hardjobovis whilst 1/18 possum and 1/9 hedgehog reacted to Tarassovi. In ruminants, seroprevalence for Hardjobovis and Pomona ranged 0-90% and 0-71% depending on the species and age group. Titres against Ballum, Tarassovi and Copenhageni were also observed in 4-20%, 0-25% and 0-21% of domestic species, respectively. The PSI indicated rodents and livestock had the most dissimilar serological responses. Three of nine hedgehogs, 31/105 mice and 2/14 rats were carrying leptospires (PCR and/or culture positive). True prevalence estimated by occupancy modelling in mice was 38% [95% Credible Interval 26, 51%] on Farm A and 22% [11, 40%] on Farm B. In the same environment, exposure to serovars found in wildlife species was commonly detected in livestock. Transmission pathways between and within species should be assessed to help in the development of efficient mitigation strategies against Leptospira.","['Moinet M', 'Oosterhof H', 'Nisa S', 'Haack N', 'Wilkinson DA', 'Aberdein D', 'Russell JC', 'Vallée E', 'Collins-Emerson J', 'Heuer C', 'Benschop J']",2023,17,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Moinet M, et al.

37658075,Pathogenic Leptospira are widespread in the urban wildlife of southern California.,"Leptospirosis, the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world, is broadly understudied in multi-host wildlife systems. Knowledge gaps regarding Leptospira circulation in wildlife, particularly in densely populated areas, contribute to frequent misdiagnoses in humans and domestic animals. We assessed Leptospira prevalence levels and risk factors in five target wildlife species across the greater Los Angeles region: striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), coyotes (Canis latrans), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and fox squirrels (Sciurus niger). We sampled more than 960 individual animals, including over 700 from target species in the greater Los Angeles region, and an additional 266 sampled opportunistically from other California regions and species. In the five target species seroprevalences ranged from 5 to 60%, and infection prevalences ranged from 0.8 to 15.2% in all except fox squirrels (0%). Leptospira phylogenomics and patterns of serologic reactivity suggest that mainland terrestrial wildlife, particularly mesocarnivores, could be the source of repeated observed introductions of Leptospira into local marine and island ecosystems. Overall, we found evidence of widespread Leptospira exposure in wildlife across Los Angeles and surrounding regions. This indicates exposure risk for humans and domestic animals and highlights that this pathogen can circulate endemically in many wildlife species even in densely populated urban areas.","['Helman SK', 'Tokuyama AFN', 'Mummah RO', 'Stone NE', 'Gamble MW', 'Snedden CE', 'Borremans B', 'Gomez ACR', 'Cox C', 'Nussbaum J', 'Tweedt I', 'Haake DA', 'Galloway RL', 'Monzón J', 'Riley SPD', 'Sikich JA', 'Brown J', 'Friscia A', 'Sahl JW', 'Wagner DM', 'Lynch JW', 'Prager KC', 'Lloyd-Smith JO']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Helman SK, et al.

37650399,Current status of infectious diseases among migrants and non-citizens in Malaysia.,"The mass movement of migrants to Malaysia for employment is one of the factors contributing to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases in this country. Despite mandatory health screening for migrants seeking employment, prevalence records of infectious diseases amongst migrant populations in Malaysia are still within negligible proportions. Therefore, the present review highlights the incidence, mortality and overall status of infectious diseases amongst migrants' populations in Malaysia, which maybe be useful for impeding exacerbation of inequalities among them and improving our national health system thru robust and effective emergency responses in controlling the prevalent diseases found among these populations and maybe, Malaysian citizens too. Peer-reviewed articles from January 2016 to December 2020 were searched through online platform including SCOPUS, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Non-peer-reviewed reports and publications from ministry and government websites including data from related agencies were also scoured from in order to ensure that there are no cases being overlooked, as most published articles did not have migrants as the research subjects. A total of 29 studies had been selected in the final analysis. Migrants in Malaysia were at higher risk for tuberculosis, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, cholera, leprosy and leptospirosis. Lymphatic filariasis was still endemic among this population while thousand cases of TB and cholera had been reported among them due to cramp living conditions and poor sanitation in their settlements respectively. While malaria had gradually decreased and become sporadic, the influx of migrant workers had led to the rising of imported malaria cases. Low cases of leprosy had been recorded in Malaysia but a significant proportion of it was contributed by migrant workers. As for leptospirosis, studies found that there are prominent cases among migrant workers, which particularly highest within workers with lower educational attainment. Infectious diseases are still prevalent among migrants in Malaysia due to various interplay factors including their working sectors, country of origin, immunization status, type of settlement, impoverished living conditions, and language and cultural barriers that impeding access to health facilities.","['Mohd Putera NWS', 'Azman AS', 'Mohd Zain SN', 'Yahaya H', 'Lewis JW', 'Sahimin N']",2023,40,2,Trop Biomed,"Mohd Putera NWS, et al.

37624847,The combination of RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a and Leptospira IgM RDT enhances the early detection of leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Lack of available sensitive point-of-care testing is one of the primary obstacles to the rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis. The purpose of this study was to test the performance of two point-of-care tests, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 12a (CRISPR/Cas12a) fluorescence-based diagnostic assay (FBDA), a Leptospira immunoglobulin M (IgM) rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and the two tests combined.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For the diagnosis of 171 clinical samples, a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-CRISPR/Cas12a FBDA for whole blood and Leptospira IgM RDT (Medical Science Public Health, Thailand) for serum were used. The confirmed cases were determined by using any positive qPCR, microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and culture results. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed on the first day of enrollment and stratified by the day after symptom onset. The overall sensitivity of the Leptospira IgM RDT and RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a FBDA was 55.66% and 60.38%, respectively. When the two tests were combined, the sensitivity rose to 84.91%. The specificity of each test was 63.08% and 100%, respectively, and 63.08% when combined. The sensitivity of the Leptospira IgM RDT rose on days 4-6 after the onset of fever, while the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a FBDA continued to decrease. When the two tests were combined, the sensitivity was over 80% at different days post-onset of fever.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of Leptospira IgM RDT and RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 FBDA exhibited significant sensitivity for the detection of leptospires at various days after the onset of fever, thereby reducing the likelihood of misdiagnosis. The combination of these assays may be suitable for early leptospirosis screening in situations with limited resources.","['Jirawannaporn S', 'Limothai U', 'Tachaboon S', 'Dinhuzen J', 'Kiatamornrak P', 'Chaisuriyong W', 'Srisawat N']",2023,17,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Jirawannaporn S, et al.

37616329,"Global, regional, and country-level cost of leptospirosis due to loss of productivity in humans.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a prevalent zoonotic disease with One Health priority and a disease of poverty, lacks global economic burden estimates. This study aims to determine the global, regional, and country-level cost of leptospirosis due to loss of productivity.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cost of leptospirosis due to loss of productivity (referred to as productivity cost hereafter) was estimated by converting the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to leptospirosis to a monetary value using the per capita gross domestic product (GDP). The country-specific DALYs lost were obtained from the global burden of leptospirosis study published previously. Non-health GDP per capita (GDP- per capita health expenditure) was used for the cost conversion of DALYs. Country-specific GDP and health expenditure data were obtained from the World Bank data repositories. Estimates were done using both nominal and international dollars. The estimated global productivity cost of leptospirosis in 2019 was Int$ 29.3 billion, with low and high estimates ranging from Int$ 11.6 billion to 52.3 billion. China (Int$ 4.8 billion), India (Int$ 4.6 billion), Indonesia (Int$ 2.8 billion), Sri Lanka (Int$ 2.1 billion), and the United States (Int$ 1.3 billion) had the highest productivity cost due to leptospirosis. Eight out of 10 countries with the highest burden were in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, lower-middle-income countries had an annual productivity cost of Int$ 13.8 billion, indicating that the disease is poverty-related.
CONCLUSION: Although significant, the cost estimate due to loss of productivity is merely a fraction of the overall economic burden of this disease, which also includes other direct, indirect, and intangible costs. The existing partial estimates of the different components of economic cost suggest a profound economic burden that demands the inclusion of leptospirosis in the global health agenda for comprehensive disease control and prevention efforts, including vaccine development.","['Agampodi S', 'Gunarathna S', 'Lee JS', 'Excler JL']",2023,17,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Agampodi S, et al.

37591900,"Aptamer-based assay for rapid detection, surveillance, and screening of pathogenic Leptospira in water samples.","Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal waterborne infection caused by Leptospira interrogans, impacting both humans and animals in tropical regions. However, current diagnostic methods for detecting pathogenic Leptospira have sensitivity, cost, and time limitations. Therefore, there is a critical need for a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective detection method. This study presents the development of an aptamer-based assay for pathogenic Leptospira detection. Aptamers targeting Leptospira were generated using the SELEX method and screened for binding affinity with major Leptospiral outer membrane proteins through in silico analysis. The aptamer with the highest binding affinity was selected for further evaluation. To enable visual detection, the aptamer was conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), resulting in a colorimetric response in the presence of L. interrogans. The aptamer-AuNP-based colorimetric assay exhibited a detection limit of 57 CFU/mL and demonstrated high specificity and reproducibility in detecting pathogenic Leptospira in water samples. This aptamer-based assay represents a significant advancement in leptospirosis diagnostics, offering a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective approach for detecting pathogenic Leptospira. Its potential for epidemiological applications, such as outbreak source identification and improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, particularly in resource-limited settings, highlights its importance in addressing the challenges associated with leptospirosis.","['Vishwakarma A', 'Meganathan Y', 'Ramya M']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Vishwakarma A, et al.

37540477,Optimization and comparative analysis of LAMP and PCR techniques for the detection of leptospiral DNA in Golden Syrian hamsters.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with significant public health and economic impact worldwide. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective prevention and treatment. This study optimized a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay using BFo isothermal DNA polymerase with different colorimetric indicators. LAMP was able to detect DNA from pathogenic and intermediate leptospires, while non-pathogenic leptospires and other non-leptospiral microorganisms were negative. LAMP assay combined with calcein showed a tenfold higher limit of detection (1 ng of leptospiral DNA per reaction) than LAMP combined with hydroxynaphthol blue or end-point PCR lipL32 (10 ng of DNA per reaction). Animal samples were collected from infected and non-infected Golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) to evaluate and compare the performance of LAMP and PCR. These techniques showed a substantial agreement according to Cohen's kappa statistic, being both useful techniques for detecting leptospiral DNA in clinical samples. Overall, this study demonstrates that the LAMP assay is a sensitive, specific, rapid, and simple tool for the detection of leptospiral DNA.

The aim of the present study is to genetically analyze antigens of Leptospira spp. from Sejroe serogroup strains isolated from cattle for a preliminary evaluation of vaccine candidates. Genes associated with antigenicity-LigA, LipL32, Loa22, and OmpL1-were analyzed through bioinformatic and immunoinformatic tools. Despite high diversity observed in strains, on an amino acid level, highly conserved regions were observed (> 90%), particularly in LipL32 gene. Moreover, highly conserved amino acid regions (> 30 aa) were observed in all genes, regardless of species, geographical origin or biological source of isolation. Superposed structures of protein fragments including all the predicted MHC-II and B-Cell epitopes were demonstrated. Results presented herein are preliminary, but a fundamental step towards the development of an efficient vaccine against bovine leptospirosis, a silent but enormously concerning disease.","['Di Azevedo MIN', 'Borges ALDSB', 'Kremer F', 'de Melo JDSL', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2023,80,9,Curr Microbiol,"Di Azevedo MIN, et al.

37530277,"Leptospiral uveitis- ""Transition 'from epidemic to endemic form"" difficulties in laboratory confirmations.","PURPOSE: Leptospirosis is a waterborne zoonotic disease that primarily causes systemic illness, followed by uveitis. After heavy flooding in Madurai district, an epidemic outbreak of systemic and ocular leptospirosis occurred in 1994. Our data shows a transition to endemicity after each epidemic.
AIM: The aim of this study is to report the clinical signs, epidemic outbreaks, and persistent endemicity of leptospiral uveitis, as well as the diagnostic dilemmas associated with it.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical signs was conducted using medical records of leptospiral uveitis patients over a period of 27 years (1994-2020) in a tertiary care eye hospital. The clinical workup of uveitis included a detailed clinical history, systemic, and ophthalmic examination. Microagglutination tests (MATs) was done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta and later in our regional laboratory. Serum samples were collected from human systemic leptospirosis cases and a small group of animals in and around Madurai.
RESULTS: The first epidemic outbreak resulted in 200 seropositive patients. Subsequent epidemic outbreaks occurred in 1997, 1998, 2001, 2005, and 2012, with Madurai experiencing multiple outbreaks. However, the disease remained endemic, with 25-50 patients being observed per year in between the peaks. Ocular examination revealed acute non-granulomatous uveitis (94.9%), pan uveitis (59.8%), vitreous inflammatory reaction (55.4%), retinal vasculitis (29.5%), disc hyperemia (20.9%), and hypopyon. (16.2%). New serovars emerged every year, resulting in decreased sensitivity of the MAT. Over time, the MAT started to miss diagnoses.
CONCLUSION: The persistent endemicity of leptospiral uveitis emphasizes the need for accessible diagnostic tests. The low performance of the MAT can be attributable to the use of an older panel. The incorporation of new isolates in the MAT by a national laboratory will improve the accuracy of diagnosis.","['Rathinam SR', 'Kohila GJ', 'Gowri PC', 'Balagiri KS']",2023,71,8,Indian J Ophthalmol,"Rathinam SR, et al.

37525220,Urine shedding patterns of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in dairy cows.,"Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are zoonotic bacteria that infect wild and domestic animals. Humans contract leptospirosis directly through contact with infected animals or indirectly from contaminated water or soil. In mammalian reservoirs, the pathogen can colonize renal tubules for lengthy periods and persistently contaminate the environment through urine. Cattle have been reported to shed several serovars; with Hardjo the most common serovar found in cattle. Without clinical manifestations, the infection can spread within a herd, impairing productivity, and putting workers like farmers, abattoir operators and veterinarians at risk. The dynamics of pathogenic Leptospira shedding was studied in six dairy herds in southern Chile. Various intermittent urine shedding patterns were found, with elimination periods between 79 and 259 days and bacterial loads ranging from 3 × 10","['Monti G', 'Montes V', 'Tortosa P', 'Tejeda C', 'Salgado M']",2023,54,1,Vet Res,"Monti G, et al.

The clinical presentations of leptospirosis range from an influenza-like presentation of fever and myalgia, to severe forms. Leptospirosis can potentially lead to a misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis when clinical similarities exist.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old man presented with fever, shock and thrombocytopenia followed by diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. Peripheral blood Metagenomic Next-generation Sequencing (mNGS) reported Leptospira interrogans. The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) plus doxycycline and improved dramatically after 7 days.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that leptospirosis can potentially lead to a misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. Correctly evaluation of thrombocytopenia in acute febrile illnesses facilitates the differential diagnosis of leptospirosis. mNGS can accurately detect Leptospira DNA during the early stage of the infection.","['Dai J', 'Yao C', 'Ling H', 'Li B', 'Chen R', 'Shi F']",2023,23,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Dai J, et al.

This study was a cross-sectional study examining the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among Thai blood donors. A total of 1053 serum specimens collected from blood donors residing in 5 regions of Thailand during March to September 2020 were included in this study. All samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to 22 leptospiral serovars using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and anti-Leptospira IgG antibodies using commercially available enzyme immunoassay. We found no evidence of recent exposure to Leptospira spp. in sera of healthy Thai blood donors by MAT, including those in higher-risk areas. However, in this same group, we did find small numbers of past exposure (1.7%) to Leptospira spp. by IgG ELISA. According to the findings of this study, there is currently no evidence for implementing new blood banking procedures to identify possible carriers in Thailand, however these should be continually monitored and revised according to the infectious disease burden in each country.

37486929,"MPL36, a major plasminogen (PLG) receptor in pathogenic Leptospira, has an essential role during infection.","Leptospirosis, a zoonosis with worldwide distribution, is caused by pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. Bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMPs), particularly those with surface-exposed regions, play crucial roles in pathogen dissemination and virulence mechanisms. Here we characterized the leptospiral Membrane Protein L36 (MPL36), a rare lipoprotein A (RlpA) homolog with a C-terminal Sporulation related (SPOR) domain, as an important virulence factor in pathogenic Leptospira. Our results confirmed that MPL36 is surface exposed and expressed during infection. Using recombinant MPL36 (rMPL36) we also confirmed previous findings of its high plasminogen (PLG)-binding ability determined by lysine residues of the C-terminal region of the protein, with ability to convert bound-PLG to active plasmin. Using Koch's molecular postulates, we determined that a mutant of mpl36 has a reduced PLG-binding ability, leading to a decreased capacity to adhere and translocate MDCK cell monolayers. Using recombinant protein and mutant strains, we determined that the MPL36-bound plasmin (PLA) can degrade fibrinogen. Finally, our mpl36 mutant had a significant attenuated phenotype in the hamster model for acute leptospirosis. Our data indicates that MPL36 is the major PLG binding protein in pathogenic Leptospira, and crucial to the pathogen's ability to attach and interact with host tissues during infection. The MPL36 characterization contributes to the expanding field of bacterial pathogens that explore PLG for their virulence, advancing the goal to close the knowledge gap regarding leptospiral pathogenesis while offering a novel potential candidate to improve diagnostic and prevention of this important zoonotic neglected disease.","['Zhu W', 'Passalia FJ', 'Hamond C', 'Abe CM', 'Ko AI', 'Barbosa AS', 'Wunder EA']",2023,19,7,PLoS Pathog,"Zhu W, et al.

37422175,Protective role of stratum corneum in percutaneous Leptospira infection in a hamster model.,"Leptospira enters humans and animals through injured skin or mucous membranes by direct or indirect contact with urine excreted from infected reservoirs. Individuals with cut or scratched skin are at high risk of infection and are recommended to be protected from contact with Leptospira, but the risk of infection via skin without apparent wounds is unknown. We hypothesized that the stratum corneum of the epidermis might prevent percutaneous invasion of leptospires. We established a stratum corneum deficient model of hamsters using the tape stripping method. The mortality rate of hamsters lacking stratum corneum that were exposed to Leptospira was higher than that of controls with shaved skin, and was not significantly different from an epidermal wound group. These results indicated that the stratum corneum plays a critical role in protecting the host against leptospiral entry. We also examined the migration of leptospires through the monolayer of HaCaT cells (human keratinocyte cell line) using Transwell. The number of pathogenic leptospires penetrating the HaCaT cell monolayers was higher than that of non-pathogenic leptospires. Furthermore, scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations revealed that the bacteria penetrated the cell monolayers through both intracellular and intercellular routes. This suggested that pathogenic Leptospira can migrate easily through keratinocyte layers and is associated with virulence. Our study further highlights the importance of the stratum corneum as a critical barrier against the invasion of Leptospira found in contaminated soil and water. Hence, preventative measures against contact infection should be taken, even without visible skin wounds.","['Asoh T', 'Miyahara S', 'Villanueva SYAM', 'Kanemaru T', 'Takigawa T', 'Mori H', 'Gloriani NG', 'Yoshida SI', 'Saito M']",2023,182,,Microb Pathog,"Asoh T, et al.

This study aimed to assess the distribution of cases and deaths from leptospirosis and its association with social vulnerability in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, between 2010 and 2019.
METHODS: The lethality rates and incidence of leptospirosis and their association with gender, age, education, and skin color were analyzed using chi-square tests. The spatial relationship between the environmental determinants, social vulnerability, and the incidence rate of leptospirosis in the different municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul was analyzed through spatial regression analysis.
RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 4,760 cases of leptospirosis, along with 238 deaths, were confirmed. The mean incidence rate was 4.06 cases/100,000 inhabitants, while the mean fatality rate was 5%. Although the entire population was susceptible, white-colored individuals, males, people of the working-age group, along with less-educated individuals, were more affected by the disease. Lethality was higher in people with dark skin, and the prime risk factor associated with death was the direct contact of the patients with rodents, sewage, and garbage. The social vulnerability was positively associated with the incidence of leptospirosis in the Rio Grande do Sul, especially in municipalities located in the center of the state.
CONCLUSIONS: It is evident that the incidence of the disease is significantly related to the vulnerability of the population. The use of the health vulnerability index showed great relevance in the evaluation of leptospirosis cases and can be used further as a tool to help municipalities identify disease-prone areas for intervention and resource allocation.","['Teles AJ', 'Bohm BC', 'Silva SCM', 'Bruhn FRP']",2023,23,1,BMC Public Health,"Teles AJ, et al.

Non-confirmed AFI cases (n = 176) from a prospective cohort study of whom paired serum samples (acute (T1), midterm (T2), or convalescent (T3)) were available were screened using MT serology. IgG against R. typhi was detected in the T2 or T3 samples using an in-house ELISA. Positive IgG samples were further screened for the presence of IgM. If both IgM and IgG were positive, the endpoint titer of T1, T2, or T3 was determined. In cases with a fourfold increase in titer, real-time PCR of T1 samples was performed to detect R. typhi DNA. In total, 71/176 (40.3%) patients tested positive for IgG antibody, and 26 AFI cases were confirmed as MT (23 cases by PCR, 3 cases by fourfold titer increased IgG or IgM titer). The most common clinical symptoms in the confirmed cases were headache (80%), arthralgia (73%), malaise (69%), and myalgia (54%). In these cases, the presumptive clinical diagnoses were typhoid fever (43.2%), dengue (38.5%), and leptospirosis (19.2%).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiological situation of the prevalence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in donkeys and mules from the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Blood serum samples were collected from 180 animals (109 donkeys and 71 mules) in two rural properties from the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and then submitted to a microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Urea and creatinine values were also quantified. Epidemiological variables such as age, breeding system, contact with other animal species, source of water and food, vaccination against leptospirosis, presence of reproductive alterations, and rodent control were also investigated. From 180 samples collected, 39 (21.67%) showed positive results in the MAT, at a dilution ≥ 1:100. Some animals were reactive for more than one serovar. The serovar Tarassovi was the most frequent (14.07%), followed by Hardjo (11.85%) and Wolffi (11.11%). There was a statistically significant difference between animals from 0 to 3 years of age reactive in the MAT in comparison to the other age groups. Most of the animals had urea and creatinine concentrations within the acceptable reference limit; however, there was a significant increase in creatinine levels in some of the test animals. The studied properties showed differences in some epidemiological aspects such as vaccination of the animals, presence of reproductive problems in the herd, and rodent control. Such aspects pointed as risk factors that may influence the frequency of positive serological results in property 1. The present study demonstrated that the prevalence of leptospirosis in donkeys and mules is high and several serovars are being maintained by these animals, representing a potential public health risk.","['Pires BC', 'Dos Santos JBF', 'de Almeida Ferreira Dos Santos JP', 'Silva DM', 'Dos Reis TFM', 'Cuccato LP', 'Ciuffa AZ', 'Rezende LM', 'Ribeiro RAC', 'Lima AMC']",2023,55,4,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Pires BC, et al.

Brazil has the highest number of reported cases of leptospirosis in the Americas (approximately 4,000 annual cases). The purpose of this study is to identify the occupational groups with a higher risk of leptospirosis in Brazil from 2010 through 2015 among suspected cases reported to the national surveillance system. Confirmed and unconfirmed cases of leptospirosis with laboratory diagnosis, 20,193 and 59,034 respectively, were classified into 12 occupational groups. Confirmed cases were predominantly male (79.4%), between 25 and 59 years of age (68.3%), white (53.4%), illiterate or with incomplete primary education (51.1%), and participating in agricultural work (19.9%). After controlling for age, sex, race, and area of residency, the multivariate analysis identified that between confirmed and unconfirmed cases of leptospirosis reported to the Brazilian national surveillance system, five occupational groups are at higher risk for leptospirosis: garbage and recycling collectors (odds ratio [OR] = 4.10; 95% CI = 3.36-4.99); agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.49-1.84); prisoners (OR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.04-2.35); building workers (OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.22-1.51); cleaners and mining workers (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.07-1.45).

37363250,"Characteristics of leptospirosis cases, prevention and control managements 1955-2020, Guangzhou, China.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, which is an easily overlooked zoonotic disease, was once widespread in Guangzhou, China. However, due to the implementation of control measures, the number of cases is decreasing. Based on the characteristics of leptospirosis cases in Guangzhou, China, between 1955 and 2020, we describe the changes and achievements in prevention and control management strategies over that period.
METHODS: The development of the leptospirosis control system in Guangzhou occurred over three periods: Period I: 1955-1978; Period II: 1979-2000; and Period III: 2001-2020. Data about leptospirosis cases were obtained from the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and national health departments. The demographic characteristics of leptospirosis patients were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: During Period I, only the Guangzhou CDC and medical institutions at every level participated in the leptospirosis control system. During Period II, additional types of organizations, including local CDCs, countryside committees, community committees, and the Patriotic Health Movement Commission, were involved in the control system. Additionally, strong links were established between different organizations. After entering Period III, an increasing number of departments joined the cooperation, and the management of human patients was expanded to include the management of host animals, and thus, the prevalence of leptospirosis was monitored and controlled in various ways. The leptospirosis control system in Guangzhou has been further improved. From 1955 to 2020, a total of 2501 leptospirosis cases were recorded in Guangzhou, and the number of cases decreased significantly over time, from 1608 (Period I) to 744 (Period II) and then to 149 (Period III).
CONCLUSION: The improvements of the leptospirosis control system in Guangzhou that occurred over decades were associated with a marked decrease in the number of leptospirosis cases. Guangzhou's experience can provide guidance for other countries or cities around the world facing similar challenges.","['Zeng Z', 'Chen H', 'Xu J', 'Zhang H', 'Xu C', 'Fan L', 'Chen S', 'Chen K', 'Yang Z', 'Wei Y']",2023,16,,One Health,"Zeng Z, et al.

37332883,One Health at gunpoint: Impact of wild boars as exotic species in Brazil - A review.,"Wild boars have been listed among the 100 most invasive species worldwide, spreading impacts to all continents, with the exception of Antarctica. In Brazil, a major source of introduction was a commercial livestock importation for exotic meat market, followed by successive escapes and releases to natural ecosystems. Currently found in all six Brazilian biomes, with reports in 11 Brazilian states, wild boars have invaded natural and agricultural areas. Wild boars have been reportedly indicated as hosts and reservoirs of several zoonotic diseases in Brazil, including toxoplasmosis, salmonelosis, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis, trichinellosis, and hepatitis E. Wild boars have been also associated with Brazilian spotted fever and rabies, infected while providing plentiful exotic blood supply for native ticks and hematophagous bats. Due to their phylogenetic proximity, wild boars may present ecological niche overlapping and direct disease risk to native white-lipped and collared peccaries. Moreover, wild boars may post an economical threat to Brazilian livestock industry due to restrictive diseases such as Aujeszky, enzootic pneumonia, neosporosis, hemoplasmosis, and classic swine fever. Finally, wild boars have directly impacted in environmentally protected areas, silting up water springs, rooting and wallowing native plants, decreasing native vegetal coverage, disbalancing of soil components, altering soil structure and composition. Wild boar hunting has failed as a control measure to date, according to the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, due to private hunting groups mostly targeting males, intentionally leaving females and piglets alive, disseminating wild boar populations nationwide. Meanwhile, non-government animal welfare organizations have pointed to animal cruelty of hunting dogs and wild boars (and native species) during hunting. Despite unanimous necessity of wild boar control, eradication and prevention, methods have been controversial and should focus on effective governmental measures instead occasional game hunting, which has negatively impacted native wildlife species while wild boars have continuously spread throughout Brazil.","['Kmetiuk LB', 'Biondo LM', 'Pedrosa F', 'Favero GM', 'Biondo AW']",2023,17,,One Health,"Kmetiuk LB, et al.

We present a case of a 24-year-old woman in her second pregnancy who arrived at the hospital at 36 weeks gestation in active labor. The patient had received regular antenatal care including routine prenatal check-ups, screenings, and appropriate vaccinations. She complained of abdominal pain for 5-6 hours, sudden onset of hematuria, and a history of low-grade fever for two days. Physical examination revealed paleness, grade three pedal edema, and elevated blood pressure. Diagnostic tests showed mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, elevated liver enzymes, and kidney dysfunction. The patient was admitted to the labor ward, and a tentative diagnosis of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome was made. Shortly after arrival, she spontaneously delivered a healthy baby. However, post-delivery, her fever profile indicated the presence of leptospira IgM antibodies, leading to a diagnosis of leptospirosis mimicking HELLP syndrome. Immediate medical treatment resulted in symptom resolution within two weeks and normal biochemical values within a month. Leptospirosis, caused by the gram-negative spirochete bacteria leptospira, is a zoonotic infection rarely observed during pregnancy and can be misdiagnosed due to its atypical presentation. It can mimic other pregnancy-related conditions such as viral hepatitis, obstetric cholestasis, HELLP syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Early detection and treatment are crucial as this disease can have serious consequences for both the mother and fetus.

37328808,Investigating the etiology of acute febrile illness: a prospective clinic-based study in Uganda.,"BACKGROUND: Historically, malaria has been the predominant cause of acute febrile illness (AFI) in sub-Saharan Africa. However, during the last two decades, malaria incidence has declined due to concerted public health control efforts, including the widespread use of rapid diagnostic tests leading to increased recognition of non-malarial AFI etiologies. Our understanding of non-malarial AFI is limited due to lack of laboratory diagnostic capacity. We aimed to determine the etiology of AFI in three distinct regions of Uganda.
METHODS: A prospective clinic-based study that enrolled participants from April 2011 to January 2013 using standard diagnostic tests. Participant recruitment was from St. Paul's Health Centre (HC) IV, Ndejje HC IV, and Adumi HC IV in the western, central and northern regions, which differ by climate, environment, and population density. A Pearson's chi-square test was used to evaluate categorical variables, while a two-sample t-test and Krukalis-Wallis test were used for continuous variables.
RESULTS: Of the 1281 participants, 450 (35.1%), 382 (29.8%), and 449 (35.1%) were recruited from the western, central, and northern regions, respectively. The median age (range) was 18 (2-93) years; 717 (56%) of the participants were female. At least one AFI pathogen was identified in 1054 (82.3%) participants; one or more non-malarial AFI pathogens were identified in 894 (69.8%) participants. The non-malarial AFI pathogens identified were chikungunya virus, 716 (55.9%); Spotted Fever Group rickettsia (SFGR), 336 (26.2%) and Typhus Group rickettsia (TGR), 97 (7.6%); typhoid fever (TF), 74 (5.8%); West Nile virus, 7 (0.5%); dengue virus, 10 (0.8%) and leptospirosis, 2 (0.2%) cases. No cases of brucellosis were identified. Malaria was diagnosed either concurrently or alone in 404 (31.5%) and 160 (12.5%) participants, respectively. In 227 (17.7%) participants, no cause of infection was identified. There were statistically significant differences in the occurrence and distribution of TF, TGR and SFGR, with TF and TGR observed more frequently in the western region (p = 0.001; p < 0.001) while SFGR in the northern region (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Malaria, arboviral infections, and rickettsioses are major causes of AFI in Uganda.

Environmental, occupational, and sociocultural practices which vary from region to region favors the disease transmission in addition to lacunas in prompt diagnosis and treatment of cases. There are limited data on the seroprevalence of this neglected tropical disease in India. To assess the risk factors associated with Lepospirosis disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A population-based case control study was conducted in Kodagu district of southern India from January 2022 to March 2022. Of the 74 confirmed cases during the year 2021, 70 cases and 140 age group and gender-matched controls participated in the study. Data were collected by using semi-structured questionnaire containing details of sociodemographic, occupational, and environmental factors. The collected data were coded and exported to STATA (16.1) and analyzed by univariate and multivaiariate logistic regression to identify significant risk factors.
RESULTS: Environmental factors such as flooding or collection of water near the house (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 4.9, confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-17.0), proximity to an open sewer (aOR = 4.9, CI: 1.2-19.1) and occupational factors such as presence of skin cuts or abrasion during work (aOR = 4, CI: 1.4-11.6), direct contact with mud or water during work (aOR = 9.7, CI: 3.3-27.7), animal farming (aOR = 3.4, CI: 1.0-11.6), presence of rodents in the house (aOR = 4, CI: 1.2-12.6), and presence of rodent habitats like grain storage area (aOR = 3.5, CI: 1.1-11.0) were significantly associated with leptospirosis.

37301334,Complete genome sequences of twelve strains of Leptospira interrogans isolated from humans in Sri Lanka.,"Leptospirosis, a major zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. is recognized globally as an emerging zoonotic disease. Whole-genome sequencing reveals hidden messages about Leptospira's pathogenesis. We used Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing to obtain complete genome sequences of twelve L. interrogans isolates from febrile patients from Sri Lanka for a comparative whole genome sequencing study. The sequence data generated 12 genomes with a coverage greater than X600 with sizes ranging from 4.62 Mb to 5.16 Mb, and a G + C content ranging from 35.00% to 35.42%. The total number of coding sequences predicted by the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) genome assembly platform ranged from 3845 to 4621 for the twelve strains. Leptospira serogroup with similar-sized LPS biosynthetic loci that belonged to the same clade had a close relationship in the phylogenetic analysis. Nonetheless, variations in the genes encoding sugar biosynthesis were found in the serovar determinant region (rfb locus). Type I and Type III CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems were found in all of the strains. Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny of these sequences allowed for detailed genomic strain typing. These findings may help us better understand the pathogenesis, develop a tools for early diagnosis, comparative genomic analysis and evolution of Leptospira.","['Senavirathna I', 'Jayasundara D', 'Warnasekara J', 'Matthias MA', 'Vinetz JM', 'Agampodi S']",2023,113,,Infect Genet Evol,"Senavirathna I, et al.

Due to the public health importance, control of disease in Croatia is being implemented by monitoring the seroprevalence of equine leptospirosis and it is regulated by the law. In the period from 2012 to 2022, a total of 61,724 serum samples from apparently healthy horses were admitted to the Laboratory for leptospires, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine University of Zagreb. Serum samples were tested for Leptospira spp. antibodies using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Samples were considered seropositive with a cut-off titre 1:200 for Bratislava and 1:400 for other Leptospira spp. serovars. Out of 61,724 serum samples tested, 6,665 (10.80%) were found seropositive for at least one Leptospira serovar. In the studied period, seroprevalence varied between 5.00% and 15.94%. The highest seroprevalence was found for serovar Pomona (41.98%) and serovar Grippotyphosa (31.34%), followed by Sejroe (8.03%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (7.05%) and Bratislava (6.47%). Results indicated that horses in Croatia are particularly exposed to Leptospira spp. infections. The most prevalent presumed infective serovar was Pomona increasing each year. Investigated horses were randomly selected and healthy and most seropositive horses have anamnestic titre due to previous infection. This is the first study in Europe reporting such high seropositivity for the serovar Pomona in apparently healthy horses. According to the results of the present study, the question arises of the possible evolutionary adaptation of the pathogenic serovar Pomona as dominant for horses.","['Benvin I', 'Perko VM', 'Maljković MM', 'Habuš J', 'Štritof Z', 'Hađina S', 'Perharić M', 'Zečević I', 'Cvetnić M', 'Turk N']",2023,127,,J Equine Vet Sci,"Benvin I, et al.

37275293,"Incidence and distribution of human leptospirosis in the Western Cape Province, South Africa (2010-2019): a retrospective study.","INTRODUCTION: leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis of global importance. In South Africa, the infection is an underreported public health concern, with limited information on its incidence and distribution. This study investigated the incidence of human leptospirosis in Western Cape Province (WCP) between 2010 and 2019, and compared the incidence based on seasonal and demographic factors.
METHODS: a retrospective study was conducted with data on leptospirosis diagnoses in WCP obtained from the National Health Laboratory Services. With the provincial population sizes as the denominator, incidence of leptospirosis was estimated and expressed as cases per 100,000 population. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the effect of sex, season, and year on the incidence of leptospirosis.
RESULTS: two hundred and fifty-four (254) cases of leptospirosis were reported between 2010 and 2019, with the highest number of cases being in 2015 and the annual incidence ranged between 0.15 and 0.66/100,000 population. Males had a higher incidence compared to females (0.55 vs. 0.25/ 100,000 population; incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.2, 95% CI: 1.66,3.03). The 18-44 age cohort had the highest average incidence (0.56/100,000 population), while the ≤17 age cohort had the lowest incidence (0.07/100,000 population). The 18-44 (IRR 8.0, 95% CI: 4.65,15.15) and ≥45 (IRR 7.4, 95% CI: 4.17,14.17) age cohorts were more at risk of infection compared to ≤17 age cohort.
CONCLUSION: leptospirosis is an important zoonosis in WCP disproportionately affecting males and the productive age demographic groups. These findings should enhance targeted prevention and provoke further investigation on the importance of environmental and socioeconomic factors on leptospirosis burden.","['Gizamba JM', 'Paul L', 'Dlamini SK', 'Odayar J']",2023,44,,Pan Afr Med J,"Gizamba JM, et al.

37263231,Hemoperfusion in Leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is the most common zoonosis frequently seen in the tropics and subtropics especially during the rainy season when humans wade in floods contaminated by the urine of infected rats in urban areas. Aside from direct toxicity of the leptospires, the role of an exuberant immune response to the pathogen leading to secondary organ damage has been recognized. Thus, our treatment protocol for patients with severe leptospirosis characterized by renal failure, acute liver injury, and lung hemorrhage now includes a short course of methylprednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide. In some patients, however, hemodynamic collapse and acute respiratory distress syndrome ensue, which may be due to the release of cytokines resulting from the dysregulated immune response. Blood purification in the form of hemoperfusion (HP) with neutral macroporous resin-adsorbing beads adsorbs cytokines and other inflammatory mediators leading to cardiovascular stability and stabilization of endothelial membranes. HP may be considered part of a multiorgan system therapeutic approach in diseases with reversible multiorgan failure that can lead to an improvement in patient survival.",['Danguilan RA'],2023,200,,Contrib Nephrol,Danguilan RA.

We present a detailed clinical description of a 70-year-old man with leptospirosis. This case presented without the typical prodromal period for leptospirosis, thus making diagnosis more difficult. This isolated case occurred in the Lviv region during the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine where Ukrainian citizens have been forced to hide in premises that are not properly adapted for their long-term stay, which result in conditions that can potentially lead to the emergence of many infectious diseases. This case highlights the need for heightened awareness into the symptoms of a variety of infectious diseases, including but not limited to leptospirosis.","['Zubach O', 'Pestushko I', 'Dliaboha Y', 'Semenyshyn O', 'Zinchuk A']",2023,23,7,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Zubach O, et al.

37243454,Crystal structure of Leptospira LSS_01692 reveals a dimeric structure and induces inflammatory responses through Toll-like receptor 2-dependent NF-κB and MAPK signal transduction pathways.,"Leptospirosis is a commonly overlooked zoonotic disease that occurs in tropical and subtropical regions. Recent studies have divided the Leptospira spp. into three groups based on virulence, including pathogenic, intermediate, and saprophytic species. Pathogenic species express a protein family with leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are less expressed or absent in nonpathogenic species, highlighting the importance of this protein family in leptospirosis. However, the role of LRR domain proteins in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis is still unknown and requires further investigation. In this study, the 3D structure of LSS_01692 (rLRR38) was obtained using X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 3.2 Å. The results showed that rLRR38 forms a typical horseshoe structure with 11 α-helices and 11 β-sheets and an antiparallel dimeric structure. The interactions of rLRR38 with extracellular matrix and cell surface receptors were evaluated using ELISA and single-molecule atomic force microscopy. The results showed that rLRR38 interacted with fibronectin, collagen IV, and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Incubating HK2 cells with rLRR38 induced two downstream inflammation responses (IL-6 and MCP-1) in the TLR2 signal transduction pathway. The TLR2-TLR1 complex showed the most significant upregulation effects under rLRR38 treatment. Inhibitors also significantly inhibited nuclear factor κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases signals transduction under rLRR38 stimulation. In conclusion, rLRR38 was determined to be a novel LRR domain protein in 3D structure and demonstrated as a TLR2-binding protein that induces inflammatory responses. These structural and functional studies provide a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.","['Hsu SH', 'Wu CT', 'Sun YJ', 'Chang MY', 'Li C', 'Ko YC', 'Chou LF', 'Yang CW']",2023,,,FEBS J,"Hsu SH, et al.

Immunochromatography rapid test is widely used for early diagnosis of leptospirosis, but with low sensitivity and specificity.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate Leptospira interrogans insoluble fraction as a potential antigen source for lateral flow immunochromatography.
METHODS: Insoluble fraction derived from the crude bacterial extract was obtained by serial centrifugation. The polypeptide profile was determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Immune reactivity of this fraction was assessed by Western Blotting and lateral flow immunochromatography (LFI). It was tested 160 microagglutination test (MAT)-positive sera from patients in the acute phase, 100 MAT-negative sera from patients with acute febrile illness, and 45 patients with other infectious diseases.
FINDINGS: There was a predominance of low molecular mass-polypeptide bands, ranging from 2 to 37 kDa. The antibody reactivity of theses polypeptides was found to range from 13-50%, especially between 10 and 38 kDa. Among MAT-positive sera of patients with leptospirosis in the acute phase, 97% were also positive in LFI, indicating high sensitivity. Among MAT-negative sera, all were negative in LFI, indicating high specificity. Only 2% of cross-reactivity was detected.

37184897,"Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Leptospirosis Hotspot Areas and Its Association With Hydroclimatic Factors in Selangor, Malaysia: Protocol for an Ecological Cross-sectional Study.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is considered a neglected zoonotic disease in temperate regions but an endemic disease in countries with tropical climates such as South America, Southern Asia, and Southeast Asia. There has been an increase in leptospirosis incidence in Malaysia from 1.45 to 25.94 cases per 100,000 population between 2005 and 2014. With increasing incidence in Selangor, Malaysia, and frequent climate change dynamics, a study on the disease hotspot areas and their association with the hydroclimatic factors would further enhance disease surveillance and public health interventions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the association between the spatio-temporal distribution of leptospirosis hotspot areas from 2011 to 2019 with the hydroclimatic factors in Selangor using the geographical information system and remote sensing techniques to develop a leptospirosis hotspot predictive model.
METHODS: This will be an ecological cross-sectional study with geographical information system and remote sensing mapping and analysis concerning leptospirosis using secondary data. Leptospirosis cases in Selangor from January 2011 to December 2019 shall be obtained from the Selangor State Health Department. Laboratory-confirmed cases with data on the possible source of infection would be identified and georeferenced according to their longitude and latitudes. Topographic data consisting of subdistrict boundaries and the distribution of rivers in Selangor will be obtained from the Department of Survey and Mapping. The ArcGIS Pro software will be used to evaluate the clustering of the cases and mapped using the Getis-Ord Gi* tool. The satellite images for rainfall and land surface temperature will be acquired from the Giovanni National Aeronautics and Space Administration EarthData website and processed to obtain the average monthly values in millimeters and degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the average monthly river hydrometric levels will be obtained from the Department of Drainage and Irrigation. Data are then inputted as thematic layers and in the ArcGIS software for further analysis. The artificial neural network analysis in artificial intelligence Phyton software will then be used to obtain the leptospirosis hotspot predictive model.
RESULTS: This research was funded as of November 2022. Data collection, processing, and analysis commenced in December 2022, and the results of the study are expected to be published by the end of 2024. The leptospirosis distribution and clusters may be significantly associated with the hydroclimatic factors of rainfall, land surface temperature, and the river hydrometric level.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will explore the associations of leptospirosis hotspot areas with the hydroclimatic factors in Selangor and subsequently the development of a leptospirosis predictive model. The constructed predictive model could potentially be used to design and enhance public health initiatives for disease prevention.

37162414,"[Leptospirosis, the diagnostic challenge of an indigenous case].","Leptospirosis is a global widespread zoonosis caused by a Gram-negative bacterium of the genus Leptospira, belonging to the Spirochaetes phylum, favored by unhealthy living conditions and some professional and recreational aquatic activities. Its diagnosis could be very difficult due to the presence of non-specific clinical presentation and biological anomalies common to other infectious diseases. To detect it, the choice of the right diagnostic method is fundamental. We hereby introduce the case of a patient with no classic risk factors for leptospirosis, showing febrile headaches and rapid deterioration of her general conditions with evolution towards septicemia.","['Martelli F', 'Gay Des Combes Gliven P', 'De Vallière S', 'Favrat B', 'Greub G', 'Kokkinakis I']",2023,19,826,Rev Med Suisse,"Martelli F, et al.

37150963,Increase in age at onset of moyamoya disease in China over 25 years.,"BACKGROUND: To explore whether the age at onset (AAO) of Chinese patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) increased over time due to a reduced exposure to leptospiral infection.
METHODS: We performed an independent, multicenter, retrospective study based on data from patients with MMD who initially attended four tertiary hospitals in Hubei, China, from 1996 to 2020. After stratifying the year of MMD onset into five periods (1996-2000, 2001-2005, 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2020), we analyzed the temporal trends in AAO and compared different classes of AAO (early-onset, < 20 years; intermediate-onset, 20-49 years; late-onset, ≥ 50 years) in each period.
RESULTS: We included 1858 patients in this study, with 878 women and 980 men. Their median (IQR) AAO was 47 (39-55) years. The case AAO significantly increased at the rate of 0.94 years per year (r = 0.406, p < .0001), while no trend was observed in birth years through time (p = .512). The birth cohorts who grew up in the leptospirosis epidemic years was stably susceptible to MMD. The median (IQR) AAO has increased significantly from 26 (14-37) years (1996-2000) to 51 (43-57) years (2016-2020) (p < .0001). The proportion of early-onset MMD was significantly higher in 1996-2000 (33.3%, p < .0001) and 2001-2005 (10.4%, p < .001). The AAO shows an aging trend that the proportion of late-onset MMD went from 4.5% (2001-2005) to 54.5% (2016-2020) (p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The AAO of MMD was increasing during a recent 25-year period in China, which may reflect a birth cohort effect that resulted from environmental changes. The disparity risk of birth cohorts with MMD changed with leptospirosis epidemics, suggesting leptospiral exposure might be a potential risk factor.","['Ma Z', 'Chen D', 'Wang S', 'Zhu Y', 'Chen J']",2023,13,6,Brain Behav,"Ma Z, et al.

37142093,Leptospirosis kidney disease: Evolution from acute to chronic kidney disease.,"Leptospirosis is a neglected bacterial disease caused by leptospiral infection that carries a substantial mortality risk in severe cases. Research has shown that acute, chronic, and asymptomatic leptospiral infections are closely linked to acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal fibrosis. Leptospires affect renal function by infiltrating kidney cells via the renal tubules and interstitium and surviving in the kidney by circumventing the immune system. The most well-known pathogenic molecular mechanism of renal tubular damage caused by leptospiral infection is the direct binding of the bacterial outer membrane protein LipL32 to toll-like receptor-2 expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) to induce intracellular inflammatory signaling pathways. These pathways include the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and nuclear factor kappa activation, resulting in acute and chronic leptospirosis-related kidney injury. Few studies have investigated the relationship between acute and chronic renal diseases and leptospirosis and further evidence is necessary. In this review, we intend to discuss the roles of acute kidney injury (AKI) to/on CKD in leptospirosis. This study reviews the molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of leptospirosis kidney disease, which will assist in concentrating on potential future research directions.","['Chou LF', 'Yang HY', 'Hung CC', 'Tian YC', 'Hsu SH', 'Yang CW']",2023,46,4,Biomed J,"Chou LF, et al.

37113837,A rare case of Weil's disease with acute pancreatitis and acute kidney injury: focus on management - a case report.,"UNLABELLED: The clinical spectrum of leptospirosis ranges from subclinical infection and anicteric fever to Weil's disease, a severely fatal infection. Acute inflammation of the pancreas is a rare manifestation of Weil's disease, and renal involvement is a hallmark in severe forms, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) and representing a major risk factor for death. The aim of the case report was to present the clinical manifestations of Weil's disease with acute pancreatitis and AKI and to highlight the management of its complications.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 22-year-old male patient presented to the hospital with a chief complaint of a persisting fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite, malaise, and urine and feces discoloration. The patient's residence had flooded 2 weeks ago. Laboratory tests were performed and the patient was diagnosed with Weil's disease with the complication of acute pancreatitis, AKI, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypotonic hypovolemic, metabolic acidosis, and hypoalbuminemia.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The patient was treated with intravenous (i.v.) ceftriaxone at a dose of 2×1 g, i.v. metoclopramide at a dose of 3×10 mg, i.v. calcium gluconate at a dose of 1 g followed by dextrose (D) 40% with insulin 2 IU for six times, avoided nephrotoxic drugs, and fluid balance was maintained at I=O+500 ml. The patient received hemodialysis due to refractory hyperkalemia. Posttreatment follow-up presented improvements in complaints and laboratory parameters.
CONCLUSION: Management of severe leptospirosis or Weil's disease with the complication of acute pancreatitis and AKI requires antibiotics and supportive therapy including adequate fluid resuscitation, proper and adequate nutrition, as well as the initiation of hemodialysis.","['Hutajulu RB', 'Bramantono B', 'Rusli M', 'Arifijanto MV', 'Hadi U']",2023,85,4,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Hutajulu RB, et al.

37103759,A Multi-landscape Assessment of Leptospira Prevalence on a Diversity of Small Mammals.,"Leptospirosis is a major zoonotic disease, especially in the tropics, and rodents were known to be carriers of this bacterium. There was established information on Leptospira prevalence among animal reservoirs in human-dominated landscapes from previous literature. However, there was very little focus given comparing the prevalence of Leptospira in a wide range of habitats. An extensive sampling of small mammals from various landscapes was carried out, covering oil palm plantations, paddy fields, recreational forests, semi-urbans, and wet markets in Peninsular Malaysia. This study aims to determine the prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira in a diversity of small mammals across different landscapes. Cage-trapping was deployed for small mammals' trappings, and the kidneys of captured individuals were extracted, for screening of pathogenic Leptospira by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using LipL32 primer. Eight microhabitat parameters were measured at each study site. Out of 357 individuals captured, 21 (5.9%) were positive for pathogenic Leptospira of which recreational forest had the highest prevalence (8.8%) for landscape types, whereas Sundamys muelleri shows the highest prevalence (50%) among small mammals' species. Microhabitat analysis reveals that rubbish quantity (p < 0.05) significantly influenced the Leptospira prevalence among small mammals. Furthermore, nMDS analysis indicates that the presence of faeces, food waste, and exposure to humans in each landscape type also were linked with high prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira among the small mammals. This study supplements previous studies on pathogenic Leptospira prevalence across different landscape types, and the major microhabitat factors associated with Leptospira prevalence. This information is crucial for epidemiological surveillance and habitat management to curb the possibility of the disease outbreaks.","['Rosli MZ', 'Mohd-Taib FS', 'Khoo JJ', 'Chee HY', 'Wong YP', 'Shafie NJ', 'Mohamed NZ', 'AbuBakar S', 'Nor SM']",2023,,,Ecohealth,"Rosli MZ, et al.

37090569,Factors associated with differential seropositivity to Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira kirschneri in a high transmission urban setting for leptospirosis in Brazil.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of bacteria belonging to the genus 
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a cross-sectional serological study in five urban informal communities in the city of Salvador, Brazil. During the years 2018, 2020 2021, we recruited 2.808 residents and collected blood samples for serological analysis using microagglutination assays. We used a mixed-effect multinomial logistic regression model to identify risk factors associated with seropositivity for each serogroup. Seropositivity to Cynopteri increased with age in years (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.06) and was higher in those living in houses with unplaster walls (exposed brick) (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.09-2.59) and where cats were present near the household (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.03-3.88). Seropositivity to Icterohaemorrhagiae also increased with age in years (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.03) but was higher in males (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.09-2.10), in those with work-related exposures (OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.10-2.66) or who had contact with sewage (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.00-2.03). Spatial analysis showed differences in distribution of seropositivity to serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae and Cynopteri within the five districts where study communities were situated.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggests distinct epidemiological patterns associated with serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae and Cynopteri within the high-risk urban environment for leptospirosis and with differences of spatial niches. Future studies must identify the different pathogenic serogroups circulating in low-income areas, and further evaluate the potential role of cats in the transmission of the serogroup Cynopteri in urban settings.","['de Oliveira D', 'Khalil H', 'Almerinda G Palma F', 'Santana R', 'Nery N', 'Quintero-Vélez JC', 'Zeppelini CG', 'do Sacramento GA', 'Cruz J', 'Lustosa R', 'Ferreira IS', 'Carvalho-Pereira T', 'Diggle PJ', 'Wunder EA', 'Ko AI', 'Lopez YA', 'Begon M', 'Reis MG', 'Costa F']",2023,,,medRxiv,"de Oliveira D, et al.

37075979,Report of Weil's disease with a fatal course triggered by Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.,"Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease characterized by a spectrum of influenza-like symptoms, can manifest as severe cases so called Weil's disease. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid the potentially fatal course of the disease. Within 24 hours of the initial administration of antibiotics, patients may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR), characterized by chills, fever, hypotension, and impaired consciousness. The Okinawa Prefecture, where our hospital is situated, boasts the highest incidence rate of leptospirosis among all regions in Japan. This reports our encounter with the initial leptospirosis case after a period of 16 years within the Okinawa Prefecture. This case exhibited JHR and required the utilization of noradrenaline (NA). Despite evidence indicating that JHR does not correlate with mortality, we contend that diagnosis of Weil's disease necessitates admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and vigilant monitoring for JHR, as it may result in impairment of general condition and fatal outcome, as observed in our case.","['Chiko Y', 'Shiokawa K', 'Namihira I', 'Itagaki K', 'Maruyama K', 'Tachibana Y', 'Ryu Y', 'Sakai T']",2023,29,8,J Infect Chemother,"Chiko Y, et al.

37062365,Transcriptome landscape reveals the chronic inflammatory response in kidneys affected by the combinatory effect of leptospirosis and nephrotoxic injury.,"Leptospirosis can cause chronic kidney damage, putting patients at risk of additional kidney injury due to other factors that can lead to renal failure. To understand the combined effect, the transcriptome profiles of kidneys of mice with adenine-induced and chronically Leptospira-infected kidneys were analysed. Chronic inflammation and T-helper 17 immune responses were activated and a high-level expression of Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 protein was found. The results indicate that the combination may predispose patients to chronic inflammation, kidney function disruption, and symptoms seen in progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, immunometabolic regulation may contribute to renal injury caused by chronic leptospirosis with secondary nephrotoxic injury. This study identified several significantly disrupted genes that could serve as potential targets for the diagnosis or treatment of CKD. Our work provides insight into the combined effect of leptospirosis and secondary kidney damage and the molecular basis for rapid progression of CKD.","['Chou LF', 'Huang CW', 'Yang HY', 'Tian YC', 'Chang MY', 'Hung CC', 'Chen KH', 'Hsu SH', 'Tsai CY', 'Ko YC', 'Chen TW', 'Yang CW']",2023,115,3,Genomics,"Chou LF, et al.

The drinking water should be free from urine and stool contamination. Coliform test is popular for understanding feces contamination. However, understanding urine contamination in drinking water is a difficult task. On the other hand, urine contamination can cause disease like leptospirosis. It occurs mainly in animals and infects humans through contaminated water, food, and soil and causes serious consequences. Rat urine is the most common source of such disease outbreaks. Further, sophisticated laboratories with high-end technologies may not be present at the site of disease outbreaks. In this context, we have proposed a spectrofluorimetric approach to screen urine contamination in water. The screening method can sense up to 156 nl/ml of rat urine.","['Kumar D', 'Yadav D', 'Kaur S', 'Chowdhary S', 'Bhattacharyya R', 'Banerjee D']",2022,66,4,Indian J Public Health,"Kumar D, et al.

37038199,Neglected tropical diseases risk correlates with poverty and early ecosystem destruction.,"BACKGROUND: Neglected tropical diseases affect the most vulnerable populations and cause chronic and debilitating disorders. Socioeconomic vulnerability is a well-known and important determinant of neglected tropical diseases. For example, poverty and sanitation could influence parasite transmission. Nevertheless, the quantitative impact of socioeconomic conditions on disease transmission risk remains poorly explored.
METHODS: This study investigated the role of socioeconomic variables in the predictive capacity of risk models of neglected tropical zoonoses using a decade of epidemiological data (2007-2018) from Brazil. Vector-borne diseases investigated in this study included dengue, malaria, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and Brazilian spotted fever, while directly-transmitted zoonotic diseases included schistosomiasis, leptospirosis, and hantaviruses. Environmental and socioeconomic predictors were combined with infectious disease data to build environmental and socioenvironmental sets of ecological niche models and their performances were compared.
RESULTS: Socioeconomic variables were found to be as important as environmental variables in influencing the estimated likelihood of disease transmission across large spatial scales. The combination of socioeconomic and environmental variables improved overall model accuracy (or predictive power) by 10% on average (P < 0.01), reaching a maximum of 18% in the case of dengue fever. Gross domestic product was the most important socioeconomic variable (37% relative variable importance, all individual models exhibited P < 0.00), showing a decreasing relationship with disease indicating poverty as a major factor for disease transmission. Loss of natural vegetation cover between 2008 and 2018 was the most important environmental variable (42% relative variable importance, P < 0.05) among environmental models, exhibiting a decreasing relationship with disease probability, showing that these diseases are especially prevalent in areas where natural ecosystem destruction is on its initial stages and lower when ecosystem destruction is on more advanced stages.
CONCLUSIONS: Destruction of natural ecosystems coupled with low income explain macro-scale neglected tropical and zoonotic disease probability in Brazil. Addition of socioeconomic variables improves transmission risk forecasts on tandem with environmental variables. Our results highlight that to efficiently address neglected tropical diseases, public health strategies must target both reduction of poverty and cessation of destruction of natural forests and savannas.","['Magalhães AR', 'Codeço CT', 'Svenning JC', 'Escobar LE', 'Van de Vuurst P', 'Gonçalves-Souza T']",2023,12,1,Infect Dis Poverty,"Magalhães AR, et al.

37038195,Seroprevalence of viral and bacterial pathogens among malaria patients in an endemic area of southern Venezuela.,"BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a leading public health problem worldwide. Co-infections with other pathogens complicate its diagnosis and may modify the disease's clinical course and management. Similarities in malaria clinical presentation with other infections and overlapping endemicity result in underdiagnosis of co-infections and increased mortality. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of viral and bacterial pathogens among diagnosed malaria patients in malaria-endemic areas in Venezuela.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on malaria patients attending three reference medical centres in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela. Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests for dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), viral hepatitis [hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV)], and leptospirosis (LEP) were performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Previous exposure to these pathogens was defined by the presence of specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and co-infection or recent exposure (CoRE) was determined by the presence of specific IgM alone or IgM + IgG. Data analysis considered descriptive statistics. Parameter distribution was statistically evaluated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the necessary comparison tests. Odds ratio (OR) for complications was determined according to CoRE presence with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 161 malaria patients were studied, 66% infected with Plasmodium vivax, 27% with P. falciparum, and 7.5% harboured P. vivax/P. falciparum mixed infection. Previous exposure to DENV (60%) and CHIKV (25%) was frequent. CoRE was confirmed in 55 of the 161 malaria patients (34%) and were more frequent in P. falciparum (49%) than in P. vivax (29%) and mixed malaria patients (25%) (OR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.39-4.25, P = 0.018). The most frequent CoRE was DENV (15%), followed by HAV (12%), HBV (6.2%), CHIKV (5.5%), and LEP (3.7%); HCV CoRE was absent. Complicated malaria was significantly more frequent in patients with CoRE (56%) than those without CoRE (36%; OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.18-4.92, P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: We found high CoRE prevalence in malaria patients as determined by serology in the study region; cases were associated with a worse clinical outcome. Further prospective studies with samples from different infection sites and the use of molecular tools are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.","['Forero-Peña DA', 'Carrión-Nessi FS', 'Lopez-Perez M', 'Sandoval-de Mora M', 'Amaya ID', 'Gamardo ÁF', 'Chavero M', 'Figuera L', 'Marcano MV', 'Camejo-Ávila NA', 'Hidalgo M', 'Arenas CJ', 'Arévalo-Herrera M', 'Herrera S']",2023,12,1,Infect Dis Poverty,"Forero-Peña DA, et al.

37018175,Seroepidemiology of Leptospira serovar Hardjo and associated risk factors in smallholder dairy cattle in Tanzania.,"BACKGROUND: Smallholder dairy farming is crucial for the Tanzanian dairy sector which generates income and employment for thousands of families. This is more evident in the northern and southern highland zones where dairy cattle and milk production are core economic activities. Here we estimated the seroprevalence of Leptospira serovar Hardjo and quantified potential risk factors associated with its exposure in smallholder dairy cattle in Tanzania.
METHODS: From July 2019 to October 2020, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in a subset of 2071 smallholder dairy cattle. Information about animal husbandry and health management was collected from farmers, and blood was taken from this subset of cattle. Seroprevalence was estimated and mapped to visualize potential spatial hotspots. The association between a set of animal husbandry, health management and climate variables and ELISA binary results was explored using a mixed effects logistic regression model.
RESULTS: An overall seroprevalence of 13.0% (95% CI 11.6-14.5%) for Leptospira serovar Hardjo was found in the study animals. There was marked regional variations with the highest seroprevalence in Iringa 30.2% (95% CI 25.1-35.7%) and Tanga 18.9% (95% CI 15.7-22.6) with odds ratios of OR = 8.13 (95% CI 4.23-15.63) and OR = 4.39 (95% CI 2.31-8.37), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed the individual animal factors that were a significant risk for Leptospira seropositivity in smallholder dairy cattle were: animals over 5 years of age (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.9); and indigenous breed (OR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.47-5.26) compared to crossbred animals SHZ-X-Friesian (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 0.99-2.21) and SHZ-X-Jersey (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.43-1.63). Farm management factors significantly associated with Leptospira seropositivity included: hiring or keeping a bull for raising purposes (OR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.34-2.71); distance between farms of more than 100 meters (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.16-2.64); cattle kept extensively (OR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.36-3.91); farms without cat for rodent control (OR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.16-3.02); farmers with livestock training (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.15-2.27). Temperature (OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.18-2.26), and the interaction of higher temperature and precipitation (OR = 1.5, 95%CI 1.12-2.01) were also significant risk factors.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated seroprevalence of Leptospira serovar Hardjo, as well as the risk factors driving dairy cattle leptospirosis exposure in Tanzania. The study showed an overall high leptospirosis seroprevalence with regional variations, where Iringa and Tanga represented the highest seroprevalence and risk. The study highlighted the urgent need to understand the human exposures and risks from this important zoonosis to develop control measures and awareness of the problem and quantify the economic and production impacts through abortion and milk loss. In addition, given that the available data was limited to Leptospira serovar Hardjo, the study recommends more studies to identify serologically the most common serovars in cattle for targeted vaccination and risk reduction.","['Motto SK', 'Hernandez-Castro LE', 'Shirima GM', 'Mengele IJ', 'Bwatota SF', 'Bronsvoort BMC', 'Lyatuu ET', 'Komwihangilo DM', 'Cook EAJ']",2023,17,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Motto SK, et al.

Deconstructing leptospirosis transmission risk and the drivers of knowledge, attitudes, and practices in a disadvantaged community in Salvador, Brazil.","Several studies have identified socioeconomic and environmental risk factors for infectious disease, but the relationship between these and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP), and more importantly their web of effects on individual infection risk, have not previously been evaluated. We conducted a cross-sectional KAP survey in an urban disadvantaged community in Salvador, Brazil, leveraging on simultaneously collected fine-scale environmental and epidemiological data on leptospirosis transmission. Residents' knowledge influenced their attitudes which influenced their practices. However, different KAP variables were driven by different socioeconomic and environmental factors; and while improved KAP variables reduced risk, there were additional effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors on risk. For example, males and those of lower socioeconomic status were at greater risk, but once we controlled for KAP, male gender and lower socioeconomic status themselves were not direct drivers of seropositivity. Employment was linked to better knowledge and a less contaminated environment, and hence lower risk, but being employed was independently associated with a higher, not lower risk of leptospirosis transmission, suggesting travel to work as a high risk activity. Our results show how such complex webs of influence can be disentangled. They indicate that public health messaging and interventions should take into account this complexity and prioritize factors that limit exposure and support appropriate prevention practices.","['Palma FAG', 'Costa F', 'Lustosa R', 'Mogaji HO', 'de Oliveira DS', 'Souza FN', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI', 'Begon M', 'Khalil H']",2022,2,12,PLOS Glob Public Health,"Palma FAG, et al.

The seasonality of infections is driven by a variety of environmental and human factors; however, the role of individual climatic factors has garnered much attention. This study utilises Poisson regression models to assess the seasonality of six important infections in tropical Australia and their association with climatic factors and severe weather events over a 21-year period. Melioidosis and leptospirosis showed marked wet season predominance, while more cases of rickettsial disease and cryptococcosis were seen in cooler, drier months. Staphylococcus aureus infections were not seasonal, while influenza demonstrated inter-seasonality. The climate did not significantly change during the 21 years of the study period, but the incidence of melioidosis and rickettsial disease increased considerably, highlighting the primacy of other factors-including societal inequality, and the impact of urban expansion-in the incidence of these infections. While anthropogenic climate change poses a threat to the region-and may influence the burden of these infections in the future-this study highlights the fact that, even for seasonal diseases, other factors presently have a greater effect on disease incidence. Public health strategies must also target these broader drivers of infection if they are to be effective.","['Fairhead LJ', 'Smith S', 'Sim BZ', 'Stewart AGA', 'Stewart JD', 'Binotto E', 'Law M', 'Hanson J']",2022,2,5,PLOS Glob Public Health,"Fairhead LJ, et al.

36960213,Case report: Leptospirosis with multi-organ failure complicated by massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a non-epidemic setting with successful management.,"Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations, specifically in tropical regions. Weil's disease is considered a severe form of leptospirosis seen in a minority of leptospirosis cases with considerable mortality. These patients typically developed the triad of acute renal injury, jaundice, and hemorrhages. Herein, we reported a case of a 28-year-old male transferred to our intensive care unit due to severe leptospirosis with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, cholestatic jaundice, acute respiratory distress, and renal injury. The patient was successfully managed with appropriate antimicrobial treatment and other supportive management, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor, and corticosteroid therapy. Ten days after admission, the patient unexpectedly developed uncontrollable massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring immediate surgical interventions. Splenectomy, partial gastrectomy, along with gastro-esophageal anastomosis were performed. Following a prolonged hospitalization, the patient fully recovered and was discharged home with excellent clinical outcomes. This fulminant leptospirosis case described here should assist in informing medical professionals of the clinical significance of this serious, occasionally fatal illness. Moreover, leptospirosis should be considered in any location wherever risk factors are present, not just in epidemic and tropical areas. In this case, we pointed out that serious complications of leptospirosis, such as hemorrhage, may happen despite their rarity. In such cases, adopting an integrated multidisciplinary team approach is essential to prevent complications and reduce mortality.","['Thalji M', 'Qunibi H', 'Muhtasib L', 'Hroob H', 'Al-Zughayyar A', 'Salhab R', 'Abu Asbeh Y']",2023,10,,Front Surg,"Thalji M, et al.

36934135,Development and validation of a simple machine learning tool to predict mortality in leptospirosis.,"Predicting risk factors for death in leptospirosis is challenging, and identifying high-risk patients is crucial as it might expedite the start of life-saving supportive care. Admission data of 295 leptospirosis patients were enrolled, and a machine-learning approach was used to fit models in a derivation cohort. The comparison of accuracy metrics was performed with two previous models-SPIRO score and quick SOFA score. A Lasso regression analysis was the selected model, demonstrating the best accuracy to predict mortality in leptospirosis [area under the curve (AUC-ROC) = 0.776]. A score-based prediction was carried out with the coefficients of this model and named LeptoScore. Then, to simplify the predictive tool, a new score was built by attributing points to the predictors with importance values higher than 1. The simplified score, named QuickLepto, has five variables (age > 40 years; lethargy; pulmonary symptom; mean arterial pressure < 80 mmHg and hematocrit < 30%) and good predictive accuracy (AUC-ROC = 0.788). LeptoScore and QuickLepto had better accuracy to predict mortality in patients with leptospirosis when compared to SPIRO score (AUC-ROC = 0.500) and quick SOFA score (AUC-ROC = 0.782). The main result is a new scoring system, the QuickLepto, that is a simple and useful tool to predict death in leptospirosis patients at hospital admission.","['Galdino GS', 'de Sandes-Freitas TV', 'de Andrade LGM', 'Adamian CMC', 'Meneses GC', 'da Silva Junior GB', 'de Francesco Daher E']",2023,13,1,Sci Rep,"Galdino GS, et al.

36929155,Identification of the most effective serovars to be included in the MAT antigen panel to optimize the serodiagnosis of Leptospira infection in Northern Italy.,"The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) assay is adopted as a world-wide reference test for the serodiagnosis of leptospirosis in humans and animals. One of the main limitations of MAT is the lack of sensitivity and serodiagnostic antigens should be periodically updated with locally circulating serovars in order to optimise its performance. The aim of this study was to determine the need to implement the antigen panel currently adopted in Northern Italy for the diagnosis of Leptospira infection in dogs. For this purpose, a group of 288 dogs with and without clinical signs potentially consistent with Leptospira infection or found to have an increased C-reactive protein (CRP) serum concentration, sampled in 2013-2016 in Northern Italy, were tested by MAT comparing the results obtained with a nine antigens panel (Australis-Bratislava, Ballum-Ballum, Canicola-Canicola, Grippotyphosa-Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae-Copenhageni, Icterohaemorrhagiae-Icterohaemorrhagiae, Sejroe-Hardjo, Pomona-Pomona and Tarassovi-Tarassovi serovars) routinely adopted and a panel expanded to 27 antigens. In general, the antigen panel currently adopted in Northern Italy for the routine MAT assay resulted adequate for the diagnosis of Leptospira infection in dogs. The main exception concerns the Sejroe serogroup, with the Saxkoebing and Sejroe serovars that were more effective than Hardjo for diagnosis in dogs and whose inclusion in the antigen panel is recommended. Among other antigens evaluated in this study, Cynopteri serovar was detected with high frequency but its pathogenic role in dogs and as public health threat deserve further investigation.","['Balboni A', ""D'Incau M"", 'Zamagni S', 'Lucchese L', 'Mazzotta E', 'Marchione S', 'Battilani M', 'Natale A']",2023,,,Vet Res Commun,"Balboni A, et al.

36927735,Incidence of acute pancreatitis among patients with leptospirosis requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): a descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an infrequently reported manifestation of leptospirosis. It is more commonly seen in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite novel modalities such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the mortality rate remains high and whether this is associated with the lung injury caused by the inflammation in AP remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in the Philippines. Primary outcome was defined as the presence or absence of AP. Secondary outcomes were defined as 28-day mortality rate, length of hospital stay, ECMO days, renal replacement therapy (RRT) days, days on mechanical ventilation, presence of local complications of AP and development of nosocomial infections.
RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were included in the study, and 88.89% (n=24) were men. The mean age for all patients was 33.59±10.22 years. Out of the 27 patients, 19 (70.37%) were diagnosed with AP. Among these 19 patients, one (5.26%) had necrotising pancreatitis and two (10.52%) developed local complications of pancreatitis. Six patients (31.58%) died among those who developed AP, while one (12.50%) died among those who did not. The duration of hospital stay, ECMO, RRT, mechanical ventilation and development of nosocomial infections was also higher in the group who presented with AP.
CONCLUSION: AP is an under-reported complication of leptospirosis.

36921206,Leptospirosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case report.,"Since SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) has been labeled as a pandemic, it took the spotlight in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with acute respiratory and systemic symptoms. Leptospirosis is one of the most common zoonoses in the world, yet it is mainly a disease of differential diagnosis for places that do not have it as an endemic. Due to the high burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare field, patients suffering from other infections may have been inadvertently neglected. COVID-19 infection can mimic other infectious diseases and can confuse physicians in their search for a confirmatory diagnosis. Nonetheless, it is very crucial to broaden the differential diagnosis and keep diseases like leptospirosis within the differential diagnosis despite its rarity, especially in patients presenting with unexplained systemic infectious symptoms. This is a unique case of a patient who presented with dyspnea, jaundice and change in urine color who was suspected to be COVID-19 positive. After a detailed investigation, the patient was diagnosed with leptospirosis instead of COVID-19 and was treated with plasmapheresis and antibiotics accordingly.","['Arman ME', 'Yavuz M', 'Cekic D', 'Issever K', 'Genc AC', 'Yaylacı S']",2023,65,,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"Arman ME, et al.

36918832,Core genome sequencing and genotyping of Leptospira interrogans in clinical samples by target capture sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: The life-threatening pathogen Leptospira interrogans is the most common agent of leptospirosis, an emerging zoonotic disease. However, little is known about the strains that are currently circulating worldwide due to the fastidious nature of the bacteria and the difficulty to isolate cultures. In addition, the paucity of bacteria in blood and other clinical samples has proven to be a considerable challenge for directly genotyping the agent of leptospirosis directly from patient material. Our understanding of the genetic diversity of strains during human infection is therefore limited.
METHODS: Here, we carried out hybridization capture followed by Illumina sequencing of the core genome directly from 20 clinical samples that were PCR positive for pathogenic Leptospira to elucidate the genetic diversity of currently circulating Leptospira strains in mainland France.
RESULTS: Capture with RNA probes covering the L. interrogans core genome resulted in a 72 to 13,000-fold increase in pathogen reads relative to standard sequencing without capture. Variant analysis of the genomes sequenced from the biological samples using 273 Leptospira reference genomes was then carried out to determine the genotype of the infecting strain. For samples with sufficient coverage (19/20 samples with coverage > 8×), we could unambiguously identify L. interrogans serovars Icterohaemorrhagiae and Copenhageni (14 samples), L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa (4 samples), and L. interrogans serovar Pyrogenes (1 sample) as the infecting strains.
CONCLUSIONS: We obtained high-quality genomic data with suitable coverage for confident core genome genotyping of the agent of leptospirosis for most of our clinical samples. The recovery of the genome of the serovars Icterohaemorrhagiae and Copenhageni directly from multiple clinical samples revealed low adaptive diversification of the core genes during human infection. The ability to generate culture-free genomic data opens new opportunities for better understanding of the epidemiology of this fastidious pathogen and pathogenesis of this neglected disease.","['Grillova L', 'Cokelaer T', 'Mariet JF', 'da Fonseca JP', 'Picardeau M']",2023,23,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Grillova L, et al.

We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of concomitant infections of leptospirosis and acute dengue infection (ADI) in clinically suspected dengue patients. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in five hospitals in the Western Province, from December 2018 to April 2019. Venous blood and sociodemographic and clinical details were collected from clinically suspected adult dengue patients. Acute dengue was confirmed by DENV NS1 antigen ELISA, IgM ELISA, IgG ELISA, and IgG quantification assay. Leptospirosis was confirmed by the microscopic agglutination test and real-time polymerase chain reaction. There were 386 adult patients. The median age was 29 years, with male predominance. Among them, 297 (76.9%) were laboratory confirmed as ADI. Concomitant leptospirosis was present in 23 (7.74%) patients.

36860632,The Emergence of Travel-related Infections in Critical Care Units.,"Several tropical or geographically confined infectious diseases may lead to organ failure requiring management in an intensive care unit (ICU), both in endemic low- and middle-income countries where ICU facilities are increasingly being developed and in (nonendemic) high-income countries through an increase in international travel and migration. The ICU physician must know which of these diseases may be encountered and how to recognize, differentiate, and treat them. The four historically most prevalent ""tropical"" diseases (malaria, enteric fever, dengue, and rickettsiosis) can present with single or multiple organ failure in a very similar manner, which makes differentiation based solely on clinical signs very difficult. Specific but frequently subtle symptoms should be considered and related to the travel history of the patient, the geographic distribution of these diseases, and the incubation period. In the future, ICU physicians may also be more frequently confronted with rare but frequently lethal diseases, such as Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers, leptospirosis, and yellow fever. No one could have foreseen the worldwide 2019-up to now coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was initially spread by travel too. In addition, the actual pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 reminds us of the actual and potential threat of (re)-emerging pathogens. If left untreated or when treated with a delay, many travel-related diseases remain an important cause of morbidity and even mortality, even when high-quality critical care is provided. Awareness and a high index of suspicion of these diseases is a key skill for the ICU physicians of today and tomorrow to develop.","['Herten PJ', 'Vlieghe E', 'Bottieau E', 'Florence E', 'Jorens PG']",2022,10,4,J Transl Int Med,"Herten PJ, et al.

36828528,Prognostic Factors for Leptospirosis Infection Severity.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important health problem in Thailand. People infected with leptospirosis may not have any mild symptoms, whereas some people have acute and severe illnesses. It is crucial to strengthen critical patients' diagnosis and treatment to prevent severe complications and reduce mortality. This study was performed to explore a set of parameters for the prediction of severe leptospirosis illness under routine clinical practice.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in eight general hospitals in Thailand. Retrospective collection data were used, and key information was retrieved from inpatient medical files. Patients were grouped into two severity categories, severe and non-severe infection. Backward elimination was used to reach the final multivariate model.
RESULTS: The six significant predictors identified in the study were hemoptysis (OR = 25.80, 95% CI 5.69, 116.92), hypotension (blood pressure < 90/60 mmHg) (OR = 17.33, 95% CI 6.89, 43.58), platelet count < 100,000/µL (OR = 8.37, 95% CI 4.65, 15.09), white blood cell count (WBC) > 14,000/µL (OR = 5.12, 95% CI 2.75, 9.51), hematocrit ≤ 30% (OR = 3.49, 95% CI 1.61, 7.57), and jaundice (OR = 3.11, 95% CI 1.71, 5.65). These predictors could correctly predict the severity of leptospirosis infection in 91.31% of the area under the receiver operation curve (AuROC).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that severe leptospirosis infections have identifiable predictors.

Humans are at risk of becoming infected by having contact with domestic and wild animals. In this paper, general aspects of the etiology and transmission of leptospirosis are addressed, data regarding the clinical presentation of the pathology in humans and animals are also presented, and the results of some epidemiological studies on leptospirosis carried out in Chile in different animal species and humans are summarized through a bibliographic review of the literature. The research on domestic canines and horses stands out in terms of their number in the country, with prevalences between 12.0% and 59.1% in dogs and from 23.3% to 65.4% in equids. Studies have been performed on domestic felines in recent years with frequencies ranging from 3.0% to 25.2%, as well as on wild animals (mainly in mammals). In pigs, cattle, sheep, and goats, the information is scarce, with little updated research dating back several decades and variable prevalence rates, which are generally high, except for in sheep. Leptospirosis is a disease of varied etiology in terms of infecting species, serovars and serogroups, which influences its epidemiology, and its prevalence is variable in different animals.

36814095,Influence of landscape structure on previous exposure to Leptospira spp. and Brucella abortus in free-living neotropical primates from southern Brazil.,"The environments in which neotropical primates live have been undergoing an intense fragmentation process, constituting a major threat to the species' survival and causing resource scarcity, social isolation, and difficulty in dispersal, leaving populations increasingly vulnerable. Moreover, the proximity of wild environments to anthropized landscapes can change the dynamics of pathogens and the parasite-host-environment relationship, creating conditions that favor exposure to different pathogens. To investigate the previous exposure of free-living primates in Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), southern Brazil, to the bacterial agents Leptospira spp. and Brucella abortus, we investigated agglutinating antibodies against 23 serovars of Leptospira spp. using the microscopic agglutination test and B. abortus acidified antigen test in primate serum samples; 101 samples from primates captured between 2002 and 2016 in different forest fragments were used: 63 Alouatta caraya, 36 Alouatta guariba clamitans, and 02 Sapajus nigritus cucullatus. In addition, the forest remnants where the primates were sampled were characterized in a multiscale approach in radii ranging from 200 to 1400 m to investigate the potential relationship of previous exposure to the agent with the elements that make up the landscape structure. The serological investigation indicated the presence of antibodies for at least one of the 23 serovars of Leptospira spp. in 36.6% (37/101) of the samples analyzed, with titers ranging from 100 to 1600. The most observed serovars were Panama (17.8%), Ballum (5.9%), Butembo (5.9%), Canicola (5.9%), Hardjo (4.9%), and Tarassovi (3.9%); no samples were seropositive for Brucella abortus. Decreased forest cover and edge density were the landscape factors that had a significant relationship with Leptospira spp. exposure, indicating that habitat fragmentation may influence contact with the pathogen. The data generated in this study demonstrate the importance of understanding how changes in landscape structure affect exposure to pathogenic microorganisms of zoonotic relevance. Hence, improving epidemiological research and understanding primates' ecological role in these settings can help improve environmental surveillance and conservation strategies for primate populations in different landscapes.","['Dos Santos EO', 'Klain VF', 'B Manrique S', 'Rodrigues RO', 'Dos Santos HF', 'Sangioni LA', 'Dasso MG', 'de Almeida MAB', 'Dos Santos E', 'Born LC', 'Reck J', 'Botton SA']",2023,85,4,Am J Primatol,"Dos Santos EO, et al.

36812779,Generation of an RNA aptamer against LipL32 of Leptospira isolated by Tripartite-hybrid SELEX coupled with in-house Python-aided unbiased data sorting.,"Leptospirosis is a potentially life-threatening zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira. The major hurdle of the diagnosis of Leptospirosis lies in the issues associated with current methods of detection, which are time-consuming, tedious and the need for sophisticated, special equipments. Restrategizing the diagnostics of Leptospirosis may involve considerations of the direct detection of the outer membrane protein, which can be faster, cost-saving and require fewer equipments. One such promising marker is LipL32, which is an antigen with high amino acid sequence conservation among all the pathogenic strains. In this study, we endeavored to isolate an aptamer against LipL32 protein via a modified SELEX strategy known as tripartite-hybrid SELEX, based on 3 different partitioning strategies. In this study, we also demonstrated the deconvolution of the candidate aptamers by using in-house Python-aided unbiased data sorting in examining multiple parameters to isolate potent aptamers. We have successfully generated an RNA aptamer against LipL32 of Leptospira, LepRapt-11, which is applicable in a simple direct ELASA for the detection of LipL32. LepRapt-11 can be a promising molecular recognition element for the diagnosis of leptospirosis by targeting LipL32.","['Shien Yeoh T', 'Yusof Hazrina H', 'Bukari BA', 'Tang TH', 'Citartan M']",2023,81,,Bioorg Med Chem,"Shien Yeoh T, et al.

36809758,Leptospirosis: A Potential Culprit for Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain Etiology.,"PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) is an environmental nephropathy in which the etiological factors are yet uncertain. Leptospirosis, a spirochetal infection that is common among agricultural communities, has been identified as a potential etiology for CKDu beyond environmental nephropathy. Although CKDu is a chronic kidney disease, in endemic regions, an increasing number of cases are reported with features suggestive of acute interstitial nephritis without any known reason (AINu), with or without background CKD. The study hypothesizes that exposure to pathogenic leptospires is one of the causative factors for the occurrence of AINu.
METHOD: This study was carried out using 59 clinically diagnosed AINu patients, 72 healthy controls from CKDu endemic region (endemic controls [ECs]), and 71 healthy controls from CKDu non-endemic region (non-endemic controls [NECs]).
RESULTS: The seroprevalence of 18.6, 6.9, and 7.0% was observed in the AIN (or AINu), EC, and NEC groups, respectively, from the rapid IgM test. Among 19 serovars tested, the highest seroprevalence was observed at 72.9, 38.9, and 21.1% in the AIN (AINu), EC, and NEC groups, respectively, by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), particularly for serovar Leptospira santarosai serovar Shermani. This emphasizes the presence of infection in AINu patients, and this also suggests that Leptospira exposure might play an important role in AINu.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that exposure to Leptospira infection could be one of the possible causative factors for the occurrence of AINu, which may lead to CKDu in Sri Lanka.","['Premarathne SS', 'Gamage C', 'Chandrajith R', 'Ratnatunge NV', 'Wijetunge S', 'Wazil A', 'Chou LF', 'Ko YC', 'Huang CT', 'Yang HY', 'Fonseka A', 'Sonnadara T', 'Herath D', 'Hewavitharane P', 'Yang CW', 'Nanayakkara N']",2023,147,8,Nephron,"Premarathne SS, et al.

36808011,Transcription start site mapping and small RNA profiling of Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc.,"Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by bacterial species of the genus Leptospira. However, the regulatory mechanisms and pathways underlying the adaptation of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira spp. in different environmental conditions remain elusive. Leptospira biflexa is a non-pathogenic species of Leptospira that lives exclusively in a natural environment. It is an ideal model not only for exploring molecular mechanisms underlying the environmental survival of Leptospira species but also for identifying virulence factors unique to Leptospira's pathogenic species. In this study, we aim to establish the transcription start site (TSS) landscape and the small RNA (sRNA) profile of L. biflexa serovar Patoc grown to exponential and stationary phases via differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) and small RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) analyses, respectively. Our dRNA-seq analysis uncovered a total of 2726 TSSs, which are also used to identify other elements, e.g., promoter and untranslated regions (UTRs). Besides, our sRNA-seq analysis revealed a total of 603 sRNA candidates, comprising 16 promoter-associated sRNAs, 184 5'UTR-derived sRNAs, 230 true intergenic sRNAs, 136 5'UTR-antisense sRNAs, and 130 open reading frame (ORF)-antisense sRNAs. In summary, these findings reflect the transcriptional complexity of L. biflexa serovar Patoc under different growth conditions and help to facilitate our understanding of regulatory networks in L. biflexa. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the TSS landscape of L. biflexa. The TSS and sRNA landscapes of L. biflexa can also be compared with its pathogenic counterparts, e.g., L. borgpetersenii and L. interrogans, to identify features contributing to their environmental survival and virulence.","['Cheah HL', 'Ahmed SA', 'Tang TH']",2023,39,4,World J Microbiol Biotechnol,"Cheah HL, et al.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients who underwent blood smear testing for malaria at the Emergency Department of the University Hospitals Leuven from 2017 to 2020. Patient characteristics, results of laboratory and radiological examinations, diagnoses, disease course and outcome were collected and analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 253 patients were included in the study. The majority of ill travellers returned from Sub-Saharan Africa (68.4%) and Southeast Asia (19.4%). Their diagnoses fell into three major syndrome categories: systemic febrile illness (30.8%), inflammatory syndrome of unknown origin (23.3%) and acute diarrhoea (18.2%). Malaria (15.8%) was the most common specific diagnosis in patients with systemic febrile illness, followed by influenza (5.1%), rickettsiosis (3.2%), dengue (1.6%), enteric fever (0.8%), chikungunya (0.8%) and leptospirosis (0.8%). The presence of hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia increased the probability of malaria, with a likelihood ratio of 4.01 and 6.03, respectively. Seven patients (2.8%) were treated in the intensive care unit, and none died.
CONCLUSION: Systemic febrile illness, inflammatory syndrome of unknown origin and acute diarrhoea were the three major syndromic categories in returning travellers presenting to our emergency department after a stay in a malaria-endemic country.

36779125,Severe Drug-Induced Liver Injury From Over-the-Counter Medication.,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is difficult to diagnose as it presents with a wide variety of clinical manifestations and there is no established specific biomarker. However, clinicians require expertise in diagnosing DILI as it can lead to critical illness, is relatively common, and can be caused by a variety of drugs, herbal medicines, and supplements. A 67-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with a fever, jaundice, and fatigue. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed no morphological abnormalities in the hepatobiliary system. On the third day of hospitalization, the liver damage and acute kidney injury progressed, and the patient was transferred to our intensive care unit. To further investigate the cause of multiple organ damage, the patient underwent repeated history taking and additional laboratory testing. In addition to the common causes of hepatic and renal damage, we also tested for rickettsiosis and leptospirosis, as the patient reported partaking regularly in outdoor leisure activities. On day seven of hospitalization, the patient recalled taking over-the-counter herbal flu medications approximately five days prior to admission; therefore, we suspected DILI and performed a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST). The DLST was positive for one drug. As other causes had been ruled out, the patient was diagnosed with severe DILI. The clinical course of the patient was observed with the patient's laboratory data and fever improving spontaneously. This case taught us several important lessons for the investigation of liver injury. Firstly, even with over-the-counter drugs, liver injury can be severe. Secondly, while the DLST is available for investigating DILI, false positives, especially for medicinal herbs, should be noted, and it is necessary to adequately rule out other diseases. Finally, when the cause of liver injury is unclear, patient history taking should be repeated carefully.","['Satoh K', 'Okuyama M', 'Hirasawa N', 'Nakae H']",2023,15,1,Cureus,"Satoh K, et al.

36773375,Time for change? A systematic review with meta-analysis of leptospires infecting dogs to assess vaccine compatibility in Brazil.,"Dogs are thought to be highly exposed to environmental pathogenic leptospires, possibly acting as potential sources of infection for zoonotic transmission. Vaccination stands as the cornerstone strategy to prevent disease and urinary shedding in dogs, yet the success of vaccination is highly dependent on the correspondence of leptospires circulating locally with those used in vaccine compositions. To provide evidence for vaccine compatibility, and to assess whether there are regional differences on serogroup distribution, we conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis on serological data, characterization of leptospiral isolates and risk factors for seropositivity in dogs from Brazil. Studies reporting canine leptospirosis within the Brazilian territory were eligible for inclusion, and methodology was validated by PROSPERO under registration CRD42020204187. Six electronic databases were searched, and data regarding population, methods, and outcomes were extracted. Sixty-one studies were included to access serogroup distribution and risk factors, with a pooled positivity rate of 19.7% in dog population. Serological evidence indicates that Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Autumnalis are the most frequently found serogroups. Twenty-eight records were included to access leptospiral strains isolated in Brazil, with n = 56 strains characterized as serogroups Canicola, n = 37 as Icterohaemorrhagiae, n = 2 as Pomona, and n = 1 strain as Australis and Sejroe each. Risk factor analysis revealed that stray dogs, puppies or elderly dogs, male dogs and dogs kept by tutors with poor social and economic conditions are at high risk for infection. The present study revealed overall good compatibility of leptospiral strains circulating locally with those used in vaccines against canine leptospirosis in Brazil. The circulation of serovars Pomona and Grippotyphosa has not been consistently demonstrated, and the inclusion of these serovars in local vaccines cannot be supported by our results. The results also provided serological evidence for the circulation of Serogroup Autumnalis among the studied populations.","['Esteves SB', 'Santos CM', 'Silva BCS', 'Salgado FF', 'Guilloux AGA', 'Cortez A', 'Lucco RC', 'Miotto BA']",2023,213,,Prev Vet Med,"Esteves SB, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was used the information deposited in the epidemiological bulletins of National System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Mexico. To determine spatial behavior, endemic channels and time series analyzes were constructed. The spatial statistical model Scan was used to determine the spatial behavior.
RESULTS: It was determined that leptospirosis cases in Mexico occur throughout the year, however endemic peaks were observed during the months of August, September and October. Regarding to spatial behavior, it was not statistically determined any aggrupation, nevertheless the States with the highest prevalence were Sinaloa with 146.7 cases per million of habitants and Tabasco with 142 cases per million of habitants.
DISCUSSION: Leptospirosis is a disease which is affected by habits and customs of the populations, as well as by climatological events, favoring the contact with the etiological agent, which coincides with that reported in other studies, in which it was determined that leptospirosis incidence increases during the rainy season, likewise, it was reported that this disease is related to recreational activities in tropical areas.

Currently, there are insufficient data on long-term renal dysfunction in patients after leptospirosis infection.
METHODS: A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted at 15 hospitals in the Sisaket province of Thailand. Confirmed leptospirosis patients admitted from December 1, 2015 to November 30, 2018 were followed between February 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020 (median 4.1 years after hospital discharge). The primary outcome was a composite of major kidney adverse events (MAKE) including all-cause mortality, dialysis, and new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD).
RESULTS: Of the 217 confirmed leptospirosis cases enrolled, 32.7% were classified as having severe leptospirosis. Fifteen cases (6.9%) were deceased at the time of hospital admission. After a median follow-up time of 4.18 years, 30 patients died and 33 patients developed CKD. Patients with severe leptospirosis had a significantly higher risk of MAKE (adjusted HR 2.45; 95%CI 1.44 - 4.18). Patients with ICU admission, pulmonary hemorrhage, and AKI also had a higher risk of MAKE and all-cause mortality. Participants with severe leptospirosis in the follow-up cohort showed a higher risk of developing CKD compared to non-severe leptospirosis (adjusted OR 3.22; 95%CI 1.04-9.96) especially renal magnesium and phosphate wasting.

The causal agents of this infectious disease are members of the genus Leptospira, known as pathogenic Leptospira spp. Specific clinical signs of the infection are difficult to detect. Therefore, the disease is normally under-diagnosed, mostly due to the lack of a cost-effective technique for diagnosing animals with a low bacterial load in their urine. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a qPCR coupled with a previous Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) step (IMS-qPCR) against a qPCR without using IMS, using a Bayesian latent class model (2 tests, 3 populations) to determine the leptospirosis infectious status in naturally infected dairy cattle. The results revealed that IMS qPCR had a sensitivity (Se) of 95.7% (95% Probability Interval (PI) = 85.0; 99.4%) and a specificity (Sp) of 98% (95% PI = 96.1; 99.4%), indicating that it is more sensitive than conventional qPCR (Se = 69.7% (95% PI = 59.2; 79.0%); median difference = 25.2% (Monte Carlo Error = 10.2%); and the Sp = 98.8% (95% PI = 97.6; 99.5%), median difference = 0.8% (Monte Carlo Error = 2.1%).

The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a native species in Croatia and, due to constant food availability and lack of interspecies competition, is becoming more abundant in urban and suburban areas. Although antibodies for Leptospira spp have been detected in red foxes, lethal disease has not been reported. We necropsied a young, male red fox that had jaundice, multifocal haemorrhages in the heart, lungs and urinary bladder, hepatomegaly, non-congestive splenomegaly and slight yellow discolouration of the renal cortex and medulla. Histology revealed multifocal haemorrhages in parenchymal organs, thrombi within lung septal capillaries and other blood vessels, interstitial lymphocytic and plasmacytic nephritis and erosions of the gastric mucosa. A microscopic agglutination test on the post-mortem cardiac blood clot revealed a high titre to Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae, which implies contact with rats, which are natural reservoirs of this serovar in Croatia. The gross and histological findings in this fox were similar to those in dogs with leptospirosis, indicating that fatal leptospirosis can occur in foxes and suggesting that this species can act as a source of infection for other animals and humans.","['Huber D', 'Habuš J', 'Turk N', 'Vinicki K', 'Šoštarić-Zuckermann IC']",2023,201,,J Comp Pathol,"Huber D, et al.

Hydrometeorological averages and extremes have been used before as drivers in the statistical prediction of disease. However, their importance and predictive capacity are still little known. In this study, the use of a random forest classifier was explored to analyze the relative importance of hydrometeorological indices in developing the leptospirosis model and to evaluate the performance of models based on the type of indices used, using case data from three districts in Kelantan, Malaysia, that experience annual monsoonal rainfall and flooding. First, hydrometeorological data including rainfall, streamflow, water level, relative humidity, and temperature were transformed into 164 weekly average and extreme indices in accordance with the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Then, weekly case occurrences were classified into binary classes ""high"" and ""low"" based on an average threshold. Seventeen models based on ""average,"" ""extreme,"" and ""mixed"" indices were trained by optimizing the feature subsets based on the model computed mean decrease Gini (MDG) scores. The variable importance was assessed through cross-correlation analysis and the MDG score. The average and extreme models showed similar prediction accuracy ranges (61.5-76.1% and 72.3-77.0%) while the mixed models showed an improvement (71.7-82.6% prediction accuracy). An extreme model was the most sensitive while an average model was the most specific. The time lag associated with the driving indices agreed with the seasonality of the monsoon. The rainfall variable (extreme) was the most important in classifying the leptospirosis occurrence while streamflow was the least important despite showing higher correlations with leptospirosis.","['Jayaramu V', 'Zulkafli Z', 'De Stercke S', 'Buytaert W', 'Rahmat F', 'Abdul Rahman RZ', 'Ishak AJ', 'Tahir W', 'Ab Rahman J', 'Mohd Fuzi NMH']",2023,67,3,Int J Biometeorol,"Jayaramu V, et al.

36708032,Infections in travellers returning to the UK: a retrospective analysis (2015-2020).,"BACKGROUND: Every year, many thousands of travellers return to the United Kingdom (UK) from visits to other countries and some will become unwell due to infections acquired abroad. Many imported infections have similar clinical presentations, such as fever and myalgia, so diagnostic testing is an important tool to improve patient management and outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the demographics, travel history, presenting symptoms and diagnostic outcomes of referrals to the UK's specialist diagnostic Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) for the period 2015-2020.
METHODS: Anonymised clinical and laboratory data were extracted from RIPL's Laboratory Information Management System and cleaned prior to descriptive analysis of the data. Travel history data were mapped to one of eight world regions, whereas symptom data were categorised into presenting syndromes. Diagnostic data were categorised as either positive, equivocal or negative.
RESULTS: During the period 2015-2020, RIPL received 73 951 samples from 53 432 patients suspected of having infections that are rare in the UK. The most common age group for unwell returning travellers was 30-39 years and the most commonly reported travel destination was Southern and SE Asia. Dengue virus was the most diagnosed infection overall, followed by chikungunya, Zika, leptospirosis and spotted fever group Rickettsia. Dengue virus was among the top three most frequent diagnoses for all world regions except Europe and represented 62.5% of all confirmed/probable diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the top five infections diagnosed by RIPL in travellers are vaccine-preventable, therefore understanding traveller demographics, destination-specific risk factors and encouraging preventative behaviours is the best available strategy to reduce the number of returning travellers who become infected. Prompt referral of acute samples with a detailed travel history, including purpose of travel and activities undertaken as well as dates and destinations can be a valuable tool in designing public health interventions and diagnostic algorithms.","['Warner JC', 'Hatziioanou D', 'Osborne JC', 'Bailey DJ', 'Brooks TJG', 'Semper AE']",2023,30,2,J Travel Med,"Warner JC, et al.

36700601,Kidney Injury Biomarkers in Leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection with a global distribution, though it has a greater impact on marginalized rural agricultural and urban communities in developing countries. Kidney injury, which can lead to severe and lethal infections, is the most frequent complication associated with leptospirosis. Novel biomarkers are being studied as tools for assessing kidney injury in different pathological processes to improve early detection. This review aimed to gather information on the use of novel kidney biomarkers for human leptospirosis. A search of the literature was carried out in September 2021 using the parameters ""((kidney) OR (renal) OR (chronic kidney disease) OR (acute kidney injury)) AND ((biomarker) OR (marker)) AND ((Leptospira) OR (leptospirosis))"". The review identified 11 original studies that evaluated the performance of 15 kidney biomarkers related to leptospirosis. Assessment of the evidence for biomarker utility was limited because of the small number of studies and sample sizes. Although some biomarkers were associated with kidney disease, no specific biomarker appeared to be ready for clinical practice, and more research in this field is necessary.","['Uribe-Restrepo P', 'Munoz-Zanzi C', 'Agudelo-Flórez P']",2023,56,,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,"Uribe-Restrepo P, et al.

36692076,"Investigation and response to a large outbreak of leptospirosis in field workers in Lower Saxony, Germany.","Between June and August 2014, 45 cases of leptospirosis were notified among workers on two strawberry farms in North-West Germany. We describe the characteristics of the outbreak and the actions taken to prevent further cases. The activities of the local, federal and national public health and veterinary authorities included collection of case data, laboratory testing of human specimens and of small mammals trapped on the fields, investigation of weather data, as well as information provided to farmers, field workers, physicians and to the authorities in Poland and Romania. Of the 45 identified cases (median age 22, 60% male), 47% were hospitalized. Characteristic symptoms were fever ≥38.5°C, generalized muscle pain and an increase in renal or liver enzymes. Thirteen cases were laboratory confirmed by serological and/or molecular methods. ELISA tests for Leptospira IgG and IgM-antibodies were positive in those samples taken >5 days after hospitalization. The probable causative agent was identified as Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa. Leptospira-specific DNA was found in kidneys of 67% of 64 trapped small mammals and was further identified as Leptospira kirschneri multi locus sequence type 110. During the estimated time period of human infections, the affected region faced warm weather with heavy rainfalls. The results of this investigation are in accordance with the theory of a chain of infection from mice to field workers during warm and humid weather. In 2015, a campaign was initiated to inform physicians, farmers and workers to enhance prevention measures, such as the use of personal protective equipment and early consultation of physicians in case of illness. Since then, no further outbreak occurred.","['Dreesman J', 'Toikkanen S', 'Runge M', 'Hamschmidt L', 'Lüsse B', 'Freise JF', 'Ehlers J', 'Nöckler K', 'Knorr C', 'Keller B', 'Mayer-Scholl A']",2023,70,4,Zoonoses Public Health,"Dreesman J, et al.

36668913,Leptospira borgpetersenii Leucine-Rich Repeat Proteins Provide Strong Protective Efficacy as Novel Leptospiral Vaccine Candidates.,"Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins are advocated for being assessed in vaccine development. Leptospiral LRR proteins were identified recently in silico from the genome of Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroup Sejroe, the seroprevalence of leptospiral infections of cattle in Thailand. Two LRR recombinant proteins, rKU_Sej_LRR_2012M (2012) and rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 (2271), containing predicted immunogenic epitopes, were investigated for their cross-protective efficacies in an acute leptospirosis model with heterologous Leptospira serovar Pomona, though, strains from serogroup Sejroe are host-adapted to bovine, leading to chronic disease. Since serovar Pomona is frequently reported as seropositive in cattle, buffaloes, pigs, and dogs in Thailand and causes acute and severe leptospirosis in cattle by incidental infection, the serogroup Sejroe LRR proteins were evaluated for their cross-protective immunity. The protective efficacies were 37.5%, 50.0%, and 75.0% based on the survival rate for the control, 2012, and 2271 groups, respectively. Sera from 2012-immunized hamsters showed weak bactericidal action compared to sera from 2271-immunized hamsters (p < 0.05). Therefore, bacterial tissue clearances, inflammatory responses, and humoral and cell-mediated immune (HMI and CMI) responses were evaluated only in 2271-immunized hamsters challenged with virulent L. interrogans serovar Pomona. The 2271 protein induced prompt humoral immune responses (p < 0.05) and leptospiral tissue clearance, reducing tissue inflammation in immunized hamsters. In addition, protein 2271 and its immunogenic peptides stimulated splenocyte lymphoproliferation and stimulated both HMI and CMI responses by activating Th1 and Th2 cytokine gene expression in vaccinated hamsters. Our data suggest that the immunogenic potential renders rhKU_Sej_LRR_2271 protein a promising candidate for the development of a novel cross-protective vaccine against animal leptospirosis.","['Prapong S', 'Tansiri Y', 'Sritrakul T', 'Sripattanakul S', 'Sopitthummakhun A', 'Katzenmeier G', 'Hsieh CL', 'McDonough SP', 'Prapong T', 'Chang YF']",2022,8,1,Trop Med Infect Dis,"Prapong S, et al.

36662608,Proteomic analysis of canine vaccines.,"OBJECTIVE: To use proteomic analysis to identify qualitatively and quantitatively mammalian protein components of commercial veterinary vaccines against canine distemper, leptospirosis, borreliosis, and rabies.
SAMPLE: 25 licensed veterinary vaccines (from 4 different manufacturers) against canine distemper and leptospirosis, borreliosis, and rabies (3-year and 1-year durations of immunity).
PROCEDURES: Duplicate samples from a single-lot vial of each vaccine were prepared by acetone precipitation and proteolysis with trypsin and Lys-C protease mix. Peptides mixtures (1 μg) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy data were searched against a Bos taurus protein database using MaxQuant to identify and quantify mammalian proteins in the vaccines. Identified proteins were classified by function and network analysis to visualize interactions.
RESULTS: The largest number of mammalian proteins was identified in 3-year rabies vaccines (median, 243 proteins; range, 184 to 339 proteins) and 1-year rabies vaccines (median, 193 proteins; range, 169 to 350 proteins). Borrelia and leptospirosis-distemper (L&D) vaccines had the lowest number of proteins. Rabies vaccines had the highest number of identified proteins in common (n = 316); 33 were unique to 1-year products and 44 were found in 3-year products. Borrelia and L&D vaccines had 16 and 22 uniquely identified proteins, respectively. The protein classifications were primarily modulators of protein-binding activity, enzymes, transfer-carrier proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, defense-immunity proteins, calcium-binding proteins, and extracellular matrix proteins.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates proteomics application to evaluate quality differences among different vaccines, identifying potential stimulants of desirable and undesirable immune responses.","['Franco J', 'Aryal UK', 'HogenEsch H', 'Moore GE']",2023,84,3,Am J Vet Res,"Franco J, et al.

36642015,Multisectoral prioritization of zoonotic diseases in Haryana (India) using one health approach.,"Zoonotic diseases have huge livestock and public health burden worldwide, including India. Prioritizing zoonotic diseases is one of the important tasks under 'One Health' as it facilitates effective policy making, proper allocation of resources and promotion of multisectoral collaboration. Although some efforts have been made to prioritizing zoonotic diseases at national level in India, it is important to identify priority diseases in regional settings due to wide variation in climate and demography of different states. Therefore, the present study aims to prioritize zoonotic diseases for the state of Haryana (India). One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) tool was used in this study to prioritize zoonotic diseases. Based on literature review of the past 23 years (2000-2022) on prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of zoonotic diseases, twenty-three high-scoring zoonotic diseases in Haryana and neighboring states of India were initially shortlisted for prioritization. A three-day participatory workshop was conducted involving 17 experts representing the Health, Animal Husbandry and Wildlife departments of Haryana. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank the criteria, which were used to score the selected diseases using the decision tree analysis. The participants selected the following 7 criteria along with their relative weights to score the diseases: (1) Severity of disease in humans, (2) Severity of disease in animals, (3) Presence of disease in the region, (4) Transmission and outbreak potential, (5) Socio-economic impact, (6) Availability of interventions, and (7) Existing inter-sectoral collaboration for surveillance and reporting. The top scoring eight diseases selected as priority zoonotic diseases for Haryana were rabies, Japanese encephalitis, bovine tuberculosis, leptospirosis, avian influenza (H5N1), brucellosis, glanders and Influenza A (H1N1). Sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant variation in prioritization results by varying criteria weights. This is the first systemic attempt to prioritize zoonotic diseases in the state and this will help in formulating effective monitoring, prevention, and control strategies for zoonotic diseases in the regional settings.","['Thukral H', 'Shanmugasundaram K', 'Riyesh T', 'Kumar N', 'Singha H', 'Gambhir D', 'Laura A', 'Tiwari S', 'Gulati BR']",2023,212,,Prev Vet Med,"Thukral H, et al.

36634544,Pinnipeds carriers of pathogenic Leptospira: New data based on molecular characterization.,"Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by the infection of pathogenic strains of the genus Leptospira, endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. Although well documented in terrestrial animals and humans, little information is available on its distribution and impact on marine animals. Despite clinical manifestations that may occur, the occurrence of carriers was suggested in some species. Nevertheless, there are few studies regarding the infection by Leptospira sp. in marine mammals. In this context, and considering the One Health approach, the present aimed to investigate pinnipeds' role as Leptospira sp. carriers. Kidneys of 47 pinnipeds of two species, Arctocephalus australis (n = 40) and Arctocephalus tropicalis (n = 7) were collected. DNA was extracted and the diagnosis was performed through LipL32-PCR and genetic characterization based on secY gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype networks were constructed. Pathogenic Leptospira sp. DNA was detected in 31.9% (15/47) of the tested pinnipeds. It was possible to amplify and sequence eight strains (6 for A. australis, 2 for A. tropicalis), all identified as L. interrogans, with high similarity with sequences from Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup. Phylogenetic analysis revealed sequences from the present study grouped in species-specific unique clusters, but very close to others from humans, wild animals, and domestic animals. We demonstrate that pinnipeds could act as carriers, and play an important role in leptospirosis dynamics.","['Torres FD', 'Borges ALDSB', 'Kolesnikovas C', 'Domit C', 'Barbosa CB', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Di Azevedo MIN', 'Lilenbaum W']",2023,155,,Res Vet Sci,"Torres FD, et al.

36624720,Revisiting the Overlooked Infection: Rickettsioses.,"The prevalence of human Rickettsioses cases in Indonesia is unknown and could probably be underestimated. The high prevalence of seropositive Rickettsia sp. was reported in small mammals (as vectors) and humans. In Indonesia, a recent study in patients with acute fever revealed that the prevalence of Rickettsioses is 10%. Many cases of Rickettsioses were often misdiagnosed with dengue fever, enteric fever, or leptospirosis due to their overlapping clinical manifestation. The limitation of point of care testing in Indonesia hindered the adequacy of diagnosis confirmation. Appropriate empirical or definitive treatment with macrolide, mainly doxycycline, is preferable compared to other broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporin or quinolones. Moreover, when left untreated, Rickettsioses may deteriorate progressively to fatal outcomes, such as meningitis, sepsis, and even death. The awareness of health care practitioners, the availability of confirmatory rapid diagnostic tests and adequate treatment choices are important in eradicating this disease.","['Lie KC', 'Nelwan EJ', 'Pasaribu A', 'Shakinah S', 'Sinto R', 'Nainggolan L']",2022,54,4,Acta Med Indones,"Lie KC, et al.

36623480,Case Report: An Imported Case of Severe Leptospirosis with Septic Cardiomyopathy Requiring Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Japan.,"A 29-year-old Japanese man presenting with fever, joint pain, and diarrhea was admitted to the intensive care unit for cardiogenic and distributive shock. We suspected leptospirosis based on conjunctival hyperemia, skin rash, elevated bilirubin, and renal involvement; a travel history to Laos was also suggestive. We confirmed the diagnosis with blood and urine polymerase chain reaction and microscopic agglutination tests using paired serum samples. His hemodynamics were unstable, and his echocardiogram showed diffuse and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction on day 2. He initially required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) support but responded and recovered on antimicrobial therapy. His cardiac function and hemodynamics improved on day 5. Severe leptospirosis may cause jaundice, renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and central nervous system involvement; however, few studies have reported severe cardiac manifestations. Herein, we report the first case of septic cardiomyopathy secondary to leptospirosis that was successfully managed with V-A ECMO. Leptospirosis should be included in the differential diagnosis when a patient returning from an endemic area presents with cardiogenic shock. Furthermore, intensive care management with prompt initiation of V-A ECMO should be considered to reverse septic cardiomyopathy.","['Goto T', 'Oda R', 'Norisue Y', 'Koizumi N']",2023,108,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Goto T, et al.

Treatment covering leptospirosis was commenced, and she improved clinically, and her cell counts returned to normal. Pancytopenia is a rare manifestation of leptospirosis and has only been reported in a handful of case studies.

36602965,Leptospira interrogans Prevents Macrophage Cell Death and Pyroptotic IL-1β Release through Its Atypical Lipopolysaccharide.,"Leptospira interrogans are bacteria that can infect all vertebrates and are responsible for leptospirosis, a neglected zoonosis. Some hosts, such as humans, are susceptible to the disease, whereas mice are resistant and get chronically colonized. Although leptospires escape recognition by some immune receptors, they activate the NOD-like receptor pyrin 3-inflammasome and trigger IL-1β secretion. Classically, IL-1β secretion is associated with lytic inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis, resulting from cytosolic LPS binding to inflammatory caspases, such as caspase 11. Interestingly, we showed that L. interrogans and Leptospira biflexa do not trigger cell death in either murine, human, hamster, or bovine macrophages, escaping both pyroptosis and apoptosis. We showed, in murine cells, that the mild IL-1β secretion induced by leptospires occurred through nonlytic caspase 8-dependent gasdermin D pore formation and not through activation of caspase 11/noncanonical inflammasome. Strikingly, we demonstrated a potent antagonistic effect of pathogenic L. interrogans and their atypical LPS on spontaneous and Escherichia coli LPS-induced cell death. Indeed, LPS of L. interrogans efficiently prevents caspase 11 dimerization and subsequent massive gasdermin D cleavage. Finally, we showed that pyroptosis escape by leptospires prevents massive IL-1β release, and we consistently found no major role of IL-1R in controlling experimental leptospirosis in vivo. Overall, to our knowledge, our findings described a novel mechanism by which leptospires dampen inflammation, thus potentially contributing to their stealthiness.","['Bonhomme D', 'Hernandez-Trejo V', 'Papadopoulos S', 'Pigache R', ""Fanton d'Andon M"", 'Outlioua A', 'Boneca IG', 'Werts C']",2023,210,4,J Immunol,"Bonhomme D, et al.

A total of 305 blood and 305 urine samples were collected from organized farms (n = 44), individually housed animals (n = 81) and animals from the slaughterhouse (n = 180). Microscopic agglutination test was carried out to detect anti‑leptospiral antibodies. Dark‑field microscopic examination and culture of urine were done to detect and isolate the Leptospira. The isolated Leptospira were identified by cross‑agglutination test and gene sequencing. PCR and real‑time PCR were carried out to detect leptospiral genomic DNA in urine samples to detect the shedders. The anti‑leptospiral antibodies were detected in 6.2% of animals. The Leptospira genomic DNA was detected in 9.2% (28 of 305) of urine samples. Of the 28 Leptospira positive urine samples, 39.2% were from animals with clinical signs suggestive of leptospirosis and 60.8% Leptospira positive samples were from slaughterhouse animals.

36581810,Cerebral infarct induced by severe leptospirosis-a case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Although most leptospirosis is mild, the severe form can cause multiple complications, with a fatality rate of over 50% even with ICU support. The clinical manifestations of leptospirosis vary depending on organs and tissues involved. Both cerebral artery and coronary artery can be damaged by leptospirosis. Although cerebral arteritis induced by leptospirosis has been reported, cerebral infarction caused by leptospirosis is rarely reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 79-year-old man admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) because of 3 days duration of fever, bloody sputum and dyspnea. Five days before he was admitted to hospital, he had harvested rice in flooded fields. After admission, leptospira interrogans DNA sequence was identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) showed the serum antibody of Mini serovars was 1,600 and Hebdomadis serovars was 800. On the eighth day of admission, the patient noted left hemiplegia. Cranial CT scan revealed low-density shadow in the right basal ganglia, so cerebral infarction was diagnosed. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated and he died on the eleventh day of admission despite penicillin treatment, invasive mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement support.
CONCLUSION: Neurologic leptospirosis manifested as cerebral occlusion, although rare, might be deadly and should not be ignored.","['Zhu Z', 'Feng J', 'Dong Y', 'Jiang B', 'Wang X', 'Li F']",2022,22,1,BMC Neurol,"Zhu Z, et al.

36567442,Leptospirosis-induced acute acquired inflammatory neuropathy.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection that can present with neurological manifestations. Although uncommon, it may affect the peripheral nervous system in the form of polyradiculoneuropathy. We report the case of a 30-year-old male who developed flaccid tetraparesis and multiple cranial neuropathies on the fourteenth day of admission to the intensive care unit for fever and multi-organ failure. We also review the existing literature about peripheral nerve damage in leptospirosis and present our hypothesis on the possible pathogenic mechanisms. Electrophysiological findings were consistent with acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and extensive blood tests were positive for leptospiral IgM and IgG antibodies. Treatment with plasmapheresis was begun, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and the patient improved slowly. Our work adds to the evidence of leptospirosis infection as a cause of acute demyelinating polyneuropathy. The possibility that leptospirosis-polyradiculoneuropathy may be caused by an immune pathogenesis emphasizes the importance of identifying this entity because immunomodulatory therapy could play a vital role in the recovery process.","['Xucla-Ferrarons T', 'Turon-Sans J', 'Caballero-Avila M', 'Cortes-Vicente E', 'Rojas-Garcia R']",2023,28,1,J Peripher Nerv Syst,"Xucla-Ferrarons T, et al.

36566953,The value of pre-exposure prophylaxis: A case series of US Marines infected with leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an ever-present threat found in the freshwater areas in many tropical and sub-tropical regions throughout the world and travelers to these areas are at increased risk of infection. This study describes a case series of 47 US Marines who experienced a single point leptospirosis exposure in 2014 and were admitted to a military treatment facility.
METHODS: Descriptive statistics were conducted for patient demographics, symptoms, laboratory results, and outcomes. Hypothesis tests were conducted to identify significant outcomes (length of hospitalization, severity of infection, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and cholecystectomy). Patient data was applied to five leptospirosis scoring models to assess their accuracy in the context of this population.
RESULTS: The patients were all male (n = 47, 100%), had a median age of 22 (range 19-37), a mean body mass index of 24.3 (SD 2.5), and most were taking antibiotic prophylaxis (n = 40, 85.1%). Most patients experienced thrombocytopenia (n = 37, 78.7%), proteinuria (n = 35, 74.5%), and transaminitis (n = 37, 78.7%). Correct classification of infection varied among the models from 42.6% (n = 20) to 10.6% (n = 5). Not taking pre-exposure prophylaxis was significantly correlated with severe infection (p = 0.02), undergoing a cholecystectomy (p = 0.01), and being admitted to the ICU (p < 0.01). No other results were found to be both clinically and statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis diagnostic models currently in use may be less effective in predicting disease severity in young and healthy populations who are taking antibiotic prophylaxis. The use of pre-exposure prophylaxis significantly correlates with less severe health outcomes.","['Hall MT', 'Do TA', 'Shusko MP']",2023,52,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Hall MT, et al.

36526310,"Distribution, frequency and clinical presentation of leptospirosis and coinfections: a systematic review protocol.","INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with high prevalence in low-income and middle-income countries and tropical and subtropical regions. The clinical symptoms of the disease are similar to symptoms presented by other endemic infectious diseases that could be present simultaneously. Thus, leptospirosis could be masked by similar infections like dengue, malaria, hantavirus, melioidosis and borreliosis, among others. Therefore, leptospirosis could present itself as an under-reported infection or as a coinfection with another pathogen, as has been reported in the literature. However, there is a lack of documented evidence about the specific risk factors of leptospirosis infection, the symptoms, the coinfection's mortality and the frequency of coinfection. Additionally, leptospirosis coinfections have not been considered a neglected public health concern. Therefore, this systematic review aims to evaluate published articles that show the risk factors associated with leptospirosis infection and coinfection with other pathogens.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The search process to identify eligible studies will be conducted including the LILACS, ProQuest, PubMed and Scopus databases with no restriction in terms of publication date. Also, grey literature will be included in the research. Authors will independently screen the title and abstracts of the articles identified from the search using Rayyan free software. Eligibility criteria include peer-reviewed research articles written in English or Spanish, including observational studies, cohorts, case-control, cross-sectional, ecological studies and report cases. The systematic review will include studies that report descriptions of leptospirosis cases with coinfection or co-occurrence. The search will be accomplished by articles from 1950 to May 2022. The data will be extracted in a standard extraction form using an Excel format.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Also, findings will be disseminated through scientific meetings. Ethical approval will not be required as this is a systematic review and primary data will be not collected or included.

36514136,Evidence of orthohantavirus and leptospira infections in small mammals in an endemic area of Gampaha district in Sri Lanka.,"BACKGROUND: Orthohantaviruses and leptospira are emerging zoonotic pathogens of high public health significance. The epidemiology of orthohantavirus infections and leptospirosis is similar and presents related clinical pictures in humans. However, a paucity of data on actual reservoir hosts for orthohantaviruses and leptospira exists. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the occurrence of orthohantaviruses and leptospira in small mammals captured in an endemic region of Sri Lanka.
METHODS: Rodents and shrews were morphologically and/or genetically identified using morphological keys and DNA barcoding techniques targeting the cytochrome oxidase b subunit gene (Cytb). Lung tissues and sera were subsequently analyzed for the presence of orthohantavirus RNA using qRT-PCR. Sera of rats were tested for IgG antibodies against orthohantaviruses and leptospira.
RESULTS: Forty-three (43) small mammals representing: Rattus (R.) rattus (black rat) or R. tanezumi (Asian rat), Suncus murinus (Asian house shrew), R. norvegicus (brown rat) and Mus musculus (house mouse) were investigated. No orthohantavirus RNA was detected from the lung tissue or serum samples of these animals. Elevated levels of IgG antibodies against Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) and/or Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV) antigens were detected in sera of 28 (72%) out of the 39 rats analysed. Interestingly, 36 (92%) of the 39 rats also showed presence of anti leptospira-IgG antibodies in their serum, representing dual infection or dual exposure in 26/39 (66.7%) of examined rats.
CONCLUSIONS: This project targets important public health questions concerning the occupational risk of orthohantavirus infections and/or leptospirosis in an endemic region of Sri Lanka. Most rats (72%) in our study displayed antibodies reacting to orthohantavirus NP antigens, related to PUUV and/or SEOV. No correlation between the orthohantavirus and leptospira IgG antibody levels were noticed. Finally, a combination of both morphological and DNA barcoding approaches revealed that several species of rats may play a role in the maintenance and transmission of orthohantavirus and leptospira in Sri Lanka.","['Sunil-Chandra NP', 'Fahlman Å', 'Waidyarathna S', 'Näslund J', 'Jayasundara MVML', 'Wesula LO', 'Bucht G']",2022,4,1,One Health Outlook,"Sunil-Chandra NP, et al.

36508469,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiology of Leptospirosis in HIV uninfected and in people living with HIV from the Southern African Development Community.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an occupational, neglected febrile disease of bacterial origin transmitted between humans and animals. In this manuscript we summarize available data on Leptospira infection in HIV uninfected and in people living with HIV from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, identifying gaps in knowledge and recommend future research priorities.
METHODOLOGY: Articles published between 1990 and 2021 were accessed by an online search of Google Scholar and Medline/PubMed performed between February 2020 and July 2022. The STATA program was used for the Meta-analysis. Pooled prevalence values with 95% confidence intervals and heterogeneity were determined.
RESULTS: Thirty studies from eight SADC countries, reporting the prevalence on Leptospira were reviewed. A pooled prevalence of 19% (CI: 13-25%), a heterogeneity level of 96% and index score ranging from 2 to 9 was determined. Only four (4) studies reported HIV co-infection status. Three species of Leptospira (Leptospira interrogans (4), L. kirschneri (3), Leptospira borgpetersenii (1) and 23 serogroups were identified. The most frequently reported serogroups were Icterohaemorrhagiae (13), Grippotyphosa and Australis (10) followed by Sejroe (8).
CONCLUSION: Studies on human leptospirosis in the SADC region are scarce, especially in people living with HIV. Additional studies aimed at determining the prevalence and the role of the pathogen in people living with HIV, including detailed clinical, molecular and demographic data are recommended.","['Comia IR', 'Miambo RD', 'Noormahomed EV', 'Mahoche M', 'Pondja A', 'Schooley RT', 'Benson C', 'Sacarlal J']",2022,16,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Comia IR, et al.

36496262,Gauge against the machine: revisiting quality for multi-targeted serology platforms.,"Diagnosis of infections of public health significance, such as leptospirosis, often present challenges for laboratories. To counter common challenges and ensure quality driven health responses, rigorous validation and verification processes are required. Despite such rigor, however, can one be certain laboratory reports are truly reflective of infection, given the risk of rare, but potentially very significant quality oversights? Here we present a real-world scenario where diagnosis of leptospirosis cases was compromised over a 6-year period despite quality measures suggesting a well performing serological assay. A subsequent investigation revealed this was attributed to the programming of an automated microtitration plate analyser, evading detection by both quality control and external quality assurance processes. The quality oversight provides insight into potential limitations in quality processes in multi-targeted serological platforms.","['Elias A', 'Tilbrook L', 'Gray T', 'Varadhan H', 'George CRR']",2023,55,1,Pathology,"Elias A, et al.

For assessment of immunity of the vaccine serum antibodies were detected before and after vaccination and challenge in three studies. The effects of the challenge were determined by a variety of parameters including reisolation of the challenge Leptospira spp. via blood, urine, and kidney samples. The challenge strain did not produce generalised infection but elevated circulating antibody levels in both the control and vaccinated dogs in any of the three studies, however leptospires were reisolated from the urine of the control dogs but not the vaccinated dogs. Cytokine levels (TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-4) were detected post-challenge in the vaccinated dogs to determine the immune profile response. The whole-killed cell vaccine in this study did not prevent leptospireamia but prevented leptospiruria in vaccinated dogs after a challenge with a live Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiea Copenhageni. The vaccine-challenge showed increased antibody (MAT) levels due to vaccination and infection (through challenge).

36468592,Spatio-temporal analysis of leptospirosis in Brazil and its relationship with flooding.,"Leptospirosis is a serious public health problem in Brazil, which can be observed after flooding events. Using an exploratory mixed clustering method, this ecological study analyzes whether spatial-temporal clustering patterns of leptospirosis occur in Brazil. Data from the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) were used to calculate the prevalence of leptospirosis between 2007 and 2017 in all counties of the country. Clustering techniques, including spatial association indicators, were used for analysis and evaluation of disease yearly spatial distribution. Based on Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) with Empirical Bayesian rates detected spatial patterns of leptospirosis ranging from 0.137 (p = 0.001 in 2009) to 0.293 (p = 0.001 in 2008). Over the whole period, the rate was 0.388 (p = 0.001). The main pattern showed permanence of leptospirosis clusters in the South and emergence and permanence of such clusters in northern Brazil. The municipalities with leptospirosis cases and at least one flood occurrence registered in the Brazilian Integrated Disaster Information System were incorporated into the LISA cluster map with Empirical Bayesian rates. These counties were expected to exhibit clustering, not all did. The results of the cluster analysis suggest allocation of health resources in areas with leptospirosis clustering.","['Nardoni Marteli A', 'Guasselli LA', 'Diament D', 'Wink GO', 'Vasconcelos VV']",2022,17,2,Geospat Health,"Nardoni Marteli A, et al.

The outbreaks are typically related to floods and hurricanes following monsoon rains, during which Leptospiras are washed off in contaminated soil and often settle in water bodies. Wildlife trapping for scientific purposes, industrial animal employment, water-intensive crop farming, sewage work, and open-water swimming are one of the major risk factors contributing to the rapid spread of disease. Occasionally, outbreaks are linked to higher-than-average precipitation and exposure to contaminated floodwaters that may have contributed to a sudden spike in leptospirosis cases in New Caledonia, Fiji, Vanuatu, and Tanzania. This amplifies the risk of leptospirosis in Pakistan and other nations with urban floods. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to address this health emergency considering the recent surge in leptospirosis cases.","['Rehan ST', 'Ali E', 'Sheikh A', 'Nashwan AJ']",2023,248,,Int J Hyg Environ Health,"Rehan ST, et al.

36458294,Evaluating immunochromatographic test kits for diagnosis of acute human leptospirosis: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a common zoonotic infection in developing countries, usually progresses to severe conditions and poor outcomes when not detected early. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and culture are available but are not accessible in all areas and are usually confined to specialized laboratories. There are several available immunochromatographic test kits (ICT) that offer ease of use, access, and affordability, but diagnostic accuracy is not yet well established. In this paper, we aim to review published literature on the use of ICTs for the detection of leptospirosis and evaluate their diagnostic efficiency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar), including gray literature sources for published research articles as of April 13, 2022, on the diagnosis of acute leptospirosis using ICT. We assessed the methodological quality of each article using the revised QUADAS-2.
RESULTS: From a total of 41 articles, 30 (73.2%) were identified as potentially relevant after reviewing the title and abstract and eliminating duplicate articles; then, 22 (53.7%) articles were included after scrutinizing and applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria to the full text.

36422940,One Health: An Effective and Ethical Approach to Leptospirosis Control in Australia.,"The increasing concerns over emerging infectious diseases and potential pandemics led to the formation of One Health, a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to address the risks from human-animal-ecosystem interactions. This multi-sectoral approach is specifically important in Australia, a biodiverse country with unique flora, fauna, and many infectious diseases, including leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is a relatively rare but potentially fatal zoonosis, with an attributed mortality of around 60,000 deaths per year worldwide. In recent years, sporadic cases and alarming outbreaks of leptospirosis have been notified in many states and territories of Australia, noteworthily in 2018 and 2019. The sudden outbreaks in these two years have raised a question about the possibility of a more severe menace or a potential threat to both humans and animals. Amid the fight against leptospirosis, One Health has been shown to be an excellent and ideal framework, especially in Australia, the country that has taken the lead in zoonosis control using this approach. In this review, the focus will be put on the effectiveness and ethics of One Health in leptospirosis control under the Australian setting to further advocate the implementation of this framework for many other infectious diseases.","['Pham HT', 'Tran MH']",2022,7,11,Trop Med Infect Dis,Pham HT and Tran MH.

36422627,An Overview of Anthropogenic Actions as Drivers for Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonotic Diseases.,"Population growth and industrialization have led to a race for greater food and supply productivity. As a result, the occupation and population of forest areas, contact with wildlife and their respective parasites and vectors, the trafficking and consumption of wildlife, the pollution of water sources, and the accumulation of waste occur more frequently. Concurrently, the agricultural and livestock production for human consumption has accelerated, often in a disorderly way, leading to the deforestation of areas that are essential for the planet's climatic and ecological balance. The effects of human actions on other ecosystems such as the marine ecosystem cause equally serious damage, such as the pollution of this habitat, and the reduction of the supply of fish and other animals, causing the coastal population to move to the continent. The sum of these factors leads to an increase in the demands such as housing, basic sanitation, and medical assistance, making these populations underserved and vulnerable to the effects of global warming and to the emergence of emerging and re-emerging diseases. In this article, we discuss the anthropic actions such as climate changes, urbanization, deforestation, the trafficking and eating of wild animals, as well as unsustainable agricultural intensification which are drivers for emerging and re-emerging of zoonotic pathogens such as viral (Ebola virus, hantaviruses, Hendravirus, Nipah virus, rabies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease-2), bacterial (leptospirosis, Lyme borreliosis, and tuberculosis), parasitic (leishmaniasis) and fungal pathogens, which pose a substantial threat to the global community. Finally, we shed light on the urgent demand for the implementation of the One Health concept as a collaborative global approach to raise awareness and educate people about the science behind and the battle against zoonotic pathogens to mitigate the threat for both humans and animals.","['Tazerji SS', 'Nardini R', 'Safdar M', 'Shehata AA', 'Duarte PM']",2022,11,11,Pathogens,"Tazerji SS, et al.

36384433,Undetected serovars: leptospirosis cases in the Cairns region during the 2021 wet season.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis infection can lead to serious renal and cardiopulmonary complications and can be fatal. Following heavy rainfall and localised flooding in early 2021, Tropical Public Health Services in Cairns were alerted to an increase in leptospirosis cases in the region, with notifications almost three times higher than usual by mid-February. An epidemiological investigation was undertaken.
METHODS: Leptospirosis notification data were obtained from the Queensland Notifiable Conditions System. Confirmed and probable cases residing in the Cairns region, with an onset date between 1 January and 31 May 2021, were included in the investigation. Case demographics, pathology results, symptoms, hospital stay information and presumed exposure sources were obtained from Queensland Health records; local rainfall data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Case characteristics and rainfall were compared to the prior ten-year period and the distribution of cases by week of onset, address, exposure source and infecting serovar analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 43 leptospirosis cases were notified between January and May 2021, the highest number recorded for the region since 2011. Presumed exposure sources were available for 40 cases (93.0%), with 33 cases (82.5%) exposed occupationally, including 25 cases working on banana farms. Infecting Leptospira serovars were identified for five cases (11.6%), with four infected with serovar Australis and one with serovar Zanoni. Limited information about the specific exposure sites for each case and a low serovar detection rate hampered the ability to confirm the presence or absence of a leptospirosis outbreak. While heavy rainfall is likely to have contributed to the spike in cases, no factors were identified as clearly associated with the increase.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of pathways are proposed to improve the collection of exposure site data and the identification of infecting serovars, in order to strengthen local leptospirosis surveillance and the ability to detect outbreaks in the Cairns region.","['Taunton C', 'Hayek CE', 'Field E', 'Rubenach S', 'Esmonde J', 'Smith S', 'Preston-Thomas A']",2022,46,,Commun Dis Intell (2018),"Taunton C, et al.

36375539,Leptospiral sphingomyelinase Sph2 as a potential biomarker for diagnosis of leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is an underestimated infectious tropical disease caused by the spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. Leptospirosis is grossly underdiagnosed due to its myriad symptoms, varying from mild febrile illness to severe haemorrhage. Laboratory tests for leptospirosis is an extremely important and potent way for disease diagnosis, as the clinical manifestations are very similar to other febrile diseases. Currently available diagnostic techniques are time-consuming, require expertise and sophisticated instruments, and cannot identify the disease at an early phase of infection. Early diagnosis of leptospirosis is the need of the hour while considering the severe complications after the infection and the rate of mortality after misdiagnosis. Secretion of Leptospira-specific sphingomyelinases in leptospirosis patient's urine within a few days of the onset of infection is quite common and is a virulence factor present only in pathogenic Leptospira species. Herein, the structural and functional importance of leptospiral sphingomyelinase Sph2 in leptospirosis pathogenesis, as well as the potential of screening urinary Sph2 for diagnosis and the scope for developing a rapid and easily affordable point-of-care test for urinary leptospiral sphingomyelinase Sph2 as an alternative to current diagnostic methods are discussed.","['Ashaiba A', 'Arun AB', 'Prasad KS', 'Tellis RC']",2022,203,,J Microbiol Methods,"Ashaiba A, et al.

A prospective study was performed in rural areas of Urabá, Antioquia, Colombia. The study enrolled 597 people between November 2015 and January 2016, of which 274 were followed up 1 year later. Serologic testing was performed by a microscopic agglutination. The outcomes were seroprevalent and seroincident cases, and the primary exposure was an outdoor occupation. A binary and mixed-effect multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate factors associated with seroprevalent or seroincident cases of Leptospira infection. The overall Leptospira seroprevalence was 27.81% (95% confidence interval: 23.62-32.49), and the overall cumulative seroincidence for Leptospira was 14.60% (95% confidence interval: 10.33-20.23). Multivariable analysis showed that factors associated with L. interrogans serogroups seropositivity were outdoor occupation, male gender, older age, the presence of dirt floor in the household, and the presence of piglets and opossums. It also showed that factors associated with other Leptospira species serogroups were the presence of pit latrines and of turkeys. In addition, the multivariable model of seroincident cases of L. interrogans serogroups evidenced outdoor occupations, the presence of rats, and corn cultivation as risk factors. Likewise, the multivariable model for seroincident cases of other Leptospira species showed that the presence of hunting canines and cassava cultivation were risk factors. We found specific factors associated with the transmission of Leptospira serogroups contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of Leptospira infection in rural areas of Urabá, Colombia.","['Quintero-Vélez JC', 'Rodas JD', 'Rojas CA', 'Ko AI', 'Wunder EA']",2022,107,6,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Quintero-Vélez JC, et al.

36375451,Leptospirosis: Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics at the National Reference Hospital in Panama.,"Leptospirosis represents a public health problem in Panama, with an incidence rate of 1 in 100,000 inhabitants in 2014. Despite active surveillance and reports of outbreaks in the news, publications about human leptospirosis in Panama are scarce. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features of leptospirosis in a cohort of patients admitted to the national reference hospital from January 2013 to December 2018. A total of 188 patients with suspected leptospirosis were identified, but only 56.9% (107 of 188) of the medical records could be retrieved. Microagglutination assays were completed in 45% (48 of 107) of the patients, confirming leptospirosis in 29.2% (14 of 48) of the patients. The most prevalent serogroup identified was Leptospira interrogans icterohemorrhagiae (4 of 14, 28.6%). The majority of patients with confirmed disease were middle-aged (36.4 ± 15.7 years), male (11 of 14, 78.6%), and symptomatic for 6.8 ± 0.7 days before admission. The predominant clinical presentation was fever (13 of 14, 92.9%), abdominal pain (7 of 14, 50%), and jaundice (8 of 14, 57.1%). Respiratory failure (8 of 14, 57.1%), elevated creatinine levels on admission (8 of 14, 57.1%), transfusion of blood-derived products (6 of 14, 42.9%), and required use of vasopressors (4 of 14, 28.6%) were common complications. Mortality was 28.6% (4 of 14). Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated in almost all patients (10 of 12, 83.3%), and was appropriate in 90% (9 of 10) of them. Our study highlights the high prevalence of severe disease and reveals the diagnostic challenges concealing the true burden of leptospirosis in Panama. However, the small number of confirmed patients limits the generalization of these findings.","['Vazquez Guillamet LJ', 'Arauz AB', 'Suárez JA', 'González E', 'Domingo de Obaldía J', 'Moreno D', 'Henostroza G', 'Armién B']",2022,107,6,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Vazquez Guillamet LJ, et al.

36353005,A study on the role of lepidopterism in seasonal fever outbreaks.,"UNLABELLED: Fever is one of the most common reasons for visit in primary care practice. Outbreaks of fever that occur at certain areas in a seasonal manner are usually recognized early by diligent general practitioners in primary care settings. At the community level, in order to tackle seasonal fever outbreaks, prevention and control strategies are widely implemented, targeting the locally prevalent endemic infectious diseases. However, what about seasonal outbreaks of diseases because of non-infectious endemic causes? How well are we aware of this and how prepared are we? In 2006, there was an outbreak of Chikungunya fever in Kerala, a southern state in India. A group of scientists discovered that many patients assumed to have Chikungunya also had exposure to a specific type of lepidopteran moth, 
AIMS: 1. To screen subjects with clinical features resembling viral fevers for specific IgE antibodies against tiger moth toxin. 2. To assess the role of tiger moths in producing features resembling viral fevers in humans.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This hospital-based, cross-sectional analytical study was conducted from March 2015 to March 2016 in a tertiary hospital in North Kerala. The sample population included patients who had clinical manifestations suggestive of viral fevers and presented to the outpatient departments of Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, or Emergency Medicine and satisfied the inclusion criteria.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: After collecting the informed consent, the blood sample needed for the study was collected simultaneously with the blood collected for other tests ordered by the consulting doctor. No extra needle insertion was needed for the study. A total of 234 samples were examined for the presence of moth-toxin-specific IgE antibodies.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analysed using SPSS 17.0. Graphs were produced using Microsoft Excel. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies with percentages and analysed using Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test. Incidence/prevalence was also expressed in percentages with confidence interval. The continuous variable was expressed as mean with standard deviation or median with inter-quartile range. For all tests, a probability value (p value) < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: Among the 234 subjects who were screened in the 13-month period, 44 subjects (18.8%) tested positive for moth-toxin IgE, of which 28 were males and 16 were females. The maximum percentage of samples with positive moth-toxin IgE antibodies was detected during the months of March, June, July, November, December, and January. Out of the 44 subjects who had positive moth-toxin IgE antibodies, 24 tested positive for Dengue fever (of which eight were positive for the Dengue NS1 antigen, 11 were positive for the Dengue IgM antibody, and five were positive for both Dengue NS1 antigen and Dengue IgM antibody), two tested positive for Leptospira IgM antibody, two tested positive for Rickettsial antibody, and three had a positive Widal test. It was found that association of moth-toxin IgE with all the presenting symptoms of subjects analysed in this study was not statistically significant, except for lymphadenopathy. Skin rashes of different morphologies were seen in the study group. 20.5% (n = 9) of the subjects who tested positive for moth-toxin IgE had skin rashes. A majority of these weffigurere erythematous and maculopapular rashes, with incidence of 44% (n = 4) and 33% (n = 3), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. A seasonal variation is evident in the incidence of cases with positive moth-toxin IgE. 2. There is no significant age/sex preference for moth-toxin IgE positivity. 3. Subjects who tested positive for moth-toxin IgE also had positive serological tests for other infectious causes of fever, including Dengue fever, Leptospirosis, Enteric fever, and Rickettsial fever. The role of tiger moth exposure in producing fever and related symptoms hence needs to be studied further. 4. It was observed that moth-toxin IgE had significant association with lymphadenopathy. This should be investigated in further studies. 5. Even though the role of lepidopterism in seasonal fever epidemics is not clear, primary care physicians should be more aware of such entities which can present with a wide range of manifestations.","['Ubaidulla SM', 'Rajanbabu B', 'Varma KK', 'Hussain A']",2022,11,8,J Family Med Prim Care,"Ubaidulla SM, et al.

METHODS: Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical classification on principal components were presented to identify different clinical types of leptospirosis. The outcomes were clinical phenotypes, laboratory and imaging findings, and prognosis.
RESULTS: The 95 enrolled patients had median values of 54.0 years (39.0-65.0) for age, 9.0 (7.0-14.0) for total hospital stay lengths, of whom 86.3% was male and 40.0% was transferred to ICU. Three clinical types were distinguished: mild leptospirosis (n=43, 45.3%) with less organ dysfunction and shorter hospital stays; respiratory leptospirosis (n=28, 29.5%) with hemoptysis, and respiratory and circulatory failure; and hepato-renal leptospirosis (n=24, 25.3%) with worst liver and kidney dysfunction. Total hospital mortality was 15.8% and was associated with dyspnea and high levels of neutrophil counts.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of leptospirosis with distinct clinical manifestations and prognosis in our population may assist clinicians to distinguish leptospirosis-like disease. Moreover, dyspnea and neutrophil count were found to be independent risk factors for severe leptospirosis progression.","['Li D', 'Liang H', 'Yi R', 'Xiao Q', 'Zhu Y', 'Chang Q', 'Zhou L', 'Liu B', 'He J', 'Liu T', 'Fan Z', 'Cheng W', 'Wang W', 'Zhang Y', 'Pan P']",2022,12,,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,"Li D, et al.

36315387,Investigating Leptospira dynamics in a multi-host community using an agent-based modelling approach.,"Leptospirosis, a neglected bacterial zoonosis, is a global public health issue disproportionately affecting impoverished communities such as urban slums in the developing world. A variety of animal species, including peridomestic rodents and dogs, can be infected with different strains of leptospirosis. Humans contract leptospirosis via exposure to water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Due to the unavailability of safe and effective vaccines, preventive strategies mainly focus on minimizing human exposure to contaminated environment. In marginalized communities, this approach is ineffective due to infrastructure deficiencies and the difficulties in implementing sanitation and hygiene practices. Moreover, continuing the expansion of urban slums worldwide will likely contribute to the increase in outbreaks of leptospirosis. Effective prevention of leptospirosis outbreaks will therefore require a thorough understanding of Leptospira transmission dynamics in impoverished, high-density settings. We developed the agent-based model MHMSLeptoDy to investigate Leptospira dynamics in a realistic, in silico high-density community of rodents, dogs and human hosts, and two host-adapted Leptospira strains. Virtual explorations using MHMSLeptoDy were undertaken to evaluate alternate interventions and to assess the zoonotic transmission risk of leptospirosis. A key finding from model explorations is that rodents are the main contributors of rodent-adapted as well as dog-adapted strains in the environment, whereas dogs play an important role in distributing the rodent-adapted strain. Alternate leptospirosis control strategies can be evaluated using the open-source, customizable agent-based model, MHMSLeptoDy. This modelling approach provides a sophisticated mechanism to quantitatively evaluate nuanced intervention strategies and inform the design of rational, locally relevant leptospirosis control programmes.","['Belsare AV', 'Gompper ME', 'Mason M', 'Munoz-Zanzi C']",2022,69,6,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Belsare AV, et al.

36310746,"Floods Associated with Environmental Factors and Leptospirosis: our Experience at Tuzla Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is the most common zoonotic disease in Tuzla Canton. Objective: Determine the influence of environmental and precipitation factors on the incidence of leptospirosis.
METHODS: A retrospective study included 80 patients with leptospirosis. Data on precipitation were obtained from the online database of Federal Hydrometeorological Institute of BiH. OpenStreetMap (OSM) was used for spatial analysis; patients were geolocated and put on a map. Statistical data processing included basic tests of descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: In the period between 01.01.2014 and 31.12.2014, 80 patients with leptospirosis confirmed by clinical and serological testing were hospitalized in the Clinic for Infectious Diseases of the University Clinical Center Tuzla. Gender wise, out of 80 patients, 54 were male (67.5% of the total), and 26 were female (32.5%). More patients lived in the countryside: 64/80 (or 89%). The largest number of patients was engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry: 48/80 (or 60%), mostly cows 32/80 (40%), chickens 12/80 (15%), sheep 4/80 (5%) and pigs 3/80 (3.8%). Of the total number of patients, 50 (or 62.5%) had contact with domestic animals: dogs 10/80 (or 12.5%) and cats 5/80 (or 6.3%). Half of 53/80 (66.3%) patients had contact with flooded areas in the study period. The increase in leptospirosis diagnosed patients in the City of Srebrenik was statistically significant for 2014 (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis in one of the neglected infectious diseases in our area, but the proven increase in the number of infected people after heavy rainfall obliges us to control the risks associated with this disease.","['Becirovic A', 'Trnacevic A', 'Dubinovic-Rekic A', 'Dzafic F']",2022,34,3,Mater Sociomed,"Becirovic A, et al.

36309182,Leptospira spp. strains associated with Bovine Genital Leptospirosis (BGL).,"Bovine Genital Leptospirosis (BGL) is an important syndrome that leads to reproductive failures. The present study aimed to perform a molecular analysis of Leptospira spp. identified from genital and urine samples from in vivo naturally infected cows with poor reproductive performance. A total of 48 cows destined for culling due to low reproductive efficiency were selected and submitted to sampling. Uterine fragments, cervicovaginal mucus (CVM), and urine were collected from all of the cows and processed for culturing and PCR. One isolate was recovered from the uterus of one cow. Other 25 animals were PCR-positive, totaling 26 positive cows. Of them, 18 animals were positive in lipL32-PCR to genital samples, while only seven animals were positive in urine. From those, sequencing of secY gene was performed. Of the 21 good sequences obtained, 16 were L. interrogans, two were L. noguchii, two were L. santarosai and one was L. borgpetersenii. In order to evaluate the genetic similarity of sequences found herein and other sequences from bovines worldwide, a phylogenetic analysis and haplotype networks were performed. Cows with reproductive failures had a significant association (p < 0.05) with positive PCR of genital samples when compared to PCR of urine. None of the animals were positive for genital samples and urine simultaneously. A high diversity of leptospiral strains were found, even in animals of the same epidemiological region. Haplotype networks of L. interrogans showed clusters of sequences from the uterus and CVM with high similarity to other genital sequences originating from previous studies. L. borgpetersenii haplotype networks presented two major clusters with high similarity, even from worldwide sequences, while L. santarosai showed clusters with high genetic distances, even with all the sequences being from Brazil. This study reinforces the theory that BGL and renal infection are distinct diseases, as well as, genital samples are crucial for the diagnosis of cows with reproductive failures caused by leptospires. In addition, haplotype networks confirmed a high genetic similarity between sequences from the present study and Sejroe strains, reinforcing Sejroe strains as the main BGL agents.","['Aymée L', 'Di Azevedo MIN', 'Borges ALDSB', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2022,173,Pt A,Microb Pathog,"Aymée L, et al.

36306013,Prediction of leptospirosis outbreaks by hydroclimatic covariates: a comparative study of statistical models.,"Leptospirosis, the infectious disease caused by a spirochete bacteria, is a major public health problem worldwide. In Argentina, some regions have climatic and geographical characteristics that favor the habitat of bacteria of the Leptospira genus, whose survival strongly depends on climatic factors, enhanced by climate change, which increase the problems associated with people's health. In order to have a method to predict leptospirosis cases, in this paper, five time series forecasting methods are compared: two parametric (autoregressive integrated moving average and an alternative one that allows covariates, ARIMA and ARIMAX, respectively), two nonparametric (Nadaraya-Watson Kernel estimator, one and two kernels versions, NW-1 K and NW-2 K), and one semiparametric (semi-functional partial linear regression, SFPLR) method. For this, the number of cases of leptospirosis registered from 2009 to 2020 in three important cities of northeastern Argentina is used, as well as hydroclimatic covariates related to the presence of cases. According to the obtained results, there is no method that improves considerably the rest and can be recommended as a unique tool for leptospirosis prediction. However, in general, the NW-2 K method gets a better performance. This work, in addition to using a long-term high-quality time series, enriches the area of applications of statistical models to epidemiological leptospirosis data by the incorporation of hydroclimatic variables, and it is recommended directing further efforts in this line of research, under the context of current climate change.","['Llop MJ', 'Gómez A', 'Llop P', 'López MS', 'Müller GV']",2022,66,12,Int J Biometeorol,"Llop MJ, et al.

36289600,Long-Term Outcome of Leptospirosis Infection with Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with long-term mortality and morbidity outcomes. Severe leptospirosis usually results in AKI and multiple organ failure, but is associated with favorable short-term outcomes, if treatment is initiated early. However, information on long-term outcomes after leptospirosis-associated AKI is limited. The effects of leptospirosis on resulting chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as mortality, were evaluated in this study. We studied 2145 patients with leptospirosis from the National Health Insurance Research Database over an 8-year follow-up period. Patient demographics and characteristics were analyzed for AKI and dialysis. The risk factors for renal outcomes were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. In total, 443 (20.6%) patients had AKI. Among them, 77 (3.6%) patients received replacement therapy (AKI-RRT group). Long-term mortality was higher in the AKI-RRT group than in the AKI group and non-AKI group, based on a multivariate logistic regression model. Similarly, the incidence rate of CKD was highest in the AKI-RRT group, followed by the AKI and non-AKI groups. Leptospirosis, complicated with AKI, may play a critical role in the long-term outcomes, resulting in CKD. The severity of AKI determines the incidence of CKD. Additional prospective investigations for the early detection of AKI in leptospirosis are warranted.","['Chang CH', 'Sun WC', 'Chang SW', 'Lee CC', 'Fan PC', 'Yang HY', 'Yang CW']",2022,10,10,Biomedicines,"Chang CH, et al.

Seroprevalence in Swedish dogs is unknown. The aims of the present study were to estimate seroprevalence of pathogenic Leptospira in healthy dogs in Sweden using the microagglutination test (MAT) and a rapid point-of-care enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and to evaluate risk factors of Leptospira exposure in Swedish dogs.
RESULTS: Positive MAT titres (≥ 1:50) were detected in 27/369 (7.3%) of included dogs. Five different serovars were represented of which the Saxkoebing serovar was the most common (64.3%), followed by Copenhagi (14.3%), Bratislava (10.7%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (7.1%), and Canicola (3.6%). The ELISA test (SNAP® Lepto) was positive in 3/316 (0.9%) dogs. Living in urban areas and contact with stagnant water were found to be risk factors for Leptospira seropositivity (p < 0.05) in a multivariable logistic regression model.
CONCLUSION: In this first seroprevalence study of Leptospira in Swedish dogs, it was shown that healthy dogs without recent (24 months) travel history and antileptospira vaccination had been exposed to pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovars.

Globally, estimates of the dual (human and animal) burden of zoonoses are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the dual burden of zoonoses using a comparable metric, ""zoonosis Disability Adjusted Life Years"" (zDALY).
METHODOLOGY: We systematically reviewed studies that quantify in the same article zoonoses in animals, through monetary losses, and in humans in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). We searched EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. We excluded articles that did not provide the data to estimate the zDALY or those for which full text was not available. This study was registered at PROSPERO, CRD42022313081.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/SIGNIFICANCE: We identified 512 potentially eligible records. After deduplication and screening of the title and abstract, 23 records were assessed for full-text review. Fourteen studies were included in this systematic review. The data contains estimates from 10 countries, a study at continental level (Asia and Africa), and 2 studies on a global scale. Rabies was the most frequently reported zoonosis where zDALYs were calculated, based on the following included studies: for Kazakhstan 457 (95% CI 342-597), Viet Nam 5316 (95% CI 4382-6244), Asia 1,145,287 (90% CI 388,592-1,902,310), Africa 837,158 (90% CI 283,087-1,388,963), and worldwide rabies 5,920,014 (95% CI 1,547,860-10,290,815). This was followed by echinococcosis, the zDALYs in Peru were 2238 (95% CI 1931-2546), in China 1490 (95% CI 1442-1537), and worldwide cystic echinococcosis 5,935,463 (95% CI 4,497,316-7,377,636). Then, the zDALYs on cysticercosis for Mozambique were 2075 (95% CI 1476-2809), Cameroon 59,540 (95% CR 16,896-101,803), and Tanzania 34,455 (95% CI 12,993-76,193). Brucellosis in Kazakhstan were 2443 zDALYs (95% CI 2391-2496), and brucellosis and anthrax in Turkey 3538 zDALYs (95% CI 2567-6706). Finally, zDALYs on leptospirosis in New Zealand were 196, and Q fever in Netherlands 2843 (95% CI 1071-4603). The animal burden was superior to the human burden in the following studies: worldwide cystic echinococcosis (83%), brucellosis in Kazakhstan (71%), leptospirosis in New Zealand (91%), and brucellosis, and anthrax in Turkey (52%). Countries priorities on zoonoses can change if animal populations are taken into consideration.","['Noguera Z LP', 'Charypkhan D', 'Hartnack S', 'Torgerson PR', 'Rüegg SR']",2022,16,10,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Noguera Z LP, et al.

36227833,SARIMA and ARDL models for predicting leptospirosis in Anuradhapura district Sri Lanka.,"Leptospirosis is considered a neglected tropical disease despite its considerable mortality and morbidity. Lack of prediction remains a major reason for underestimating the disease. Although many models have been developed, most of them focused on the districts situated in the wet zone due to higher case numbers in that region. However, leptospirosis remains a major disease even in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The objective of this study is to develop a time series model to predict leptospirosis in the Anuradhapura district situated in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Time series data on monthly leptospirosis incidences from January 2008 to December 2018 and monthly rainfall, rainy days, temperature, and relative humidity were considered in model fitting. The first 72 months (55%) were used to fit the model, and the subsequent 60 months(45%) were used to validate the model. The log-transformed dependent variable was employed for fitting the Univariate seasonal ARIMA model. Based on the stationarity of the mean of the five variables, the ARDL model was selected as the multivariate time series technique. Residuals analysis was performed on normality, heteroskedasticity, and serial correlation to validate the model. The lowest AIC and MAPE were used to select the best model. Univariate models could not be fitted without adjusting the outliers. Adjusting seasonal outliers yielded better results than the models without adjustments. Best fitted Univariate model was ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)12,(AIC-1.08, MAPE-19.8). Best fitted ARDL model was ARDL(1, 3, 2, 1, 0),(AIC-2.04,MAPE-30.4). The number of patients reported in the previous month, rainfall, rainy days, and temperature showed a positive association, while relative humidity was negatively associated with leptospirosis. Multivariate models fitted better than univariate models for the original data. Best-fitted models indicate the necessity of including other explanatory variables such as patient, host, and epidemiological factors to yield better results.","['Warnasekara J', 'Agampodi S', 'Nr A']",2022,17,10,PLoS One,"Warnasekara J, et al.

36214431,Serological review of Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana infection among Malaysian patients with unknown causes of febrile illnesses.,"Limited information is available on human exposure to Bartonella infection, i.e., Bartonella henselae (causative agent of cat scratch disease) and Bartonella quintana (causative agent of trench fever) in West Malaysia. This study reports a review of serological findings obtained from patients attending to a teaching hospital in Klang Valley, Malaysia. An indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to determine IgG and IgM antibody titers against B. henselae and B. quintana. In a pilot study conducted between 2013-2015, IgG antibodies against Bartonella spp. (either B. quintana and B. henselae) were detected in 14 (36.8%) of 38 patients who were clinically suspected of rickettsial infections, while IgM antibody was detected in 4 (10.5%) patients. This has prompted us to investigate the serologic responses of patients who were clinically suspected of other febrile causes besides rickettsial infection. Of the 59 serum samples analysed in a follow-up investigation, Bartonella IgG antibodies were detected from 7 (11.9%) patients, of which 5 (27.8%) and 2 (18.2%) patients were clinically suspected of rickettsial infection (n=18) and dengue (n=11), respectively. None of the sera obtained from the leptospirosis (n=10), legionellosis (n=10) and mycoplasma infection (n=10) groups were seropositive to Bartonella spp. The review of Bartonella serological findings in this study highlights that Bartonella infection is not uncommon and should be considered as one of the causes for febrile illness in Malaysia.","['Hou SL', 'Idris N', 'Tay ST']",2022,39,3,Trop Biomed,"Hou SL, et al.

36207807,Acute kidney injury in the tropics.,"The tropics are a region consisting of more than 125 countries, accounting for 40% of the world's population. The region's population is expected to increase up to 60% in the coming decades. Many tropical countries continue to experience public health problems such as high rates of infectious diseases, lack of sanitation, climate change impacts, poor regulation of herbal medicines and low access to healthcare. These conditions produce the unique problem of tropical acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Tropical infections such as leptospirosis, dengue and malaria have varied mechanisms of AKI, including both direct kidney invasion and indirect effects, depending on the disease characteristics. Animal toxins from snakebites and arthropods along with plant toxins, such as djenkol beans, starfruit and herbal medicine, are characterized by a harmful renal effect from each toxic substance. Environmental factors such as heat stress, natural disasters and chemical compounds also lead to AKI and have a systemic effect from their own pathogenesis. The long-term kidney prognosis varies among these etiologies depending on the cause and severity of disease. However, all these conditions are potentially preventable and treatable. Prompt management and good preventive approaches are needed. This article will focus on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and management of AKI associated with tropical infections, toxins and environment impacts.","['Kusirisin P', 'da Silva Junior GB', 'Sitprija V', 'Srisawat N']",2023,28,1,Nephrology (Carlton),"Kusirisin P, et al.

36206109,Ocular leptospirosis: lack of awareness among ophthalmologists and challenges in diagnosis.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Systemic leptospirosis exists worldwide. But leptospiral uveitis, an important late complication is not identified by ophthalmologists in several countries.
RECENT FINDINGS: In the last 18 months numerous publications, especially on epidemiology, surveillances, and novel rapid diagnostic kits to test at the point of care site on leptospirosis have been published from all over the world. However, publications from ophthalmologists are very scarce. Remarkably ophthalmologists should know the global burden of leptospirosis, prevalence of the disease in their country, demographic factors associated, risk factors, and systemic signs to elicit relevant history and travel history. They should be aware of recent advances in investigations to confirm their clinical diagnosis.
SUMMARY: It is quite evident from this work that leptospirosis is prevalent worldwide. Ophthalmologists' awareness has to improve to identify the etiological diagnosis. They should have access to simple, less expensive, and less cumbersome laboratory tests.",['Sivakumar RR'],2022,33,6,Curr Opin Ophthalmol,Sivakumar RR.

Reports of leptospirosis in bats have increased and prompted epidemiological research in Brazil. This study aimed to perform a molecular and epidemiological investigation of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in bat kidneys. The total DNA was extracted from 102 kidney samples from chiropterous of different species and cities in Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), Brazil. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a fragment corresponding to lipL32 gene, which is only present in pathogenic Leptospira spp. lipL32 gene was detected in 22.5% (23/102) of the bat kidney tissues. Phylogenetic analysis showed that L. interrogans is circulating in bats in RS. Most species of the bats collected were insectivores. Pathogenic Leptospira spp. detection in bats demonstrated that these animals participate in the infection chain of leptospirosis and, therefore, may play as reservoirs and disseminators of this microorganism. Thus, it is important to monitor infectious agents, especially with zoonotic potential in bats.","['Ulsenheimer BC', 'von Laer AE', 'Tonin AA', 'Campos AAS', 'Dos Santos HF', 'Sangioni LA', 'de Avila Botton S']",2022,53,4,Braz J Microbiol,"Ulsenheimer BC, et al.

The pathogen, Leptospira spp., is primarily associated with rodent reservoirs. However, a wide range of other species has been implicated as reservoirs or dead-end hosts. We conducted a survey for Leptospira spp. in bats and rodents from Papua New Guinea. Kidney samples were collected from 97 pteropodid bats (five species), 37 insectivorous bats from four different families (six species) and 188 rodents (two species). Leptospires were detected in a high proportion of pteropodid bats, including Nyctimene cf. albiventer (35%), Macroglossus minimus (34%) and Rousettus amplexicaudatus (36%). Partial sequencing of the secY gene from rodent and bat leptospires showed host species clustering, with Leptospira interrogans and L. weilii detected in rodents and L. kirschneri and a potential novel species of Leptospira detected in bats. Further research is needed in Papua New Guinea and other locales in the Pacific region to gain a better understanding of the circulation dynamics of leptospires in reservoir species and the risks to public and veterinary health.","['Javati S', 'Guernier-Cambert V', 'Jonduo M', 'Robby S', 'Kimopa J', 'Maure T', 'McBryde ES', 'Pomat W', 'Aplin K', 'Helgen KM', 'Abdad MY', 'Horwood PF']",2022,69,6,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Javati S, et al.

Epidemiological and clinical data as well as blood samples were obtained from consenting patients at hospitals, health clinics and private residences. Samples were tested for arboviruses in cell cultures and for IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA. Blood smears were examined for malaria, and sera were tested for antibodies to Leptospira spp. by ELISA and microscopic agglutination. Among 6,607 febrile patients studied, dengue viruses caused 14.6% of the cases, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus caused 2.5%, Oropouche virus 1.0%, Mayaro virus 0.4%, and other arboviruses caused 0.2% of the cases. Also, 22.9% of 4,844 patients tested were positive for malaria, and of 400 samples tested, 9% had evidence of acute leptospirosis. Although the study was not designed to assess the importance of these pathogens as a cause of human morbidity in the total population, these results indicate that arboviruses, leptospirosis, and malaria were the cause of approximately 50% of the febrile cases. Although the arboviruses that were diagnosed can produce asymptomatic infections, our findings increased the overall understanding of the relative health burden of these infections, as well as baseline knowledge needed for designing and implementing further studies to better assess the health impact and threat of these pathogens in the Amazon Basin of Peru.","['Watts DM', 'Russell KL', 'Wooster MT', 'Sharp TW', 'Morrison AC', 'Kochel TJ', 'Bautista CT', 'Block K', 'Guevara C', 'Aguilar P', 'Palermo PM', 'Calampa C', 'Porter KR', 'Hayes CG', 'Weaver SC', 'de Rosa AT', 'Vinetz JM', 'Shope RE', 'Gotuzzo E', 'Guzman H', 'Tesh RB']",2022,107,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Watts DM, et al.

It is a leading cause of disease burden in form of mortality, morbidity and hospital admission. Identifying patients at high risk for mortality or for prolonged hospitalization may save lives and preserve economy. The aim of the current study is to identify significant factors associated with disease mortality and prolonged hospitalization.
DESIGN: Cress-sectional retrospective study.
SETTINGS: Tertiary care teaching hospitals in Kelantan, Peninsular Malaysia.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients proven to have leptospirosis depending on IgM ELISA were classified into two classes depending on prolonged hospitalization (>7 days or ≤ 7 days) and mortality (fatal cases or non-fatal cases). Patients' clinico-laboratory data were compared according to these two outcomes using the appropriate statistical test.
RESULTS: Of the 525 patients enrolled, 136 (25.9%) had prolonged hospitalization. The mean length of stay was 6.77 ± 5.68 days. Logistic regression analysis identified acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 2.3), Jaundice (OR 2.7), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR 2), and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (OR 1.9) independently associated with prolonged hospitalization. Case fatality rate was 6.48% and around one third of fatal cases had prolonged hospitalization of more than seven days. Factors associated with leptospirosis mortality included age >40 years (

Four similar challenge studies in beagle dogs were performed. In each study the dogs were assigned to one of three treatment groups as follows: group 1, Nobivac L4; group 2, Versican Plus L4; group 3, non-vaccinated control group. Two vaccinations were followed by a Leptospira challenge. Strains of the following serogroups were used for challenge: study 1, Grippotyphosa; study 2, Icterohaemorrhagiae; study 3, Canicola; study 4, Australis. Parameters of efficacy were antibody titres; body temperature; clinical signs; cultures of Leptospira bacteria from the blood, urine, kidney and liver; rapid urinalysis; macroscopic and histopathological examination at necropsy. It was concluded that compared to vaccination with Versican Plus L4, vaccination with Nobivac L4 resulted in generally better control of leptospirosis disease parameters after the challenge including a complete prevention of the clinical signs following a Grippotyphosa and Icterohaemorrhagiae challenge. In contrast, vaccination with Versican Plus L4 only prevented infection by Australis and shedding by Grippotyphosa and Australis but it did not lead to any statistically significant reduction of either infection or shedding following an Icterohaemorrhagiae challenge.","['Klaasen HLBM', 'Veen MV', 'Dorrestein-Spierenburg CM', 'Cao Q']",2022,10,9,Vaccines (Basel),"Klaasen HLBM, et al.

36137081,Internalization of Leptospira interrogans via diverse endocytosis mechanisms in human macrophages and vascular endothelial cells.,"Leptospirosis, one of the leading global causes of morbidity and mortality, is an emerging public health problem, particularly in large urban centers of developing countries. Leptospirosis results from infection with an organism belonging to the Leptospira genus L. interrogans. The extensive invasive ability has previously been documented, however a mechanism that describes how the organism is internalized by human macrophages and transmigrates through human blood vessel remains poorly understood. In the present study, we utilized a human macrophage and vascular endothelial cell line to study the diverse invasive mechanisms by which L. interrogans infections occur. We found that THP-1 and HUVEC had a diverse expression of cell receptors and L. interrogans entered THP-1 and HUVEC by different pathways. In the macrophage model cell line, ITGB1/FAK-signaling mediated microfilament dependent endocytosis with lysosome fusion, whereas ITGB1/CAV-1/PI3K-signaling mediated microfilament dependent endocytosis and transcytosis without lysosome fusion in the endothelial cell model. Shedding of pathogenic leptospires from HUVEC displayed higher viability than those from THP-1. The monolayer of HUVEC maintained integrity during the infection, while 3D imaging showed that leptospires were transmigrated both intra- and intercellularly.

36136818,A Patient with Severe Leptospirosis Treated with Cytokine Removal and High-Dose Corticosteroids.,"Leptospirosis is an ubiquitous zoonosis with significant morbidity and mortality. Approximately 10 percent of human infections evolve into a severe form, with a sepsis-like disease, multiorgan failure, and significant mortality rate. The cornerstone of treatment of severe disease is antibiotic therapy, with the aims of preventing complications, reducing the duration of disease, and ultimately reducing mortality. The initiation of antibiotic chemotherapy can precipitate a febrile inflammatory reaction, also known as a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. We present a case report of a patient with severe leptospirosis, complicated by multiorgan failure with severe circulatory failure of distributive and cardiogenic etiology, possibly as a consequence of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The patient was treated with antimicrobial therapy and other supportive measures along with high-dose corticosteroid therapy, long-term mechanical ventilation, high-dose vasopressor therapy, and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration with extracorporeal cytokine removal.With this case, we would like to report on a patient presenting with two neglected diseases in our part of Europe, who was treated with novel therapeutic strategies.","['Fluher J', 'Cestar I', 'Jerenec K', 'Kalamar Ž', 'Baklan Z', 'Markota A']",2022,14,5,Infect Dis Rep,"Fluher J, et al.

36136619,Serological Investigation and Epidemiological Analysis of Bovine Leptospirosis in Egypt.,"Bovine leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution. Little information is available regarding the occurrence of the disease in the Nile Delta provinces, Egypt. The present study investigated the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among cattle from Dakahlia province, Northern Egypt, and identified the individual variables factors associated with infection. To this end, a total of 600 serum samples from cattle of small stakeholders with various clinical manifestations possibly associated with leptospirosis were collected from different localities across Dakahlia province, Egypt. Sera were examined serologically via ELISA to investigate the occurrence of the disease among animals. Chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to determine the association between hypothesized risk factors and the disease. Interestingly, our findings showed that 39.33% of the examined sera were positive for Leptospira antibodies, with significant differences among different localities. In addition, statistical analysis showed significant differences among age groups. Notably, the highest prevalence rate (22%) was observed in those aged between 3 and 5 years (p < 0.0001), whereas the lowest prevalence (2.66%) was reported in cattle <1 year old (p < 0.0001). Moreover, females had a significantly higher prevalence rate (35.33%) than males (4%) (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, our results showed significant differences in the occurrence of infection and reported clinical signs (p < 0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression identified repeated breeder and drop milk yield as the best predictors for prediction of ELISA results and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model showed that overall classification accuracy of ELISA result using clinical signs and demographic data as predictors was 70.7%. The current study concluded a relative high prevalence of leptospirosis among cows bred in movable herds and households in the studied area and that age, repeated breeder and drop milk yield can be considered major risk factors associated with infection.","['Ibrahim NA', 'Alrashdi BM', 'Elnaker YF', 'Elmahallawy EK', 'Alblihed MA', 'Daib MS', 'Abd Elmoety AM', 'Abo Elfadl EA', 'Badawy BM', 'Elbaz E']",2022,7,9,Trop Med Infect Dis,"Ibrahim NA, et al.

36130240,Clinical features and risk factors for death in acute undifferentiated fever: A prospective observational study in rural community hospitals in six states of India.,"BACKGROUND: Acute undifferentiated fever (AUF) ranges from self-limiting illness to life-threatening infections, such as sepsis, malaria, dengue, leptospirosis and rickettsioses. Similar clinical presentation challenges the clinical management. This study describes risk factors for death in patients hospitalized with AUF in India.
METHODS: Patients aged ≥5 y admitted with fever for 2-14 d without localizing signs were included in a prospective observational study at seven hospitals in India during 2011-2012. Predictors identified by univariate analysis were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression for survival analysis.
RESULTS: Mortality was 2.4% (37/1521) and 46.9% (15/32) died within 2 d. History of heart disease (p=0.013), steroid use (p=0.011), altered consciousness (p<0.0001), bleeding (p<0.0001), oliguria (p=0.020) and breathlessness (p=0.015) were predictors of death, as were reduced Glasgow coma score (p=0.005), low urinary output (p=0.004), abnormal breathing (p=0.006), abdominal tenderness (p=0.023), leucocytosis (p<0.0001) and thrombocytopenia (p=0.001) at admission. Etiology was identified in 48.6% (18/37) of fatal cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Bleeding, cerebral dysfunction, respiratory failure and oliguria at admission, suggestive of severe organ failure secondary to systemic infection, were predictors of death. Almost half of the patients who died, died shortly after admission, which, together with organ failure, suggests that delay in hospitalization and, consequently, delayed treatment, contribute to death from AUF.","['Mørch K', 'Manoharan A', 'Chandy S', 'Singh A', 'Kuriakose C', 'Patil S', 'Henry A', 'Chacko N', 'Alvarez-Uria G', 'Nesaraj J', 'Blomberg B', 'Kurian S', 'Haanshuus CG', 'Antony GV', 'Langeland N', 'Mathai D']",2023,117,2,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Mørch K, et al.

36116606,Detection of Leptospira spp. in genitourinary tract of female goats managed in the brazilian semiarid.,"Studies related to the prevalence of leptospirosis in the semiarid region showed that even during long periods of drought, the disease has a remarkable frequency in herds in the region. It is a neglected disease and the extent of its effects in the Brazilian semiarid region is not known. The dynamics of this agent is well studied in the urinary tract, however, there are not many studies regarding the genital tract in female goats. Observing this scenario, the present work aimed to diagnose Leptospira spp. in female goats kept in the Brazilian semiarid region by means of serological, molecular and isolation techniques. Blood samples, vaginal fluid, urine and fragments of organs from the genitourinary tract were collected from 40 goats destined for slaughter. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used as a serological technique, with a battery of 24 serovars. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of the vaginal fluid, urine and organ fragments was performed, as well as the bacterial growth of these same products in a selective medium. Isolation positive samples were subjected to PCR. It was observed that two (5%) animals were serologically positive for the Pyrogenes serogroup. A total of 29 (72.5%) animals were PCR positive, with DNA present in 51/160 (31.8%) samples from the genital tract and 34/120 (28.3%) from the urinary tract, with no statistical difference. For bacterial growth, 22/40 (55%) animals were positive for growth, with morphology being observed in 19/160 (11.8%) for the genital tract and 16/120 (13.3%) for the urinary tract, with no statistical difference. Two uterus samples showed 99% similarity with L. interrogans after sequencing. Thus, female goats kept under semiarid conditions were positive for Leptospira spp, with positive samples from both the urinary and genital tracts, which possible is an alternative way of adapting and maintaining the agent for severe and adverse conditions.","['Soares RR', 'Natércio da Costa Barnabé N', 'Cristiny Rodrigues Silva ML', 'Figueiredo da Costa D', 'Araújo Júnior JP', 'Malossi CD', 'Ullmann LS', 'Silvano Dos Santos Higino S', 'Santos de Azevedo S', 'Alves CJ']",2022,172,,Microb Pathog,"Soares RR, et al.

36112668,"Ecology and distribution of Leptospira spp., reservoir hosts and environmental interaction in Sri Lanka, with identification of a new strain.","Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease and one of the leading causes of zoonotic morbidity and mortality, particularly in resource-poor settings. Sri Lanka has one of the highest disease burdens worldwide, with occasional endemic leptospirosis outbreaks (2008, 2011). Rodents are considered the main wildlife reservoir, but due to a scarcity of studies it is unclear which particular species contributes to bacterial transmission and reservoir maintenance in this multi-host multi-parasite system. Several rodent species act as agricultural pests both in rice fields and in food storage facilities. To unravel the interactions among the small mammal communities, pathogenic Leptospira spp. and human transmission pathways, we collected animals from smallholder food storage facilities, where contact between humans and small mammals is most likely, and screened kidney tissue samples for Leptospira spp. using PCR. Samples were collected in three climatic zones along a rainfall gradient. Pathogenic Leptospira spp. were detected in small mammal communities in 37 (74%) out of 50 sampled farms and 61 (12%) out of 500 collected individuals were infected. The small mammal community was comprised of Rattus rattus (87.6%), Suncus shrews (8.8%), Bandicota spp. (2.8%) and Mus booduga (0.8%). Three pathogenic Leptospira spp. were identified, L. borgpetersenii (n = 34), L. interrogans (n = 15), and L. kirschneri (n = 1). Suncus shrews were commonly infected (32%), followed by B. indica (23%) and R. rattus (10%). L. borgpetersenii strains similar to strains previously extracted from human clinal samples in Sri Lanka were detected in R. rattus and Suncus shrews. L. interrogans was observed in R. rattus only. A single L. kirschneri infection was found in M. booduga. The presence of human pathogenic Leptospira species in an agricultural pest rodent (R. rattus) and in commensal shrews (Suncus) calls for management of these species in commensal settings. Further investigation of the interplay between pathogen and reservoir population dynamics, overlap in geographic range and the extent of spill-over to humans in and around rural settlements is required to identify optimal management approaches.","['Sluydts V', 'Sarathchandra SR', 'Piscitelli AP', 'Van Houtte N', 'Gryseels S', 'Mayer-Scholl A', 'Bier NS', 'Htwe NM', 'Jacob J']",2022,16,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Sluydts V, et al.

However, the mechanisms of leptospiral pathogenesis are still not fully known and not all virulence factors (VFs) have been identified. Budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a popular eukaryotic model which has been used to identify bacterial VFs that target the conserved eukaryotic cellular processes. In this study, we screened for putative VFs of L. interrogans, one of the dominant species causing leptospirosis, by expressing candidate VFs in budding yeast and examining their impact on yeast growth in a high-throughput format. From an initial selection of 288 L. interrogans ORFs, we screened 226 candidate VFs in a yeast growth inhibition assay and identified nine putative VFs in four categories (adhesion, enzymatic, host structure interaction, and immunogenicity). Notably, LIC10280 was highly toxic even when expressed at low copies. We also observed specific subcellular localization for several putative VFs. This study shows that there are still potential L. interrogans VFs that await discovery. KEY POINTS: • High-throughput cloning and expression of leptospiral proteins in yeast. • Heterologous expression of nine leptospiral proteins inhibited yeast growth. • An uncharacterized protein LIC10280 maybe a putative VF for further validation.","['Lai WY', 'Wong Z', 'Chang CH', 'Samian MR', 'Watanabe N', 'Teh AH', 'Noordin R', 'Ong EBB']",2022,106,19-20,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,"Lai WY, et al.

36063673,Equine genital leptospirosis: Evidence of an important silent chronic reproductive syndrome.,"Leptospirosis may be associated with important syndromes in equines, including reproductive ones. Recently, our group demonstrated a reproductive syndrome of leptospirosis in ruminants (Bovine Genital Leptospirosis - BGL), that presents its own agent, particular diagnostic methods, and specific treatment and prevention, requiring special attention. We realized that the genital syndrome of leptospirosis may not be exclusive to ruminants and may also affect horses. The aim of the present study is to gather the available data on leptospirosis in equine reproduction and propose a new genital leptospirosis syndrome in horses, which we have named Equine Genital Leptospirosis (EGL). The main agent is most probably serovar Bratislava (serogroup Australis), whose role has been increasingly recognized in the etiology of infection, presenting a worldwide distribution. The most probable relevant transmission route in the EGL context is the sexual transmission. Subfertility, estrus repetition, and, less commonly, late-term abortions are the most common effects. Serology may not be adequate to diagnose this chronic silent reproductive leptospiral infection. As most studies regarding equine leptospirosis investigate urinary samples, EGL is vastly underdiagnosed, and the disease is little studied and underestimated. Therefore, PCR, particularly from cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) and uterine fragments, turns out to be a rapid and definitive diagnosis choice. In order to mitigate the effects of the disease in equines, triad antibiotic therapy, vaccination, and environmental management are essential. Adequate recognition of the particularities of this syndrome may help to highlight its occurrence and contribute to a broader understanding of its clinical manifestations, use of a correct diagnosis, and development of novel approaches for its control.","['Di Azevedo MIN', 'Lilenbaum W']",2022,192,,Theriogenology,Di Azevedo MIN and Lilenbaum W.

This article examines the risk factors, etiology, number of confirmed cases, and subsequent case index to analyse the epidemiology of the current leptospirosis outbreak in Tanzania's southern Linda region. In light of these findings, this research further details recent recommendations made by the WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and MoH to mitigate such an alarming situation. These recommendations include early detection and isolation, contact tracing, and chemoprophylaxis using doxycycline. The article concludes by outlining suggestions for individuals and governments, including the launch of public awareness campaigns, immunisation, increased surveillance, rapid detection testing, and the installation of suitable purification systems, to help contain future leptospirosis outbreaks.","['Masunga DS', 'Rai A', 'Abbass M', 'Uwishema O', 'Wellington J', 'Uweis L', 'El Saleh R', 'Arab S', 'Onyeaka CVP', 'Onyeaka H']",2022,80,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Masunga DS, et al.

35986911,Understanding leptospirosis: application of state-of-the-art molecular typing tools with a One Health lens.,"Leptospirosis is an archetypal One Health problem as described in the companion Currents in One Health article in the October 2022 issue of the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association by Sykes et al. A thorough understanding of leptospirosis requires a detailed analysis of the elaborate interplay among pathogenic leptospiral strains, host species, and the environment. Such an understanding is required to inform appropriate preventative measures including vaccine design, prophylaxis efforts, educational programs that help to reduce exposure to pathogenic spirochetes, as well as policy development. Because of the complex epidemiology of leptospirosis, a One Health approach as defined by the One Health Initiative Task Force is critical-an approach that calls for ""the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally, to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environment."" Over the last three decades, progressive advances in cutting-edge molecular typing techniques, as well as our ability to rapidly generate and share large amounts of sequence data through establishment and growth of databases, have been central to accelerating a One Health understanding of the epidemiology of leptospirosis. Nevertheless, our dependence on serotype information because of the serovar-specific nature of current vaccines means that laborious serotyping efforts continue. With the advent of new approaches such as mRNA vaccines that are based on lipopolysaccharide immunogens, sequence- and/or proteomics-based typing methods may replace these methods.","['Sykes JE', 'Gamage CD', 'Haake DA', 'Nally JE']",2022,83,10,Am J Vet Res,"Sykes JE, et al.

35969647,"Zoonoses and gold mining: A cross-sectional study to assess yellow fever immunization, Q fever, leptospirosis and leishmaniasis among the population working on illegal mining camps in French Guiana.","BACKGROUND: Most emerging pathogens are zoonoses and have a wildlife origin. Anthropization and disruption of ecosystems favor the crossing of inter-species barriers. We hypothesize that the marginalized population of undocumented goldminers in the Amazon is at risk of acquiring zoonoses.
METHOD: A multicentric cross-sectional study included consenting gold-mining adult workers in 2019. A clinical examination recorded dermatological signs of leishmaniosis and past history of yellow fever vaccination. Biological tests were performed for yellow fever, Q fever and leptospirosis serologies. Additional blood samples from a previous study in 2015 were also tested for leptospirosis.
RESULTS: In 2019, 380 individuals were included in the study, along with 407 samples from the 2015 biological collection. The seroprevalence of leptospirosis was 31.0% [95%CI = 26.4-35.5] in 2015 and 28.1% [23.5-32.7] in 2019. The seroprevalence of Q fever was 2.9% [1.2-4.6]. The majority of participants reported being vaccinated against yellow fever (93.6%) and 97.9% had seroneutralizing antibodies. The prevalence of suspected active mucocutaneous leishmaniasis was 2.4% [0.8-3.9].
DISCUSSION: These unique data shed new light on the transmission cycles of zoonoses still poorly understood in the region. They support the existence of a wild cycle of leptospirosis but not of Q fever. Leishmaniasis prevalence was high because of life conditions and tree felling. High yellow fever vaccine coverage was reassuring in this endemic area. In the era of global health, special attention must be paid to these vulnerable populations in direct contact with the tropical ecosystem and away from the health care system.","['Douine M', 'Bonifay T', 'Lambert Y', 'Mutricy L', 'Galindo MS', 'Godin A', 'Bourhy P', 'Picardeau M', 'Saout M', 'Demar M', 'Sanna A', 'Mosnier E', 'Blaizot R', 'Couppié P', 'Nacher M', 'Adenis A', 'Suarez-Mutis M', 'Vreden S', 'Epelboin L', 'Schaub R']",2022,16,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Douine M, et al.

This paper reviews data published for pig and poultry diseases in the province during the last 20 years (2000-2020). The review included relevant published papers identified by a computerised literature search from Web of Science; provincial animal health reports; the national database from the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD); animal health reports submitted by DALRRD to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) via the World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID) interface and laboratory records. A publication was considered eligible if it included qualitative or quantitative information on any disease affecting pigs and poultry including zoonosis. The search retrieved 174 publications, of which 26 were relevant. The review found that Newcastle disease (ND), coccidiosis and fowl pox (FP) were the most reported avian diseases in the national database, whereas avian infectious bronchitis (AIB), ND and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were the most reported diseases in the OIE database. Classical swine fever (CSF) was the most reported pig disease in both databases. The retrieved literature on pig and poultry diseases was scarce and no longer up to date, providing decision makers with little information.

35927739,Determining the spatial distribution of environmental and socio-economic suitability for human leptospirosis in the face of limited epidemiological data.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is among the leading zoonotic causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Knowledge about spatial patterns of diseases and their underlying processes have the potential to guide intervention efforts. However, leptospirosis is often an underreported and misdiagnosed disease and consequently, spatial patterns of the disease remain unclear. In the absence of accurate epidemiological data in the urban agglomeration of Santa Fe, we used a knowledge-based index and cluster analysis to identify spatial patterns of environmental and socioeconomic suitability for the disease and potential underlying processes that shape them.
METHODS: We geocoded human leptospirosis cases derived from the Argentinian surveillance system during the period 2010 to 2019. Environmental and socioeconomic databases were obtained from satellite images and publicly available platforms on the web. Two sets of human leptospirosis determinants were considered according to the level of their support by the literature and expert knowledge. We used the Zonation algorithm to build a knowledge-based index and a clustering approach to identify distinct potential sets of determinants. Spatial similarity and correlations between index, clusters, and incidence rates were evaluated.
RESULTS: We were able to geocode 56.36% of the human leptospirosis cases reported in the national epidemiological database. The knowledge-based index showed the suitability for human leptospirosis in the UA Santa Fe increased from downtown areas of the largest cities towards peri-urban and suburban areas. Cluster analysis revealed downtown areas were characterized by higher levels of socioeconomic conditions. Peri-urban and suburban areas encompassed two clusters which differed in terms of environmental determinants. The highest incidence rates overlapped areas with the highest suitability scores, the strength of association was low though (CSc r = 0.21, P < 0.001 and ESc r = 0.19, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We present a method to analyze the environmental and socioeconomic suitability for human leptospirosis based on literature and expert knowledge. The methodology can be thought as an evolutive and perfectible scheme as more studies are performed in the area and novel information regarding determinants of the disease become available. Our approach can be a valuable tool for decision-makers since it can serve as a baseline to plan intervention measures.","['Cristaldi MA', 'Catry T', 'Pottier A', 'Herbreteau V', 'Roux E', 'Jacob P', 'Previtali MA']",2022,11,1,Infect Dis Poverty,"Cristaldi MA, et al.

35909688,Method to Assess Farm-Level Vaccine and Antibiotic Usage Utilizing Financial Documentation: A Pilot Study in a Commercial Pig Farm in South Africa From 2016 to 2018.,"The purpose of the study was to develop a blueprint using financial documentation to describe and quantify vaccine and antibiotic usage (ABU). This method was piloted in a commercial pig farm in South Africa, with the ultimate hope to serve as a tool in a future species-specific vaccine and ABU surveillance system. Data collection was based on templates from the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC) network and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). Invoices from 2016 to 2018 were used as the main data source. In addition, monthly statement of accounts were used to check for missing invoices. An inventory check was done to ensure that the correct antibiotic concentrations were used in subsequent calculations. Livestock counts and slaughter statistics were also collected to be used as denominator data. Cost calculations for the procurement of antibiotics and vaccines were also done. The study showed that veterinary medicinal products were purchased only from a single veterinary practice. A total of 291 invoices were issued over 3 years, of which 2.75% (8/291) were missing and could therefore not be used in quantification. Tetracyclines (453.65 ± 25.49 kg and 135.16 ± 3.31 mg/kg), followed by quinoxalines (258.33 ± 8.04 kg and 77.07 ± 3.93 mg/kg) were used in the highest amounts, both in terms of weight (kg) and adjusted for animal biomass (mg/kg). Vaccines used on the farm targeted seven different diseases, namely enzootic pneumonia, erysipelas, ileitis, infectious infertility, leptospirosis, neonatal pig diarrhea and porcine circovirus disease. An average of 103 546 vaccine dosages was purchased for ZAR1 302,727 ($ 84,620) per year, whereas the average cost for the procurement of antibiotics was ZAR 907,372 ($ 69,561) per year. The study showed that invoices and monthly statement of accounts, in combination with an inventory check and on-farm production statistics, are useful data sources to quantify vaccine and ABU in the absence of veterinary prescriptions. In addition, vaccinating pigs were more expensive than administering antibiotics.","['Strasheim W', 'Etter EMC', 'Lowe M', 'Perovic O']",2022,9,,Front Vet Sci,"Strasheim W, et al.

35908795,Assessment of recombinant antigens Tp0100 and Tp1016 of Treponema pallidum for serological diagnosis of syphilis.,"OBJECTIVE: To discover novel serodiagnostic candidates for the serological diagnosis of syphilis.
METHODS: Two recombinant Treponema pallidum proteins Tp0100 and Tp1016 were expressed, purified, and identified by Western Blotting. A total of 600 clinical serum samples were tested with the Tp0100-based ELISA, the Tp1016-based ELISA, and the commercial LICA Syphilis TP kit (ChIVD, Beijing, China). The sensitivities were determined by testing 340 samples from individuals with clinically diagnosed primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis. The specificities were determined by screening 260 samples from healthy controls and individuals with potentially cross-reactive infections, including leptospirosis, Lyme disease, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus. Kappa (κ) values were applied to compare the agreement between clinical syphilis diagnosis and the Tp0100-based ELISA, the Tp1016-based ELISA, or the LICA Syphilis TP test.
RESULTS: Using clinical syphilis diagnosis as the gold standard, Tp0100 exhibited an overall sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 98.1% for testing IgG antibody while Tp1016 demonstrated only an overall sensitivity of 75.0% and specificity of 79.6%. In contrast, the LICA Syphilis TP test revealed an overall sensitivity of 97.6% and specificity of 96.2%. In addition, the overall percent agreement and corresponding κ values were 96.7% (95% CI 95.6%-97.8%) and 0.93 for the Tp0100-based ELISA, 77.0% (95% CI 74.3%-79.7%) and 0.54 for the Tp1016-based ELISA, and 97.0% (95% CI 96.0%-98.0%) and 0.94 for the LICA Syphilis TP test, respectively.

35895801,A global one health perspective on leptospirosis in humans and animals.,"Leptospirosis is a quintessential one health disease of humans and animals caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Intra- and interspecies transmission is dependent on 1) reservoir host animals in which organisms replicate and are shed in urine over long periods of time, 2) the persistence of spirochetes in the environment, and 3) subsequent human-animal-environmental interactions. The combination of increased flooding events due to climate change, changes in human-animal-environmental interactions as a result of the pandemic that favor a rise in the incidence of leptospirosis, and under-recognition of leptospirosis because of nonspecific clinical signs and severe signs that resemble COVID-19 represents a ""perfect storm"" for resurgence of leptospirosis in people and domestic animals. Although often considered a disease that occurs in warm, humid climates with high annual rainfall, pathogenic Leptospira spp have recently been associated with disease in animals and humans that reside in semiarid regions like the southwestern US and have impacted humans that have a wide spectrum of socioeconomic backgrounds. Therefore, it is critical that physicians, veterinarians, and public health experts maintain a high index of suspicion for the disease regardless of geographic and socioeconomic circumstances and work together to understand outbreaks and implement appropriate control measures. Over the last decade, major strides have been made in our understanding of the disease because of improvements in diagnostic tests, molecular epidemiologic tools, educational efforts on preventive measures, and vaccines. These novel approaches are highlighted in the companion Currents in One Health by Sykes et al, AJVR, September 2022.","['Sykes JE', 'Haake DA', 'Gamage CD', 'Mills WZ', 'Nally JE']",2022,260,13,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Sykes JE, et al.

Group A was subdivided into three groups: A1 with 32 dogs immunized with the vaccine #1; A2 by 32 dogs with #2; and A3 30 dogs with #3. Serology (MAT and IgG-ELISA) and urinary PCR were conducted. (3) Results: Seroreactivity increased at D15 post-vaccination and, regardless of vaccine brand, remained high up to D180, with antibody switch to IgG after D30. A total of 46.8% of animals from Group A were PCR-positive at least once, in contrast to 75% in Group B, regardless of vaccine brand (p < 0.05; OR: 0.3). (4) Conclusions: All commercial vaccines succeeded at eliciting a long-term IgG-based response and were partially effective at protecting against kidney infection.","[""Sant'Anna da Costa R"", 'Di Azevedo MIN', 'Dos Santos Baptista Borges AL', 'Aymée L', 'Martins G', 'Lilenbaum W']",2022,12,14,Animals (Basel),"Sant'Anna da Costa R, et al.

35864518,Leptospirosis vaccination in dogs attending UK primary care practices: vaccine uptake and factors associated with administration.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that is found globally and affects most mammalian species. Vaccination of dogs against leptospirosis is an important approach to preventing clinical disease, or reducing disease severity, as well as reducing transmission of the infection to humans. Although it is generally considered to be a 'core' vaccine, there is limited information on the level of leptospirosis vaccine usage and factors associated with its usage in dogs in the UK. The study aimed to report the uptake of leptospirosis vaccination and factors associated with its usage in a cohort of dogs under primary veterinary care during a 12-month period.
RESULTS: From a population of 905,543 dogs, 49% (95%CI 48.9-49.1%) had at least one leptospirosis vaccine administered during the 12 months of study. Adult dogs had reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine when compared to dogs < 1 year old, with dogs > 8 years old having a greater than ten-fold reduction in odds (OR = 0.08, 95%CI 0.07-0.09). Odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine was increased in insured dogs when compared to uninsured dogs (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.17-1.28). Neutered dogs had reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine (OR = 0.87, 95%CI 0.83-0.91). Breed associations with receiving a leptospirosis vaccine varied. Several breeds were associated with increased odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine when compared to crossbreed dogs, including Border Terriers (OR = 1.49, 95%CI 1.42-1.57), Golden Retrievers (OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.24-1.37), Cocker Spaniels (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.31) and West Highland White Terriers (OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.22-1.31). French Bulldogs (OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.62-0.67), Staffordshire Bull Terriers (OR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.78-0.82) and Pugs (OR = 0.91, 95%CI =0.88-0.95) had significantly reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccination during the study.
CONCLUSION: This work identified that almost half of the UK primary care attending population received a leptospirosis vaccine during the year. Several demographic variables were associated with leptospirosis vaccine administration, with age being particularly important. Both the proportion of uptake and factors associated with leptospirosis vaccine usage can be used as a benchmark for comparisons in the future. Additionally, an understanding of which populations have reduced odds of receiving a leptospirosis vaccine can potentially be used for initiatives to encourage owner vaccination uptake in these groups.","['Taylor C', ""O'Neill DG"", 'Catchpole B', 'Brodbelt DC']",2022,18,1,BMC Vet Res,"Taylor C, et al.

35859430,"Leptospirosis in central & eastern Uttar Pradesh, an underreported disease: A prospective cross-sectional study.","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease associated with potentially fatal consequences and a grossly underreported disease in Uttar Pradesh. However, only a few studies are available which report the prevalence of leptospirosis in this State. Hence, this study was undertaken to know the status of the disease in central and eastern Uttar Pradesh.
METHODS: A total of 143 serum and urine samples were collected from patients with acute febrile illness from July 2017 to March 2019. All the serum samples were tested for Leptospira by rapid IgM antibody card and IgM ELISA and urine samples were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect Leptospira DNA. All positive and 10 per cent negative sera from ELISA and RT-PCR (all rapid test positive were also ELISA positive) were sent to the ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Port Blair for microscopic agglutination test (MAT).
RESULTS: Thirty eight (26.6%) out of 143 samples were positive for leptospirosis either by ELISA or RT-PCR. Positive results were eight (6%) by Rapid card, 32 (22%) by IgM ELISA, 10 (7%) by MAT, 10 (7%) by RT-PCR. In MAT, the most common serovar was Lai followed by Hebdomadis, Bangkinang and Pomona.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis was found to be one of the important causes for acute febrile illness in the central and eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh. The results of the present study suggest that it is necessary to increase diagnostic facility and awareness in clinicians for the screening of leptospirosis in acutely febrile patients to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.","['Shukla S', 'Mittal V', 'Karoli R', 'Singh P', 'Singh A']",2022,155,1,Indian J Med Res,"Shukla S, et al.

35857771,"Evaluation of the impact of chemical control on the ecology of Rattus norvegicus of an urban community in Salvador, Brazil.","BACKGROUND: The presence of synanthropic rodents, such as Rattus norvegicus, in urban environments generates high costs of prophylaxis and control, in large part due to the environmental transmission of the pathogenic spirochete Leptospira interrogans, which causes leptospirosis. In Salvador, Brazil, The Center for Control of Zoonosis (CCZ) is responsible for planning and implementing Rodent Control Programs (RCP) which are based on chemical rodenticide. However, these strategies have not been standardized for use in developing countries.
AIM: This study aimed to identify the effect of a chemical control campaign on the demographic variables of urban R. norvegicus, analyzing relative abundance, sex structure, body mass, and age of the population, as well as the characterization of spatial distribution among households, rodent capture campaigns and interventions.
METHODS: This study was carried out during 2015 in three valleys of an urban poor community in Salvador. Individuals of R. norvegicus were systematically captured before (Pre-intervention) and three months (1st post-intervention) and six months (2nd post-intervention) after a chemical control intervention conducted by the CCZ in two valleys of the study area while the third valley was not included in the intervention campaign and was used as a non-intervention reference. We used analysis of variance to determine if intervention affected demographic variables and chi-square to compare proportions of infested households (Rodent infestation index-PII).
RESULTS: During the chemical intervention, 939 households were visited. In the pre-intervention campaign, an effort of 310 trap nights resulted in 43 rodents captured, and in the 1st and 2nd, post-intervention campaigns resulted in 47 rodents captured over 312 trap nights and 36 rodents captured over 324 traps-nights, respectively. The rodent infestation index (PII) points did not show a reduction between the period before the intervention and the two periods after the chemical intervention (70%, 72%, and 65%, respectively). Regarding relative abundances, there was no difference between valleys and period before and two periods after chemical intervention (trap success valley 1: 0,18; 0,19; 0,18 / Valley 3 0,15; 0,17; 0,13/ P>0,05). Other demographic results showed that there was no difference in demographic characteristics of the rodent population before and after the intervention, as well as there being no influence of the application of rodenticide on the areas of concentration of capture of rodents between the campaigns.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that the chemical control was not effective in controlling the population of R. norvegicus and provides evidence of the need for re-evaluation of rodent control practices in urban poor community settings.","['Pertile AC', 'Lustosa R', 'Carvalho-Pereira T', 'Pedra GG', 'Panti-May JA', 'Oliveira U', 'Zeppelini CG', 'Souza FN', 'Oliveira DS', 'Khalil H', 'Reis MG', 'Childs J', 'Ko AI', 'Begon M', 'Costa F']",2022,17,7,PLoS One,"Pertile AC, et al.

35840123,"High-level seroprevalence against Leptospira interrogans serovars among wild foxes, jackals and stray dogs in the North Khorasan Province, Iran.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important, neglected zoonotic disease that affects people and animals in humid (sub)tropical regions. Wild canines carry the pathogen and may contaminate natural resources which may then act as a source of human infection.
OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to understand the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among domestic and wild canines in Bojnurd County, Northeast Iran.
METHODS: A total of 77 serum samples, comprising 29 sera from asymptomatic wild canines [foxes (n = 25) and jackals (n = 4)] and 48 sera from asymptomatic stray dogs, was investigated. Serovars were identified and antibody titres were measured by standard microscopic agglutination test (MAT) using serial serum dilutions.
RESULTS: Among all serum samples, 44.1% reacted positively to a Leptospira interrogans serovars. The average percentage of positive reactions was higher in stray dogs than in wild canines although this did not reach statistical significance (55.2% and 37.5%, p = 0.159). Positive reactions with L. i. Pomona, L. i. Australis and L. i. Tarasovi was detected only among jackals and foxes. Among the stray dogs, the highest number of positive sera were for L. i. Grippotyphosa (61.1%) and L. i. Canicola (50%). The highest titre detected was for L. i. canicola (1:1600) in two stray dogs and against L. i. Icterohaemorrhagiae and L. i. Pomona (1:800) in a single jackal.
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that leptospirosis is endemic among various canine species in the North Khorasan Province of Iran.

35835048,Seroprevalence of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in domestic dogs from southern Chile and risk factors associated with different environments.,"Leptospirosis is a neglected and severe zoonotic bacterial disease that affects canine populations worldwide, and it is present in animals from different settings, such as urban and rural environments. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted on owned domestic dogs from urban and rural origins in southern Chile. The study aimed: 1) to estimate the true prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira in dogs from urban and rural environments in southern Chile, 2) to determine the serovars circulating in an endemic area of Chile, 3) to assess potential risk factors associated with seropositivity in dogs from urban and rural environments. Blood samples from 706 canines were collected, and the serum was tested with Micro-Agglutination-Test (MAT), using a panel of 13 serovars. A Bayesian approach was applied to estimate True prevalence (TP). In addition, dog owners answered a questionnaire that had prompts regarding dog characteristics and potential risk factors. The effect of these factors on the risk of being infected was analysed using a logistic regression model. The TP for urban dogs was 9.4% and 9.1% for rural animals. However, seroprevalence was higher in dogs with different individual, lifestyle, and habitat characteristics regarding their origin. For example, in urban animals, those living in places with rodents roaming near houses and dogs with rodent hunting habits had decreased risk for the seropositivity in MAT. On the other hand, in rural dogs, those of a recognized breed, with contact with cattle and sheep, living with more than one cat at home and living in places close to natural water sources have more risk to seropositivity in MAT. The presence of anti-Leptospira antibodies is widespread in pet dogs in urban and rural environments in southern Chile, and individual, lifestyle and habitat characteristics of the animals, according to the origin, are associated with the seropositivity in MAT. Therefore, the adoption of preventive measures is urgent, in addition to increase the awareness either in public health institutions, practitioners and companion animals' owners, considering the zoonotic potential of Leptospira infection and the close contact between people and their pets.","['Azócar-Aedo L', 'Monti G']",2022,206,,Prev Vet Med,Azócar-Aedo L and Monti G.

Sophisticated differential tests and prediction tools are better ways to tackle this issue. Here, we aimed to develop a clinician assisted decision making tool to differentiate the common tropical infections.
METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional study through 9 item self-administered questionnaire were performed to understand the need of developing a decision making tool and its parameters. The most significant differential parameters among the identified infections were measured through a retrospective study and decision tree was developed. Based on the parameters identified, a multinomial logistic regression model and a machine learning model were developed which could better differentiate the infection.
RESULTS: A total of 40 physicians involved in the management of tropical infections were included for need analysis. Dengue, malaria, leptospirosis and scrub typhus were the common tropical infections in our settings. Sodium, total bilirubin, albumin, lymphocytes and platelets were the laboratory parameters; and abdominal pain, arthralgia, myalgia and urine output were the clinical presentation identified as better predictors. In multinomial logistic regression analysis with dengue as a reference revealed a predictability of 60.7%, 62.5% and 66% for dengue, malaria and leptospirosis, respectively, whereas, scrub typhus showed only 38% of predictability. The multi classification machine learning model observed to have an overall predictability of 55-60%, whereas a binary classification machine learning algorithms showed an average of 79-84% for one vs other and 69-88% for one vs one disease category.
CONCLUSION: This is a first of its kind study where both statistical and machine learning approaches were explored simultaneously for differentiating tropical infections.

35768761,A case-control study of agricultural and behavioral factors associated with leptospirosis in Vietnam.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a neglected disease in Vietnam. Until now, there has been limited knowledge about risk factors of this disease in Vietnam. The study was carried out to identify agricultural and behavioral factors associated with the transmission of leptospirosis in Vietnam.
METHODS: This matched retrospective hospital-community-based case-control study was conducted from 1 October 2018 to 31 October 2019. We recruited cases from 11 selected government hospitals in three provinces of Vietnam, while controls were selected from the same communes of cases and matched by age (± 2 years) and sex. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied to determine confirmed cases, while only MAT was used to identify controls with a single high MAT titer < 1:100.
RESULTS: 504 participants (252 cases and 252 controls) were identified. Cultivating (OR 2.83, CI 1.38-5.79), animal farming (OR 8.26, CI 2.24-30.52), pig owners (OR 10.48, CI 5.05-21.73), cat owners (OR 2.62, CI 1.49-4.61) and drinking unboiled water (OR 1.72, CI 1.14 -2.59, p = 0.010) were significantly associated with human leptospirosis in Vietnam. Hand washing after farming/ gardening (OR 0.57, CI 0.38-0.86, p = 0.007) and bathing after farming, gardening, contact with cattle and poultry (OR 0.33, CI 0.19-0.58, p = 0.000) were determined as protective factors for this disease.
CONCLUSIONS: In short, the case-control study has revealed the risks in agricultural and animal practices and protective behavioral factors related to human leptospirosis in Vietnam. The findings suggested promotion of communication and health education programs targeting health behaviors in daily life and agricultural practices. Using personal protective equipment such as gowns, gloves, and boots during agricultural practices, especially cultivating and animal farming, is most recommended.","['Dung LP', 'Hai PT', 'Hoa LM', 'Mai TNP', 'Hanh NTM', 'Than PD', 'Tran VD', 'Quyet NT', 'Hai H', 'Ngoc DB', 'Thu NT', 'Mai LTP']",2022,22,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Dung LP, et al.

35761507,Endothelial biomarkers as predictors for haemodialysis need in severe leptospirosis patients (Weil's disease).,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prediction ability of vascular injury biomarkers for haemodialysis requirement in patients with severe leptospirosis.
METHODS: Prospective study with severe leptospirosis patients hospitalised in Fortaleza, Brazil. Blood samples were collected hospital admission to quantify vascular injury biomarkers: syndecan-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2 and FGF-23. Two groups were evaluated according to haemodialysis requirement during hospital stay.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were included, with a mean age of 39 ± 18 years. 88.9% were males. 53.8% needed haemodialysis and presented higher levels on hospital admission of syndecan-1 (572 [300-811] vs. 263 [106-421] ng/ml; p = 0.03), angiopoietin-2 (1.52 [0.72-2.72] vs. 0.63 [0.4-1.38] ng/ml; p = 0.01), and FGF-23 (291 [56-2031] vs. 10 [10-806] pg/ml; p = 0.021). Syndecan-1 showed significant correlation with creatinine (r = 0.546; p = 0.05) and total bilirubin levels (r = 0.534; p = 0.013) on hospital admission. Angiopoietin-2 showed significant correlation with creatinine levels (r = 0.513; p = 0.009) on hospital admission and with number of haemodialysis sessions (r = 0.406; p = 0.049). No significant correlation was found with FGF-23. Regarding prognostic performance, combined syndecan-1 and angiopoietin-2 levels had a better ability to predict haemodialysis need in patients with severe leptospirosis (AUC-ROC = 0.744 [95% CI: 0.545-0.943] p = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: Syndecan-1 and angiopoietin-2 were associated with haemodialysis need in patients with severe leptospirosis and may be useful to improve therapeutic approach and reduce mortality.","['Meneses GC', 'de Carvalho Gomes PEA', 'Galdino GS', 'Bezerra GF', 'de Souza Santos RS', 'Martins AMC', 'da Silva Junior GB', 'Libório AB', 'Pires Neto RDJ', 'Daher EF']",2022,27,8,Trop Med Int Health,"Meneses GC, et al.

35749480,"Canine leptospirosis in Canada, test-positive proportion and risk factors (2009 to 2018): A cross-sectional study.","Over the past decade, there has been an apparent increased frequency and widened distribution of canine leptospirosis in Canada, however, this has been minimally investigated. Availability and clinical uptake of Leptospira polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing of dogs in Canada may provide important insight into the epidemiology of this canine and zoonotic infectious disease. Study objectives were to evaluate clinical canine Leptospira PCR test results from a large commercial laboratory to determine temporal and spatial distribution in Canada and identify dog, geographic and temporal risk factors for test-positive dogs. This cross-sectional study analyzed data obtained from IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. on 10,437 canine Leptospira PCR tests (blood and/or urine) submitted by Canada-based veterinarians (July 2009 to May 2018). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for test-positive dogs. Test-positive proportion varied widely annually (4.8-14.0%) and by location. Provinces with the highest test-positive proportion over the study period were Nova Scotia (18.5%) and Ontario (9.6%), with the prairie provinces (Manitoba and Alberta combined) having the lowest proportion (1.0%); the northern territories could not be evaluated due to limited testing. In the final model, dog age, sex, breed, month, and year test performed, and location (urban/rural, province) of the practice submitting the sample were significant predictors of a positive Leptospira PCR test. Dogs less than one year of age (OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.6-2.9), male sex (OR = 1.3; 1.1-1.5), toy breed (OR = 3.3; 2.5-4.4), and samples submitted from an urban practice (OR = 1.3; 1.0-1.8) had the greatest odds of a positive Leptospira PCR test as compared to referent groups. Significant two-way interactions between province-month and year-month highlight the complex spatial and temporal influences on leptospirosis occurrence in this region. Our work suggests a high incidence of canine leptospirosis regionally within Canada. Identifiable dog and location factors may assist in future targeted prevention efforts.","['Stull JW', 'Evason M', 'Weese JS', 'Yu J', 'Szlosek D', 'Smith AM']",2022,17,6,PLoS One,"Stull JW, et al.

35742291,"Impact of Plantation Induced Forest Degradation on the Outbreak of Emerging Infectious Diseases-Wayanad District, Kerala, India.","The world has been facing a pandemic owing to COVID-19. We have also seen the geographic expansion and outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases (EID) in recent years. This paper investigates the direct and indirect effects of land use land cover change (LULCC) on EID outbreaks in the context of Wayanad District of Kerala, India. Wayanad is in the vulnerable tropical forested region, and it is named as one of the four environmental change hotspots. The focus of this project is mainly three EIDs prevalent in this region: Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Dengue and Leptospirosis. Our results, based on topographical map, remote sensing and extensive field work, show that the natural forest in Wayanad was replaced with agriculture and forest plantation during 1950-2018. This paper further suggests that encroachment of forest by forest plantation causes the human-animal conflict resulting in the outbreak of KFD cases. Our analysis reveals that a high number of Dengue cases is found in the forested regions of the district and over the adjacent human-made agriculture plantation areas. High and medium number of Leptospirosis cases contain a high portion of land area devoted to paddy cultivation and agricultural plantation. In summary, the results clearly show the linkage between the outbreak of above mentioned EIDs and LULCC in the context of Wayanad district, Kerala. We also discuss in detail the causal pathway involving human-environmental dynamics through which plantation leads to the outbreak of KFD. Replacing forests with plantations poses an alarming threat of disease outbreak in the community.","['Saha K', 'Ghatak D', 'S Muralee NS']",2022,19,12,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Saha K, et al.

This study assessed the occurrence and genetically identified Leptospira spp. in the follicular fluid (FF) of naturally infected live cows. A total of 251 asymptomatic cows from different commercial dairy herds were subjected to ovum-pick up technique for follicular fluid sampling. PCR was performed for Leptospira spp. detection and phylogenetic analysis was later implemented for sequencing. From 251 samples analyzed, 67 (26.7 %) were lipL32-PCR positive, confirming the presence of leptospiral DNA on FF. Furthermore, it was possible to amplify and sequence nine strains after secY nested-PCR. All of them were identified as L. interrogans, with 100 % of identity with strains belonging to Sejroe serogroup. Our findings reveal a high occurrence of infection of Leptospira in the ovarium of asymptomatic cows, highlighting the importance of considering the silent leptospirosis syndrome when screening animals for assisted reproductive biotechniques.","['Dos Santos Pereira PV', 'Di Azevedo MIN', 'Dos Santos Baptista Borges AL', 'Loureiro AP', 'Martins G', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Souza-Fabjan JMG', 'Lilenbaum W']",2022,271,,Vet Microbiol,"Dos Santos Pereira PV, et al.

A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted. Medical records from proteinuric dogs (urinary protein−creatinine ratio > 0.5) presented to a Veterinary Teaching Hospital over a two-year period were reviewed for signalment, established diagnosis, proteinuria origin, and CVBD screening results. A total of 106 dogs were included. The median age was 9.5 years old (IQR: 7−12). Proteinuria was considered of renal origin in 76% of cases (46% of them had a presumptive diagnosis of glomerulonephritis secondary to CVBD, 27% chronic kidney disease, 26% systemic disease possible to induce proteinuria, and 1% leptospirosis). Proteinuria was classified as post-renal or mixed-origin in 17% and 7% of cases, respectively. About 35% of proteinuric dogs were positive for at least one CVBD. Of them, 84% were seropositive for one CVBD, while 16% tested positive for two or more. Among dogs testing positive for CVBD, 89% were seropositive for Leishmania infantum. This study showed that about one-third of proteinuric dogs tested positive for CVBDs, highlighting the relevance of their screening in dogs with proteinuria living in endemic regions.","['Paz MLQM', 'Casimiro T', 'Correia JHD', 'Leal RO']",2022,9,6,Vet Sci,"Paz MLQM, et al.

35716700,"Clinical evaluation of the BioFire Global Fever Panel for the identification of malaria, leptospirosis, chikungunya, and dengue from whole blood: a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study.","BACKGROUND: Acute febrile illness is a common presentation for patients at hospitals globally. Assays that can diagnose a variety of common pathogens in blood could help to establish a diagnosis for targeted disease management. We aimed to evaluate the performance of the BioFire Global Fever Panel (GF Panel), a multiplex nucleic acid amplification test performed on whole blood specimens run on the BioFire FilmArray System, in the diagnosis of several pathogens that cause acute febrile illness.
METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study to evaluate the GF Panel. Consenting adults and children older than 6 months presenting with fever in the previous 2 days were enrolled consecutively in sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda), southeast Asia (Cambodia, Thailand), central and South America (Honduras, Peru), and the USA (Washington, DC; St Louis, MO). We assessed the performance of six analytes (chikungunya virus, dengue virus [serotypes 1-4], Leptospira spp, Plasmodium spp, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale) on the GF Panel. The performance of the GF Panel was assessed using comparator PCR assays with different primers followed by bidirectional sequencing on nucleic acid extracts from the same specimen. We calculated the positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of the GF Panel with respect to the comparator assays. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02968355.
FINDINGS: From March 26, 2018, to Sept 30, 2019, 1965 participants were enrolled at ten sites worldwide. Of the 1875 participants with analysable results, 980 (52·3%) were female and the median age was 22 years (range 0-100). At least one analyte was detected in 657 (35·0%) of 1875 specimens. The GF Panel had a positive percent agreement for the six analytes evaluated as follows: chikungunya virus 100% (95% CI 86·3-100), dengue virus 94·0% (90·6-96·5), Leptospira spp 93·8% (69·8-99·8), Plasmodium spp 98·3% (96·3-99·4), P falciparum 92·7% (88·8-95·6), and P vivax or P ovale 92·7% (86·7-96·6). The GF Panel had a negative percent agreement equal to or greater than 99·2% (98·6-99·6) for all analytes.
INTERPRETATION: This 1 h sample-to-answer, molecular device can detect common causative agents of acute febrile illness with excellent positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement directly in whole blood. The targets of the assay are prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions globally, and the assay could help to provide both public health surveillance and individual diagnoses.

35696427,Estimating the duration of antibody positivity and likely time of Leptospira infection using data from a cross-sectional serological study in Fiji.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease prevalent throughout the world, but with particularly high burden in Oceania (including the Pacific Island Countries and Territories). Leptospirosis is endemic in Fiji, with outbreaks often occurring following heavy rainfall and flooding. As a result of non-specific clinical manifestation and diagnostic challenges, cases are often misdiagnosed or under-ascertained. Furthermore, little is known about the duration of persistence of antibodies to leptospirosis, which has important clinical and epidemiological implications.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using the results from a serosurvey conducted in Fiji in 2013, we fitted serocatalytic models to estimate the duration of antibody positivity and the force of infection (FOI, the rate at which susceptible individuals acquire infection or seroconversion), whilst accounting for seroreversion. Additionally, we estimated the most likely timing of infection. Using the reverse catalytic model, we estimated the duration of antibody persistence to be 8.33 years (4.76-12.50; assuming constant FOI) and 7.25 years (3.36-11.36; assuming time-varying FOI), which is longer than previous estimates. Using population age-structured seroprevalence data alone, we were not able to distinguish between these two models. However, by bringing in additional longitudinal data on antibody kinetics we were able to estimate the most likely time of infection, lending support to the time-varying FOI model. We found that most individuals who were antibody-positive in the 2013 serosurvey were likely to have been infected within the previous two years, and this finding is consistent with surveillance data showing high numbers of cases reported in 2012 and 2013.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use serocatalytic models to estimate the FOI and seroreversion rate for Leptospira infection. As well as providing an estimate for the duration of antibody positivity, we also present a novel method to estimate the most likely time of infection from seroprevalence data. These approaches can allow for richer, longitudinal information to be inferred from cross-sectional studies, and could be applied to other endemic diseases where antibody waning occurs.","['Rees EM', 'Lau CL', 'Kama M', 'Reid S', 'Lowe R', 'Kucharski AJ']",2022,16,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Rees EM, et al.

35692716,Effects of rainfall on human leptospirosis in Thailand: evidence of multi-province study using distributed lag non-linear model.,"UNLABELLED: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that remains an important public health problem, especially in tropical developing countries. Many previous studies in Thailand have revealed the outbreak of human leptospirosis after heavy rainfall, but research determining its quantitative risks associated with rainfall, especially at the national level, remains limited. This study aims to examine the association between rainfall and human leptospirosis across 60 provinces of Thailand. A quasi-Poisson regression framework combined with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate province-specific association between rainfall and human leptospirosis, adjusting for potential confounders. Province-specific estimates were then pooled to derive regional and national estimates using random-effect meta-analysis. The highest risk of leptospirosis associated with rainfall at national level was observed at the same month (lag 0). Using 0 cm/month of rainfall as a reference, the relative risks of leptospirosis associated with heavy (90th percentile), very heavy (95th percentile), and extremely heavy (99th percentile) rainfall at the national level were 1.0994 (95% CI 0.9747, 1.2401), 1.1428 (95% CI 1.0154, 1.2862), and 1.1848 (95% CI 1.0494, 1.3378), respectively. The highest risk of human leptospirosis associated with rainfall was observed in the northern and north-eastern regions. Specifically, the relative risks of leptospirosis associated with extremely heavy rainfall in northern and north-eastern regions were 1.2362 (95% CI 0.9110, 1.6775) and 1.2046 (95% CI 0.9728, 1.4918), respectively. Increasing rainfall was associated with increased risks of leptospirosis, especially in the northern and northeastern regions of Thailand. This finding could be used for precautionary warnings against heavy rainfall.

35688386,The impact of genetic recombination on pathogenic Leptospira.,"Leptospirosis is the most common zoonosis worldwide, and is increasingly common in poor urban communities, where there is inadequate sewage disposal and abundance of domestic and peridomestic animals. There are many risk factors associated with the disease, such as contaminated water exposure, close contact with animals, floods, recreational activities related to water, wet agriculture. The symptoms of leptospirosis are common to other infectious diseases and, if not treated, it can lead to meningitis, liver failure, kidney damage and death. Leptospirosis is caused by 38 pathogenic species of Leptospira, which are divided in almost 30 serogroups and more than 300 serovars. The serological classification (serogroups and serovars) is based on the expression of distinct lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens. These antigens are also associated to protective immunity; antibodies against a serovar protect from any member of the same serovar. Serologic and phylogenetic analyses are not congruent probably due to genetic recombination of LPS genes among different leptospiral species. To analyze the importance of recombination in leptospiral evolution, we performed a gene-by-gene tree topology comparison on closed genomes available in public databases at two levels: among core genomes of pathogenic species (34 recombinant among 1213 core genes), and among core genomes of L. interrogans isolates (178/798). We found that most recombinant genes code for proteins involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, but also for cell wall, membrane and envelope biogenesis. Besides, our final results showed that half of LPS genes are recombinant (18/36). This is relevant because serovar classification and vaccine development are based on these epitopes. The frequent recombination of LPS-associated genes suggests that natural selection is promoting the survival of recombinant lineages. These results may help understanding the factors that make Leptospira a successful pathogen.","['Mejía L', 'Prado B', 'Cárdenas P', 'Trueba G', 'González-Candelas F']",2022,102,,Infect Genet Evol,"Mejía L, et al.

35687988,"Infectious causes of acute encephalitis syndrome hospitalizations in Central India, 2018-20.","BACKGROUND: We enhanced surveillance of hospitalizations of all ages for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) along with infectious aetiologies, including the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).
METHODS: From October 2018 to September 2020, we screened neurological patients for AES in all age groups in Maharashtra and Telangana States. AES cases were enrolled at study hospitals along with other referrals and sampled with cerebrospinal fluid, acute and convalescent sera. We tested specimens for non-viral aetiologies viz. leptospirosis, typhoid, scrub typhus, malaria and acute bacterial meningitis, along with viruses - JEV, Dengue virus (DENV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Chandipura virus (CHPV) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV).
RESULTS: Among 4977 neurological hospitalizations at three study site hospitals over two years period, 857 (17.2%) were AES. However, only 287 (33.5%) AES cases were eligible. Among 278 (96.9%) enrolled AES cases, infectious aetiologies were identified in 115 (41.4%) cases, including non-viral in 17 (6.1%) cases - leptospirosis (8), scrub-typhus (3) and typhoid (6); and viral in 98 (35.3%) cases - JEV (58, 20.9%), HSV (22, 7.9%), DENV (15, 5.4%) and CHPV (3, 1.1%). JEV confirmation was significantly higher in enrolled cases than referred cases (10.2%) (p < 0.05). However, the contribution of JEV in AES cases was similar in both children and adults. JE was reported year-round and from adjacent non-endemic districts.
CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese encephalitis virus continues to be the leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in central India despite vaccination among children. Surveillance needs to be strengthened along with advanced diagnostic testing for assessing the impact of vaccination.","['Tandale BV', 'Tomar SJ', 'Bondre VP', 'Sapkal GN', 'Damle RG', 'Narang R', 'Qazi MS', 'Goteti PV', 'Jain M', 'Jain D', 'Guduru VK', 'Jain J', 'Gosavi RV', 'Sekhar VC', 'Study-Group IE', 'Pavitrakar DV', 'Shankarraman V', 'Mahamuni SA', 'Salunkhe A', 'Khude P', 'Deshmukh PS', 'Deshmukh PR', 'Raut AV', 'Niswade AK', 'Bansod YV', 'Narlawar UW', 'Talapalliwar M', 'Rathod P', 'Jha PK', 'Rao RK', 'Jyothi K', 'B PS', 'M PK', 'K J KK', 'Taksande A', 'Kumar S', 'Mudey G', 'Yelke BS', 'Kamble M', 'Tankhiwale S']",2022,153,,J Clin Virol,"Tandale BV, et al.

35676790,Astragalus polysaccharides protects against acute leptospirosis by glycolysis-depended priming effect.,"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic leptospira, is a neglected infectious disease that causes acute kidney injury, bleeding disorders, and even death. People can become infected with leptospirosis when they travel into epidemic areas. Except for vaccines and antibiotics, there are few reports of other drugs about prevention of leptospirosis. In this study, we show that the natural molecular compound, astragalus polysaccharides (APS), prevents against acute leptospirosis in hamsters. Pretreatment with APS improved the survival rate of hamsters with more minor organ damage and lower leptospira burden. After pretreatment with APS, the expression levels of leptospira-induced TLR2, TLR4, and TNF-α were enhanced. The priming effect of APS was studied in vitro. The data showed that leptospira-induced expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β were higher in APS-primed peritoneal macrophage, with enhanced glucose consumption and lactate production. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that pretreatment with APS down regulated respiratory chain and mitochondrial function, up regulated glycolysis related gene expressions. After pretreatment with glycolysis inhibitor (2-DG), the priming effect of APS in leptospira infection was inhibited. Our results indicated that pretreatment with natural molecular compound, APS, protected against acute leptospirosis in hamsters by priming effect through enhanced glycolysis.","['Zhang W', 'Song N', 'Gao Y', 'Xie X', 'Liu K', 'Cao Y', 'Jin N']",2022,151,,Biomed Pharmacother,"Zhang W, et al.

35672661,"Serological and molecular characteristics of pathogenic Leptospira in rodent populations in Fujian Province, China, 2018-2020.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a significant emerging infectious disease worldwide. Rodents are considered to be the most critical hosts of Leptospira spp. Fujian Province is a region highly endemic for leptospirosis in China. However, the genetic diversity of leptospires circulating among rodents in Fujian is limited.
RESULTS: The carrier status of rodents for Leptospira spp. was investigated by culture and serological detection in Fujian during 2018-2020. A total of 710 rodents, including 11 species, were trapped, with Rattus losea being the dominant trapped species (50.56%). Fourteen pathogenic Leptospira strains were obtained. Seven L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica strains belonging to ST143, 4 L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains belonging to ST1 and ST17, 2 L. interrogans serogroup Bataviae strains belonging to ST96 and ST333, and 1 L. interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes strains belonging to ST332 were identified using 16S rDNA gene sequencing, microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST). L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica belonging to ST143 was the dominant type (50.00%). A total of 387 rodent serum samples were tested by MAT. Serum were considered positive for seroreactivity at a titer ≥ 1:160 against at least one serovar. A total of 90 (23.26%) serum samples tested positive, and four serogroups were identified, with Javanica being the dominant serogroup (87.78%), which was similar to the dominant serogroup isolated from rodents. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of leptospirosis in rodents and public health education among high-risk workers is highly recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: R. losea was the dominant trapped rodent, and L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica ST143 was widely distributed among rodents in Fujian from 2018 to 2020. Despite the low number of isolates obtained from rodents, this study suggests that continuous epidemiological surveillance of the aetiological characteristics of pathogenic Leptospira in wild animal reservoirs may help reduce the possible risk of disease transmission.","['Xu G', 'Qiu H', 'Liu W', 'Jiang X', 'Chang YF', 'Wang J', 'Li Z', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhang C', 'Xiao F']",2022,22,1,BMC Microbiol,"Xu G, et al.

Aim is to generate empirical updated evidence of leptospiral infection and delineate serovars involved.
METHODS: Study determined the sero-prevalence and infection rate in 342 dogs using sero-assays, culture isolation and novel qPCR. In-house designed primers targeting conserved regions were used to amplify genes in quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) for leptospiral detection to serogroups.

35618255,Comparative genomic analysis of Leptospira spp. isolated from Rattus norvegicus in Indonesia.,"Leptospirosis is one of the most prevalent zoonotic diseases caused by pathogenic spirochetes of Leptospira spp. The disease has become a public health concern in urban localities in the tropics, where rats serve as significant reservoir animals for leptospirosis transmission. In Indonesia, the occurrence of leptospirosis is underestimated, and information on the causative Leptospira genotypes and serotypes is limited. This study reports the isolation of Leptospira spp. from rats captured in urban areas of Bogor, Indonesia. Serogroups and genotypes, sequence types (STs), or multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) types using 11 loci, were determined for the isolates. Furthermore, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 11 Indonesian isolates and 24 isolates from other Asian countries. Ninety small mammals, including 80 Rattus norvegicus and ten Suncus murinus, were captured and, 25 Leptospira spp. were isolated solely from R. norvegicus (31.3%). The isolates were identified as Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica with ST 143 (four strains) and Leptospira interrogans serogroup Bataviae with the same MLVA type as isolates from other Asian countries (19); the serogroup of the two L. interrogans with ST252 could not be identified. The core genome SNP-based phylogenetic tree revealed that Indonesian isolates were genetically related to L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica strains widely distributed in Asian countries but formed a different cluster from other strains. The phylogenetic tree of L. interrogans serogroup Bataviae isolates from Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam revealed that isolates were grouped into five clusters based on their geographic locations. This study discovered a high carriage rate of Leptospira spp. among R. norvegicus in Bogor, Indonesia, indicating a potential risk of rat-borne leptospirosis in the area.

35589947,"Prevalence of leptospirosis among patients attending renal and general outpatient clinics in Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda.","In this study, we sought to establish the prevalence of leptospirosis among renal patients and general outpatients attending Mulago National Referral Hospital, Uganda. A total of 254 patients were recruited, their blood samples collected and interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaires provided between July and October 2018. These questionnaires captured data on sociodemographic characteristics and symptoms of leptospirosis disease. An individual with an average body temperature of 37.3 ± 1.1 °C was considered to be having fever. The blood samples were analyzed using the standard Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) with a panel of 14 Leptospira-serovars belonging to 11 serogroups. Prevalence was reported with confidence intervals while questionnaire data was analyzed using logistic regression analysis. We present an overall prevalence of leptospirosis at 4.70% (95% CI = 2.60-8.30) after analysis of samples from recruited patients. This seropositivity (12/254) was classified into 7 serovars, among which, Canicola and Djasiman presented with titers between ≥ 200 and ≥ 400 in samples of both renal patients and outpatients, indicative of the active disease. Djasiman was the highest contributor to the reported prevalence. Overall, most examined participants presented with common symptoms of abdominal pain (AOR = 24.4, 95% CI (2.42-267.89), p = 0.02) and dehydration (AOR = 0.1, 95% CI (0.01-0.69), p = 0.05). Our study suggests that these symptoms and previous history of abdominal pain may be caused by Leptospira infections among the studied participants. We therefore recommend inclusion of leptospirosis in the differential diagnosis for renal and febrile illnesses. Indeed, abdominal pain and dehydration should be further studied with a bigger sample size and for other related febrile illnesses.","['Wambi R', 'Worodria W', 'Muleme J', 'Aggrey S', 'Mugisha L']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Wambi R, et al.

35584087,Pulmonary haemorrhage as the earliest sign of severe leptospirosis in hamster model challenged with Leptospira interrogans strain HP358.,"BACKGROUND: Severe leptospirosis is challenging as it could evolve rapidly and potentially fatal if appropriate management is not performed. An understanding of the progression and pathophysiology of Leptospira infection is important to determine the early changes that could be potentially used to predict the severe occurrence of leptospirosis. This study aimed to understand the kinetics pathogenesis of Leptospira interrogans strain HP358 in the hamster model and identify the early parameters that could be used as biomarkers to predict severe leptospirosis.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Male Syrian hamsters were infected with Leptospira interrogans strain HP358 and euthanized after 24 hours, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days post-infection. Blood, lungs, liver and kidneys were collected for leptospiral detection, haematology, serum biochemistry and differential expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. Macroscopic and microscopic organ damages were investigated. Leptospira interrogans strain HP358 was highly pathogenic and killed hamsters within 6-7 days post-infection. Pulmonary haemorrhage and blood vessel congestion in organs were noticed as the earliest pathological changes. The damages in organs and changes in biochemistry value were preceded by changes in haematology and immune gene expression.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study deciphered haemorrhage as the earliest manifestation of severe leptospirosis and high levels of IL-1β, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-α, neutrophils and low levels of lymphocytes and platelets serve as a cumulative panel of biomarkers in severe leptospirosis.","['Philip N', 'Priya SP', 'Jumah Badawi AH', 'Mohd Izhar MH', 'Mohtarrudin N', 'Tengku Ibrahim TA', 'Sekawi Z', 'Neela VK']",2022,16,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Philip N, et al.

Electronic records search was performed to identify dogs with results for both PCR and MAT testing for leptospirosis.
METHODS: All dogs were clinically ill. Diagnosis of leptospirosis was defined as an unvaccinated dog with a positive MAT titer of ≥1:800 or a vaccinated dog or dog with an unknown vaccination status with a positive MAT titer of ≥1:1,600. Diagnosis of leptospirosis was excluded based on MAT titer <1:800 on both the initial and convalescent samples or an initial MAT titer <1:800 and an alternative definitive diagnosis.
RESULTS: Forty-nine samples (urine, 
CONCLUSIONS: PCR assay performed on urine or blood has high specificity and positive predictive value when compared to MAT for diagnosis of clinical canine leptospirosis. Sensitivity and negative predictive value are moderate to low, so PCR testing should be performed in conjunction with paired MAT testing for canine leptospirosis. Prior antibiotic therapy does not preclude the use of the PCR test.","['Martin EA', 'Heseltine JC', 'Creevy KE']",2022,9,,Front Vet Sci,"Martin EA, et al.

35551530,"Leptospirosis: Morbidity, mortality, and spatial distribution of hospitalized cases in Ecuador. A nationwide study 2000-2020.","BACKGROUND: In Ecuador, leptospirosis surveillance involves a mandatory notification of all cases and a hospitalization for severe illness. Morbidity and mortality are, nevertheless, underestimated and contribute directly to the status of leptospirosis as a neglected disease. Leptospira spp. is zoonotic in Ecuador with established endemic transmission in the Tropics. Here, we review retrospective national data within the country to aid in control strategies.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a population-based nationwide study, we analysed morbidity, mortality, and spatial distribution on confirmed hospital-discharged leptospirosis cases from 2000-2020 from a publicly accesible National Database, including males and females of all ages. We computed data for the 24 provinces across the four-geoclimatic regions of Ecuador based on seasonal and monthly variations and calculated rates according to age and sex. The spatial distribution was estimated at the level of ecoregions, provinces, and cantons. A total of 2,584 hospitalizations were recorded over all three continental regions in 22 provinces, except Carchi province and the Galapagos Islands. The annual incidence varied from 0.27 to 2.45 cases per 100,000 inhabitants with ages ranging from 1 to 98 years-old and an overall male/female ratio of 1.92:1. Most hospitalizations and deaths occurred in males ages 25-34 years. We registered 79 fatalities (3.06%); the highest mortality rate was 0.05 per 100,000 inhabitants. More cases clustered in the tropical cantons of central and north of the Coast and in the southern Amazon when compared to the Andes.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings evidence leptospirosis endemicity and pinpoint the highest incidence within resource-poor tropical settings. The highest incidence occurred in males of adult age, with those also exhibiting the highest mortality. The national incidence rate was stable, but peaks occurred intermittently during the rainy seasons. Thus, strategies aimed at leptospirosis monitoring and control involving the application of preventive measures should consider this season and the aforementioned high-risk groups.","['Calvopiña M', 'Vásconez E', 'Coral-Almeida M', 'Romero-Alvarez D', 'Garcia-Bereguiain MA', 'Orlando A']",2022,16,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Calvopiña M, et al.

35544621,"Leptospiral infection: a serosurvey in urban and rural communities in Olavarría county, Argentina.","INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease, affecting mainly poor and vulnerable populations.
METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional-study was carried out in 557 subjects from Olavarría county (Argentina) to estimate the seroprevalence of leptospirosis and the factors associated with seropositivity. A survey was carried out to obtain clinical and epidemiological data. Serum was tested for anti-leptospiral antibodies by Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT). Chi-square or Fisher Exact tests were used to assess association between the MAT results and the exploratory variables. For the variables statistically associated, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Individuals from Olavarría city were georeferenced to describe the spatial distribution and to detect clusters of seropositivity for leptospiral antibodies.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of leptospirosis infection was 7.00%, higher in rural (19.66%) than in urban populations (3.64%) (p < 0.001). Sejroe was the most predominant serogroup in rural communities while Icterohaemorrhagiae was the most prevalent in urban populations. The factors associated with Leptospira infection were the presence of rodents inside households (OR = 3.9) in rural populations, while contact with cats (OR = 4.97) and male gender (OR = 7.75) represented higher risk of infection for the urban ones. Cases with positive serology have been found near Tapalqué stream or in the peripheral areas of Olavarría city.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from data obtained during the study period were similar to other reports and demonstrate the importance of continuous epidemiological surveillance system and specific community educational campaigns to prevent the leptospirosis infection in Olavarría county and other communities with similar characteristics especially in rural areas.","['Rivero MA', 'Scialfa EA', 'Appendino HM', 'Barbero M', 'Barragán P', 'Martin FC', 'Morón B', 'Silva JA', 'Tisnés A', 'Estein SM', 'Signorini ML', 'González Ayala SE', 'Bolpe J']",2022,16,4,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Rivero MA, et al.

35533268,Emerging canine leptospirosis in Sydney and the role of population demographics.,"An outbreak of canine leptospirosis commenced in Sydney, Australia in 2017. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine if clusters of leptospirosis occurred during this outbreak, and if these were associated with host factors, to assist investigation of the drivers of emerging leptospirosis at this location. Within the City of Sydney local government area, 13 cases were reported during the outbreak. Administrative data on the canine population were collected and mapped. Clusters of leptospirosis cases were detected using a retrospective space-time analysis and a discrete Poisson probability statistical model. Sydney dog population registration [55.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 51.8-58.1%] was lower than the Australian national average (80%). The distribution of dog types, based on the United Kennel Club standards, was significantly (p < .0001) different to that of the national profile: there was a distinct preference in Sydney for companion dogs. The age distribution of dogs in Sydney did not reflect a typical right-skewed curve; instead, a relatively uniform distribution was observed between the age group of 1 to 8 years. A primary disease cluster (radius 1.1 km) in the eastern area of the Sydney City Council was identified (4 cases observed between 24 May and 9 August 2019 vs. 0.10 cases expected), p = .0450. When adjusted for the age, breed type and sex distribution of the population, similar clusters were identified; in the case of age-adjustment, the spatiotemporal cluster identified was larger and of longer duration (seven cases observed between 28 June and 11 November 2019 versus 0.34 cases expected), p = .0025. The presence of clusters of canine leptospirosis in the City of Sydney during this outbreak, which persisted after adjustment for demographics (age, sex, breed type), suggest that environmental factors - rather than host or pathogen factors - might be responsible for the emergence of leptospirosis. Environmental factors that potentially might be linked to this outbreak of canine leptospirosis and the clusters observed require investigation.","['Gong J', 'Griebsch C', 'Kirkwood N', 'Norris JM', 'Ward MP']",2022,69,5,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Gong J, et al.

35526804,"Some like it hot, some like it cold; proteome comparison of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strains propagated at different temperatures.","Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease affecting humans and livestock species. Bacterin vaccines lack cross protection between serogroups, and include multiple serovars propagated at 29 °C. Recent work demonstrated substantial variation in the transcriptome of identical species and serovars of Leptospira. Here, substantial differences in protein abundance profiles were identified in Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo; strain HB203, which was isolated in the 1980s, compared to newer strains TC129 and TC273 isolated in 2016, and whether they were propagated at the routine temperature of 29 °C, compared to 37 °C which more closely emulates host infection. While 388 and 385 significantly differentially expressed (DE) proteins (FDR of 0.01) were identified in HB203 versus TC129, and HB203 versus TC273 when propagated at 29 °C respectively, only 66 and 4 DE proteins were identified in HB203 versus TC129, and HB203 versus TC273 when propagated at 37 °C respectively. Within each strain comparing temperatures, HB203 had 524 significantly DE proteins, TC129 had 347 DE proteins, and TC273 had 569 DE proteins. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD032831. Results highlight significant differential protein expression among identical serovars of L. borgpetersenii suggesting that bacterin vaccine design can benefit from consideration of strains employed and effects of temperature on growth. SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by spirochete bacteria of the genus Leptospira. While leptospirosis affects over one million people per year, symptoms range vastly in severity from completely asymptomatic, to flu-like, to multi-organ failure and death in severe cases. Incidental hosts become infected after encountering pathogens directly from contact with another host, including domestic or wildlife animals, or indirectly from contaminated environments. Though animal vaccines exist, they lack cross protection across serogroups, and instead rely on inclusion of multiple carefully selected serovars from laboratory strains prepared at ~29 °C. Recent interest in gene expression at the Leptospira strain level, along with a newly achieved culture temperature of 37 °C (which more closely resembles host body temperature), led us to investigate the proteomic profiles of an older, established challenge strain HB203 in comparison to TC129 and TC273, two strains isolated in 2016 from abattoir cattle in the central United States. Herein, we identify substantial proteomic differences not only between strains of the same species and serovar, but notably between growth temperatures, collectively suggesting that bacterin vaccine composition may benefit from investigating strain selection and the temperature employed for growth of the bacteria used in bacterin preparation.","['Putz EJ', 'Fernandes LGV', 'Sivasankaran SK', 'Bayles DO', 'Alt DP', 'Lippolis JD', 'Nally JE']",2022,262,,J Proteomics,"Putz EJ, et al.

Around the world, one million people each year are infected, leading to 60,000 deaths. Infection occurs through contact with environmental pathogens excreted by mammals (notably rodents). Data on Leptospira and leptospirosis in Africa are rather scarce, especially in urban habitats though these appear to be favourable environments for the pathogen circulation and human contamination. Using qPCR, DNA sequencing as well as MST/VNTR approaches, we examined Leptospira occurrence and genetic diversity in 779 commensal small mammals that were sampled over 2 years in the city centre of Cotonou, Benin, from three neighbourhoods with contrasting socio-environmental conditions. Overall prevalence reached 9.1%. However, very marked variations in both space and time were observed, with local peaks of high prevalence but no clear seasonal pattern. In most sites that could be regularly sampled, Leptospira-positive rodents were found at least once, thus confirming the widespread circulation of the pathogen within small mammal communities of Cotonou. Interestingly, an unusual diversity of small mammal-borne Leptospira species and genotypes was retrieved, with up to four species and three different genovars within the same neighbourhood, and even instances of two species and two genovars identified simultaneously within the same household. To our knowledge, such a high genetic diversity has never been described at such a fine scale, a fortiori in Africa and, more generally, within an urban environment.

In Chile, the zoonoses of mandatory notification are brucellosis, anthrax, trichinosis, hydatidosis, leptospirosis, dengue, Chagas disease, hantavirosis and rabies.
AIM: To assess the trend and characterize the mortality from zoonoses of mandatory notification in Chile between 1997-2018.
METHODS: An official mortality and population data were used. Relative, general and specific mortality rates were described according to sociodemographic variables. Crude and adjusted annual mortality rates (direct method) were calculated. Temporal trend was evaluated with the Prais-Winsten regression model.
RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2018, the mortality rate due to zoonosis of mandatory notification corresponded to 0.13% (2152 deaths) of the total mortality, being Chagas disease (59.2%), hydatidosis (24.6%) and hantavirosis (13.5%) the main causes.

Transmission of the disease can occur via rats or surface water infected by rats. The Netherlands have seen a record number of cases of leptospirosis in 2019. Diagnosis is often delayed and not always considered because of the variable clinical presentation of the disease. Surveillance of disease prevention concerning rat breeders is inadequate.

35492362,"Biannual and Quarterly Comparison Analysis of Agglutinating Antibody Kinetics on a Subcohort of Individuals Exposed to Leptospira interrogans in Salvador, Brazil.","INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonosis with a worldwide spread that leads to clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection to a life-threatening disease. The immune response is predominantly humoral mediated limited to the infecting serovar. Individuals living in an area endemic for leptospirosis are often exposed to an environment contaminated with leptospires and there is a paucity of information on naturally acquired immunity. In the present study, we evaluated the kinetics of agglutinating antibodies in individuals from an endemic area for leptospirosis in Salvador, Brazil comparing two different intersample collection times.
METHODS: Between 2017-2018, we carried out a biannual prospective cohort with 2,086 individuals living in an endemic area for leptospirosis in Salvador, Brazil. To compare agglutinating antibody kinetics using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with different collection times, a subcohort of 72 individuals with quarterly follow-up was carried out in parallel.
RESULTS: The results revealed that using a shorter time for intersample collection led to the detection of a higher number of infections and reinfection events. Furthermore, we observed a higher rate of titer decay indicating partial and short protection. However, there was no indication of major changes in risk factors for the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated antibody kinetics among residents of an endemic area for leptospirosis comparing two sample collection times. The constant exposure to the contaminated environment increases the risk for leptospirosis infection with reinfection events being more common than expected. This indicates that the burden of leptospirosis might be underestimated by serological surveys, and further studies are necessary to better characterize the humoral response after infection.","['Cruz JS', 'Nery N', 'Sacramento GA', 'Victoriano R', 'Montenegro ALS', 'Santana JO', 'Costa F', 'Ko AI', 'Reis MG', 'Wunder EA']",2022,9,,Front Med (Lausanne),"Cruz JS, et al.

35491227,Hantavirus Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome - Suspected Cases in Sri Lanka: Clinical Picture and Epidemiology from 2013-2021.,"Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an emerging zoonotic disease in Europe and Asia, which is clinically indistinguishable from leptospirosis. A total of 1,032 patients with clinical suspicion of HFRS-like illness were included in the analysis from March 2013 to March 2021. Of these, 168 were positive for hantavirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Thirty-one of 35 patients had a 4-fold increase in IgG antibody titer with paired serum, confirming acute hantavirus infections. The detected antibodies showed a diverse pattern, strongly cross-reacting with the Seoul, Hantaan, and Puumala virus antigens. All the IgM-positive patients had no serological evidence of acute dengue or leptospirosis and had classical features of HFRS, including fever, thrombocytopenia, and renal involvement. More than 90% of patients had a history of rodent exposure 2-3 weeks prior to the onset of the fever. The highest number of positive cases was diagnosed in the Western and North Central Provinces of Sri Lanka during the paddy harvesting seasons. A significant number of patients develop severe complications with high mortality rates. Therefore, hantavirus infection should be considered as a differential diagnosis for leptospirosis-like illnesses in Sri Lanka.","['Muthugala R', 'Dheerasekara K', 'Manamperi A', 'Gunasena S', 'Galagoda G']",2022,75,5,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Muthugala R, et al.

35486672,Detection of Leptospirosis Genome from the Aqueous Humor of a Patient with Bilateral Uveitis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospira species are difficult to culture. Thus, when there is suspicion for an infectious etiology to uveitis, bacterial cultures may fail to identify Leptospira. We describe a case of leptospirosis-associated uveitis that evaded culture and molecular assays. DNA sequencing of the aqueous fluid showed the presence of Leptospira spp.
METHODS: Retrospective case review of clinical and laboratory features of a patient with ocular leptospirosis is presented.
RESULTS: DNA sequencing identified the genome of Leptospirosis spp. in the aqueous humor.
CONCLUSION: Metagenomic sequencing, by virtue of its unbiased nature, can be a helpful adjunctive test when a strong clinical suspicion for intraocular infection persists despite negative routine culture and molecular assays.","['Gonzales JA', 'Sundararajan M', 'Qian Y', 'Hwang T', 'Doan T']",2023,31,5,Ocul Immunol Inflamm,"Gonzales JA, et al.

35483416,[Leptospirosis: A growing health threat to fish farming and recreational activities].,"Leptospirosis is a cosmopolitan infectious disease caused by the bacteria Leptospirainterrogans, which is worldwide increasing as the result of climate changes favoring the reproduction of asymptomatic reservoir rodents and also flooding that brings mammals and humans into contact with contaminated water. This disease affects many mammals among wild, domestic or farmed animals. In humans, it is manifested through frustrated to severe forms that can lead to liver and kidney failure and death in about one in ten severe cases. Diagnostic methods and treatments are satisfactory. Prophylaxis is based on individual protective measures including vaccination. The single human vaccine that is available is expensive and it protects 97% against about a third of human pathogenic serovars. Moreover, this vaccine is not covered by health insurance. Better epidemiological knowledge, particularly at European level, could stimulate research in this area in order to obtain a vaccine that would protect more comprehensively against serovars pathogenic to humans.","['Loiseau PM', 'German M']",2022,80,6,Ann Pharm Fr,Loiseau PM and German M.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical features and outcomes of patients infected with both infections. A retrospective review of charts of all patients with COVID-19 who were also diagnosed with leptospirosis by immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was undertaken. The clinical features, laboratory report, treatment details, and outcomes of all the included patients were recorded. The collected data were summarized as the frequency with percentage for categorical data and the mean or median for continuous data. Twenty-four cases of coinfections were admitted between July and November 2020. Most of these patients were categorized as severe COVID-19 (n = 15, 62.5%). Acute kidney injury was seen in 79.2% (n = 19) patients, while raised bilirubin was present in 79.2% (n = 19) of the patients. All patients had raised C-reactive protein, while all but one had raised procalcitonin. Thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis, and leukocytopenia were seen in 91.7% (n = 22), 45.8% (n = 11), and 12.5% (n = 3) of the patients. The median duration of hospital stay was 11 (8.25-15) days. A total of 79.2% (n = 19) of the patients improved and were discharged, while 20.8% (n = 5) died during the hospital stay.

35469592,Fever in the Returning Traveler.,"BACKGROUND: It is predicted that approximately two billion tourist trips to foreign countries will be taken worldwide each year by 2030. Germany has long been among the most active countries in tourism. The frequency of illness among persons returning from developing and newly industrialized countries is 43-79%. The appropriate diagnosis of fever in returning travelers is a clinically important matter, as it can be a sign of a life-threatening illness.
METHODS: This review is based on publications (2001-2022) retrieved by a selective search in PubMed for studies on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of febrile illnesses in returning travelers, or on specific tropical diseases.
RESULTS: Diarrhea, fever, and skin changes are the most common manifestations of disease after travel to tropical and sub - tropical areas. The diagnostic evaluation should be performed in a series of steps, beginning with a precise travel history and the identification of specific risk factors. Among travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the most common cause of fever on presentation to centers for infectious diseases and tropical medicine, affecting approximately 50 per 1000 travelers. Among persons returning from travel to Southeast Asia, dengue fever is the most common infectious disease, affecting 50-160 per 1000 travelers. Further potentially dangerous diseases include chikungunya and zika fever, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, amoebic liver abscess, visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), leptospirosis, and, very rarely, imported cases of viral hemorrhagic fever. COVID-19 and influenza are important differential diagnoses.
CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis can be narrowed by thorough history-taking with particular attention to the patient's travel route, combined with a good knowledge of the geographic spread and incubation times of the main tropical diseases. Algorithms help clinicians to focus the diagnostic work-up and select the appropriate further laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures.","['Paquet D', 'Jung L', 'Trawinski H', 'Wendt S', 'Lübbert C']",2022,119,22,Dtsch Arztebl Int,"Paquet D, et al.

Although rare, it is possible to have coinfection with organisms that are endemic in a region, causing diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. Leptospirosis is caused by Gram-negative spirochetes. Leptospira are widely distributed and are transmitted by contamination of water and food by the urine of infected animals like rodents. Leptospirosis is characterized by fever, body aches, abdominal pain, and hepatic and renal involvement. Laboratory abnormalities include cytopenia, elevated bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and abnormal renal function tests. Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), which is transmitted by fecal contamination of drinking water and food items. The clinical manifestations of typhoid fever include fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Laboratory abnormalities include cytopenia and mildly deranged liver function tests. A strain of S. typhi resistant to all antibiotics except azithromycin and carbapenems was isolated in 2016 in Pakistan. Most of the clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities of leptospirosis and typhoid fever overlap. There have been case reports of coinfection of S. typhi and Leptospira, but there is no report of coinfection of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) S. typhi and Leptospira. We present a case of a 20-year-old man with fever, loose motions, and jaundice from Peshawar, Pakistan who had coinfection of Leptospira and XDR S. typhi.

35429805,"Compatibility between a rabies vaccine and two canine combined vaccines against canine distemper, adenovirosis, parvovirosis, parainfluenza virus disease and leptospirosis, with or without canine coronavirus.","In many countries, vaccination programs still require dogs to be vaccinated against rabies in addition to Canine distemper virus (CDV), adenovirus (CAV), parvovirus (CPV), parainfluenza virus (CPiV), Leptospira (L) or Canine coronavirus (CCV= Cv). Few vaccines containing all these antigens are commercially available and, unless compatibility between the vaccines was demonstrated, concurrent administration of a DAPPi-L(Cv) vaccine and a vaccine against rabies should not be recommended. This may be of concern for practitioners who wish to vaccinate dogs with all components on the same day. This study aimed at evaluating immunological compatibility between a monovalent rabies vaccine (Rabisin™) and two large combination vaccines against CDV, CAV, CPV, CPiV with 2 leptospira components +Cv (Recombitek® C6/Cv) or with 4 Leptospira components (Recombitek® C8), when injected concomitantly at two separate injection sites. Fourteen days after administration of the rabies vaccine, with or without concomitant administration of combo vaccines, all dogs had seroconverted against rabies and maintained protective titers over the duration of the study. In addition, 100% of the puppies vaccinated with one or the other combo vaccines seroconverted against CDV, CAV, CPV, CPiV (CCV) and Leptospira, whatever the vaccination group. Lack of immunological interference between Rabisin™ and all components of the Recombitek® C6/Cv or Recombitek® C8 Combo vaccines was demonstrated by non-inferiority analysis, except for CDV in the Recombitek®C8+ Rabisin™ group. Based on these results, a concomitant administration of Rabisin™ with Recombitek® C6/Cv or Recombitek® C8 can be recommended in daily practice, which can be essential for facilitating vaccination compliance.","['Thibault JC', 'Bouvet J', 'Cupillard L', 'Cariou C', 'Oberli F']",2022,86,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Thibault JC, et al.

METHODOLOGY: A hospital-based surveillance in 11 public hospitals in 3 provinces in Vietnam enrolled 3,815 patients with suspected leptospirosis. Two consecutive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IgM and a single microscopic aggregation test were applied at a 1:100 to 1:800 dilution for probable or confirmed cases.
RESULTS: The findings showed that of the 3,815 suspected cases, 68 (1.8%) were Leptospira-confirmed and 248 (6.5%) probable cases, whereas more than a third were positive for acute ELISA-IgM sera. Furthermore, 20 different serovars were found, of which Wolffi (14.2%), Hebdomadis (13.8%), and Icterohaemorrhagiae (12.6%) were the most predominant. The ratio of probable and confirmed cases of leptospirosis between females and males was 1.4:1, and their clinical manifestation was not specific. Cases were more likely to be detected in groups that are farmers, pet raising or livestock farming, of working age, practicing either wading in mud or walking barefoot, or exposed to heavy rainfall.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of human leptospirosis has indicated fairly high seroprevalence and diversity of Leptospira serovars circulating in all studied geographical zones in Vietnam.

35398418,"Monitoring of Leptospira species diversity in freshwater bathing area and in rats in Paris, France.","Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution caused by bacterial pathogenic Leptospira. Rodents are considered as the main reservoir of Leptospira and transmission usually occurs through exposure to urine-contaminated environment. However, interactions between environment, rodent reservoir and human leptospirosis remain poorly studied. Here, we evaluated the concentration of Leptospira in surface water and captured rats in the city of Paris (France) from 2018 to 2020 using an integrity qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction). All environmental samples (n = 1031) were positive for saprophytic Leptospira but pathogenic Leptospira P1 group were only found in 40% (n = 363; 2018) to 0% (n = 264; 2020) of samples. In the same time, analysis of 200 brown rat corpses trapped in the city, showed about 15% of positivity for Leptospira but the different method used for rats conservation (based on presence or absence of conservative agent) showed important variations in the Leptospira prevalence. Metagenomic analysis, based on rrs gene sequencing, was also carried out to evaluate the distribution of Leptospira in samples. Results could indicate that some species of Leptospira are found in surface waters as well as rats, but further study is needed to accurately describe the nature of the link between these two reservoirs. Quantification of Leptospira and pathogenic species description circulating inside animal reservoir living in the vicinity of freshwater in urban areas, will be helpful to understand the eco-epidemiology of leptospirosis and to establish prevention and intervention strategies, especially in the context of organization of recreative activity events in these urban areas.","['Richard E', 'Geslin J', 'Wurtzer S', 'Moulin L']",2022,833,,Sci Total Environ,"Richard E, et al.

35390628,The role of Leptospira santarosai serovar Guaricura as agent of Bovine Genital Leptospirosis.,"Bovine Genital Leptospirosis (BGL) is an important reproductive disease. The main agents are Sejroe strains, particularly the Hardjo genotypes from Leptospira interrogans and L. borgpetersenii. Although other Sejroe strain, L. santarosai genotype Guaricura, has been frequently isolated from asymptomatic and slaughtered cattle, even from vaginal fluid samples, the role of this strain as real agent of BGL remains uncertain. This study aimed to reinforce L. santarosai strain Guaricura as an important BGL agent, through genetic characterization of a uterine isolate from a live subfertile cow. Urine, cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) and uterine fragment (UF) were collected. In a set up field laboratory, urine, CVM and UF were immediately seeded in T80/40LH medium with antimicrobial cocktail STAFF. Cultures were subcultured in T80/40LH without cocktails, stored at 29ºC and weekly examined. DNA from urine, CVM and UF samples were submitted to PCR targeting lipL32 and secY genes. One leptospiral isolate was recovered from uterine sample; it was serogrouped as Sejroe (titre 25,600) and secY sequencing revealed high genetic similarity with L. santarosai strains from Guaricura serovar. The isolation of this strain from uterus of a live subfertile cow represents substantial evidence that L. santarosai strain Guaricura indeed plays an important role as a BGL agent.","['Aymée L', 'Nogueira Di Azevedo MI', 'de Souza Pedrosa J', 'Loria de Melo JDS', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2022,268,,Vet Microbiol,"Aymée L, et al.

35387956,Natural infection of leptospirosis and melioidosis in long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Thailand.,"This study aimed to determine the incidence of leptospirosis and melioidosis in long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Thailand. Serum samples from 223 monkeys were subjected to the Lepto Latex Test and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test to detect antibodies against Leptospira spp. and Burkholderia pseudomallei. The microagglutination test (MAT) was used to identify serovars of Leptospira spp. Conventional PCR for the LipL32 gene of L. interogans and the BPSS0120 and btfc-orf18 genes of B. pseudomallei was used for molecular detection. The overall seroprevalence of leptospirosis and melioidosis was 2.69% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99-5.76%) and 14.35% (95% CI: 10.03-19.65%), respectively. Six samples that showed positive MAT results were also positive for IHA. The serovars of Leptospira were Ranarum (5/6), Shermani (6/6), and both (5/6). Conventional PCR for the LipL32 gene of Leptospira spp. was positive in 10.31% of the samples (95% CI: 5.56-13.51%). However, there were no positive results for BPSS0120 and btfc-orf18 in B. pseudomallei. Active infection was detected only for leptospirosis; however, it can be assumed that pathogen exposure occurred in this group of animals because immunity could be detected. The routes of infection and elimination pathways of both bacteria remain unclear, and the mechanism of protection in non-human primates needs to be elucidated in further studies. Moreover, this health issue should be considered to prevent human infections in monkeys and their environment.","['Saechan V', 'Tongthainan D', 'Fungfuang W', 'Tulayakul P', 'Ieamsaard G', 'Ngasaman R']",2022,84,5,J Vet Med Sci,"Saechan V, et al.

The aim of this study was to determine the existence of scrub typhus in central and eastern Uttar Pradesh, India in patients with acute febrile illness (AFI) presenting to a super specialty tertiary level institute.
METHODS: This prospective hospital-based study was conducted for a period of one year, from August 2018 to July 2019. About 2-5 mL of blood samples, along with clinical, epidemiological, and demographic data from a total of 125 patients presenting with acute febrile illness to outpatient and inpatient departments, were collected. ELISA testing tested the sera from blood samples for IgM antibodies against scrub typhus. Samples were also tested for dengue, leptospirosis, malaria and typhoid.
RESULTS: During the study period, out of a total of 125 samples collected, 20% were found positive for IgM antibodies against scrub typhus. Demographically higher positivity was found in males, older age group, and in rural area. Rainfall was found to be important epidemiological parameter for presence of scrub typhus. Co-infection with dengue, leptospirosis and malaria was found.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Scrub typhus is found to be an important cause of acute febrile illness. It is necessary to include it in differential diagnosis of AFI cases even in absence of eschar. Diagnostic facilities of this as a screening test should be started in primary care centers or community health centers of rural areas of districts of central and eastern Uttar Pradesh, India.","['Mittal V', 'Singh P', 'Shukla S', 'Karoli R']",2021,58,4,J Vector Borne Dis,"Mittal V, et al.

35379346,Circulating serogroups of Leptospira in swine from a 7-year study in France (2011-2017).,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira and is responsible for significant economic porcine livestock losses. Knowledge of Leptospira serogroups and their distributions is important for evaluation of the relevance of leptospirosis management measures, including use of the prophylactic vaccine that was recently made available in France. A retrospective study was conducted to determine the relationships between different circulating Leptospira serogroups. Pigs from across France presenting clinical signs suggestive of leptospirosis were tested with the microagglutination test (MAT) between 2011 and 2017. We used weighted averages to determine serogroup distributions according to MAT results and considering cross-reactions.
RESULTS: A total of 19,395 pig sera, mostly from Brittany, were tested, and 22.7% were found to be positive for at least one Leptospira serogroup. Analysis of the 4,346 seropositive results for which the putative infective serogroup could be defined, revealed that two out of ten serogroups were much more frequent than the others: Australis (48.5%) and Icterohaemorrhagiae (38.2%). Other serogroups, including Autumnalis, Panama, Ballum, Tarassovi, Sejroe, Grippotyphosa, Bataviae, and Pomona, were less common.
CONCLUSIONS: Although diagnostic laboratory data cannot be extrapolated to infer the distribution of Leptospira serogroups at the nationwide scale in France, the analysis of such data can provide an overview of the relationship between circulating Leptospira serogroups in space and time. During the last decade, protection against the serogroups Australis and Icterohaemorrhagiae would have prevented most of the clinical porcine leptospirosis cases in the large number of farms that we studied. In the future, epidemiological information related to circulating Leptospira serogroups should be extracted from data with a standardized approach for use in nationwide or international surveillance and prophylactic strategy support.","['Naudet J', 'Crespin L', 'Cappelle J', 'Kodjo A', 'Ayral F']",2022,8,1,Porcine Health Manag,"Naudet J, et al.

35366060,"Spatial distribution models of seroreactive sheep to Leptospira spp. in Veracruz, Mexico.","Leptospirosis is an infectious zoonotic disease of special importance in tropical regions of the world and is closely related to climatic conditions. In Mexico, at least eight Leptospira serogroups are known to affect sheep, but little is known about their distribution. The aim was to analyse the spatial distribution of seroreactive sheep to eight serogroups of Leptospira spp. through ecological niche modelling from the state of Veracruz. We carried out a cross-sectional, multistage, and stratified epidemiological study, sampling 405 sheep in different regions of the state (north, center, and south). The sera were analysed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) to identify seropositivity to eight Leptospira serogroups (Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pyrogenes, Grippotyphosa, Canicola, Pomona, Hardjo, Wolffi, and Tarassovi). Management variables in the sampled herds were evaluated through a survey among the producers, which was analysed using the chi-squared test for cross-tabulation. Geospatial modelling was conducted using MAXENT and 19 climatic variables, and validation was carried out using the area under the curve (AUC). No positive animals were found for Pomona in any area of Veracruz, and there was only one case of seroreactivity to Grippotyphosa. The total seroprevalence found was 53.83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.84-58.75). The main serogroup found was Sejroe (55.31%, 95% CI 50.32-60.20%), followed by Canicola (8.64%, 95% CI 6.17-11.92%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (4.69%, 95% CI 2.93-7.36%), Tarassovi (3.95%, 95% CI 2.35-6.47%), Pyrogenes (2.47%, 95% CI 1.26-4.64%), Australis (0.99%, 95% CI 0.32-2.69%), and Grippotyphosa (0.25%, 95% CI 0.01-1.59%). The predictive model for Australis was not significant. Acceptable predictive models (AUC > 0.7-0.8) were found for Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pyrogenes, and Tarassovi, while for Sejroe, it was excellent (AUC > 0.85); consequently, the climatic variables that most contributed to the model were those related to precipitation. The potential distribution of Pyrogenes, Icterohaemorrhagiae, and Canicola was located to a greater extent in the three regions; Pyrogenes and Tarassovi were distributed mostly in the north and central regions, and Sejroe was mostly located in the center and south of the state. Ecological niche modelling could support epidemiological control and surveillance programs for affected sheep herds in the state of Veracruz.","['Gabriel-Véjar BL', 'Vázquez-Luna D', 'Martínez-Herrera DI', 'Villagómez-Cortés JA', 'Leyva-Ovalle OR', 'Torres-Barranca JI', 'Zarza Villanueva H']",2022,69,5,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Gabriel-Véjar BL, et al.

35358181,"Analysis of human clinical and environmental Leptospira to elucidate the eco-epidemiology of leptospirosis in Yaeyama, subtropical Japan.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a zoonosis caused by species in the spirochete genus Leptospira, is endemic to the Yaeyama region in Okinawa, subtropical Japan. Species of the P1 subclade ""virulent"" group, within the genus Leptospira, are the main etiological agents of leptospirosis in Okinawa. However, their environmental persistence is poorly understood. This study used a combination of bacterial isolation and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding methods to understand the eco-epidemiology of leptospirosis in this endemic region.
FINDINGS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) characterized twelve human clinical L. interrogans isolates belonging to the P1 subclade ""virulent"" subgroup and 11 environmental soil isolates of the P1subclade ""low virulent"" subgroup (genetically related to L. kmetyi, n = 1; L. alstonii, n = 4; L. barantonii, n = 6) from the Yaeyama region targeting four virulence-related genes (lipL32, ligA, ligB and lpxD1). Clinical isolates were PCR positive for at least three targeted genes, while all environmental isolates were positive only for lipL32. Analysis of infected renal epithelial cells with selected clinical and environmental strains, revealed the disassembly of cell-cell junctions for the Hebdomadis clinical strain serogroup. Comparison of leptospiral eDNA during winter and summer identified operational taxonomic units corresponding to the species isolated from soil samples (L. kmetyi and L. barantonii) and additional P2 subclade species (L. licerasiae, L. wolffii-related, among others) that were not detected by soil cultivation. Total Leptospira read counts were higher in summer than in winter and the analysis of leptospiral/animal eDNA relationship suggested Rattus spp. as a potential reservoir animal.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated high environmental Leptospira diversity in the Yaeyama region, particularly during summer, when most of the leptospirosis cases are reported. In addition, several Leptospira species with pathogenic potential were identified that have not yet been reported in Yaeyama; however, the environmental persistence of P1 subclade species previously isolated from human clinical cases in this region was absent, suggesting the need of further methodology development and surveillance.","['Sato Y', 'Hermawan I', 'Kakita T', 'Okano S', 'Imai H', 'Nagai H', 'Kimura R', 'Yamashiro T', 'Kajita T', 'Toma C']",2022,16,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Sato Y, et al.

Environmental conditions and equine raising or managing practices were recorded in all 72 visited establishments; epidemiological information was obtained from each worker. Microscopic agglutination technique (MAT) was performed with 10 Leptospira strains for equines and 18 for human sera, that were also studied with IgM indirect immunofluorescence (IgM-IIF). Equine titres ≥100 were considered positive, and human sera titres ≥200 suggested probable recent or past infection. Urines were cultured in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) media; local identification of one obtained isolate with lipL32 PCR, Multiple Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis and partial rrs gene sequencing, were completed at Institut Pasteur, Paris. Estimated reactivity was 61.3% for equines, which was higher than the studied bovine national levels (21%) and mainly observed with Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup (40.3%), Sejroe, Canicola, Pomona or Ballum. Aged animals from slaughterhouses and cattle farms were the most frequently positive. Multiple regression analysis confirmed a significant association between seropositivity and equine age. Only one positive culture could be fully studied, and confirmed to be Leptospira interrogans serogroup Canicola; it was added to the MAT antigen panel and revealed fairly frequent reaction with equine and human sera. Three workers (2%) showed titres = 200 with Icterohaemorrhagiae or Canicola serogroups, without recent clinical manifestations. Their attended equines reacted with the same serogroups, suggesting common source infections or infection transmitted by equines. Three other humans yielded titres = 100, and none of the 150 showed an IgM-IIF-positive result. Equines seem not to be an important origin of regional human leptospirosis, except perhaps during acute animal infection.

Few studies, however, have described the potential impact of these measures on other important infectious diseases.
METHODS: The incidence of 19 major infectious diseases in Zhejiang Province was collected from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System from January 2017 to October 2020. The entire epidemic control phase was divided into three stages. The government deployed the first level response from 24 January to 2 March (the most rigorous measures). When the outbreak of COVID-19 was under control, the response level changed to the second level from 3 to 23 March, and then the third level response was implemented after 24 March. We compared the epidemiological characteristics of 19 major infectious diseases during different periods of the COVID-19 epidemic and previous years.
RESULTS: A total of 1,814,881 cases of 19 infectious diseases were reported in Zhejiang from January 2017 to October 2020, resulting in an incidence rate of 8088.30 cases per 1,000,000 person-years. After the non-pharmaceutical intervention, the incidence of 19 infectious diseases dropped by 70.84%, from 9436.32 cases per 1,000,000 person-years to 2751.51 cases per 1,000,000 person-years, with the large decrease in the first response period of influenza. However, we observed that the daily incidence of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and leptospirosis increased slightly (from 1.11 cases per 1,000,000 person-years to 1.82 cases per 1,000,000 person-years for SFTS and 0.30 cases per 1,000,000 person-years to 1.24 cases per 1,000,000 person-years for leptospirosis). There was no significant difference in the distribution of epidemiological characteristic of most infectious diseases before and during the implementation of COVID-19 control measures.
CONCLUSION: Our study summarizes the epidemiological characteristics of 19 infectious diseases and indicates that the rigorous control measures for COVID-19 are also effective for majority of infectious diseases.","['Li H', 'Ling F', 'Zhang S', 'Liu Y', 'Wang C', 'Lin H', 'Sun J', 'Wu Y']",2022,22,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Li H, et al.

The disease is particularly important in tropical and subtropical countries. Infections in humans can be caused by exposure to infected animals or contaminated soil or water, which are suitable for Leptospira. To explore the cluster area, the Global Moran's I index was calculated for incidences per 100,000 population at the province level during 2012-2018, using the monthly and annual data. The high-risk and low-risk provinces were identified using the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). The risk factors for leptospirosis were evaluated using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with zero-inflation. We also added spatial and temporal correlation terms to take into account the spatial and temporal structures. The Global Moran's I index showed significant positive values. It did not demonstrate a random distribution throughout the period of study. The high-risk provinces were almost all in the lower north-east and south parts of Thailand. For yearly reported cases, the significant risk factors from the final best-fitted model were population density, elevation, and primary rice crop arable areas. Interestingly, our study showed that leptospirosis cases were associated with large areas of rice production but were less prevalent in areas of high rice productivity. For monthly reported cases, the model using temperature range was found to be a better fit than using percentage of flooded area. The significant risk factors from the model using temperature range were temporal correlation, average soil moisture, normalized difference vegetation index, and temperature range. Temperature range, which has strongly negative correlation to percentage of flooded area was a significant risk factor for monthly data. Flood exposure controls should be used to reduce the risk of leptospirosis infection. These results could be used to develop a leptospirosis warning system to support public health organizations in Thailand.","['Chadsuthi S', 'Chalvet-Monfray K', 'Geawduanglek S', 'Wongnak P', 'Cappelle J']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Chadsuthi S, et al.

The present study aims to characterize and compare strains/sequences belonging to the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae recovered from clinically ill and asymptomatic dogs. Based on secY gene sequences of L. interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae, we have studied genetic diversity of strains obtained from 13 dogs, including dogs with clinical signs of acute leptospirosis, asymptomatic dogs and animals with chronic kidney disease, all of them from the same geographical area, the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. No genetic variations on secY gene were observed between strains/groups. No significant associations were observed between clinical status and age, sex or vaccinal status. The same strain leads to different clinical outcomes on canine leptospirosis. The answer for this will rise from deep studies regarding whole genomic sequencing of the strains, as well as proteomics.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease mainly confined to tropical areas. In both cases, most of those affected are asymptomatic or have only mild respiratory disease. Those who turn critical develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multiple-organ failure occurs rapidly, with high fatality.
METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective observational study from 2020 involving COVID-19 and leptospirosis patients. The data were collected using a semi-structured proforma, and analysis was performed using Easy R (EZR) software.
RESULTS: There were five patients with COVIDC-19 and four patients with leptospirosis; with pulmonary involvement. All the patients were males. There was no significant difference in age, the onset of pulmonary involvement, time of initiation of steroids, duration of steroids, and outcome between the two groups. However, in the case of COVID-19, it took a longer period for clearing of infiltrates.
CONCLUSION: Though COVID-19 and leptospirosis are two different diseases, both of them show a similar life-saving response to steroids, the common factor in the pathogenesis being cytokine storm. Primary care physicians in tropical areas of the world should be aware of the similarities between these two diseases, especially the initial clinical presentation, the pathogenesis, and the response to steroids.","['Xavier V', 'Baby B', 'George JM', 'Ittyachen AM']",2022,11,1,J Family Med Prim Care,"Xavier V, et al.

35309218,Assessment of the Current Surveillance System for Human Leptospirosis in Ecuador by Decision Analytic Modeling.,"Leptospirosis is a globally disseminated zoonotic disease with no national surveillance systems. On the other hand, surveillance is crucial for improving population health, and surveillance systems produce data that motivates action. Unfortunately, like many other countries, Ecuador put in place a monitoring system that has never been tested. The goal of this study was to use scenario tree modeling to assess the sensitivity of Ecuador's current national surveillance system to human leptospirosis as the basis for an economic assessment of the system. We created a decision-tree model to analyze the current system's sensitivity. The inputs were described as probabilities distributions, and the model assessed the program's sensitivity as an output. The model also considers the geographical and weather variations across Ecuador's three continental regions: Andean, Amazonia, and the Coast. Several data sources were used to create the model, including leptospirosis records from Ecuador's Ministry of Public Health, national and international literature, and expert elicitation, all of which were incorporated in a Bayesian framework. We were able to determine the most critical parameters influencing each scenario's output (CSU) sensitivity through sensitivity analysis. The Coast region had the best sensitivity scenario, with a median of 0.85% (IC 95% 0.41-0.99), followed by the Amazonia with a median of 0.54% (CI 95% 0.18-0.99) and the Andes with a median of 0.29% (CI 95% 0.02-0.89). As per the sensitivity study, the most influential criteria on the system's sensitivity were ""Attendance or probability of going to a health center"" and ""probability of having symptoms,"" notably for the Coast and Amazonia Regions.","['Calero ML', 'Monti G']",2022,10,,Front Public Health,Calero ML and Monti G.

Each case was then followed longitudinally to determine the rate of recurrence of uveitis.
RESULTS: Twenty-three cases and 46 controls were recruited. Being close to a pig farm (OR 27.8, CI 1.31-592.06) and a recent history of flooding of the pasture (OR 15.43, CI 2.80-84.98) was associated with increased risk of uveitis. Being in the same owner's possession for a longer amount of time had a protective effect (OR 0.79, CI 0.68-0.93). Horses recovered uneventfully following treatment and showed no evidence of recurrence in 59.1% of the cases (n = 13). In five horses (22.7%), the initial episode of uveitis could not be controlled and required surgical therapy. Recurrence was observed in four horses (18.2%).
MAIN LIMITATIONS: Small sample size. Recall bias from owners for some of the data. Possibility of selection bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can use this information to identify horses with increased risk of uveitis and provide advice to the owners of these horses. The proportion of cases that experience recurrence appears low in the UK.","['Malalana F', 'Ireland JL', 'Pinchbeck GL', 'McGowan CM']",2023,55,1,Equine Vet J,"Malalana F, et al.

35298403,Clinical disease and treatment of Leptospira kirschneri sv Grippotyphosa in a Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae).,"CASE DESCRIPTION: A 12-year-old sexually intact male zoo-managed Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) was evaluated for a 3-day history of vomiting, hyporexia, and lethargy. Radiographs were supportive of gastrointestinal obstruction, and an exploratory laparotomy was performed.
CLINICAL FINDINGS: Diffuse tan foci were present on the liver parenchyma, and the tiger became icteric throughout the procedure. Hepatic histopathology and immunohistochemistry resulted in a diagnosis of leptospirosis. Serum microagglutination testing for Leptospira spp antibody titers were positive for L kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa, rising from 1:400 to 1:3,200 in 2 days.
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The tiger was treated with antimicrobials, ursodiol, and mirtazapine, and increased biosecurity measures were instituted. Free-ranging wildlife on grounds were trapped, euthanized, and submitted for necropsy to screen for disease vectors. The tiger's urine was intermittently opportunistically collected from the enclosure and remained PCR assay negative for Leptospira spp until being positive once again on day 595. Although the tiger was without clinical signs at that time, antimicrobial therapy and increased biosecurity protocols were instituted a second time until urinary Leptospira shedding was confirmed to have stopped. By 1,071 days after initial presentation, the tiger remained nonclinical, with no additional urinary shedding episodes.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While domestic and nondomestic free-ranging felids have been reported as subclinical Leptospira spp carriers, this report indicates the clinical importance of leptospirosis when a tiger presents with generalized gastrointestinal signs and icterus. Due to the zoonotic potential, biosecurity measures are necessary. This patient had a clinically successful outcome with antimicrobial therapy and supportive care.","['Webb JK', 'Keller KA', 'Sander SJ', 'Allender MC', 'Sheldon JD']",2022,260,11,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Webb JK, et al.

Certain features of Santa Catarina's coastal region influence these processes. Using negative binomial regression, we investigated trends in the incidence of leptospirosis in the six municipalities with the highest epidemic peaks between 2000 and 2015 and the climatic and environmental variables associated with the occurrence of the disease. Incidence was highest in 2008 and 2011, and peaks occurred in the same month or month after disasters. Incidence showed a strong seasonal trend, being higher in summer months. There was a decrease trend in incidence across the six municipalities (3.21% per year). The climatic and environmental factors that showed the strongest associations were number of rainy days, maximum temperature, presence of flash floods, and river flooding. The impact of these variables varied across the municipalities. Significant interactions were found, indicating that the effect of river flooding on incidence is not the same across all municipalities and differences in incidence between municipalities depend on the occurrence of river flooding.","['Silva AEP', 'Latorre MDRDO', 'Chiaravalloti Neto F', 'Conceição GMS']",2022,27,3,Cien Saude Colet,"Silva AEP, et al.

35292370,Dissemination of Leptospira into the intestinal tract resulting in fecal excretion in a hamster model of subcutaneous infection with Leptospirainterrogans.,"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira, is one of the most common zoonotic diseases in the world. It is transmitted to humans through the skin and mucous membranes by contact with water or soil contaminated with urine excreted from infected animals. In human infections, gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea have been frequently observed, but there have been no reports analyzing gastrointestinal lesions in leptospirosis, and the pathological mechanism of gastrointestinal symptoms in leptospirosis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the pathological changes and the distribution of leptospires in the intestinal wall, and the presence of leptospires in the intestinal contents and feces, of hamsters subcutaneously infected with Leptospira interrogans. Results showed that infected hamsters had macroscopic redness in the jejunum and ileum. Submucosal hemorrhage was observed histologically, and there was no infiltration of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils. There were no obvious changes in the colon, either macroscopically or histologically, and the feces were normal (solid stools). Leptospira was isolated from all the intestinal walls from the small intestine to the colon, the intestinal contents, and the feces. These findings suggest that the invasion of leptospires into the intestinal wall and the associated submucosal hemorrhage may be the cause of the gastrointestinal symptoms observed in leptospirosis. Furthermore, not only the urine of infected animals but also the feces could be a source of infection.","['Inamasu Y', 'Nikaido Y', 'Miyahara S', 'Maruoka T', 'Takigawa T', 'Ogawa M', 'Nakayama T', 'Harada M', 'Saito M']",2022,165,,Microb Pathog,"Inamasu Y, et al.

35272979,[Kidney injury in children and adolescents with leptospirosis in France].,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is an anthropozoonosis with polymorphic clinical symptoms and a high variability of severity, ranging from flu-like syndrome to severe acute kidney injury. This disease is highly incident in tropical regions but there is a trend towards increasing incidence in metropolitan France and in Reunion Island. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and therapeutic characteristics of the pediatric leptospirosis in metropolitan France and in Reunion Island.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of leptospirosis cases hospitalized in University hospitals where members of the Paediatric Nephrology Society work in France between January 2008 and December 2020, 6 centers reported leptospirosis cases, one center had one patient in consultation but lack of available data and 10 centers did not find any case.
RESULTS: A total of 21 cases were reported (mean age 13.4±3.4years), mostly boys (ratio 6:1). Out of 21 patients, 95% had fever, 71% were presenting with myalgia, 81% with thrombocytopenia, and 76% with gastrointestinal symptoms. Regarding kidney impairment, 18 patients (86%) had acute kidney injury, including 4 (19%) with oligoanuria, but none of them required acute dialysis. About 30% of patients had biological signs of tubulopathy including hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, or tubular proteinuria. No death due to the disease occurred. The therapeutic management followed the current guidelines with the use of antibiotic therapy by amoxicillin or 3rd generation cephalosporins with symptomatic treatment. When there was biological control after exit, creatinine decreased.
DISCUSSION: In this multicenter retrospective study, we report 21 children with leptospirosis with a significant proportion of acute kidney injury, the outcome was favorable. Children do not seem to be at high risk of chronic kidney disease progression but nephrology follow-up has not been systematically carried out. Compared to studies performed in adults, the prognosis was better and hepatic impairment was rare. Compared to other pediatric studies, conjunctivitis was not a common symptom but kidney injury and survival appeared to be similar. Children were presenting with anicteric renal presentation. The casebook wasn't exhaustive and didn't include the other overseas territories, which account for the highest proportion of leptospirosis infection.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is an infection which may lead to multivisceral failure with kidney involvement conditioning the outcome. Despite a better prognosis in children, it remains important to quickly diagnose this infection in order to start appropriate antibiotic therapy and perform a kidney function monitoring.","['De Thomasis S', 'Flodrops H', 'Llanas B', 'Martinez Casado É', 'Cloarec S', 'Pietrement C', 'Zaloszyc A']",2022,18,3,Nephrol Ther,"De Thomasis S, et al.

35248601,Current methods for the diagnosis of leptospirosis: Issues and challenges.,"Leptospirosis is a re-emerging anthropo-zoonotic infection of worldwide significance caused by the pathogenic spirochete (Leptospira interrogans) of the genus Leptospira, predominant in tropical/temperate regions and endemic to areas receiving heavy rainfall and flooding. Clinical presentation is similar to that of other febrile illnesses exhibiting mild symptoms which are often self-limiting. Hence, Leptospirosis is often mis-diagnosed and remains untreated progressing to Weil's Disease which is fatal. As only 30% of cases are diagnosed in endemic countries, Leptospirosis remains as a neglected zoonotic disease of tropical regions, due to poor diagnostic facilities and mild, asymptomatic disease manifestations which are often neglected. As this zoonosis is reported to cause periodical outbreaks, it is a major public health concern. Although diagnostic facilities are available, they are not accessible in technology-limited settings and are limited to certain hospitals and reference laboratories. This review is about the various methods used for the detection of Leptospirosis and their significance. It highlights the need for an appropriate diagnostic test for the rapid detection of leptospirosis in order to initiate immediate antibiotic therapy.","['Pinto GV', 'Senthilkumar K', 'Rai P', 'Kabekkodu SP', 'Karunasagar I', 'Kumar BK']",2022,195,,J Microbiol Methods,"Pinto GV, et al.

35229486,Serological survey of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in individuals with animal hoarding disorder and their dogs in a major city of Southern Brazil.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with hoarding disorder (HD) presented a persistent difficulty in detaching from objects and/or animals. Unhealthy conditions, frequently found in cases of animal HD (AHD), may favour environmental contamination and the spread of zoonotic pathogens. Despite that, only one study of zoonotic diseases in individuals with AHD and their companion animals has been conducted to date.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in individuals with AHD and their dogs in a major city of Southern Brazil.
METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 264 dogs (21 households) and 19 individuals with AHD (11 households) and tested by microscopic agglutination test.
RESULTS: All human samples were seronegative. Seropositivity was found in 16/264 (6.1%; CI 95% 3.3-9.6%) dogs from 11/21 (52.38%) households, with titres ranging from 100 up to 400, and Copenhageni (10/16; 62.5%) was the most frequent serovar. Surprisingly, seropositivity of hoarded dogs found herein was among the lowest reportedly observed in other dog populations of Brazil. Two epidemiological variables were significantly associated with seropositivity in dogs: the presence of cat hoarding (p = 0.004) and the report of flood occurrence in the household (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: No individuals with AHD were seropositive, and besides the lower seroprevalence of dogs, they probably had contact with Leptospira spp. at some point in their life. Since dogs can be considered potential sentinels in leptospirosis, public health programs must become aware of the risk of leptospirosis cases in households of individuals with AHD and nearby communities.","['Cunha GRD', 'Pellizzaro M', 'Martins CM', 'Rocha SM', 'Yamakawa AC', 'da Silva EC', 'Dos Santos AP', 'Morikawa VM', 'Langoni H', 'Biondo AW']",2022,8,2,Vet Med Sci,"Cunha GRD, et al.

Two hundred and sixty serum samples were tested for the Dengue NS1 antigen and the IgM antibodies of Dengue, Chikungunya, Scrub Typhus (ST), and Japanese Encephalitis (JE) during April 2019-March 2020. Fifteen Dengue, six JE, twelve Chikungunya, nine ST and three Leptospirosis, and mixed infections of three JE + Chikungunya, four Dengue + Chikungunya, three Dengue + JE + Chikungunya, one Dengue + Chikungunya + ST, and one Dengue + ST were found positive by IgM ELISA tests, and four for the Dengue NS1 antigen, all without any travel history. True prevalence values estimated for infections detected by Dengue IgM were 0.134 (95% CI: 0.08-0.2), Chikungunya were 0.084 (95% CI: 0.05-0.13), Scrub were 0.043 (95% CI: 0.01-0.09), and Japanese Encephalitis were 0.045 (95% CI: 0.02-0.09). Dengue and Chikungunya were associated significantly more with a younger age. There was a lack of a defined set of symptoms for any of the Dengue, Chikungunya, JE or ST infections, as indicated by the k-modes cluster analysis. Interestingly, most of these symptoms have an overlapping set with malaria; thereby, it becomes imperative that malaria and these non-malaria vector-borne disease diagnoses are made in a coordinated manner.

We developed EIA based serologic assays using recombinant proteins (rLigA, rLigB, rLipL32) and whole-cell extracts from eight Leptospira serovars as antigen and assessed the diagnostic performance of the new assay within each class, against MAT positive (MAT+) human sera panels from Portugal/PT (n = 143) and Angola/AO (n = 100). We found that a combination of recombinant proteins rLigA, rLigB and rLipL32 correctly identified antigen-specific IgG from patients with clinical and laboratory confirmed leptospirosis (MAT+) with 92% sensitivity and ~ 97% specificity (AUC 0.974) in serum from the provinces of Luanda (LDA) and Huambo (HBO) in Angola. A combination of whole cell extracts of L. interrogans sv Copenhageni (LiC), L. kirschneri Mozdok (LkM), L. borgpetersenii Arborea (LbA) and L. biflexa Patoc (LbP) accurately identified patients with clinical and laboratory confirmed leptospirosis (MAT+) with 100% sensitivity and ~ 98% specificity for all provinces of Angola and Portugal (AUC: 0.997 for AO/LDA/HBO, 1.000 for AO/HLA, 0.999 for PT/AZ and 1.000 for PT/LIS). Interestingly, we found that MAT+ IgG+ serum from Angola had a significantly higher presence of IgD and that IgG3/IgG1 isotypes were significantly increased in the MAT+ IgG+ serum from Portugal. Given that IgM/IgD class and IgG3/IgG1 specific isotypes are produced in the earliest course of infection, immunoglobulin G isotyping may be used to inform diagnosis of acute leptospirosis. The speed, ease of use and accuracy of EIA tests make them excellent alternatives to the laborious and expensive MAT for screening acute infection in areas where circulating serovars of pathogenic Leptospira are well defined.","['Fortes-Gabriel E', 'Guedes MS', 'Shetty A', 'Gomes CK', 'Carreira T', 'Vieira ML', 'Esteves L', 'Mota-Vieira L', 'Gomes-Solecki M']",2022,16,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Fortes-Gabriel E, et al.

35192629,A lethal model of Leptospira infection in hamster nasal mucosa.,"Leptospirosis is a fatal zoonosis caused by contact between skin or a mucosal surface and contaminated soil or water. Hamsters were infected by intraperitoneal injection fto establish experimental leptospirosis, which is not a natural route of infection. There are no reports of nasal mucosal infection in hamsters. In this study, infection of the nasal mucosa was performed to establish a model of natural infection. Both methods of infection can cause lethal models with similar symptoms in the later stages of infection, such as weight loss, blood concentration, increased neutrophils (GRAN), and decreased lymphocytes (LYM) in the blood, severe organ damage and liver function obstruction. The burden of Leptospira in the organs and blood was lower in the mucosal inoculation groups at 1 day after infection. However, mucosal infection induced a higher Leptospira burden in urine than intraperitoneal infection in the late stages of infection. After nasal mucosal infection, antibody levels were higher and lasted longer.

We aimed to investigate the oxidant/antioxidant balance and acute-phase response in naturally infected horses and cattle with Leptospira interrogans. A total of 600 serum samples from horses and cattle were examined for L. interrogans antibodies using the microscopic agglutination test to determine anti-Leptospira IgG antibodies against a panel of eight important Leptospira antigens in Iran. Then, serum total antioxidant capacity, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde activities, and nitric oxide, total protein, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, and albumin concentrations were measured in seropositive and seronegative samples. Serum catalase activities and malondialdehyde, serum amyloid A, and haptoglobin ‌concentrations in seropositive cattle and horses were significantly higher (P < .05) than in those that were seronegative.

35167605,The variable presence of Leptospira in the environment; an epidemiological explanation based on serial analysis of water samples.,"Human leptospirosis involves the classic epidemiological triad (agent, host and environment); hence the investigations should include the knowledge on Leptospira within the animals and the environment. The objectives of this study are to explore the abundance of Leptospira in different climate zones of Sri Lanka and to describe the presence of Leptospira in the same water source at serial time points. First, water and soil samples were collected from different parts of Sri Lanka (Component-1); second, water sampling continued only in the dry zone (Component-2). Finally, serial water sampling from ten open wells was performed at five different time points (Component-3). Quantitative PCR of water and metagenomic sequencing of soil were performed to detect Leptospira. Three replicates for each sample were used for PCR testing, and positive result of two or more replicates was defined as 'strongly positive,' and one positive replicate was defined as positive. In the water and soil sample analysis in the whole country (Component-1), two out of 12 water sites were positive, and both were situated in the wet zone. Very small quantities of the genus Leptospira were detected by 16 amplicon analysis of soil in all 11 sites. In the dry zone water sample analysis (Component-2), only samples from 6 out of 26 sites were positive, of which one site was strongly positive. In the serial sample analysis (Component-3), Six, five, four, five, and six wells were positive in serial measurements. All wells were positive for at least one time point, while only one well was positive for all five time points. Proximity to the tank and greater distances from the main road were associated with strong positive results for Leptospira (P<0.05). The presence of Leptospira was not consistent, indicating the variable abundance of Leptospira in the natural environment. This intermittent nature of positivity could be explained by the repetitive contamination by animal urine.","['Warnasekara J', 'Srimantha S', 'Senavirathna I', 'Kappagoda C', 'Farika N', 'Nawinna A', 'Agampodi S']",2022,17,2,PLoS One,"Warnasekara J, et al.

35163781,Motility of the Zoonotic Spirochete Leptospira: Insight into Association with Pathogenicity.,"If a bacterium has motility, it will use the ability to survive and thrive. For many pathogenic species, their motilities are a crucial virulence factor. The form of motility varies among the species. Some use flagella for swimming in liquid, and others use the cell-surface machinery to move over solid surfaces. Spirochetes are distinguished from other bacterial species by their helical or flat wave morphology and periplasmic flagella (PFs). It is believed that the rotation of PFs beneath the outer membrane causes transformation or rolling of the cell body, propelling the spirochetes. Interestingly, some spirochetal species exhibit motility both in liquid and over surfaces, but it is not fully unveiled how the spirochete pathogenicity involves such amphibious motility. This review focuses on the causative agent of zoonosis leptospirosis and discusses the significance of their motility in liquid and on surfaces, called crawling, as a virulence factor.",['Nakamura S'],2022,23,3,Int J Mol Sci,Nakamura S.

35151822,Macrophage migration inhibitory factor gene promoter polymorphism (-173G/C SNP) determines host susceptibility and severity of leptospirosis.,"The biological mechanisms that are associated with the severity of leptospirosis are far from complete. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene promoter polymorphisms determine susceptibility to and severity of human leptospirosis. MIF is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, which has been reported to correlate with the risk of inflammatory disease onset and severity. In the present study, MIF 173G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was analyzed by PCR-RFLP (Restriction fragment length polymorphism). A statistically significant increase of MIF -173*C allele related genotypes was observed in leptospirosis patients when compared with healthy control subjects. Genotypes GC (OR: 28.4; 95% CI: 10.9-73.6; p < 0.001) and CC (OR: 40; 95% CI: 2.3-686.5; p < 0.001) of -173 G/C MIF polymorphism was associated with susceptibility and severity of leptospirosis respectively. In leptospirosis cases, 69.8% of leptospirosis patients were GC genotype carriers while 19.8% and 10.4% cases were CC and GG carriers; in severe leptospirosis, 68% cases were CC carriers and 32% were GC carriers; and in healthy controls, 92.5% subjects were GG carriers and 7.5% were GC carriers. MIF -173*C allele was (OR: 15; 95% CI: 6.1-36.8; p < 0.001) significantly associated with the risk of leptospirosis than -173*G allele (OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.02-0.16; p < 0.001). The relationship of -173G/C MIF polymorphism with mRNA and serum level of MIF and inflammatory cytokine expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and MIF ELISA. MIF mRNA expression was significantly increased in carriers of MIF -173*C allele associated genotypes, GC and CC. A substantial increase of serum MIF (Mean ± SD) was found in risk genotypes GC (5.81 ± 0.61 ng/mL) and CC (10.12 ± 0.23 ng/mL) carrying leptospirosis patients than GG genotype (0.86 ± 0.3 ng/mL) carrying healthy controls. Pearson correlation test showed a significant positive correlation between elevated serum MIF and -173*C allele (r = 0.99, p < 0.001). High MIF expression genotypes GC and CC upregulated the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-4 whereas downregulated the IL-10 expression. Thus, MIF -173 G/C SNP genotype GC carriers have highly susceptible to leptospirosis and the leptospirosis patients with CC genotype had an increased risk of developing a severe form of the disease. The observations of this study conclude that MIF -173G/C polymorphism is associated with leptospirosis susceptibility and severity and also could be a promising severity predictor of leptospirosis.","['Sumaiya K', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2022,164,,Microb Pathog,Sumaiya K and Natarajaseenivasan K.

Considering the scarcity of studies regarding this condition, the objective of the present study was to identify and analyse leptospires infecting the reproductive tract of female pigs slaughtered in the Amazon region. Cervical-vaginal mucus (CVM) from 150 non-pregnant females were collected and submitted to molecular analysis. Initially, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the lipL32 gene was performed. A total of 26.7% (40/150) samples were positive, indicating the presence of Leptospira sp. DNA. Subsequently, positive lipL32-PCR samples were evaluated using secY nested-PCR and sequencing procedures. Eleven amplicons could be sequenced and were identified as Leptospira interrogans (100% identity). Results from phylogenetic analyses led to identification of a putative strain of L. interrogans serogroup Australis, which is indicative of this being a serogroup. In the present study, there was detection of female pigs with leptospires in CVM indicating the possibility of venereal transmission. The large number of genital positive cases could indicate that genital leptospirosis syndrome could also be relevant onto swine production.","['Gomes YA', 'Medeiros LS', 'Di Azevedo MIN', 'Loureiro AP', 'Loria de Melo JDS', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2022,238,,Anim Reprod Sci,"Gomes YA, et al.

35140240,The role of small ruminants in the epidemiology of leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a common global zoonotic disease of man and all farm animals. Although most leptospiral infections in sheep and goats are asymptomatic, they may play a role in the epidemiology of the disease by the spread of Leptospira through the urine. This study was carried out to evaluate the role of sheep and goats in the epidemiology of leptospirosis. Blood and urine samples were taken from 210 goats and 246 sheep. To detect antibodies, sera samples were tested with 8 live serovars of L. interrogans (Hardjo, Pomona, Grippotyphosa, Canicola, Ballum, Icterhemorrhagiae, Tarasovi, and Australis) by MAT. Then, urine samples were tested by Nested PCR targeting 16S rRNA gene for detection of pathogenic Leptospira. Results of MAT showed that 10.95% of goats and 8.53% of sheep had antibodies against at least one examined serovars. In both species, the highest reacting was L. i. Pomona with a rate of 68.18% and 56% in sheep and goats, respectively. Moreover, in PCR, 2 (0.95%) urine samples of goat and 12 (4.87%) urine samples of sheep were positive. All of the MAT positive studied animals were PCR negative and, statistical analysis showed that there was no relationship and agreement between the results of PCR and MAT in sheep (kappa = - 0.07, p > 0.05) and goats (kappa = - 0.02, p > 0.05). Finally, it is concluded that sheep and goats can excrete L. interrogans in the urine and thus transmit them to other animals and humans.","['Haji Hajikolaei MR', 'Rezaei S', 'Ghadrdan Mashhadi AR', 'Ghorbanpoor M']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Haji Hajikolaei MR, et al.

In 2017, Boyolali District was reported that the number of leptospirosis cases reached 40.62 per 100,000 population with a CFR of 23.52%. The determination of risk factors and Leptospira bacteria's presence in the body of water plays an essential role in the transmission of leptospirosis.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This study aims to determine the risk factors and Leptospira bacteria's presence in water bodies in Boyolali District. This research is descriptive research with a survey method using a cross-sectional design and an analytical study using an observational method with a case-control approach. The sample was 100 water samples from wells, rivers, and paddy fields in endemic and non-endemic areas of leptospirosis. This study's population was 34 people with leptospirosis in Boyolali Regency in January 2017 - August 2018.
RESULTS: There was a significant relationship between leptospirosis incidence in the Boyolali Regency with garbage, the pet presence, a history of injuries, and field activity. Leptospira bacteria are found in rivers (18.18%) and rice fields (6.67%), while in sub-districts with cases occur almost every year. Leptospira are found in wells (18.18%) and rice fields (6.67%).

35124897,Detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in herpetofauna in Central Appalachia.,"Leptospirosis is a water borne zoonotic disease of global significance that is caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira. Pathogenic leptospires live in the kidneys of reservoir or infected animals and are shed in their urine contaminating water, soil, etc. Rodents are considered the primary reservoir of leptospirosis, but little is known about the role of herpetofauna (non-avian reptiles and amphibians) in the epidemiology of the disease. To address this, various species of amphibians and reptiles in the Cumberland Gap Region of the Central Appalachia were screened for the presence of Leptospira spp. Kidneys harvested from of a total of 116 amphibians and reptiles belonging to seven species of snakes, seven species of salamanders, seven species of frogs/toads, seven species of turtles and one species of lizards were tested using a highly specific TaqMan based qPCR that targets lipl32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira spp. Overall, 15 of the tested 116 amphibians and reptiles were positive (12.9%; 95% CI: 7.4%-20.4%). Of the 101 amphibians, 11 were positive (10.9%; 95% CI: 5.6%-18.7%), and 4 of the 15 reptiles tested positive (26.7%; 95% CI: 7.8%-55.1%). The amplified gene fragments of lipl32 from qPCR positive kidneys were sequenced and found to be identical with known pathogenic Leptospira spp. These results suggest that although the proportion of reptiles and amphibians transmitting pathogenic Leptospira spp. within the environment may be low as compared to rodents, they pose a risk to other susceptible hosts that share their habitats and may have role in maintaining a baseline infection in the environment.","['Verma A', 'Brandt L', 'Runser S', 'Gruszynski K', 'Gallatin K', 'Morgan J', 'Barnhart H', 'Duke C', 'Brovarney S', 'Geer A', 'Willems E', 'Strobel R', 'Bryant C', 'Pawlowski E', 'Thaker A']",2022,69,4,Zoonoses Public Health,"Verma A, et al.

Due to the similarity with clinical signs of other febrile diseases, early diagnosis remains challenging. Real-time PCR has been used for direct detection of Leptospira, but it requires thermocyclers and highly trained personnel. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a simple and rapid DNA-based assay. Therefore, here we have developed PCR and LAMP assays targeting two novel genes, lic13162 and lic20239, and also lipL32 gene to detect pathogenic Leptospira. Analytical and diagnostic performances were compared with bacterial isolates (including different Leptospira species and serovars) and clinical samples. The results demonstrated that PCR assays targeting lic13162 and lic20239 were successful to amplify Leptospira, but LAMP not. However, both PCR and LAMP targeting lipL32 could detect pathogenic Leptospira. LAMP lipL32 could be performed in 30 min with a detection limit of 156 cells/mL. Diagnostic performance of lipL32-LAMP presented 84.2% sensitivity and 93.2% specificity.

During the spring months from 2017 to 2019, 1,357 specimens of Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected at 9 localities in the vicinity of Novi Sad (Serbia). The number of collected ticks varied considerably among the different sampling sites and years. Also, a statistically significant difference was found between months and observed number of ticks for each stadium. By statistical analysis of tick activity depending on microclimatic conditions, a positive and statistically significant relationship between temperature and the number of ticks for each life stage was established, but not for humidity. Dew had a statistically significant impact only on nymphs but not on adults. The infection rate of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. was the highest in March (46.5-51.2%) and the lowest in May (32.9-34.8%). The highest prevalence was detected in males and the lowest in nymphs. Since there is a positive and statistically significant correlation between tick number and prevalence, the ability to provide weather-based predictions of the seasonal patterns of current tick activity is important for the risk assessment of TBDs such as Lyme borreliosis.","['Ivanović I', 'Stošić MŽ', 'Sabljić ER', 'Kišek TC', 'Špik VC', 'Popović A', 'Savić S']",2022,,,Acta Vet Hung,"Ivanović I, et al.

35110854,Analysis of Causes of Hepatic Dysfunction in Obstetric Patients in India: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiology of liver disease in obstetric patients shows geographical variation depending upon the prevalence of preeclampsia, viral hepatitis, and tropical vector-borne diseases like malaria, leptospirosis, etc. We undertook the current systematic review to analyze the causes of hepatic dysfunction in obstetric patients in India and identify the gaps in the literature and reporting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did a systematic review of studies reporting the causes of hepatic dysfunction in obstetric patients in India. A methodological quality assessment was done using a five-point questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 21 studies qualified for evaluation. The rate of hepatic dysfunction among obstetric patients in India ranged from 0.15 to 3.3% with a mean and median rate of 1.49 and 0.93%, respectively. Preeclampsia/HELLP (mean = 36.0%, median = 31.4%, range: 3.6-83.8%) and viral hepatitis (mean = 34.1%, median = 35.5%, range: 5.1-61.8%) were the commonest causes of hepatic dysfunction. Other causes were intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, tropical fever (malaria, leptospirosis, dengue, scrub typhus), etc. Maternal mortality ranged from 1.4 to 40% (mean = 12.6%, median = 10.0%) and perinatal mortality was between 16.4 and 38.70% (mean = 31.75%, median = 35.5%).
CONCLUSION: There is moderate quality evidence to show that preeclampsia/HELLP and viral hepatitis are the commonest causes of hepatic dysfunction in obstetric patients in India.

35076093,Emerging leptospirosis in urban Sydney dogs: a case series (2017-2020).,"Canine leptospirosis has not been reported in the Sydney dog population since 1976. However, between 2017 and 2020, leptospirosis was confirmed in 17 dogs, five of which were known to hunt rodents. Dogs infected between 2017 and 2019 lived within a 3 km radius in the Inner City of Sydney (n = 11). In 2020, cases emerged across a broader area of Sydney; Inner City (n = 1), Inner West (n = 3), Lower North Shore (n = 1) and Upper North Shore (n = 1). The disease was characterised by severe hepatorenal involvement resulting in an unusually high case fatality rate (88%). In conjunction with supportive clinical signs, diagnosis was confirmed by real-time PCR on whole blood (n = 1), kidney (n = 1), urine (n = 4), whole blood and urine (n = 9) or by seroconversion (n = 3). Antibody titres determined by Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) to Leptospira serovars were measured in 12 dogs: seven were positive for serovar Copenhageni, one was positive for serovar Hardjo, three were negative for all serovars, likely due to insufficient time for seroconversion before death and one had a low positive titre (1/50) for serovars Australis and Robinsoni. This sudden emergence of a highly fatal disease in pet dogs in Sydney has led to the introduction of Leptospira vaccination protocols for dogs living in inner Sydney using a monovalent vaccine containing serovar Copenhageni. The success of this vaccination program will require ongoing research to understand the emergence of leptospirosis in this region and the serovars involved.","['Griebsch C', 'Kirkwood N', 'Ward MP', 'So W', 'Weerakoon L', 'Donahoe S', 'Norris JM']",2022,100,5,Aust Vet J,"Griebsch C, et al.

We sought to determine if rodents in U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) are carriers of Leptospira. In total, 140 rodents were sampled, including 112 Mus musculus and 28 Rattus rattus. A positive carrier status was identified for 64/140 (45.7%); 49 (35.0%) were positive by dark-field microscopy, 60 (42.9%) by culture, 63 (45.0%) by fluorescent antibody testing, and 61 (43.6%) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR). Molecular typing indicated that 48 isolates were L. borgpetersenii and 3 were L. kirschneri; the remaining nine comprised mixed species. In the single culture-negative sample that was rtPCR positive, genotyping directly from the kidney identified L. interrogans. Serotyping of L. borgpetersenii isolates identified serogroup Ballum and L. kirschneri isolates as serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae. These results demonstrate that rodents are significant Leptospira carriers and adds to understanding the ecoepidemiology of leptospirosis in USVI.","['Hamond C', 'Browne AS', 'de Wilde LH', 'Hornsby RL', 'LeCount K', 'Anderson T', 'Stuber T', 'Cranford HM', 'Browne SK', 'Blanchard G', 'Horner D', 'Taylor ML', 'Evans M', 'Angeli NF', 'Roth J', 'Bisgard KM', 'Salzer JS', 'Schafer IJ', 'Ellis BR', 'Alt DP', 'Schlater L', 'Nally JE', 'Ellis EM']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Hamond C, et al.

35008046,"Clinical Evaluation of the Modified Faine Criteria in Patients Admitted with Suspected Leptospirosis to the Territorial Hospital, New Caledonia, 2018 to 2019.","Leptospirosis is endemic in New Caledonia. Clinical diagnosis is often difficult and its evolution can be fatal. Leptospirosis requires specific management before biological confirmation. Modified Faine criteria (Faine Score) have been suggested to diagnose leptospirosis on epidemiological (parts A and B) and biological (part C) criteria. The main objective of our study was to assess the relevance of the epidemiological-clinical modified Faine score, parts A and B (MF A + B), in patients with suspected leptospirosis in New Caledonia. A monocentric case-control study was conducted in suspect patients for whom a Leptospira polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was done within the first 7 days of signs onset at the tertiary hospital from January 2018 to January 2019. Cases and control subjects were matched 1:2 in the gender and age categories. Bivariate, and then multivariable, analyses studied the association between the MF A + B score and a positive Leptospira PCR test, adjusted on the variables retained. In all, 35 cases and 70 control subjects matched for age and gender were analyzed. Multivariable analysis by logistic regression found a significant association between an MF A + B score taken from the categories ""possible leptospirosis"" (score, 20-25) and ""presumed leptospirosis"" (score, > 26), and the case or control subject status (P < 0.0001). Model performance was high, with an area under the curve value of 99.27%, 93.55% sensitivity, and 96.36% specificity, which classified subjects correctly in 95.35% of cases. Our study suggests using the MF A + B score to identify possible cases of leptospirosis and initiate antibiotic therapy before biological confirmation in New Caledonia. This score should be evaluated in areas where more differential diagnoses exist and where PCR is not widely available.","['Guibreteau H', 'Tarantola A', 'Goarant C', 'Gervolino S', 'Gourinat AC', 'Colot J', 'Cazorla C', 'Klement-Frutos E']",2022,106,2,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Guibreteau H, et al.

We aimed to investigate the involvement of pathogenic leptospira in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of meningitis-suspected children in Sudan.
METHODS: A total of 153 CSF specimens were collected over 5 months from patients attending a reference pediatric hospital in Omdurman, Sudan. All patients had provisionally been diagnosed with meningitis on admission. Demographic, clinical, and conventional laboratory findings were obtained. DNA was extracted using a QIAamp mini kit, and the 
RESULTS: Nine of 153 (6%) CSF specimens were positive for pathogenic leptospiral DNA. All these patients were male (seven infants and two toddlers aged ˂4 years). Typical conventional laboratory findings for aseptic meningitis (ie, CSF turbidity/pleocytosis, normal or reduced CSF glucose, normal or elevated proteins) were seen in five (56%). All patients presented with fever and seizures, 56% vomiting and stiff neck, and 29% bulging fontanel. Most (67%) patients presented in summer (March to May). Polymicrobial infections were identified in three patients (33%).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that pathogenic leptospira are probably a common cause of meningitis in children in Sudan; therefore, we recommend including leptospirosis in the differential diagnosis of CNS infections and other undifferentiated febrile illnesses in this country.","['Abdelrahim NA', 'Fadl-Elmula IM', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Ahmed A', 'Goris M']",2021,12,,Res Rep Trop Med,"Abdelrahim NA, et al.

This research generated the Janus using a hybrid of zinc oxide (ZnO) and gold (Au) on the sensor surface toward making high-performance DNA sensors. The Janus ZnO/Au-textured film was synthesized via the one-step sol-gel method, which involves a suitable ratio of a mixture of ZnO sol seed solution. The synthesized Janus ZnO/Au-textured film undergoes a low-temperature aqueous hydrothermal route to synthesize quasi-one-dimensional nanowires. The average grain size in the Janus ZnO/Au nanotextured wire was 41.60 nm. The fabricated nanotextured wire was further optimized by tuning the thickness and characterized by XRD and high-resolution microscopy. Electrical characterization was conducted on the Janus ZnO/Au nanotextured wire coupled with an interdigitated electrode sensor to detect the specific leptospirosis DNA strand.

34996765,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence and mortality of zoonotic diseases in China.,"BACKGROUND: It has been reported that strict non-pharmaceutical measures can significantly reduce the incidence and mortality of respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are limited reports on the impact in terms of the rates of zoonotic diseases.
METHODS: We extracted the incidence and mortality data of eight notifiable infectious zoonotic diseases from the website of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for the period of January 2015 to April 2021.
RESULTS: First, the overall incidence of zoonotic diseases decreased from 0.3714 per 100 000 in 2015-2019 to 0.2756 in 2020 (25.79% reduction, p<0.001); however, a dramatic increase in activity was seen in 2021 compared with 2020 (0.4478 per 100 000 in 2021, 62.47% increase, p<0.001). Anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis and hydatid disease exhibited significant upward trends in 2021. Second, analysed further by stages, the monthly incidence in the routine stage (from May to December 2020) was much higher than that in the emergency stage of the COVID-19 (from January to April 2020) (55.33% increase, p<0.001). We also found that the monthly observed incidence was significantly lower than the predicted incidence of a 10.29% reduction in the emergency stage. Third, no differences were seen in mortality between 2021 and 2020, while a significant decline was found in 2020 compared with the previous 5 years (72.70%, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Strict containment and feasible suppression strategies during the 2020 period of the COVID-19 pandemic had positive impacts on the overall incidence of zoonotic diseases in China. However, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis and hydatid diseases might increase with the relaxation of non-pharmacological interventions in 2021.","['Ma C', 'Guo X', 'Wang L', 'Li W', 'Liu S', 'Lin F', 'Xu W']",2022,7,1,BMJ Glob Health,"Ma C, et al.

34990457,Rapid and sensitive point-of-care detection of Leptospira by RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a targeting lipL32.,"BACKGROUND: One of the key barriers preventing rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis is the lack of available sensitive point-of-care testing. This study aimed to develop and validate a clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 12a (CRISPR/Cas12a) platform combined with isothermal amplification to detect leptospires from extracted patient DNA samples.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)-CRISPR/Cas12a-fluorescence assay was designed to detect the lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira spp. The assays demonstrated a limit of detection (LOD) of 100 cells/mL, with no cross-reactivity against several other acute febrile illnesses. The clinical performance of the assay was validated with DNA extracted from 110 clinical specimens and then compared to results from qPCR detection of Leptospira spp. The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay showed 85.2% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 92.7% accuracy. The sensitivity increased on days 4-6 after the fever onset and decreased after day 7. The specificity was consistent for several days after the onset of fever. The overall performance of the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a platform was better than the commercial rapid diagnostic test (RDT). We also developed a lateral flow detection assay (LFDA) combined with RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a to make the test more accessible and easier to interpret. The combined LFDA showed a similar LOD of 100 cells/mL and could correctly distinguish between known positive and negative clinical samples in a pilot study.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 targeting the lipL32 gene demonstrated acceptable sensitivity and excellent specificity for detection of leptospires. This assay might be an appropriate test for acute leptospirosis screening in limited-resource settings.","['Jirawannaporn S', 'Limothai U', 'Tachaboon S', 'Dinhuzen J', 'Kiatamornrak P', 'Chaisuriyong W', 'Bhumitrakul J', 'Mayuramart O', 'Payungporn S', 'Srisawat N']",2022,16,1,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Jirawannaporn S, et al.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study of clinically suspected leptospirosis patients whose sample and information were sent to the Okinawa Prefectural Institute of Health and Environment from November 2003 to December 2020. Laboratory diagnosis was established using culture, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and/or microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and/or urine samples. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the epidemiological information, clinical features, and sensitivities of diagnostic methods among laboratory-confirmed cases. Serogroups and the species of Leptospira isolates were determined by MAT using 13 antisera and flaB sequencing. A total of 531 clinically suspected patients were recruited, among whom 246 (46.3%) were laboratory confirmed to have leptospirosis. Among the confirmed cases, patients aged 20-29 years (22.4%) and male patients (85.7%) were the most common. The most common estimated sources of infection were recreation (44.5%) and labor (27.8%) in rivers. Approximately half of the isolates were of the L. interrogans serogroup Hebdomadis. The main clinical symptoms were fever (97.1%), myalgia (56.3%), and conjunctival hyperemia (52.2%). Headache occurred significantly more often in patients with Hebdomadis serogroup infections than those with other serogroup infections. The sensitivities of culture and PCR exceeded 65% during the first 6 days, while the sensitivity of MAT surpassed that of culture and PCR in the second week after onset. PCR using blood samples was a preferable method for the early diagnosis of leptospirosis.

34898610,Investigating the role of the carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) in Leptospira spp.,"Carbon Storage Regulator A (CsrA) is a well-characterized post-transcriptional global regulator that plays a critical role in response to environmental changes in many bacteria. CsrA has been reported to regulate several metabolic pathways, motility, biofilm formation, and virulence-associated genes. The role of csrA in Leptospira spp., which are able to survive in different environmental niches and infect a wide variety of reservoir hosts, has not been characterized. To investigate the role of csrA as a gene regulator in Leptospira, we generated a L. biflexa csrA deletion mutant (ΔcsrA) and csrA overexpressing Leptospira strains. The ΔcsrA L. biflexa displayed poor growth under starvation conditions. RNA sequencing revealed that in rich medium only a few genes, including the gene encoding the flagellar filament protein FlaB3, were differentially expressed in the ΔcsrA mutant. In contrast, 575 transcripts were differentially expressed when csrA was overexpressed in L. biflexa. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed the RNA-seq data in the ΔcsrA mutant, showing direct binding of recombinant CsrA to flaB3 mRNA. In the pathogen L. interrogans, we were not able to generate a csrA mutant. We therefore decided to overexpress csrA in L. interrogans. In contrast to the overexpressing strain of L. biflexa, the overexpressing L. interrogans strain had poor motility on soft agar. The overexpressing strain of L. interrogans also showed significant upregulation of the flagellin flaB1, flaB2, and flaB4. The interaction of L. interrogans rCsrA and flaB4 was confirmed by EMSA. Our results demonstrated that CsrA may function as a global regulator in Leptospira spp. under certain conditions that cause csrA overexpression. Interestingly, the mechanisms of action and gene targets of CsrA may be different between non-pathogenic and pathogenic Leptospira strains.","['Phoka T', 'Fule L', 'Da Fonseca JP', 'Cokelaer T', 'Picardeau M', 'Patarakul K']",2021,16,12,PLoS One,"Phoka T, et al.

The present study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Leptospira spp. in small ruminants under traditional husbandry systems. A cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out in a sample of 1039 animals which included 793 sheep and 245 goats from 49 farms of 10 municipalities of northeastern areas of Colombia. The MAT test using a panel of 13 laboratory serovars was performed to diagnose the Leptospira spp. antibodies in the serum samples of animals. A structured questionnaire was filled in each farm to obtain information on putative risk factors, and its association with Leptospira spp. infection was detected by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The general seroprevalence showed a rate of 13.9%, the 79.6% of farms showed at least one positive animal, the 14.2% and 0.4% of positive animals showed titers ≥ 1:100 and 1:200, respectively. The seroprevalence in sheep and goats showed a rate of 13.1% and 16.2%, respectively. The most common serovars in positive animals were Autumnalis (3.6%), Tarassovi (3.4%), Bratislava (2.9%), Mini (2.9%), Bataviae (1.4%), Canicola (0.3%), and Grippotyphosa (0.3%). The univariate and multivariate analysis showed as risk factors the absence of housing system (OR = 3.412 CI: 1.347-8.152), the absence of quarantine measures to new animals (OR = 1.371 CI: 0.943-1.978), and the protective factor identified was the use of Toggenburg breed (OR = 0.571 CI: 0.249-1.074).

34890112,Ocular abnormalities in the Icelandic horse with a focus on equine recurrent uveitis: 112 Icelandic horses living in Denmark and 26 Icelandic horses living in the United States.,"PURPOSE: To describe the most common ocular abnormalities in the Icelandic horse with focus on equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) and association between ocular abnormalities and summer eczema and coat colors.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study. A complete physical and ophthalmic examination as well as measurement of serum titers for Leptospira serovariants was performed on Icelandic horses from Denmark (DK) and the United States (USA).
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve Icelandic horses living in DK and 26 Icelandic horses living in the United States were included in this study (total of 138 horses, 274 eyes). The three most common ocular abnormalities were follicular conjunctivitis (55.8%, 153/274 eyes), cataracts (27.4%, 75/274 eyes), and multifocal chorioretinopathy (""bullet holes""; 19%, 52/274 eyes). The prevalence for ERU among Icelandic horses aged ""eight years and older"" was 8% (6/75 horses). The ""insidious ERU"" type was found in 83% of the ERU cohort (5/6 horses), while ""classic ERU"" was found in 17% (1/6 horses). A correlation between ERU and cataracts was found in the population (p < .01). Leptospiral serology results were not associated with ERU in either DK or US-Icelandic horses (p = 1.00, p = 1.00, respectively). ERU was not associated with summer eczema (p = .49), and no coat colors were associated with the ocular abnormalities found in the Icelandic horse (all p-values > .05).
CONCLUSION: Follicular conjunctivitis, cataracts, and multifocal chorioretinopathy were the three most common ocular abnormalities findings.

While species and strain specificity can play a major role in disease presentation, the hamster is susceptible to most leptospiral infections and is the model of choice for vaccine efficacy testing. During evaluation of blood smears from hamsters challenged with different species and strains of Leptospira, a circulating population of large, mononuclear, lipid-filled cells, most similar to foamy macrophages (FMs), was detected. Circulating FMs were identified by Giemsa staining and verified by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. FMs were found in the circulating blood of all Leptospira-challenged hamsters, indicating that the finding was not species or strain specific, although higher numbers of FMs tended to correlate with severity of disease. The unique finding of circulating FMs in the hamster model of leptospirosis can yield additional insights into the pathogenesis of leptospirosis and other diseases that induce circulating FMs.","['Putz EJ', 'Andreasen CB', 'Stasko JA', 'Fernandes LGV', 'Palmer MV', 'Rauh MJ', 'Nally JE']",2021,189,,J Comp Pathol,"Putz EJ, et al.

34879100,Clinical spectrum of endemic leptospirosis in relation to cytokine response.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical spectrum and the cytokine response of leptospirosis patients in an endemic setting of Sri Lanka.
METHODS: Patients presenting to the university teaching hospital, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka with a leptospirosis-compatible illness were recruited over a period of 12 months starting from June 2012. Daily clinical and biochemical parameters of the patients were prospectively assessed with a follow-up of 14 days after discharge. A magnetic bead-based multiplex cytokine kit was used to detect 17 cytokines.
RESULTS: Of the 142 clinically suspected leptospirosis patients recruited, 47 were confirmed and, 29 cases were labeled as ""probable."" Thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis were observed at least once during the hospital stay among 76(54%) and 39(28%) patients, respectively. Acute kidney injury was observed in 31 patients (22%) and it was significantly higher among confirmed and probable cases. Hu TNF-α and IL-1β were detected only in patients without complications. Hu MIP-1b levels were significantly higher among patients with complications. During the convalescence period, all tested serum cytokine levels were lower compared to the acute sample, except for IL-8. The cytokine response during the acute phase clustered in four different groups. High serum creatinine was associated GM-CSF, high IL-5 and IL-6 level were correlates with lung involvement and saturation drop. The patients with high billirubin (direct)>7 mmol/l had high IL-13 levels.

This system has been widely recognized as a high throughput, ethical, and cost-effective invertebrate infection model to study the virulence and pathogenesis of various bacterial pathogens. In this study, we compared the effect of Leptospira infection in G. mellonella larvae infected with Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni (pathogenic) or Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc (saprophytic) strains. We observed significant pathologic changes such as decreased activity, complete melanization, and lower survival rate in the G. mellonella larvae infected with a pathogenic strain L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni compared to those infected with a nonpathogenic strain L. biflexa serovar Patoc. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and the potential of using G. mellonella larvae as an alternative model to study virulence mechanisms and pathogenesis of Leptospira strains.

We found that 40.1% (151/377) of asymptomatic adults had been exposed to Leptospira spp. Almost 36.3% of positive subjects reported contact with rats (137/377) which represent 90.7% among positive leptospira serology compared with 48.2% of negative subjects (182/377) which represent 80.5% among negative leptospira serology (OR 2.37, CI 1.25-4.49) and 1.7 fold on prevalence ratio and 2.37 of odd ratio. Furthermore, being a crop farmer was significantly associated with leptospirosis (OR 2.06, CI 1.29-3.28). We identified 6 asymptomatic subjects (1.6%) who met criteria for acute infection.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high prevalence of leptospiral antibodies infection among asymptomatic adults in rural Rwanda, particularly relative to neighboring countries. Although positive subjects were more likely to report rat contact, we found no independent association between rats and leptospirosis infection. Nonetheless, exposure was high among crop farmers, which is supportive of the hypothesis that rats together with domestic livestock might contribute to the transmission. Further studies are needed to understand infecting Leptospira servers and elucidate the transmission epidemiology in Rwanda and identify means of host transmitters.","['Ntabanganyimana E', 'Giraneza R', 'Dusabejambo V', 'Bizimana A', 'Hamond C', 'Iyamuremye A', 'Nshizirungu P', 'Uzabakiriho R', 'Munyengabe M', 'Wunder EA', 'Page C']",2021,15,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Ntabanganyimana E, et al.

34872058,"Climatic Variability and Human Leptospirosis Cases in Cartagena, Colombia: A 10-Year Ecological Study.","Leptospirosis is an acute febrile disease that mainly affects developing countries with tropical climates. The complexity and magnitude of this disease is attributed to socioeconomic, climatic, and environmental conditions. In this study, in a 10-year period from 2008 to 2017, the relationship between human leptospirosis cases and climatic factors in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia were evaluated. Monthly leptospirosis cases, climatic variables, and macroclimatic phenomena (El Niño and La Niña) were obtained from public datasets. Local climatic factors included temperature (maximum, average, and minimum), relative humidity, precipitation, and the number of precipitation days. Time series graphs were drawn and correlations between cases of leptospirosis and climatic variables considering lags from 0 to 10 months were examined. A total of 360 cases of leptospirosis were reported in Cartagena during the study period, of which 192 (53.3%) were systematically notified between October and December. Several correlations were detected between the number of cases, local climatic variables, and macroclimatic phenomena. Mainly, the increase of cases correlated with increased precipitation and humidity during the La Niña periods. Herein, seasonal patterns and correlations suggest that the climate in Cartagena could favor the incidence of leptospirosis. Our findings suggest that prevention and control of human leptospirosis in Cartagena should be promoted and strengthened, especially in the last quarter of the year.","['Cano-Pérez E', 'Loyola S', 'Espitia-Almeida F', 'Torres-Pacheco J', 'Malambo-García D', 'Gómez-Camargo D']",2021,106,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Cano-Pérez E, et al.

34855911,The oxidative stress response of pathogenic Leptospira is controlled by two peroxide stress regulators which putatively cooperate in controlling virulence.,"Pathogenic Leptospira are the causative agents of leptospirosis, the most widespread zoonotic infectious disease. Leptospirosis is a potentially severe and life-threatening emerging disease with highest burden in sub-tropical areas and impoverished populations. Mechanisms allowing pathogenic Leptospira to survive inside a host and induce acute leptospirosis are not fully understood. The ability to resist deadly oxidants produced by the host during infection is pivotal for Leptospira virulence. We have previously shown that genes encoding defenses against oxidants in L. interrogans are repressed by PerRA (encoded by LIMLP_10155), a peroxide stress regulator of the Fur family. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of another putative PerR-like regulator (LIMLP_05620) in L. interrogans. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that LIMLP_05620 displayed all the canonical PerR amino acid residues and is restricted to pathogenic Leptospira clades. We therefore named this PerR-like regulator PerRB. In L. interrogans, the PerRB regulon is distinct from that of PerRA. While a perRA mutant had a greater tolerance to peroxide, inactivating perRB led to a higher tolerance to superoxide, suggesting that these two regulators have a distinct function in the adaptation of L. interrogans to oxidative stress. The concomitant inactivation of perRA and perRB resulted in a higher tolerance to both peroxide and superoxide and, unlike the single mutants, a double perRAperRB mutant was avirulent. Interestingly, this correlated with major changes in gene and non-coding RNA expression. Notably, several virulence-associated genes (clpB, ligA/B, and lvrAB) were repressed. By obtaining a double mutant in a pathogenic Leptospira strain, our study has uncovered an interplay of two PerRs in the adaptation of Leptospira to oxidative stress with a putative role in virulence and pathogenicity, most likely through the transcriptional control of a complex regulatory network.","['Zavala-Alvarado C', 'G Huete S', 'Vincent AT', 'Sismeiro O', 'Legendre R', 'Varet H', 'Bussotti G', 'Lorioux C', 'Lechat P', 'Coppée JY', 'Veyrier FJ', 'Picardeau M', 'Benaroudj N']",2021,17,12,PLoS Pathog,"Zavala-Alvarado C, et al.

34850241,Integrated serological surveillance of acute febrile illness in the context of a lymphatic filariasis survey in Timor-Leste: a pilot study using dried blood spots.,"BACKGROUND: Acute febrile illnesses (AFIs), including dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis, cause significant morbidity and mortality in Southeast Asia. Serological surveillance can be used to investigate the force and distribution of infections. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples are an attractive alternative to serum because they are easier to collect and transport and require less cold storage. We conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of integrating serological surveillance for dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis into a population-representative lymphatic filariasis seroprevalence survey in Timor-Leste using DBSs.
METHODS: A total of 272 DBSs were collected from healthy community participants. DBSs were analysed at the National Health Laboratory using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. To validate assays for DBSs, 20 anonymised serum samples of unknown serostatus were used to create dried serum spots (DSSs). These were analysed with optical densities compared with those of serum. Where low variance was observed (dengue assay) the published kit cut-offs for serum were applied to the analysis of DBSs. For the other assays (scrub typhus and leptospirosis), index values (IVs) were calculated and cut-offs were determined to be at 2 standard deviations (SDs) above the mean.
RESULTS: Of the 272 samples analysed, 19 (7.0% [95% confidence interval {CI} 4.3 to 10.7]) were positive for dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG), 11 (4.0% [95% CI 2.1 to 7.1]) were positive for scrub typhus IgG and 16 (5.9% [95% CI 3.4 to 9.4%]) were positive for leptospira IgG.
CONCLUSIONS: While dengue seroprevalence was lower than in nearby countries, results represent the first evidence of scrub typhus and leptospirosis transmission in Timor-Leste. Integrated programmes of serological surveillance could greatly improve our understanding of infectious disease epidemiology in remote areas and would incur minimal additional fieldwork costs. However, when planning such studies, the choice of assays, their validation for DBSs and the laboratory infrastructure and technical expertise at the proposed location of analysis must be considered.","['Arkell P', 'Angelina J', 'do Carmo Vieira A', 'Wapling J', 'Marr I', 'Monteiro M', 'Matthews A', 'Amaral S', 'da Conceicao V', 'Kim SH', 'Bailey D', 'Yan J', ""Fancourt's NSS"", 'Vaz Nery S', 'Francis JR']",2022,116,6,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Arkell P, et al.

34843470,Surface proteomics and label-free quantification of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona.,"Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonosis with a global distribution. Surface-exposed outer membrane proteins (SE-OMPs) are crucial for bacterial-host interactions. SE-OMPs locate and expose their epitope on cell surface where is easily accessed by host molecules. This study aimed to screen for surface-exposed proteins and their abundance profile of pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. Two complementary approaches, surface biotinylation and surface proteolytic shaving, followed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were employed to identify SE-OMPs of intact leptospires. For quantitative comparison, in-depth label-free analysis of SE-OMPs obtained from each method was performed using MaxQuant. The total number of proteins identified was 1,001 and 238 for surface biotinylation and proteinase K shaving, respectively. Among these, 39 were previously known SE-OMPs and 68 were predicted to be localized on the leptospiral surface. Based on MaxQuant analysis for relative quantification, six known SE-OMPs including EF- Tu, LipL21, LipL41, LipL46, Loa22, and OmpL36, and one predicted SE-OMPs, LipL71 were found in the 20 most abundant proteins, in which LipL41 was the highest abundant SE-OMP. Moreover, uncharacterized LIC14011 protein (LIP3228 ortholog in serovar Pomona) was identified as a novel predicted surface βb-OMP. High-abundance leptospiral SE-OMPs identified in this study may play roles in virulence and infection and are potential targets for development of vaccine or diagnostic tests for leptospirosis.","['Techawiwattanaboon T', 'Thaibankluay P', 'Kreangkaiwal C', 'Sathean-Anan-Kun S', 'Khaenam P', 'Makjaroen J', 'Pisitkun T', 'Patarakul K']",2021,15,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Techawiwattanaboon T, et al.

Inflammatory storms induced by Leptospira are the reason to induce immunoparalysis and organ failures. Antibiotics are still the current mainstream treatment for leptospirosis. In addition to their antibacterial action, the immunomodulatory function of antibiotics has been paid more and more attention. In this study, the role of norfloxacin on Leptospira-induced inflammation was investigated. Treatment with norfloxacin down-regulated Leptospira-induced IL-1β and TNF-α both in vivo and vitro models. Further study showed that norfloxacin inhibited Leptospira-induced phosphorylation of p65 and ERK. Norfloxacin also inhibited the Leptospira-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation with the increased level of Na/K-ATPase Pump β1 subunit and decreased level of Kcnk6. These results indicated that norfloxacin suppressed Leptospira-induced inflammation through inhibiting p65 and ERK phosphorylation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

34819445,Clinical profile of Thrombocytopenia in Acute Febrile Illnesses; a hospital-based study.,"Background Thrombocytopenia is a common haematological abnormality noted in clinical practice, however, it can be missed in cases where specific investigations are not asked for. Acute Febrile Illness with thrombocytopenia is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, as thrombocytopenia has an inverse relation to mortality and morbidity in various febrile illnesses. Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases (like malaria, dengue, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis), infections and sepsis are some of the common causes of fever with thrombocytopenia. Objective To identify the causes of fever with thrombocytopenia, assess the clinical complications associated with febrile thrombocytopenia, and overall study the clinical profile of thrombocytopenia in a tertiary care hospital Method Medical records of all adult patients, admitted to a tertiary level hospital, with fever and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 1,00,000 /mm3 ) were assessed (from October 2009 to March 2011). Detailed case history, general physical examination findings, routine and specific examinations were recorded according to a pre-decided format. Data were analysed using SPSS 16.0 Result Acute febrile illness with thrombocytopenia was most commonly seen in Dengue patients. Headache and arthralgia were more commonly encountered in scrub typhus. Platelet transfusions were necessitated in a large number of patients, especially in scrub typhus. Malaria patients had the highest mortality rate. Conclusion Acute Febrile Illnesses (AFI) are of varied origins, and proper diagnosis is imperative. The degree of thrombocytopenia in infections has a prognostic value. It can also help in differential diagnosis and clear identification of aetiology of acute febrile illnesses. Timely identification and management of thrombocytopenia in acute febrile illness can positively impact the overall patient outcome.","['Dhunputh P', 'Acharya R', 'Umakanth S', 'Shetty SM', 'Mohammed AP', 'Saraswat PP']",2021,19,74,Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),"Dhunputh P, et al.

This study aimed to determine how the physicochemical properties of water sources influence the growth and effect of iron on the gene expression of Leptospira spp. P47.
METHODS: Surface water samples (n=55) were collected and used for Leptospira spp. P47 cultivation. Physicochemical factors, including iron, calcium, magnesium and pH, were analyzed. The association between Leptospira spp. P47 viability at days 5, 10 and 15 with the physicochemical factors were analyzed. In addition, this bacterium was cultured in six selected water samples. The effect of iron in water on HemO and LipL32 gene expression was determined by relative quantification real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Leptospira viability at day 5 was not significantly correlated with physicochemical factors, while Leptospira viability at day 10 was associated with both pH and iron. The Leptospira viability rate at day 15 had a significantly positive association with pH and iron and a negative association with calcium. HemO expression was significantly increased, mostly in selected water samples and under iron-depleted conditions. Conversely, LipL32 expression was significantly decreased in all water samples.

34784395,Serologic titers to Leptospira in vaccinated pigs and interpretation for surveillance.,"Diagnosis and surveillance of pathogenic Leptospira is difficult as organisms may be intermittently shed and in small numbers. Therefore, serologic testing by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the primary screening method for leptospirosis. While a MAT titer ≥1:100 is considered to be a positive result, interpretation is complicated by the use of commercial vaccines in pigs. Most guidelines for interpretation of MAT titers in pigs were published in the 1970's and 1980's, prior to the development of the current multivalent vaccines. We evaluated MAT titers in routinely vaccinated healthy research pigs compared to their unvaccinated cohorts. Our study confirmed previous reports that the Pomona serovar elicits minimal antibody response even after a second booster 6 months after initial vaccination. However, MAT titers of ≥1:3,200 were detected as early as 4 weeks post initial vaccination for serovars Bratislava and Icterohaemorrhagiae and remained as high as ≥1:1,600 prior to booster at 24 weeks post vaccination. Our study determined that high levels of MAT titers can occur from vaccination alone and high titers are not necessarily indicative of infection. Therefore, the interpretation of MAT titers as indicators of Leptospira infection should be readdressed.","['Schommer SK', 'Harrison N', 'Linville M', 'Samuel MS', 'Hammond SL', 'Wells KD', 'Prather RS']",2021,16,11,PLoS One,"Schommer SK, et al.

34784354,"Epidemiology of leptospirosis in Tanzania: A review of the current status, serogroup diversity and reservoirs.","BACKGROUND: Tanzania is among the tropical countries of Sub-Saharan Africa with the environmental conditions favorable for transmission of Leptospira. Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease, and although there are several published reports from Tanzania, the epidemiology, genetic diversity of Leptospira and its host range are poorly understood.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of human and animal leptospirosis within the 26 regions of the Tanzanian mainland. Literature searches for the review were conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar. We further manually identified studies from reference lists among retrieved studies from the preliminary search.
RESULTS: We identified thirty-four studies describing leptospirosis in humans (n = 16), animals (n = 14) and in both (n = 4). The number of studies varied significantly across regions. Most of the studies were conducted in Morogoro (n = 16) followed by Kilimanjaro (n = 9) and Tanga (n = 5). There were a range of study designs with cross-sectional prevalence studies (n = 18), studies on leptospirosis in febrile patients (n = 13), a case control study in cattle (n = 1) and studies identifying novel serovars (n = 2). The most utilized diagnostic tool was the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) which detected antibodies to 17 Leptospira serogroups in humans and animals. The Leptospira serogroups with the most diverse hosts were Icterohaemorrhagiae (n = 11), Grippotyphosa (n = 10), Sejroe (n = 10), Pomona (n = 9) and Ballum (n = 8). The reported prevalence of Leptospira antibodies in humans ranged from 0.3-29.9% and risk factors were associated with occupational animal contact. Many potential reservoir hosts were identified with the most common being rodents and cattle.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is prevalent in humans and animals in Tanzania, although there is regional and host variation in the reports. Many regions do not have information about the disease in either humans or their animal reservoirs. More studies are required to understand human leptospirosis determinants and the role of livestock in leptospirosis transmission to humans for the development of appropriate control strategies.","['Motto SK', 'Shirima GM', 'de Clare Bronsvoort BM', 'Cook EAJ']",2021,15,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Motto SK, et al.

34780473,"Mongooses (Urva auropunctata) as reservoir hosts of Leptospira species in the United States Virgin Islands, 2019-2020.","During 2019-2020, the Virgin Islands Department of Health investigated potential animal reservoirs of Leptospira spp., the bacteria that cause leptospirosis. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated Leptospira spp. exposure and carriage in the small Indian mongoose (Urva auropunctata, syn: Herpestes auropunctatus), an invasive animal species. This study was conducted across the three main islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), which are St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John. We used the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), fluorescent antibody test (FAT), real-time polymerase chain reaction (lipl32 rt-PCR), and bacterial culture to evaluate serum and kidney specimens and compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of these laboratory methods. Mongooses (n = 274) were live-trapped at 31 field sites in ten regions across USVI and humanely euthanized for Leptospira spp. testing. Bacterial isolates were sequenced and evaluated for species and phylogenetic analysis using the ppk gene. Anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies were detected in 34% (87/256) of mongooses. Reactions were observed with the following serogroups: Sejroe, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pyrogenes, Mini, Cynopteri, Australis, Hebdomadis, Autumnalis, Mankarso, Pomona, and Ballum. Of the kidney specimens examined, 5.8% (16/270) were FAT-positive, 10% (27/274) were culture-positive, and 12.4% (34/274) were positive by rt-PCR. Of the Leptospira spp. isolated from mongooses, 25 were L. borgpetersenii, one was L. interrogans, and one was L. kirschneri. Positive predictive values of FAT and rt-PCR testing for predicting successful isolation of Leptospira by culture were 88% and 65%, respectively. The isolation and identification of Leptospira spp. in mongooses highlights the potential role of mongooses as a wildlife reservoir of leptospirosis; mongooses could be a source of Leptospira spp. infections for other wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.","['Cranford HM', 'Browne AS', 'LeCount K', 'Anderson T', 'Hamond C', 'Schlater L', 'Stuber T', 'Burke-France VJ', 'Taylor M', 'Harrison CJ', 'Matias KY', 'Medley A', 'Rossow J', 'Wiese N', 'Jankelunas L', 'de Wilde L', 'Mehalick M', 'Blanchard GL', 'Garcia KR', 'McKinley AS', 'Lombard CD', 'Angeli NF', 'Horner D', 'Kelley T', 'Worthington DJ', 'Valiulis J', 'Bradford B', 'Berentsen A', 'Salzer JS', 'Galloway R', 'Schafer IJ', 'Bisgard K', 'Roth J', 'Ellis BR', 'Ellis EM', 'Nally JE']",2021,15,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Cranford HM, et al.

34774700,Emergency vaccine immunization protects hamsters against acute leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira, is a global critical zoonotic disease in terms of mortality and morbidity. Vaccines are often used to prevent leptospirosis. However, few studies have reported the therapeutic effect of a vaccine against Leptospira infection. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the emergency vaccine immunization against acute leptospirosis in hamsters. Treatment with a whole-cell vaccine (Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai) at 24 h post-infection improved the survival rate of hamsters with lower leptospiral burden and minor pathological damage to organs. The vaccine also protected against multiple Leptospira serotypes acute infection. However, the protective effect of the vaccines was lost when beginning treatment at 36 h or 48 h post-infection. These results indicated that vaccines could treat acute leptospirosis in hamsters, but only if immunization is within 24 h after infection.","['Zhang S', 'Wu D', 'Tang R', 'Zhang W', 'Cao Y']",2021,161,Pt A,Microb Pathog,"Zhang S, et al.

34769638,The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Communicable Disease Incidence and Its Projection: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Climate change poses a real challenge and has contributed to causing the emergence and re-emergence of many communicable diseases of public health importance. Here, we reviewed scientific studies on the relationship between meteorological factors and the occurrence of dengue, malaria, cholera, and leptospirosis, and synthesized the key findings on communicable disease projection in the event of global warming.
METHOD: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 flow checklist. Four databases (Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, EBSCOhost) were searched for articles published from 2005 to 2020. The eligible articles were evaluated using a modified scale of a checklist designed for assessing the quality of ecological studies.
RESULTS: A total of 38 studies were included in the review. Precipitation and temperature were most frequently associated with the selected climate-sensitive communicable diseases. A climate change scenario simulation projected that dengue, malaria, and cholera incidence would increase based on regional climate responses.
CONCLUSION: Precipitation and temperature are important meteorological factors that influence the incidence of climate-sensitive communicable diseases. Future studies need to consider more determinants affecting precipitation and temperature fluctuations for better simulation and prediction of the incidence of climate-sensitive communicable diseases.","['Baharom M', 'Ahmad N', 'Hod R', 'Arsad FS', 'Tangang F']",2021,18,21,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Baharom M, et al.

34752782,The burden of opisthorchiasis and leptospirosis in Thailand: A nationwide syndemic analysis.,"Opisthorchiasis, caused by the foodborne trematode parasite Opisthorchis viverrini, is co-endemic with leptospirosis in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Socio-economic determinants, occupational risk factors, and reservoir hosts interact with the diseases in the threat to human health, but the situation has not been explored. We, therefore, studied the interaction between the diseases and their associated risks using a syndemic approach with nationwide data for Thailand. Methods included Bayesian mapping, principal component analysis (PCA), and nested correlation analysis to analyze the data for 2009 and 2014. Bayesian mapping demonstrates that opisthorchiasis acts in a synergistic manner to massively alter the risk of leptospirosis at the provincial level, particularly in areas of opisthorchiasis endemicity in Northeast Thailand. Socio-economic and occupational factors significantly influence the disease syndemic with moderate effect sizes of -0.4 and 0.5, respectively (P<0.001). These effects are most remarkable in the northeastern region, which has not only the highest poverty level but also the highest proportion of occupational risk (P<0.001). Cats and dogs play crucial roles in maintaining the syndemic (r-value 7 and 6 with P<0.001). The study shows that opisthorchiasis and leptospirosis become syndemic, especially in North-East, Thailand. Socio-economic and occupational variables are positively syndemic as they are representative of neglected tropical diseases. The role of reservoir hosts underlines the value of an interdisciplinary approach, such as One Health for Sustainability Disease Control.","['Almanfaluthi M', 'Widodo S', 'Suttiprapa S', 'Wongsaroj T', 'Sripa B']",2022,226,,Acta Trop,"Almanfaluthi M, et al.

34749158,Cross-sectional survey for sheep leptospirosis in the northeast region of Brazil.,"Sheep farming has shown expressive growth, even in the Northeast region of Brazil, with rainfall below expectations in the last decade. This growth has been observed not only in the number of herds, but also in the number of properties involved in sheep farming. Although expressive, the production of small ruminants still presents low levels of performance, mainly due to the occurrence of diseases, which constitute an obstacle to this activity. The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with the seroprevalence of leptospirosis in sheep in Northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 3438 sheep in 190 herds from 48 municipalities, belonging to the states of Ceará, Paraíba, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. Serological diagnosis was performed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). In 76.3 % (95 % CI = 69.79-81.81) of the herds there was at least one animal seropositive for at least one of the Leptospira spp. serogroups and 14.94 % (95 %CI = 13.8-16.18) of the animals were seropositive. The state of Paraíba had the highest herd (95.7 %) and animal (26.6 %) prevalences, followed by Ceará (93.9 % and 23.7 %, respectively). The most frequent serogroups were Autumnalis (18.68 %), Australis (17.9 %) and Pyrogenes (15.18 %). There was no association between the studied variables and the herd-level prevalence of leptospirosis. High herd and animal-level seroprevalences was found for sheep leptospirosis in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil, and there is a need to implement control and prevention measures, such as quarantine, serology, vaccination and adequate treatment, in addition to the introduction of proven healthy animals, mainly in the states of Paraíba and Ceará, aiming to reduce the prevalence of disease.","['da Silva JD', 'Viana MP', 'Lima Pereira Calado LG', 'César Lima AM', 'Fernandes Alves FS', 'Pinheiro RR', 'da Costa DF', 'Pinheiro da Silva GC', 'de Azevedo SS', 'Alves CJ']",2021,197,,Prev Vet Med,"da Silva JD, et al.

Here we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of MMD in Hubei province, China.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based study to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of MMD in Hubei province between 2017 and 2019. The regional clusters of the hot spots (high incidence) and cold spots (low incidence) of MMD were identified using the spatial statistical method. To evaluate the role of leptospirosis in MMD, we performed an ecological comparison study to evaluate whether the socioeconomic and environmental variables of hot spots are more suitable for leptospirosis spread.
RESULTS: The average annual sex and age adjusted incidence of MMD was 3.07 per 100,000 person-years from 2017 to 2019. The middle-aged had apparently higher incidence of MMD than the children. There existed an obvious geographic distribution difference of MMD at county level. The hot spots were identified mainly in the low mountainous and hilly terrain, while cold spots were located in the Jianghan Plains. Compared to cold spots, the hot spots had larger cattle density (32.0 vs 3.1, p = 0.002), higher percentages of rice field (85.6% vs 47.0%, p = 0.007), and lower elevation (33.6 vs 157.4, p < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: There exists geographic distribution difference of MMD in Hubei province and was likely to be caused by leptospirosis in the early years. The MMD in China is dominant by middle-aged adults, which might be driven from leptospirosis outbreaks in the last century.","['Ma Z', 'Wang X', 'Li M', 'Zhou D', 'Chen J']",2021,210,,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,"Ma Z, et al.

Leptospira noguchii is an emerging pathogen, but its association with reproductive disease is unclear. We have detected L. noguchii as the agent of an outbreak with reproductive disorders in a Brazilian dairy goat flock. In the kidding season, five out of 10 Saanen had abortions in the final month of pregnancy and two newborn kids had acute clinical signs. After necropsy of three foetuses and one newborn kid, fragments of liver, lung and kidney were submitted to lipL32-PCR. It yielded positive results in at least one fragment from each animal. After, a nested secY-PCR, followed by sequencing, could identify L. noguchii, with 99-100% of identity with sequences obtained from cattle in the same region. For the first time, L. noguchii was detected in goats and, most importantly, the association of this leptospiral species with reproductive failures in ruminants has been demonstrated.","['Aymée L', 'Di Azevedo MIN', 'de Melo JDSL', 'Balaro MFA', 'Martins GMS', 'Consalter A', 'Leite JDS', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2022,69,5,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Aymée L, et al.

34736464,Pathogens with potential impact on reproduction in captive and free-ranging European bison (Bison bonasus) in Poland - a serological survey.,"BACKGROUND: The European bison is an endangered species, and as such it is extremely important to monitor herds for pathogens which can lead to reproductive failure. The aim of the present study was to determine the current prevalence of antibodies to pathogens known to potentially influence reproduction in European bison. Serum samples from 183 bison, originating from different parts of Poland, were tested using commercial ELISA tests for antibodies to Chlamydia spp., Coxiella burnetti, Leptospira interrogans, Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii; the findings were compared between captive and main free-ranging herds, and with regard to the influence of demographic factors such as age and sex. The prevalence of seropositivity was also checked with regard to location and the animal species sharing it.
RESULTS: Chlamydia spp. antibodies were present in 48 out of 130 (36.9%) tested samples. Coxiella burnetii was found in one sample out of 178 (0.58%). N. caninum in 36 out of 172 (20.9%) and T. gondii in 23 out of 172 (13.4%). No sample was positive for leptospirosis. Neither sex nor age appeared to have a significant effect on the occurrence of antibodies to the identified species. The prevalence of Chlamydia spp. in the samples varied significantly according to location; however, similar frequency ranges were observed between free ranging and captive herds. In contrast, antibodies to N. caninum were more common in free-ranging herds than captive herds, with the highest frequency observed in the Bieszczady Mountains.
CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia spp., N. caninum and T. gondii might have a similar impact on the reproductive potential of European bison as they have on cattle. The high occurrence of antibodies to N. caninum in bison from the Bieszczady Mountains may be associated with the relatively high density of the wolf population in the area.","['Didkowska A', 'Klich D', 'Hapanowicz A', 'Orłowska B', 'Gałązka M', 'Rzewuska M', 'Olech W', 'Anusz K']",2021,17,1,BMC Vet Res,"Didkowska A, et al.

Exposure to infections such as leptospirosis, for which rodents are primary hosts, is of particular concern.
METHODS: A wellness program was conducted to determine the presence of antibodies against Leptospira (seroprevalence) in 11 refugee community schools and centers in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. A total of 433 samples were assessed for IgG and IgM antibodies against Leptospira, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).
RESULTS: Overall Leptospira seroprevalence was 24.7%, with 3.0% being seropositive for anti-Leptospira IgG and 21.7% for anti-Leptospira IgM. Factors significantly associated with overall Leptospira seroprevalence included: age, ethnicity, pet ownership, knowledge of disease and awareness of disease fatality. For IgM seroprevalence, significant risk factors included sex, ethnicity, eating habits with hands, pet ownership, the presence of rats, walking in bare feet and water recreation visits.

34714909,SEROSURVEY FOR SELECTED PARASITIC AND BACTERIAL PATHOGENS IN DARWIN'S FOX (LYCALOPEX FULVIPES): NOT ONLY DOG DISEASES ARE A THREAT.,"The Darwin's fox (Lycalopex fulvipes) is one of the most endangered carnivores worldwide, with the risk of disease spillover from domestic dogs being a major conservation threat. However, lack of epidemiologic information about generalist, non-dog-transmission-dependent protozoal and bacterial pathogens may be a barrier for disease prevention and management. To determine the exposure of some of these agents in Darwin's fox populations, 54 serum samples were collected from 47 Darwin's foxes in Southern Chile during 2013-18 and assessed for the presence of antibodies against Brucella abortus, Brucella canis, Coxiella burnetii, pathogenic Leptospira (serovars Grippotyphosa, Pomona, Canicola, Hardjo, and Copehageni), Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum. The highest seroprevalence was detected for T. gondii (78%), followed by pathogenic Leptospira (14%). All the studied Leptospira serovars were confirmed in at least one animal. Two foxes seroconverted to Leptospira and one to T. gondii during the study period. No seroconversions were observed for the other pathogens. No risk factors, either intrinsic (sex, age) or extrinsic (season, year, and degree of landscape anthropization), were associated with the probability of being exposed to T. gondii. Our results indicate that T. gondii exposure is widespread in the Darwin's fox population, including in areas with minimal anthropization, and that T. gondii and pathogenic Leptospira might be neglected threats to the species. Further studies identifying the causes of morbidity and mortality in Darwin's fox are needed to determine if these or other pathogens are having individual or population-wide effects in this species.","['Hidalgo-Hermoso E', 'Cabello J', 'Verasay J', 'Moreira-Arce D', 'Hidalgo M', 'Abalos P', 'Borie C', 'Galarce N', 'Napolitano C', 'Sacristán I', 'Cevidanes A', 'Ramírez-Toloza G', 'Farias A', 'Di Cataldo S', 'Lagos R', 'Millán J']",2022,58,1,J Wildl Dis,"Hidalgo-Hermoso E, et al.

34673004,Leptospira collagenase and LipL32 for antibody detection in leptospirosis.,"Various Leptospira components have been identified as candidate antigens for the detection of antibody to Leptospira. LipL32 is a Leptospira membrane protein which has been widely studied. The report of Leptospira whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that pathogenic Leptospira contained the nucleotide sequence (colA gene) coding for the collagenase. Expression of ColA protein and its enzymatic activity was demonstrated. In this study, cloned ColA protein, in comparison with LipL32, was used as an antigen for antibody detection. Thirty pairs of sera from human leptospirosis patients were tested. Sera from blood donors, and patients with scrub typhus and dengue virus infection (20 samples from each group) were tested for the specificity. All sera from leptospirosis patients tested in this study reacted with both ColA and LipL32 proteins. Sera from blood donors, patients with scrub typhus and dengue virus infection did not react with ColA protein. Data suggested that sensitivity and specificity of ColA protein for Leptospira antibody detection were 100%. In addition, ColA protein showed higher specificity than LipL32. Our data suggested that ColA protein could be another candidate antigen for antibody detection in leptospirosis diagnosis.","['Chirathaworn C', 'Janwitthayanan W', 'Suputtamongkol Y', 'Poovorawan Y']",2021,499,,J Immunol Methods,"Chirathaworn C, et al.

METHODS: A logistic regression model in which the response variable was the presence of hantavirus or leptospirosis was adjusted.
RESULTS: As a result, the method selected the following variables that influenced the prediction formula: sociodemographic variables, clinical manifestations, and exposure to environmental risks. All variables considered in the model presented statistical significance with a p<0.05 value. The accuracy of the model to differentiate hantavirus from leptospirosis was 88.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Concluding that the development of statistical tools with high potential to predict the disease, and thus differentiate them precociously, can reduce hospital costs, speed up the patient's care, reduce morbidity and mortality, and assist health professionals and public managers in decision-making.","['Rabelo MRG', 'Amâncio NFG', 'Ramos SB']",2021,67,8,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),"Rabelo MRG, et al.

34669742,Application of simplified MLST scheme for direct typing of clinical samples from human leptospirosis cases in a tertiary hospital in the Philippines.,"Despite the major threat of leptospirosis to public health in the Philippines, its epidemiologic data remain scarce. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a method often used for identification of circulating Leptospira species and disease surveillance. Unfortunately, molecular typing of Leptospira isolates is not routinely done in most hospital settings. A simplified MLST scheme targeting three loci (adk, lipL41, mreA) was performed for rapid direct typing of Leptospira in clinical specimens. Blood samples from suspected or clinically diagnosed cases (n = 50) were initially screened via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 23S rRNA, 16S rRNA (rrs2), and lipL32 genes. From the nine positives, seven had interpretable data from MLST. Allelic profiles identified L. interrogans in all positive samples. Six were assigned to ST12 of serovar Manilae (serogroup Pyrogenes) while one sample cannot be clearly differentiated between two serovars/serogroups, Bataviae/Losbanos (serogroup Bataviae) or Australis (serogroup Australis), indicating possibility of a new ST. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the application of simplified MLST scheme produces consistent results with the seven-loci genetic profile of published Leptospira MLST schemes. Reduced scheme addressed the challenges often encountered in the amplification of full MLST genetic profile of Leptospira. The approach is a potential alternative to serological tests for rapid typing of clinical specimens and can also aid in investigations on disease epidemiology specifically to monitor occurrence, pathogen transmission, host specificity and susceptibility, and other factors that could lead to potential outbreaks.","['Mendoza MV', 'Rivera WL']",2021,16,10,PLoS One,Mendoza MV and Rivera WL.

34667214,Linking climate and infectious disease trends in the Northern/Arctic Region.,"Recognition of climate-sensitive infectious diseases is crucial for mitigating health threats from climate change. Recent studies have reasoned about potential climate sensitivity of diseases in the Northern/Arctic Region, where climate change is particularly pronounced. By linking disease and climate data for this region, we here comprehensively quantify empirical climate-disease relationships. Results show significant relationships of borreliosis, leptospirosis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Puumala virus infection, cryptosporidiosis, and Q fever with climate variables related to temperature and freshwater conditions. These data-driven results are consistent with previous reasoning-based propositions of climate-sensitive infections as increasing threats for humans, with notable exceptions for TBE and leptospirosis. For the latter, the data imply decrease with increasing temperature and precipitation experienced in, and projected for, the Northern/Arctic Region. This study provides significant data-based underpinning for simplified empirical assessments of the risks of several infectious diseases under future climate change.","['Ma Y', 'Destouni G', 'Kalantari Z', 'Omazic A', 'Evengård B', 'Berggren C', 'Thierfelder T']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Ma Y, et al.

34666707,Predictors of severe leptospirosis: a multicentre observational study from Central Malaysia.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a re-emerging disease with vast clinical presentations, that ranges from subclinical or mild to severe and fatal outcomes. Leptospirosis can be managed well if diagnosed earlier, however, similar clinical presentations by several other febrile illnesses or co-infections, and laboratory diagnostic challenges due to the biphasic nature of the illness, often result in mis- or underdiagnosis, thereby lead to severe illness. Identification of clinical predictors for the severe form of the disease plays a crucial role in reducing disease complication and mortality. Therefore, we aimed to determine the clinical predictors associated with severe illness among leptospirosis patients from Central Malaysia through a prospective multicenter observational study.
METHODS: A prospective multicenter observational study was performed on patients admitted for clinically suspected leptospirosis. Three hospitals namely Hospital Serdang, Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah and Hospital Teluk Intan were included in the study. Among a total of 165 clinically suspected leptospirosis patients, 83 confirmed cases were investigated for clinical predictors for severe illness. Qualitative variables were performed using χ2 and the relationship between mild and severe cases was evaluated using logistic regression. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the independent variable for severity.
RESULTS: Among the 83 patients, 50 showed mild disease and 33 developed severe illness. The mean age of the patients was 41.92 ± 17.99 and most were males (n = 54, 65.06%). We identified mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, septic shock, creatinine level of > 1.13 mg/dL, urea > 7 mmol/L, alanine aminotransferase > 50 IU, aspartate aminotransferase > 50 IU, and platelet < 150 × 10
CONCLUSIONS: Lungs, liver and kidney involvement and septic shock were found as the prognostic factors for severe leptospirosis. Acute kidney injury, high level of alanine aminotransferase and low level of platelets were found to be independent predictors of severity.","['Philip N', 'Lung Than LT', 'Shah AM', 'Yuhana MY', 'Sekawi Z', 'Neela VK']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Philip N, et al.

34662860,The Applicability of Commonly Used Severity of Illness Scores to Tropical Infections in Australia.,"Many patients with leptospirosis, melioidosis, and rickettsial infection require intensive care unit (ICU) admission in tropical Australia every year. The multi-organ dysfunction associated with these infections results in significantly elevated severity of illness (SOI) scores. However, the accuracy of these SOI scores in predicting death from these tropical infections is incompletely defined. This retrospective study was performed at Cairns Hospital, a tertiary-referral hospital in tropical Australia. All patients admitted to ICU with laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis, melioidosis, and rickettsial disease between January 1, 1999 and June 30, 2020, were eligible for the study. The ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, APACHE III, Simplified Acute Physiology Scores (SAPS) II, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to predict death before ICU discharge was evaluated. Overall, 18 (12.1%) of the 149 included patients died: 15/74 (20.3%) with melioidosis, 2/54 (3.7%) with leptospirosis and 1/21 (4.8%) with rickettsial disease. However, the APACHE II, APACHE III, SAPS II, and SOFA scores significantly overestimated the case-fatality rate of all the infections; the disparity between the predicted and observed mortality was most marked in the cases of leptospirosis and rickettsial disease. Commonly used SOI scores significantly overestimate the case-fatality rate of melioidosis, leptospirosis, and rickettsial infections in Australian ICU patients. This may be at least partly explained by the unique pathophysiology of these infections, particularly leptospirosis and rickettsial disease. However, SOI scores may still be useful in facilitating the comparison of disease severity in clinical trials that examine patients with these pathogens.","['Salaveria K', 'Smith S', 'Liu YH', 'Bagshaw R', 'Ott M', 'Stewart A', 'Law M', 'Carter A', 'Hanson J']",2021,106,1,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Salaveria K, et al.

34657392,"Spatial epidemiology of Leptospira sp. exposure in bovines from Veracruz, México.","Bovine leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects cattle herds, causing economic losses due to reproductive problems which require expensive treatments. The main source of transmission for cattle is still uncertain, but rodents and bats can play an important role in the transmission cycle by being maintenance hosts for the pathogenic species of the bacterium and spreading it through urine. In this study, we characterize possible risk areas for bovine leptospirosis exposure in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, based on the geographical distribution of flying (bats) and terrestrial (rodents and opossums) wild hosts of Leptospira sp. reported in Mexico, in addition to climate, geography, soil characteristics, land use and human activities (environmental variables). We used a generalized linear regression model to understand the association between the frequency of anti-Leptospira sp. antibodies (a proxy of exposure) in cattle herds exposed to Leptospira, the favourability of wild hosts of Leptospira as well as the environmental variables. The parameterized model explained 12.3% of the variance. The frequency of anti-Leptospira sp. antibodies exposure in cattle herds was associated with elevation, geographic longitude, pH of the soil surface and environmental favourability for the presence of rodents, opossums and bats. The variation in exposure was mainly explained by a longitudinal gradient (6.4% of the variance) and the favourability-based indices for wild hosts (9.6% of the variance). Describing the possible risks for exposure to Leptospira in an important and neglected livestock geographical region, we provide valuable information for the selection of areas for diagnosis and prevention of this relevant disease.","['Gutiérrez-Molina R', 'Acevedo P', 'Sánchez-Montes S', 'Romero-Salas D', 'López-Ortiz S', 'Flores-Primo A', 'Cruz-Romero A']",2022,69,4,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Gutiérrez-Molina R, et al.

34627180,"""Y no quedó nada, nada de la casa, todo salió volando"" (And there was nothing left, nothing of the house, everything flew away): a critical medical ecological perspective on the lived experience of hurricane María in Puerto Rico.","BACKGROUND: Ecological disasters create dramatic changes as man-made and natural ecosystems adapt to their effects. In 2017, Hurricanes Irma and María devastated Puerto Rico. Public focus after such traumatic ecological events often neglects pre-existing community dynamics, heterogeneity of lived experience, and complexity of decision-making in the disaster context. We intended to better understand the lived experience of this ecological trauma in communities across ecosystems in Puerto Rico and among those displaced to Florida.
METHOD: We used the Critical Medical Ecological (CME) framework to assess the relative contribution of ecological dimensions on lived experience across community levels and time. We used qualitative methods with emic coding and etic mapping of salient constructs to the ecological model. In total, 96 people participated in 23 discussion encounters. Two people coded interviews in Spanish using Dedoose. We identified common themes in sequential order mapped to elements of the CME to approximate the participants' temporal experience.
RESULTS: Codes applied to the period of the hurricane's landfall, traverse, and exit were markedly distinct from the other two periods (before and after) examined in this study: the experience of the hurricane's strike was highly personal and, at this level, reflected a mix of sociocultural, biological, and abiotic factors. After the hurricanes, social and community factors re-emerged while new risks and conditions arose that were biological (e.g., leptospirosis, no food or water) or abiotic (e.g., unusable roads/bridges, structures destroyed), but created ongoing stressors and social needs for communities. As we found, the dynamics of the social and household landscape sometimes involved the decision to leave Puerto Rico altogether, or forced people to continually face and adapt to the ongoing collapse in basic services that were only slowly and differentially restored.
CONCLUSION: Lived experience across each stage of the hurricanes differed substantially from one another. Communities disrupted by ecological disaster are also frequently entangled within global economic and political histories and dependencies that could preclude recovery. Island nations are especially vulnerable to both climate-induced ecological change and political-economic exploitation. The ongoing health effect of the hurricane remains palpable in many communities of Puerto Rico and among the diaspora in Florida.","['Vega Ocasio D', 'Pérez Ramos JG', 'Dye TDV']",2021,21,1,BMC Public Health,"Vega Ocasio D, et al.

34588617,Gut microbiota involved in leptospiral infections.,"Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease worldwide. Intestinal bleeding is a common but neglected symptom in severe leptospirosis. The regulatory mechanism of the gut microbiota on leptospirosis is still unclear. In this study, we found that Leptospira interrogans infection changed the composition of the gut microbiota in mice. Weight loss and an increased leptospiral load in organs were observed in the gut microbiota-depleted mice compared with those in the control mice. Moreover, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to the microbiota-depleted mice reversed these effects. The phagocytosis response and inflammatory response in bone marrow-derived macrophages and thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages were diminished in the microbiota-depleted mice after infection. However, the phagocytosis response and inflammatory response in resident peritoneal macrophage were not affected in the microbiota-depleted mice after infection. The diminished macrophage disappearance reaction (bacterial entry into the peritoneum acutely induced macrophage adherence to form local clots and out of the fluid phase) led to an increased leptospiral load in the peritoneal cavity in the microbiota-depleted mice. In addition, the impaired capacity of macrophages to clear leptospires increased leptospiral dissemination in Leptospira-infected microbiota-depleted mice. Our study identified the microbiota as an endogenous defense against L. interrogans infection. Modulating the structure and function of the gut microbiota may provide new individualized preventative strategies for the control of leptospirosis and related spirochetal infections.","['Xie X', 'Liu J', 'Chen X', 'Zhang S', 'Tang R', 'Wu X', 'Zhang W', 'Cao Y']",2022,16,3,ISME J,"Xie X, et al.

34587213,Identification of pathogenic Leptospira species and serovars in New Zealand using metabarcoding.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance. The breadth of Leptospira diversity associated with both human and animal disease poses major logistical challenges to the use of classical diagnostic techniques, and increasingly molecular diagnostic tools are used for their detection. In New Zealand, this has resulted in an increase in positive cases reported nationally that have not been attributed to the infecting serovar or genomospecies. In this study, we used data from all pathogenic Leptospira genomes to identify a partial region of the glmU gene as a suitable locus for the discrimination of the infecting species and serovars of New Zealand-endemic Leptospira. This method can be used in culture and culture-independent scenarios making it flexible for diagnostics in humans, animals, and environmental samples. We explored the use of this locus as a molecular barcoding tool via the Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing platform MinION. Sequences obtained by this method allowed specific identification of Leptospira species in mixed and enriched environmental cultures, however read error inherent in the MinION sequencing system reduced the accuracy of strain/variant identification. Using this approach to characterise Leptospira in enriched environmental cultures, we detected the likely presence of Leptospira genomospecies that have not been reported in New Zealand to date. This included a strain of L. borgpetersenii that has recently been identified in dairy cattle and sequences similar to those of L. mayottensis. L. tipperaryensis, L. dzianensis and L. alstonii.","['Wilkinson DA', 'Edwards M', 'Benschop J', 'Nisa S']",2021,16,9,PLoS One,"Wilkinson DA, et al.

34578116,Immunoinformatic Study of Recombinant LigA/BCon1-5 Antigen and Evaluation of Its Diagnostic Potential in Primary and Secondary Binding Tests for Serodiagnosis of Porcine Leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is responsible for hampering the productivity of swine husbandry worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of bioinformatics tools in predicting the three-dimensional structure and immunogenicity of recombinant LigBCon1-5 (rLigBCon1-5) antigen. A battery of bioinformatics tools such as I-TASSER, ProSA and SAVES v6.0 were used for the prediction and assessment of the predicted structure of rLigBCon1-5 antigen. Bepipred-2.0, DiscoTope v2.0 and ElliPro servers were used to predict linear and conformational epitopes while T-cell epitopes were predicted using NetMHCpan 4.1 and IEDB recommended 2.22 method for MHC Class I and II peptides respectively. The results obtained using various in silico methods were then compared with wet lab experiments comprising of both primary (IgG Dot ELISA Dipstick test) and secondary-binding assays (Latex Agglutination Test [LAT]) to screen 1153 porcine serum samples. The three-dimensional structure of rLigA/BCon1-5 protein as predicted by I-TASSER was found to be reliable by Ramachandran Plot and ProSA. The ElliPro server suggested 10 and three potential linear and conformational B-cell-epitopes, respectively, on the peptide backbone of the rLigA/BCon1-5 protein. The DiscoTope prediction server suggested 47 amino acid residues to be part of B-cell antigen. Ten of the most efficient peptides for MHC-I and II grooves were predicted by NetMHCpan 4.1 and IEDB recommended 2.22 method, respectively. Of these, three peptides can serve dual functions as it can fit both MHC I and II grooves, thereby eliciting both humoral-and cell-mediated immune responses. The prediction of these computational approaches proved to be reliable since rLigBCon1-5 antigen-based IgG Dot ELISA Dipstick test and LAT gave results in concordance to gold standard test, the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis. Both the IgG Dot ELISA Dipstick test and LAT were serodiagnostic assays ideally suited for peripheral level of animal health care system as ""point of care"" tests for the detection of porcine leptospirosis.","['Behera SK', 'Sabarinath T', 'Mishra PKK', 'Deneke Y', 'Kumar A', 'ChandraSekar S', 'Senthilkumar K', 'Verma M', 'Ganesh B', 'Gurav A', 'Hota A']",2021,10,9,Pathogens,"Behera SK, et al.

34568135,Seroprevalence trends of Scrub typhus among the febrile patients of Northern India: A prospective cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Rickettsial infections remain one of the most neglected and underdiagnosed tropical diseases in the developing countries. Scrub typhus can prove to an important diagnosis in pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) patients and is transmitted by a species of trombiculid mites (""chiggers""). The disease leads to a plethora of symptoms like fever, rash, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, etc. The current study was aimed to assess the seroprevalence as well as other demographic parameters of scrub typhus among patients diagnosed with PUO in the northern part of India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken for a period of 3 years from September 2017 to September 2020. Serum samples of suspected cases were tested for IgM Scrub typhus along with other common febrile illnesses like Malaria, typhoid, dengue, leptospirosis, chikengunya, etc. Additional testing for COVID-19 was also planned for samples received after February 2020.
RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of Scrub typhus during the 3 year study period was noted to be 18.6% in the PUO patients. Typhoid was noted in 39.5%, malaria in 9.2%, Dengue in 13.5%, leptospirosis in 4.8%, and chikungunya in 5.3% of the patients. No cause was identified in 9.1% of the PUO cases. 3.9% of the samples were positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19. No mortality was noted in the scrub typhus positive cases.
CONCLUSION: Scrub typhus is an emerging tropical rickettsial disease in the Indian subcontinent. The present study highlights the importance of screening of PUO cases for this important infection as timely institution of simple empirical treatment can prove to be life saving in such positive cases.","['Singh S', 'Patel SS', 'Sahu C', 'Ghoshal U']",2021,10,7,J Family Med Prim Care,"Singh S, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate subsequent risk of major AD in hospitalized Taiwanese for Leptospirosis.
METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study was employed. The enrolled period was from 2000 to 2012. In the main model, we extracted 4026 inpatients with leptospirosis from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and 16,104 participants without leptospirosis at a 1:4 ratio propensity-score matched (PSM) by age, gender, index year, and comorbidities. The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial diagnosis of leptospirosis to major AD occurrence or 2013. This study was re-analyzed by frequency-matching as a sensitivity analysis for cross-validation. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: The adjusted HR (95% CI) of major ADs for the leptospirosis group was 4.45 (3.25-6.79) (p < 0.001) compared to the controls after full adjustment. The risk of major ADs was 5.52-fold (95% CI, 3.82-7.99) higher in leptospirosis patients hospitalized for seven days and above than the controls, while 2.80-fold (95% CI, 1.68-5.61) in those hospitalized less than seven days. The sensitivity analysis yields consistent findings. Stratified analysis revealed that the association between leptospirosis and major ADs was generalized in both genders, and all age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic leptospirosis is associated with increased rate of subsequent major ADs, and the risk seems to be higher in severe cases.","['Chen CC', 'Hung YM', 'Chiu LT', 'Chou MC', 'Chang R', 'Wei JC']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Chen CC, et al.

34561731,Are infectious reproductive pathogens of large ruminants a threat to improving food security? An investigation from Cambodia.,"In Cambodia, information on common pathogens causing reproductive losses in cattle and buffalo are lacking, despite there being a need to address livestock health to enhance food security. We analysed stored buffalo (n = 29) and cattle (n = 471) serum samples collected in 2016 using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Antibodies to Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo and Brucella abortus were detected in buffalo samples at 79.3% (95% CI 64.6-94.0), 3.4% (95% CI 0-10.0), 0% and 0%, respectively, and in cattle at 4.2% (95% CI 2.4-6.0), 6.4% (95% CI 4.2-8.6), 8.1% (95% CI 5.6-10.6) and 0%, respectively. The high N. caninum seroprevalence in buffalo was associated with increasing age, with buffalo having a 13.1% chance of being seropositive at birth, increasing to 99.4% by age 7 (p = 0.045). This suggests a predominance of horizontal transmission, possibly from exposure to faeces from free-roaming village dogs. Cattle L. interrogans serovar Hardjo seroprevalence was highest in Tbong Khmum province (20.4%) compared to other provinces (p < 0.001), and may be compromising bovine fertility and creating a zoonotic risk for smallholders who may contract leptospirosis from farm work. These high infection rates prompt further research to determine: to what extent these pathogens are linked to the low reproductive efficiency observed in large ruminants in Cambodia, the risk factors to pathogen exposure and appropriate strategies to reduce these risks. Low BVDV and B. abortus exposure is an important observation. Increasing large ruminant livestock trade into the country will require improved biosecurity and disease surveillance to prevent their emergence. An enhanced understanding of the status of infectious reproductive livestock pathogens in Cambodia can assist development projects to make evidence-based strategies to enhance cattle and buffalo health and improve food security.","['Olmo L', 'Reichel MP', 'Windsor PA', 'Suon S', 'Wahl LC', 'Thomson PC', 'Bush RD']",2021,53,5,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Olmo L, et al.

34513968,The Northern Ireland Control Programmes for Infectious Cattle Diseases Not Regulated by the EU.,"The disease control programmes for Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Johne's Disease (JD), Leptospirosis and Neosporosis are described including the approved diagnostic tools, diagnostic quality systems, and the role of vaccination (where appropriate). This paper describes the control programmes within NI, the challenges relating them, as well as assessing their impact and effectiveness, taking into consideration the quality of data available and number of herds participating. With the NI agricultural industry experiencing increasing financial pressures and post Brexit changes, the necessity of working to maximise the performance of bovine disease control programmes at the individual farm level as well as at the regional level is increasingly important. The programmes described fall into two categories with two distinct aims. Two managed by Animal Health & Welfare NI (AHWNI), the BVD eradication and JD Dairy Control programmes seek to eradicate or control infection at the regional level. A further 5 programmes, covering BVD, JD, IBR, Leptospirosis and Neosporosis, are managed by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) and focus on facilitating eradication or control at the individual herd level. These latter programmes conform to the Cattle Health Certification Standards (UK) (CHeCS) which is a UK self-regulatory body set up to ensure consistency between different disease control schemes across herds. The largest of all the programmes described is the AHWNI BVD Eradication Programme which has led to significant reductions in infection incidence. Compliance with it has been high with more than 97% of all cattle alive at the end of 2020 having a BVD test status. The rolling annual incidence of BVD virus positive calves has fallen by 56% since the start of the compulsory programme in 2016. This decrease has occurred largely through industry initiatives to deal with BVD positives, including the voluntary culling of persistently infected (PI) animals by herd owners, a voluntary abattoir ban on the slaughter of BVD virus (BVDv) positive animals, and the inclusion of retention of a BVDv positive animal as a non-conformance in the industry-run Farm Quality Assurance Scheme.","['Strain S', 'Verner S', 'Campbell E', 'Hodnik JJ', 'Santman-Berends IMGA']",2021,8,,Front Vet Sci,"Strain S, et al.

34509026,Identification of in vivo expressed proteins in live attenuated lipopolysaccharide mutant that mediates heterologous protection against Leptospira spp.,"Leptospirosis vaccines that elicit broad protection against a range of pathogenic Leptospira spp. would overcome a major drawback of currently licensed bacterin vaccines. Live attenuated vaccine produced from a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutant strain of L. interrogans serovar Manilae M1352 (Live M1352) stimulated better protective efficacy than heat killed M1352 (HK M1352) against a heterologous challenge with L. interrogans serovar Pomona. To identify antigens of Live M1352 potentially responsible for cross protection, in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT), a powerful tool to identify in vivo-induced (ivi) genes expressed during infection, was employed in this study. Pooled sera from hamsters immunized with Live M1352 were sequentially adsorbed with various preparations of in vitro grown M1352. The pre-adsorbed sera were used to screen a genomic expression library of M1352. Nineteen strongly reactive clones were selected for DNA sequencing. These ivi genes are conserved in most Leptospira strains. Four selected genes including LIMLP_04965 (tolB), LIMLP_01535, LIMLP_06785 (fliI), and LIMLP_14930 were confirmed for their upregulated expression in kidneys of infected hamsters by RT-qPCR, suggesting their role in leptospiral infection.

In the Netherlands, CPs are in place for six endemic cattle diseases: bovine viral diarrhea, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, salmonellosis, paratuberculosis, leptospirosis, and neosporosis. These CPs have been tailored to the specific situation in the Netherlands: a country with a high cattle density, a high rate of animal movements, a strong dependence on export of dairy products, and a high-quality data-infrastructure. The latter specifically applies to the dairy sector, which is the leading cattle sector in the Netherlands. When a herd enters a CP, generally the within-herd prevalence of infection is estimated in an initial assessment. The outcome creates awareness of the infection status of a herd and also provides an indication of the costs and time to achieve the preferred herd status. Subsequently, the herd enrolls in the control phase of the CP to, if present, eliminate the infection from a herd and a surveillance phase to substantiate the free or low prevalence status over time. The high-quality data infrastructure that results in complete and centrally registered census data on cattle movements provides the opportunity to design CPs while minimizing administrative efforts for the farmer. In the CPs, mostly routinely collected samples are used for surveillance. Where possible, requests for proof of the herd status are sent automatically. Automated detection of risk factors for introduction of new animals originating from a herd without the preferred herd status i.e., free or unsuspected, is in place using centrally registered data. The presented overview may inspire countries that want to develop cost-effective CPs for endemic diseases that are not (yet) regulated at EU level.","['Santman-Berends IMGA', 'Mars MH', 'Weber MF', 'van Duijn L', 'Waldeck HWF', 'Biesheuvel MM', 'van den Brink KMJA', 'Dijkstra T', 'Hodnik JJ', 'Strain SAJ', 'de Roo A', 'Veldhuis AMB', 'van Schaik G']",2021,8,,Front Vet Sci,"Santman-Berends IMGA, et al.

34481272,Bovine Genital Leptospirosis and reproductive disorders of live subfertile cows under field conditions.,"Bovine genital leptospirosis (BGL) is characterized by silent chronic reproductive disorders, most related to early embryonic death leading to estrus repetition, subfertility and abortions. However, most studies were conducted in slaughterhouses, which lacks reproductive and sanitary history of the studied animals. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of Leptospira sp. infection in live cows with history of low reproductive efficiency. Blood, urine, cervico-vaginal mucus and uterine fragment were collected from nine cows of the same herd presenting reproductive failure (abortions, estrus repetition and chronic infertility). Serology (MAT) and molecular analysis (PCR and nucleotide sequencing) were performed. Serology showed three (33.3%) seroreactive cows, two to Sejroe and one to Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroups. Six cows (66.7%) presented leptospiral DNA on genital samples, while all urine samples were negative. L. interrogans was identified in five samples, very closely related to strains from Sejroe (n = 3) and Icterohaemorrhagiae (n = 2) serogroups, while L. noguchii was identified in one sample. Results from this preliminary study demonstrates the presence of leptospires on uterus and reinforces the negative impact of leptospiral infection on reproductive tract, highlighting its association with reproductive failures on live animals.","['Aymée L', 'Gregg WRR', 'Loureiro AP', 'Di Azevedo MIN', 'Pedrosa JS', 'Melo JDSL', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'de Souza GN', 'Lilenbaum W']",2021,261,,Vet Microbiol,"Aymée L, et al.

34472784,Factors Affecting Maternal Outcome in Urban Setting (FAMOUS)-ICU Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women in India are at higher risk of dying as compared to middle to high income countries. Deaths can be prevented if risk factors are identified, critical illness is diagnosed early and timely care is provided. The present research was undertaken to study the clinical profile and factors affecting the outcome of pregnant and postpartum patients in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).
METHOD: A total of 75 consecutive patients of age &gt;18 years with confirmed pregnancy or postpartum females within 42 days from date of delivery requiring admission in ICU for at least one organ dysfunction as per APACHE II criteria1 were enrolled in the study. Clinical profiles of patients and outcomes were measured till hospital discharge.
RESULTS: Among 75 patients, 18(24%) patients were postpartum while 57(76%) were antepartum.The commonest symptom was fever (64%), followed by breathlessness (62.7%). Respiratory distress (58.7%) was the commonest indication for transfer to MICU. While 60(80%) patients were admitted for medical illnesses in pregnancy, 15(20%) patients were admitted for obstetric complications. Acute infections including malaria, dengue and leptospirosis were the commonest illness diagnosed in 19(25.3%) patients. Severity of illness measured using APACHE II score varied from 4 to 35 points with a mean score of 10.61.Longer duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention, lower pH, lower paO2/FiO2 ratio and serum bicarbonate, a diagnosis of tuberculosis and a higher APACHE II score were associated with a higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: With institution of intensive therapy in critically ill maternal patients, 80% of patients could be saved and 61% of fetuses had uneventful outcomes.The prognosis was better for obstetric illnesses than for medical illnesses with only 3 patients dying of obstetric causes whereas 12 patients died of medical illnesses common to the general population. Even though APACHE II score was higher in the group with obstetric conditions (mean=11 vs. 8.1), the mortality was lower.","['Sabesan S', 'Trivedi T', 'Shah P', 'Honrao S', 'Acharya P', 'Zope G', 'Panchal D', 'Karnik N']",2021,69,6,J Assoc Physicians India,"Sabesan S, et al.

34471713,"A participatory epidemiological investigation of causes of cattle abortion in Jimma zone, Ethiopia.","A participatory epidemiological study was conducted with cattle keepers in Jimma zone, Ethiopia, between October 2018 and October 2019 to identify the causes of abortion in cattle. Data collection involved 20 group discussions (each comprising 8-12 people) in 10 peasant associations. Methods used in group discussions included semi-structured interviews, pairwise ranking, matrix scoring, proportional piling, and seasonal calendar. The result of pairwise ranking identified brucellosis, leptospirosis, listeriosis, trypanosomosis, and Foot and mouth disease (FMD) in decreasing order as the most important causes of abortion in cattle. Mechanical or physical agents were also identified as less important non-infectious causes of cattle abortion in study areas. A very strong agreement (W = 0.880; P < 0.001) was observed among informant groups in pairwise ranking as to the most important cause of cattle abortion in study areas. Proportional piling showed that brucellosis was responsible for the highest proportion of abortions (39.9%) followed by leptospirosis (22.5%) and listeriosis (16.3%). A lesser proportion of abortion was attributed to trypanosomosis and FMD which comprise 11.6% and 9.7%, respectively. Matrix scoring showed strong agreement (W = 0.572 to 0.898; p < 0.001) concerning causes of abortion and its clinical signs between informant groups. According to the discussants, brucellosis and FMD tend to occur more frequently in the winter and spring seasons whereas listeriosis and trypanosomosis occurred frequently in the summer and autumn seasons, respectively. Strong agreement was observed among informant groups about the seasonal pattern of occurrence causes of abortion (W = 0.525-0.794; P < 0.001). Participants used medicinal plants and other traditional practices to manage cattle abortion in their areas. Farmers' knowledge should be incorporated to investigate health problems of unknown causes, designing, and implementing the intervention program in the areas.","['Gelalcha BD', 'Robi DT', 'Deressa FB']",2021,7,8,Heliyon,"Gelalcha BD, et al.

They were compared with Tamilnadu (TN) the southern province of India for the serovar and risk factor inconsistency. Serovar Ballum was reported to be prevalent (28.1 %) in Assam and Grippotyphosa (16.1 %) in Tamilnadu. The overall seropositivity observed was 36.8 %(206/560) from NER and 30.7 %(86/280) from TN. In this study, the higher seroprevalence was observed in pigs (42.6 %), cattle (39.8 %) and goats (26 %) in NER. Cattle (36.4 %) and goat (17.6 %) showed higher prevalence in TN. The presence of rodents in pig herds was found to be significant (P = 0.0088) in NER and it was for cattle in TN (P = 0.0063). We suggest that a program of rodent control should be included in the flock management practices aiming to reduce transmission of the leptospires.","['Saranya P', 'Goswami C', 'Sumathi K', 'Balasundareshwaran AH', 'Bothammal P', 'Dutta LJ', 'Muralitharan G', 'Bora DP', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2021,79,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Saranya P, et al.

34458546,Drivers of zoonotic disease risk in the Indian subcontinent: A scoping review.,"Literature on potential anthropogenic drivers of zoonotic disease risk in the Indian subcontinent is sparse. We conducted a scoping review to identify primary sources, published 2000-2020, to clarify what research exists and on which areas future research should focus. We summarised findings thematically by disease. Of 80 sources included, 78 (98%) were original research articles and two were conference abstracts. Study designs and methods were not always clearly described, but 74 (93%) were quantitative (including one randomised trial), five (6%) were mixed-methods, and one was qualitative. Most sources reported research from India (39%) or Bangladesh (31%), followed by Pakistan (9%), Nepal (9%), Bhutan and Sri Lanka (6% each). Topically, most focused on rabies (18; 23%), Nipah virus (16; 20%) or leptospirosis (11; 14%), while 12 (15%) did not focus on a disease but instead on knowledge in communities. People generally did not seek post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies even when vaccination programmes were available and they understood that rabies was fatal, instead often relying on traditional medicines. Similarly, people did not take precautions to protect themselves from leptospirosis infection, even when they were aware of the link with rice cultivation. Nipah was correlated with presence of bats near human habitation. Official information on diseases, modes of transmission and prevention was lacking, or shared informally between friends, relatives, and neighbours. Behaviour did not correspond to disease knowledge. This review identifies various human behaviours which may drive zoonotic disease risk in the Indian subcontinent. Increasing community knowledge and awareness alone is unlikely to be sufficient to successfully change these behaviours. Further research, using interdisciplinary and participatory methods, would improve understanding of risks and risk perceptions and thus help in co-designing context-specific, relevant interventions.","['Durrance-Bagale A', 'Rudge JW', 'Singh NB', 'Belmain SR', 'Howard N']",2021,13,,One Health,"Durrance-Bagale A, et al.

Blood samples from 216 cows from nine herds were collected for a Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), and a reproductive follow-up with ultrasonography was carried out monthly for at least 12 months. A total of 75 (16.5%) cows were reactive, while seroreactivity to a herd level ranged from 16.0% to 52.8%. Out of the nine herds, in five (55.0%) Sejroe was found to be the predominant serogroup and in four (45.0%) it was Icterohaemorrhagiae. The major reproductive problems identified were embryonic death (ED) and abortions. All herds presented ED and abortion was observed in three (33.3%). Herds with high seroreactivity (>20%) had more reproductive problems. Those with a predominance of Sejroe were associated with ED (P < 0.05), while those with Icterohaemorrhagiae were associated with abortion. The results show that different leptospiral strains lead to different reproductive problems, as well as showing that the main problem - ED - is caused by leptospirosis, particularly for those determined by strains of the serogroup Sejroe.","['Muniz Oliveira GD', 'Nogueira Garcia LA', 'Aymée Pires Soares L', 'Lilenbaum W', 'Nunes de Souza G']",2021,174,,Theriogenology,"Muniz Oliveira GD, et al.

Simultaneously, the semen of all bulls was subjected to sperm viability analysis and PCR based on the 16S rRNA gene. PCR-positive results of semen samples were confirmed by sequencing. A modified seminal plasma agglutination (MSPA) test, replacing the blood serum of all bulls in the MAT with seminal plasma was performed as well. Eight (8/203 = 3.9%) semen samples from bulls were considered nonviable (necrospermia and azoospermia) without relation to the PCR diagnosis. No agglutinin titers were identified in MSPA test. A high frequency (132/203 = 65%) of leptospiral agglutinin titers was identified in the MAT, particularly for the Sejroe serogroup (Hardjo CTG, 100/203 = 49.3%; Wolffi 74/203 = 36.4%; Guaricura 72/203 = 35.5%; and Hardjoprajitno 56/203 = 27.6%). Three (3/203 = 1.5%) semen samples of bulls were positive in the PCR, but these results were not confirmed by sequencing. The high frequency of serovars from the Sejroe serogroup typically adapted to bovines indicates the need for measures for the prophylaxis/control of the pathogen on the sampled farms. Discrepancies among the MAT, sperm viability, and molecular detection of leptospires in semen highlight the need for a combination of methods to diagnose leptospirosis in bovine bulls. To our knowledge, modified seminal plasma agglutination is described for the first time here to investigate anti-Leptospira antibodies produced locally in the genital tract in the diagnosis of bovine leptospirosis among bulls that reproduce by natural means.","['Maiolino SR', 'Cortez A', 'Langoni H', 'Giuffrida R', 'Dos Santos JR', 'de Nardi Júnior G', 'Lara GHB', 'Motta RG', 'Chacur MGM', 'Monteiro FM', 'Heinemann MB', 'de Souza Filho AF', 'de Souza Araújo Martins L', 'Bello TS', 'Ribeiro MG']",2021,52,4,Braz J Microbiol,"Maiolino SR, et al.

The assessment of the febrile child returning from international travel is a diagnostic challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected international travel and made evaluation and management of the sick returned traveler more challenging. Children visiting friends and relatives abroad remain at higher risk of infection compared to tourists. This review presents a guidance on the initial assessment of a traveling febrile child including interpretation of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Important clues to etiology include exposure to different infectious agents, incubation periods of pathogens, and prophylaxis regimens and vaccines received. Early identification of potentially life-threatening and highly contagious infections is essential.

34403427,Leptospirosis as a cause of fever associated with jaundice in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.,"BACKGROUND: Fever with jaundice is a common symptom of some infectious diseases. In public health surveillance within the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), yellow fever is the only recognized cause of fever with jaundice. However, only 5% of the surveillance cases are positive for yellow fever and thus indicate the involvement of other pathogens. Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a widespread bacterial zoonosis, a known cause of fever with jaundice. This study aimed to determine the seropositivity of anti-Leptospira antibodies among suspected yellow fever cases and map the geographical distribution of possible leptospirosis in the DRC.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using 1,300 samples from yellow fever surveillance in the DRC from January 2017 to December 2018. Serum samples were screened for the presence of IgM against Leptospira spp. by a whole cell-based IgM ELISA (Patoc-IgM ELISA) at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in Kinshasa (INRB) according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidance. Exploratory univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were undertaken to assess associations between socio-demographic factors and the presence of Leptospira IgM.
RESULTS: Of the 1,300 serum samples screened, 88 (7%) showed evidence of IgM against Leptospira spp. Most positive cases (34%) were young adult males in the 20-29-year group. There were statistically significant associations between having Leptospira IgM antibodies, age, sex, and living area. Observed positive cases were mostly located in urban settings, and the majority lived in the province of Kinshasa. There was a statistically significant association between seasonality and IgM Leptospira spp. positivity amongst those living in Kinshasa, where most of the positive cases occurred during the rainy season.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that leptospirosis is likely an overlooked cause of unexplained cases of fever with jaundice in the DRC and highlights the need to consider leptospirosis in the differential diagnosis of fever with jaundice, particularly in young adult males. Further studies are needed to identify animal reservoirs, associated risk factors, and the burden of human leptospirosis in the DRC.","['Mukadi Kakoni P', 'Munyeku Bazitama Y', 'Nepomuceno JR', 'Pukuta-Simbu E', 'Kawhata Mawika F', 'Kashitu Mujinga G', 'Palla L', 'Ahuka-Mundeke S', 'Muyembe Tamfum JJ', 'Koizumi N', 'Kubo Y', 'Ariyoshi K', 'Smith C']",2021,15,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Mukadi Kakoni P, et al.

34400016,Protective efficacy of whole-cell inactivated Leptospira vaccines made using virulent or avirulent strains in a hamster model.,"Whole-cell inactivated vaccines remain the only licensed vaccines used to control human and animal leptospirosis worldwide. Although they are protective against lethal infections, the efficacy of these vaccines has been divergent. The manufacturing process often involves the use of standard bacterial strains subjected to serial in vitro passages, with a risk of loss of virulence, and may affect the immunogenicity and consequently decrease protection. Thus, the objective of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of the efficacy of in-house bacterins produced with standard (avirulent) and virulent strains. Hamsters were immunized with killed bacteria produced using avirulent and virulent strains of L. interrogans serovars Copenhageni and Canicola. Vaccine efficacy was determined in terms of protection against lethal homologous or heterologous challenges. The results showed that immunization with both avirulent and virulent Canicola strains resulted in 100% protection against homologous challenge. Conversely, Copenhageni bacterins produced using an avirulent strain conferred only 25-37.5% protection against homologous challenge (P > 0.05), while virulent Copenhageni bacterin conferred 100% protection (P < 0.001). A single vaccine dose was sufficient to induce protection, and administration of a prime boost significantly reduced the bacterial load in the kidneys and improved the humoral immune response to the virulent Copenhageni strain. These findings suggest that the maintenance of virulent strains in bacterin formulations is essential for improving the immunogenicity and efficacy of leptospirosis vaccines.","['Rodrigues de Oliveira N', 'Jorge S', 'Andrade Colares Maia M', 'Thurow Bunde T', 'Kurz Pedra AC', 'Pinto Seixas Neto AC', 'Larré Oliveira T', 'Dellagostin OA']",2021,39,39,Vaccine,"Rodrigues de Oliveira N, et al.

It is known that following activation, key tyrosines are phosphorylated in the intracytoplasmic domains of WC1 molecules and that the cells fail to respond when WC1 is knocked down or, as shown here, when physically separated from the TCR. Based on these results we hypothesized that the colocalization of WC1 and TCR will occur following cellular activation thereby allowing signaling to ensue. We evaluated the spatio-temporal dynamics of their interaction using imaging flow cytometry and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy.

Thus, this study aimed to assess knowledge and perception of the community about potential causes of abortion and case-control study of brucellosis as a cause of abortion in cattle of study districts.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2016 and October 2017 in selected districts of the Jimma zone using a questionnaire survey. Based on the questionnaire survey, we also carried out a case-control study (141 cases and 282 controls) to confirm whether the most frequently mentioned disease (brucellosis) is associated with abortion. The blood samples were collected from both cases and controls cattle groups and then serum was separated. The presence of antibody against Brucella organism in serum was first tested by Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and all RBPT positive samples were confirmed using the Complement Fixation Test (CFT).
RESULTS: From a total of 180 randomly selected respondents, the majority (59.4%) of them attributed abortion to infectious diseases. Based on the questionnaire survey, brucellosis, leptospirosis and listeriosis were identified as the major infectious causes of abortion in the areas. Physical injuries, shortage of feed and toxic substances were observed as less important non-infection causes of abortion in the study areas. This study also identified improper disposal of aborted materials and birth products, use of communal bulls, sharing communal grazing areas and water sources which favour disease transmission. Exposure to Brucella organism was higher among cases (6.4%) than controls (2.8%) with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.042).
CONCLUSION: Brucellosis is the most important infectious cause of cattle abortion in this study. Thus, important to conduct appropriate control methods and increasing public awareness of the zoonotic transmission of brucellosis are suggested. This finding also recommended the need for further study to isolate and characterise brucellosis as a cause of abortion in cattle.","['Robi DT', 'Gelalcha BD', 'Deresa FB']",2021,7,6,Vet Med Sci,"Robi DT, et al.

34388889,Eco-epidemiological scaling of Leptospirosis: Vulnerability mapping and early warning forecasts.,"Infectious disease epidemics are plaguing the world and a lot of research is focused on the development of models to reproduce disease dynamics for eco-environmental and biological investigation, and disease management. Leptospirosis is an example of a neglected zoonosis strongly mediated by ecohydrological dynamics with emerging endemic and epidemic patterns worldwide in both animal and human populations. By accounting for large heterogeneities of affected areas we show how exponential endemics and scale-free epidemics are largely predictable and linked to common socio-environmental features via scaling laws with different exponents that inform about vulnerability factors. This led to the development of a novel pattern-oriented integrated model that can be used as an early-warning signal (EWS) tool for endemic-epidemic regime classification, risk determinant attribution, and near real-time forecast of outbreaks. Forecasts are grounded on expected outbreak recurrence time dependent on exceedance probabilities and statistical EWS that sense outbreak onset. A stochastic spatially-explicit model is shown to comprehensively predict outbreak dynamics (early sensing, timing, magnitude, decay, and eco-environmental determinants) and derive a spreading factor characterizing endemics and epidemics, where average over maximum rainfall is the critical factor characterizing disease transitions. Dynamically, case cross-correlation considering neighboring communities senses 2-weeks in advance outbreaks. Eco-environmental scaling relationships highlight how predicted host suitability and topographic index can be used as epidemiological footprints to effectively distinguish and control Leptospirosis regimes and areas dependent on hydro-climatological dynamics as the main trigger. The spatio-temporal scale-invariance of epidemics - underpinning persistent criticality and neutrality or independence among areas - is emphasized by the high accuracy in reproducing sequence and magnitude of cases via reliable surveillance. Further investigations of robustness and universality of eco-environmental determinants are required; nonetheless a comprehensive and computationally simple EWS method for the full characterization of Leptospirosis is provided. The tool is extendable to other climate-sensitive zoonoses to define vulnerability factors and predict outbreaks useful for optimal disease risk prevention and control.","['Convertino M', 'Reddy A', 'Liu Y', 'Munoz-Zanzi C']",2021,799,,Sci Total Environ,"Convertino M, et al.

34375345,Longitudinal analysis to characterize classes and subclasses of antibody responses to recombinant receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in Thailand.,"Serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might contribute to confirming the suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients not detected with molecular assays. Human antibodies that target the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-binding domain of the viral spike protein are a target for serodiagnosis and therapeutics. This study aimed to characterize the classes and subclasses of antibody responses to a recombinant receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients and investigated the reactivity of these antibodies in patients with other tropical infections and healthy individuals in Thailand. ELISAs for IgM, IgA, IgG and IgG subclasses based on RBD antigen were developed and tested with time series of 27 serum samples from 15 patients with COVID-19 and 60 samples from pre-COVID-19 outbreaks including acute dengue fever, murine typhus, influenza, leptospirosis and healthy individuals. Both RBD-specific IgA and IgG were detected in only 21% of the COVID-19 patients in the acute phase. The median IgA and IgG levels were significantly higher in the convalescent serum sample compared to the acute serum sample (P < 0.05). We observed the highest correlation between levels of IgG and IgA (rho = 0. 92). IgG1 and IgG3 were the major IgG subclasses detected in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Only acute IgG3 level was negatively associated with viral detection based on RT-PCR of ORF1ab gene (rho = -0.57). The median IgA and IgG levels in convalescence sera of COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than healthy individuals and convalescent sera of other febrile infectious patients. The analyses of antibody classes and subclasses provide insights into human immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 during natural infection and interpretation of antibody assays.","['Tandhavanant S', 'Koosakunirand S', 'Kaewarpai T', 'Piyaphanee W', 'Leaungwutiwong P', 'Luvira V', 'Chantratita N']",2021,16,8,PLoS One,"Tandhavanant S, et al.

34345127,Leptospirosis in Intensive Care Unit.,"Tropical infections constitute 20 - 30% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in developing countries. Leptospirosis is a spectrum with mild form presenting as an acute febrile illness with jaundice, complicating in few as acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The poor prognostic markers are hemorrhagic ARDS, acute renal failure, DIC, severe metabolic acidosis, older age, chronic alcohol abuse, high SOFA score, and septic shock. The confirmatory diagnosis relies on antibody testing, such as microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and IgM ELISA, while the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test being reserved for clinically suspected antibody negative cases. The spectrum of multi-organ involvement necessitates a complete hematological, biochemical workup, including electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and two-dimensional echocardiography. Specific antimicrobial therapy consists of the following-benzylpenicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and doxycycline. The reported mortality ranges from 6% to as high as 44%. Various ICU scores like SPiRO, THAI LEPTO score, and Faine's criteria have been useful in risk stratification. Optimizing intensive care treatment with appropriate antibiotics, lung protection ventilation strategies, strict fluid management, and if need be timely initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) helps in reducing mortality.

(3) Microscopic agglutination test is considered the gold standard for diagnosing leptospirosis; however, now IgM ELISA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are more frequently used for diagnosis. (4) Tuberculosis is diagnosed with the help of nucleic acid amplification tests like Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra which also detects rifampicin resistance. Other tests include microscopy, Lowenstein-Jensen and mycobacteria growth indicator tube culture, line probe assay. (5) Tropical rickettsial infections are diagnosed by serological reactions (Weil-Felix, ELISA for antibodies) and PCR. (6) For Brucellosis culture from blood, bone marrow or tissue specimens remain the mainstay in diagnosis. (7) Dengue, Zika, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, hantavirus, rabies are diagnosed with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Serological tests like IgM ELISA or paired sera samples for IgG are also used for diagnosis.

34342523,Outreach Medicine as an Experiential Teaching Tool to Improve Veterinary Student and Client Education.,"Outreach medicine is used to improve students' medical, technical, behavioral, and communication training among health professional schools; it is also used in veterinary schools, but little has been described on its educational impacts among pre-clinical veterinary students. Aiming to train practice-ready graduates, we established a monthly nonprofit vaccine clinic serving low-income clients to provide pre-clinical veterinary students with a realistic experiential learning environment. We developed surveys to assess the educational impacts of outreach medicine on pre-clinical veterinary student and client education. We received 101 student surveys, 26 educator (i.e., veterinarians and registered veterinary technicians) surveys, and 96 client surveys. Veterinarians, students, and technicians reported that students improved in important veterinary skills such as client communication, subcutaneous injection, patient handling, and physical examination. They also reported improved confidence in students' clinical decision making. Veterinarians valued the vaccine clinic as a favorable educational tool to teach behavior assessment and low-stress handling, and they highlighted that experiential learning via the vaccine clinic provided students with a clinical experience representative of most veterinarian practices (i.e., small animal general practitioner). Clients reported that the clinic's students and veterinarians greatly improved their knowledge of their pets' care and vaccines-notably, their knowledge of rabies and leptospirosis improved. Outreach medicine in the form of a vaccine clinic creates valuable experiential learning opportunities that increase veterinary student preparedness and complement didactic, laboratory, and case-based teaching.","['Kim J', 'Rinke EJ', 'Matusicky ME', 'Millward LM']",2022,49,5,J Vet Med Educ,"Kim J, et al.

34336315,Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis with Leptospirosis: A Rare but Devastating Complication.,"INTRODUCTION: Secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), often associated with an array of infections, malignancies, and autoimmune diseases, is rarely seen with leptospirosis, which carries a relatively poor prognosis even with modern state-of-the-art medical care. We describe a patient with leptospirosis complicated by sHLH who succumbed to illness following multiorgan dysfunction. 
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease in the tropics with significant morbidity and mortality. In the case of severe leptospirosis, overlapping clinical features with sHLH make the diagnosis of the latter challenging. No assessment tools are available to date to predict the risk of developing sHLH in a patient having leptospirosis. Outcome following sHLH due to leptospirosis still remains majorly ominous. A high index of suspicion and low threshold for specific investigations could possibly alter the outcome following such an occurrence.","['Munasinghe BM', 'Arambepola AG', 'Pathirage N', 'Fernando UPM', 'Subramaniam N', 'Nimalan S', 'Gajanthan T']",2021,2021,,Case Rep Infect Dis,"Munasinghe BM, et al.

Protein and peptide microarrays now provide a rapid, high-throughput platform for immunological testing and validation of potential antigens and B-cell epitopes. However, there is still a need for tools to prioritize and select relevant probes when designing these arrays. In this work we describe a computational method called APRANK (Antigenic Protein and Peptide Ranker) which integrates multiple molecular features to prioritize potentially antigenic proteins and peptides in a given pathogen proteome. These features include subcellular localization, presence of repetitive motifs, natively disordered regions, secondary structure, transmembrane spans and predicted interaction with the immune system. We trained and tested this method with a number of bacteria and protozoa causing human diseases: ","['Ricci AD', 'Brunner M', 'Ramoa D', 'Carmona SJ', 'Nielsen M', 'Agüero F']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Ricci AD, et al.

34320613,An evaluation of diagnostic tests in a case series of suspected leptospirosis patients seen in primary care.,"AIMS: This study describes 47 presentations of suspected leptospirosis in general practice in New Zealand. Our primary aim was to assess the laboratory diagnosis of leptospirosis in these patients, by comparing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and culture results.
METHODS: Patients suspected of leptospirosis were recruited from general practices in the Waikato (n=17) and Wairoa (n=30) between August 2011 and June 2015. Blood and urine samples were tested for leptospirosis at two diagnostic laboratories and one research laboratory using PCR tests, MAT and culture.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were recruited for this study: 37 during the acute phase of the illness (within 10 days of symptom onset) and 10 after the acute phase. Eleven of the acute phase patients (11/37, 30%) and two of the later phase patients (2/10, 20%) returned positive leptospirosis test results. The 11 acute phase leptospirosis positive patients had the following positive diagnostic tests: PCR and paired MAT (+/- blood culture) (n=3), PCR only (+/- blood culture) (n=4), paired MAT only (n=3) and blood culture only (n=1). Urine PCR (performed only on Wairoa patients) was the only positive test for two of these patients.
CONCLUSION: About a quarter of farm workers and meat workers presenting to general practice with flu-like symptoms will have leptospirosis, but they will not be diagnosed unless appropriately tested, and then they may only test positive for some of the tests available. To increase the likelihood of making a diagnosis, clinicians should order multiple laboratory tests, including blood and urine PCR and a paired MAT.","['Earl L', 'Fang F', 'Janes R', 'Gedye K', 'French N', 'Collins-Emerson J', 'Benschop J']",2021,134,1539,N Z Med J,"Earl L, et al.

METHODS: Review of suspected leptospirosis cases referred to the reference laboratory from hospitals in the Hawke's Bay region between March 2003 and March 2012. Inclusion criteria were IgM positivity and diagnosis confirmed with either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or microscopic agglutination test (MAT). A retrospective systematic review of case notes was completed for demographic and laboratory data.
RESULTS: Forty-three cases were included. Most common presenting symptoms were pyrexia (93%), myalgia, and headache (both 86%). 93% of patients worked in the farming or meat industries. The most common biochemical abnormalities were elevated CRP (100%) and abnormal urinalysis (93%). There was no difference in disease severity between icteric and anicteric patients. Compared to other studies, patients in New Zealand have less severe disease.
CONCLUSION: Contrary to popular understanding, this study has not found icteric leptospirosis to be related to more severe disease. Anicteric leptospirosis should be a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with pyrexia, myalgia, and headache who have elevated CRP and abnormal urinalysis.","['Sellors P', 'Watson RF', 'Bate R', 'Bentham GL', 'Haigh K']",2021,2021,,J Trop Med,"Sellors P, et al.

Identifying a case of leptospirosis in Switzerland is uncommon. Although kidney complications are frequent in severe forms, including tubular dysfunction, observing this complication is rare in our country. We report the case of a patient with leptospirosis and kidney dysfunction, which was notable for proximal tubulopathy. This case report describes the diagnosis and management of this patient's tubular dysfunction.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old Caucasian male known for alcohol and drug abuse presented to our emergency department suffering from severe pain in the lower limbs, jaundice, and fever with flu-like symptoms. Physical examination was not contributory. Blood tests showed cytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, acute kidney injury, and altered liver function tests with predominant cholestasis. Urinalysis showed proteinuria and significant glycosuria without concomitant hyperglycemia. Leptospirosis was suspected and confirmed by both positive serum polymerase chain reaction and elevated immunoglobulin M for Leptospira interrogans. The patient was treated with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate and doxycycline for 7 days. After antibiotic treatment, symptoms disappeared, and kidney dysfunction completely resolved.

34287302,Pica (Allotriophagy): An Underestimated Risk Factor for Severe Leptospirosis (Weil's Diseases)? Report of a Leptospira Septic Shock Successfully Managed with ECMO.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by infection with pathogenic strains of the bacterium Leptospira. The disease can be complicated by pulmonary hemorrhages and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with the mortality rate increasing to 51-100%. We report the case of a 37-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency department with a 6-day history of fever, weakness, vomiting and diarrhea, followed by jaundice. On admission, he presented leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and acute liver and kidney injuries. His clinical course was critical, as it was immediately complicated by sepsis and severe respiratory failure, requiring haemodialysis, mechanical ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In the following days, a veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was started due to a dramatic deterioration in respiratory function; 20 h later, it was switched to veno-arterial ECMO because of refractory cardiogenic shock. Hantavirus or Leptospira infection etiology was suspected, so penicillin G and methylprednisolone were initiated as an empirical therapy and subsequently confirmed after a laboratory diagnosis of leptospirosis. Although the clinical course was further complicated by hemorrhagic pneumonia, a gradual, full recovery occurred, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. After excluding other sources of contact with Leptospira-infected material, an unsuspected abnormal eating behavior was identified as the most probable cause of the patient's Leptospira infection.","['Fabiani A', 'Dal Bo E', 'Di Bella S', 'Gabrielli M', 'Bologna A', 'Albert U', 'Sanson G']",2021,13,3,Infect Dis Rep,"Fabiani A, et al.

34273371,Biomacromolecules of chitosan - Bacopa saponin based LipL32 gene delivery system for leptospirosis therapy.,"Leptospirosis is a severe bacterial infectious disease caused by the organisms belonging to the genus of Leptospira. The chitosan/Bacopa saponin/tripolyphosphate (CS/BS/TPP) nanoparticles conjugated with recombinant DNA vaccines were designed against Leptospirosis. Chitosan, a polysaccharide is suitable for delivery of drug, and gene due to its bio-compatible and biodegradable properties. Bacopa saponins are used for the induction of the immune response against microbial infections. The recombinant DNA vaccine construct was composed of the leptospiral outer membrane LipL32 gene tagged with EGFP and hGMCSF adjuvant in the pVAX1 mammalian expression vector along with the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. These recombinant DNA vaccine constructs was termed as pVAX1-EGFP-LipL32 and pVAX1-EGFP-hGMCSF-LipL32, and these constructs were conjugated with CS/BS/TPP nanoparticles by using the ionic gelation technique. Thus, CS/BS/TPP conjugated nanoparticle DNA vaccine was confirmed by functionality (FT-IR), crystalline nature (XRD) and surface charge (Zeta potential). The 90% encapsulation efficiency was observed in the conjugated nanoparticle DNA vaccine. In contrast, cell viability analysis validated that the synthesized DNA conjugated CS/BS/TPP nanoparticles showed low cytotoxicity up to 10 mg/mL. The results showed here are the initial establishment of DNA vaccine conjugated nanoparticles, which can be used as a potential anti-leptospiral vaccine.","['Govindan P', 'Pitchaikani S', 'Kandasamy S', 'Rajan M', 'Shakila H', 'Eed EM', 'Elfasakhany A', 'Pugazhendhi A']",2021,202,,Environ Res,"Govindan P, et al.

34272435,The role of leptospiremia and specific immune response in severe leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis can cause a high mortality rate, especially in severe cases. This multicenter cross-sectional study aimed to examine both host and pathogen factors that might contribute to the disease severity. A total of 217 leptospirosis patients were recruited and divided into two groups of non-severe and severe. Severe leptospirosis was defined by a modified sequential organ failure assessment (mSOFA) score of more than two or needed for mechanical ventilation support or had pulmonary hemorrhage or death. We found that leptospiremia, plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) at the first day of enrollment (day 1) and microscopic agglutination test (MAT) titer at 7 days after enrollment (days 7) were significantly higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group. After adjustment for age, gender, and the days of fever, there were statistically significant associations of baseline leptospiremia level (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.23-2.34, p = 0.001), pNGAL (OR 9.46, 95% CI 4.20-21.33, p < 0.001), and IL-6 (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.96-4.07, p < 0.001) with the severity. In conclusion, a high leptospiremia, pNGAL, and IL-6 level at baseline were associated with severe leptospirosis.","['Limothai U', 'Lumlertgul N', 'Sirivongrangson P', 'Kulvichit W', 'Tachaboon S', 'Dinhuzen J', 'Chaisuriyong W', 'Peerapornratana S', 'Chirathaworn C', 'Praditpornsilpa K', 'Eiam-Ong S', 'Tungsanga K', 'Srisawat N']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Limothai U, et al.

Stray dogs have been postulated to play a role in disease transmission; however, supporting information are still limited. Roaming behavior may not only predispose the dogs to infection, but could also contribute to disease spread. In this study, the susceptibility of urban stray dogs in shedding Leptospira spp. was determined. Blood, urine, and tissue samples of kidney and liver were collected from 100 dogs from 2 animal control facilities. Serological testing using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) were performed on blood against 20 leptospiral serovars with a cut-off titre of ≥ 1:100. Samples were cultured onto semi-solid Ellinghausen and McCullough modified by Johnson and Harris (EMJH) media. Isolates were identified using molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 2 primers (16s rRNA and LipL32) and hyperimmune serum (HIS) MAT. The seroprevalence for the dogs positive for leptospirosis was 32% (n=32/100) with the following detected serovars: Javanica (n=13), Bataviae (n=10), Icterohaemorrhagiae (n=3), Autumnalis (n=2), Canicola (n=1), Pyrogenes (n=1), Copenhageni (n=1), and Australis (n=1). Six Leptospira spp. isolated were procured from urine (n=2), kidney (n=2) and liver (n=2). All 6 isolates belonged to L. interrogans, a pathogenic variant of Leptospira spp. Serotyping and phylogenetic analysis suggested serovar Bataviae (n=5) and serovar Canicola (n=1). Presence of vaccinal serovars (Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola) suggested potential post-vaccination antibodies but the predominance of non-vaccinal serovars (Javanica and Bataviae) indicate the possibility of current infection or post-exposure. Isolation of Leptospira spp. directly from urine sample not only suggested an active infection but highlighted the potential shedding capability among these stray dogs. These findings further strengthen speculations that urban stray dogs could play a role in transmission and dissemination of leptospirosis through their constant movement. The urine of infected dogs may contaminate the environment, posing a major public health threat.","['Goh SH', 'Khor KH', 'Radzi R', 'Lau SF', 'Khairani-Bejo S', 'Abdul Rahman MS', 'Roslan MA']",2021,45,,Top Companion Anim Med,"Goh SH, et al.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in accelerating the reduction of serum creatinine in patients with leptospirosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a clinical trial study involving 64 patients with leptospirosis, with microscopic agglutination tests used to confirm the diagnosis of acute kidney injury. NAC was given to patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml/min at 1200 mg every 12 h, and it lasted for 48 h. Next, 32 patients were measured and the relationship between the length of hospitalization, age, and sex was also examined. Additionally, the two groups of case and control were compared in terms of the rate of decrease in serum creatinine level in three different time periods. The Shapro-Wilk test was used to investigate the distribution of data.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the decrease in serum creatinine level on the first, third, and seventh days of hospitalization and also in the use of NAC between the case and control groups (P = 0.255). In addition, the use of NAC had no significant effect on reducing the length of hospitalization (P = 0.067).
CONCLUSION: Recovery of acute kidney injury following leptospirosis and drugs that accelerate the healing process in these patients require further studies with greater sample size and longer follow-up time.","['Davoodi L', 'Ebrahimi NR', 'Izadyar H', 'Moradi S', 'Razavi A', 'Zakariaei Z', 'Soleymani E']",2021,67,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Davoodi L, et al.

We evaluated 156 laboratory- or clinically confirmed leptospirosis cases. The overall seroprevalence of S. stercoralis was 32.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 27.4-36.5%, 50/156). Seropositivity was significantly associated with agricultural activities (odds ratio (OR): 2.84, 95% CI: 1.0-8.77) and gastrointestinal disorders (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-4.9). Laboratory findings indicated that seropositivity of S. stercoralis was significantly associated with decreased levels of platelet and elevated levels of creatinine, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (P < 0.05). Our findings suggested a higher exposure to S. stercoralis larvae among patients with leptospirosis.

This study proposes actions to better characterise cases of acute hepatitis in Brazil and to provide relevant information to institutionalised health policies within the Unified Health System. Available data on acute hepatitis in Brazil need to be re-evaluated regarding the different hepatotropic agent (hepatitis A to E virus) frequencies, as well as other agents that can cause similar clinical conditions, such as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2(HSV1, HSV2), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Human Herpes Virus 6 and 7 (HHV6, HHV7), arbovirus (yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, Zika), parvovirus B19, adenovirus, parechovirus, enterovirus, HIV, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis and syphilis, in addition to autoimmune hepatitis. In this context, the primary aim of this study is the clinical-epidemiological and molecular characterisation of acute viral hepatitis in Brazilian health services from all geographical regions of the country. The present article describes the study protocol.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will evaluate 2280 patients with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of acute liver disease in Brazilian health institutions in all five geographic Brazilian regions. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data will be collected, as well as blood samples to be analysed at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein Clinical Laboratory.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained at the national research ethics committee (Conselho Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa- CONEP-CAAE 00952818.4.1001.0071) and at all participating sites.

The objectives of this review are to inform wilderness medicine providers about the environmental conditions that can precipitate rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; to describe the regional geographic distributions of rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America; and to recommend prophylactic treatments and effective prevention and control strategies for rodent-borne infectious diseases. To meet these objectives, Internet search engines were queried with keywords to identify scientific articles on outbreaks of the most common regional rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America. Wilderness medicine providers should maintain high levels of suspicion for regional rodent-borne diseases in patients who develop febrile illnesses after exposure to contaminated freshwater after heavy rains or floods and after swimming, rafting, or paddling in endemic areas. Public health education strategies should encourage limiting human contact with rodents; avoiding contact with or safely disposing of rodent excreta; avoiding contact with contaminated floodwaters, especially contact with open wounds; securely containing outdoor food stores; and modifying wilderness cabins and campsites to deter rodent colonization.",['Diaz JH'],2021,32,3,Wilderness Environ Med,Diaz JH.

34197457,"Optimizing the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) panel for the diagnosis of Leptospirosis in a low resource, hyper-endemic setting with varied microgeographic variation in reactivity.","The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the standard serological reference test for the diagnosis of leptospirosis, despite being a technically demanding and laborious procedure. The use of a locally optimised MAT panel is considered essential for proper performance and interpretation of results. This paper describes the procedure of selecting such an optimised panel for Sri Lanka, a country hyper-endemic for leptospirosis. MAT was performed using 24 strains on 1132 serum samples collected from patients presenting with acute undifferentiated fever. Of 24 strains, 15 were selected as the optimised panel, while only 11% of serum samples showed positivity. A geographical variation in predominantly reactive serovars was observed, whereas reactivity was low with the saprophytic strain Patoc. Testing with paired sera yielded a higher sensitivity but provided only a retrospective diagnosis. Serological tests based on ELISA with complementary molecular diagnosis using PCR are a feasible and robust alternative approach to diagnose leptospirosis in countries having a higher burden of the disease.","['Jayasundara D', 'Gamage C', 'Senavirathna I', 'Warnasekara J', 'Matthias MA', 'Vinetz JM', 'Agampodi S']",2021,15,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Jayasundara D, et al.

METHODS: Leptospirosis cases and deaths, population and precipitation were recovered from different databases (2007-2019). Annual incidence, mortality and case fatality rates (CFRs) of human leptospirosis and average precipitation were calculated for Brazil and its regions. Time series analysis using an moving average with external variable (ARMAX) model was used to analyse the monthly contribution and precipitation influence over leptospirosis cases for each Brazilian region and for the whole country. A forecast model to predict cases for 2020 was created for Brazil.
RESULTS: Human leptospirosis exhibited heterogeneous distribution among Brazilian regions, with most cases occurring during the rainy season and precipitation influenced the disease occurrence in all regions but the South. The forecast model predicted 3276.99 cases for 2020 (mean absolute percentage error 14.680 and root mean square error 53.013). Considering the annual average for the period, the leptospirosis incidence was 1913 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, mortality was 0.168 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants and the CFR was 8.83%.
CONCLUSIONS: The models built can be useful for planning leptospirosis surveillance and control actions for the whole country and its regions and, together with the health indicators, revealed no uniform epidemiological situation of leptospirosis in Brazil.","['Costa ACTRB', 'Pereira CR', 'Sáfadi T', 'Heinemann MB', 'Dorneles EMS']",2022,116,2,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Costa ACTRB, et al.

Aiming at assessing the potential infection risks via recreational exposure, the molecular prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira in 14 amenity forests in five selected districts of the state of Perak was determined. Water and soil samples along streams and waterfalls were subjected to culture of leptospires and the pathogenic Leptospira spp. was detected by lipL32-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty out of 154 samples (13%) that tested positive for leptospires were mostly soils and still water recorded with tolerable temperatures (22.2- 26.5°C) and pHs (5.73-6.70). The localised prevalence was highly varied among eight positive forests (6.7-41.7%), particularly higher in Kampar and Kinta districts which are the more populated urban areas. The importance of public health surveillance should not be underrated given the high prevalence of Leptospira spp. in forests in close proximity to indigenous settlements, even where the places are clean.

Exaggerated immune response may promote tissue damage that lead to severe disease outcome. In this study TNF, IL-10, sTNFR1 levels were measured among sixty-two hospitalized leptospirosis confirmed patients in Sri Lanka. Thirty-one serum samples from healthy individuals were obtained as controls. PCR-RFLP method was used to identify TNF gene polymorphisms and to determine their association with TNF expression and disease severity in leptospirosis. TNF (p = 0.0022) and IL-10 (p < 0.0001) were found to be significantly elevated in leptospirosis patients, while sTNFR1 (p < 0.0001) was significantly suppressed. TNF was not significantly elevated in patients with complications while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly elevated among patients with complications (p = 0.0011) and with mortality (p = 0.0088). The ratio of IL-10 to TNF was higher among patients with complications (p = 0.0008) and in fatal cases (p = 0.0179). No association between TNF gene polymorphisms and TNF expression was detected due to the low frequency of heterozygous and mutated genes present in this study population. Thus the findings of the study show that elevated levels of IL-10 in the acute phase of disease could lead to severe outcomes and a high IL-10/TNF ratio is observed in patients with complications due to leptospirosis.","['Nisansala T', 'Weerasekera M', 'Ranasinghe N', 'Marasinghe C', 'Gamage C', 'Fernando N', 'Gunasekara C']",2021,210,4,Med Microbiol Immunol,"Nisansala T, et al.

34143778,Correlation between renal distribution of leptospires during the acute phase and chronic renal dysfunction in a hamster model of infection with Leptospira interrogans.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis has been described as a biphasic disease consisting of hematogenous dissemination to major organs in the acute phase and asymptomatic renal colonization in the chronic phase. Several observational studies have suggested an association between leptospirosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the dynamics of leptospires and histopathological changes in the kidney to understand the relationship between them, and also investigated the extent of renal dysfunction in the acute and chronic phases of leptospirosis using a hamster model.
FINDINGS: Hamsters (n = 68) were subcutaneously infected with 1 × 104 cells of the Leptospira interrogans serovar Manilae strain UP-MMC-SM. A total of 53 infected hamsters developed fatal acute leptospirosis, and the remaining 15 hamsters recovered from the acute phase, 13 of which showed Leptospira colonization in the kidneys in the chronic phase. Five asymptomatic hamsters also had renal colonization in the chronic phase. Immunofluorescence staining showed that leptospires were locally distributed in the renal interstitium in the early acute phase and then spread continuously into the surrounding interstitium. The kidneys of the surviving hamsters in the chronic phase showed patchy lesions of atrophic tubules, a finding of chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, which were substantially consistent with the distribution of leptospires in the renal interstitium. The degree of atrophic tubules in kidney sections correlated statistically with the serum creatinine level in the chronic phase (rs = 0.78, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous infection with pathogenic leptospires could cause acute death or chronic leptospirosis in hamsters after surviving the acute phase. We suggest that the renal distribution of leptospires during the acute phase probably affected the extent of tubular atrophy, leading to CKD.","['Maruoka T', 'Nikaido Y', 'Miyahara S', 'Katafuchi E', 'Inamasu Y', 'Ogawa M', 'Fukuda K', 'Nakayama T', 'Horishita T', 'Saito M']",2021,15,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Maruoka T, et al.

34129288,"The epidemiology of bacterial zoonoses in pastoral and dairy cattle in Cameroon, Central Africa.","Previous work identified that bacterial zoonoses (Brucella species, Coxiella burnetii and Leptospira hardjo) were present in Cameroonian pastoral cattle. To assess the characteristics of this zoonotic risk, we analyse seroprevalence of each pathogen and the associated management, herd and environmental factors in Cameroonian pastoral and dairy cattle. Cross-sectional samples included pastoralist herds in the Northwest Region (NWR n = 750) and Vina Division (VD n = 748) and small holder dairy herds in the NWR (n = 60). Exposure to Brucella spp., C. burnetii and L. hardjo were screened for using commercial ELISAs and population adjusted estimates made. In addition, individual, herd and ecological metadata were collected and used to identify risk factors associated with animal-level seropositivity. In the pastoral cattle, seroprevalence to Brucella spp. was relatively low but was higher in the NWR (4.2%, CI: 2.5%-7.0%) than the VD (1.1%: CI 0.5%-2.4%), while L. hardjo seroprevalence was much higher though similar in the NWR (30.7%, CI 26.3%-35.5%) and VD (35.9%, CI 31.3%-40.7%). No differences were noted in C. burnetii seroprevalence between the two study sites (NWR: 14.6%, CI 11.8%-18.0%. VD: 12.4%, 9.6%-15.9%). Compared to pastoral, dairy cattle had lower seroprevalences for L. hardjo (1.7%, CI: 0.0%-4.9%), C. burnetii (0.0%, CI 0.0%-6.0%) but similar for Brucella spp. (5.0%, CI 0.0%-10.6%). Increased odds of Brucella spp. seropositivity were associated with owning sheep or rearing sheep and fencing cattle in at night. Adult cattle had increased odds of being seropositive for both C. burnetii and L. hardjo. Additionally, exposure to C. burnetii was associated with local ecological conditions and L. hardjo was negatively associated with cattle undertaking transhumance. This work highlights that exposure to these 3 important production diseases and occupational zoonoses are widespread in Cameroonian cattle.

34106895,Leptospirosis as a neglected burden at human-cattle interface in Mid-Delta of Egypt.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis in developing countries including Egypt where its burden is underestimated.
METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional study was carried out to estimate the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo infection among cows and leptospirosis among human patients in Mid-Delta of Egypt.
RESULTS: Out of 112 examined cows using ELISA, 3.6% were seropositive to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo infection. Seroconversion occurred in 5 animals (1 herd) of all examined animals in convalescent phase testing (5/112, 4.5%). Affected herd suffered acute outbreak with 43.3% within herd prevalence; signs of infection included abortions, bloody urine and sudden death of 2 cows. Highest risk for L. interrogans serovar Hardjo infection in cows was in animals drank from untreated surface water (6.7 times, p = 0.06). The seroprevalence of leptospirosis was 6.2% in all tested humans, 28.6% in nonspecific fever cases and 22.2% in non-viral hepatitis cases. The risk of leptospirosis among patients with nonspecific fever or non-viral hepatitis cases was 4 times higher than those with viral hepatitis (p = 0.01). Additionally, there was a significant association between leptospirosis and patients with livestock contact (Odds 8, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of L. interrogans serovar Hardjo outbreak in cows in Egypt.

Post-flood, Kerala state was under the threat of many infectious diseases including leptospirosis, but did not report any leptospirosis infections.
OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted with the following objectives: (1) Assess the knowledge, attitude and practices regarding the prevention of leptospirosis among the flood affected population and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) of Chengannur; and (2) Analyze the factors responsible for and contributing to leptospirosis control in the area post flood.
METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional questionnaire based observational study was conducted among 2 groups: the flood affected population, and ASHA. The questionnaire was divided into 3 parts. Part A contained the socio-demographic information. Part B contained questions on assessment of knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding the prevention, and control of leptospirosis. Part C was only for the ASHA involved.
RESULTS: The final sample size was 331 (244 from the general population and 87 ASHAs). With respect to knowledge, attitude, and practice, the responses were dichotomized into correct and wrong responses. The mean knowledge score was 9.01 ± 1.08 (maximum score of 10), mean attitude score was of 3.61 ± 0.55 (maximum score of 4) and the mean practice score was 4.12 ± 1.05 (maximum score of 5).
CONCLUSION: Knowledge and attitude scores did not significantly differ between the general population and ASHA, but the practice score showed a higher score among the ASHA, all of which could have probably contributed to the prevention of a leptospirosis outbreak in the region.","['Sreelakshmi MK', 'Kuruvilla S', 'Subramaniam R', 'Latti P', 'Venkitachalam R']",2022,16,3,Disaster Med Public Health Prep,"Sreelakshmi MK, et al.

34092853,A Retrospective Analysis of Outcome in Malaria Patients Admitted into a Multidisciplinary Intensive Care Unit of a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital.,"INTRODUCTION: Malaria is a significant public health problem with people worldwide at risk for the disease. It is a mosquito-borne disease causing high-grade fever, chills, and flu-like illness. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the case with severe malaria should be admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU). Severe malaria is a medical emergency and often managed in ICU with regard to the definition of hyperparasitemia. The WHO amended the criteria for definition of severe malaria in 2006, 2010, and 2015.
METHODS: All patients had a full workup for fever that included three smears for malarial parasites, serology for dengue, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, enteric fever, blood, urine, sputum or endotracheal cultures, and other tests as clinically indicated. A diagnosis was made when a patient is tested positive for malarial antigen with a rapid diagnostic test and other causes of fever excluded. Patients were treated with intravenous Artesunate along with enteral Doxycycline.
RESULTS: Of total patients, the vasopressor requirements being Dopamine (7.40%), nor adrenaline (7.40%) and vasopressin (3.70%). None received packed red blood cell transfusions, whereas 14.81% had platelet transfusions. 66.66% required Noninvasive ventilation, none required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and both noninvasive and IMV. None of the patients had received hemodialysis. The mean duration of ICU and hospital stay was 4.14 and 6.26 days, respectively. No deaths were observed during the study period.

Clinicopathological findings at presentation included anaemia (42%), thrombocytopenia (43%), increased alanine transaminase activity (ALT) (66%), hyperbilirubinemia (55%), azotaemia (68%), hypoalbuminaemia (49%) and glucosuria (32%). Seven serovars of Leptospira interrogans or Leptospira kirschneri were detected; the most prevalent was Copenhageni (48%). Seventy-one percent survived to discharge. Dogs in the non-surviving group had a higher creatinine at presentation compared to survivors (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Copenhageni was the most prevalent serovar in this population. This supports the use of a vaccine including this serovar, in this region. Renal involvement was associated with reduced survival to discharge. A hepatic only form was common in this population, and leptospirosis should be included as a differential diagnosis for dogs suffering with a hepatopathy. No cases had significant pulmonary involvement, but ongoing clinical vigilance for this disease manifestation is essential.","['Raj J', 'Campbell R', 'Tappin S']",2021,189,7,Vet Rec,"Raj J, et al.

Leptospira samples (24 antigens) that make up our panel of antigens used in MAT were used, among them, reference and autochthonous strains isolated in Brazil. The samples were grown individually in the EMJH medium under the three previously mentioned conditions (adapted enrichment, original enrichment and commercial enrichment). In addition, 89 blood serums from domestic and wild animals were analyzed by MAT using the antigens grown in these media. All samples tested grew efficiently with the adapted enrichment, and the MAT results were satisfactory. Therefore, other laboratories could also benefit from the use of this adapted enrichment when culturing the Leptospira strains applied in their MAT panels.","['Guedes IB', 'Souza GO', 'Castro JFP', 'Cavalini MB', 'Filho AFS', 'Aizawa J', 'Cortez A', 'Heinemann MB']",2022,54,2,Rev Argent Microbiol,"Guedes IB, et al.

34082705,A rare case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a patient with severe leptospirosis complicated with rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury; a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal disease caused by Leptospira interrogans. The clinical presentation ranges from an asymptomatic state to a fatal multiorgan dysfunction. Neurological manifestations including aseptic meningitis, spinal cord and peripheral nerve involvement, cranial neuropathies and cerebellar syndrome are well recognized with varying frequencies among patients with this disease. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a very rare occurrence in leptospirosis and only two cases are reported in the medical literature up to now. We report a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a patient with leptospirosis with rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 21 year-old male presented with fever and oliguric acute kidney injury with rhabdomyolysis. A diagnosis of leptospirosis was made and he was being managed according to the standard practice together with regular hemodialysis. The clinical condition was improving gradually. On day 8 of the illness, he developed headache and sudden painless complete bilateral vision loss followed by several brief generalized tonic clonic seizure attacks. Examination was significant for a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14/15, blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg and complete bilateral blindness. The findings of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were compatible with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. He was managed with blood pressure control and antiepileptics with supportive measures and standard treatment for leptospirosis and made a complete recovery.
CONCLUSION: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, though very rare with leptospirosis, should be considered as a differential diagnosis in a patient with new onset visual symptoms and seizures, especially during the immune phase. Optimal supportive care together with careful blood pressure control and seizure management would yield a favourable outcome in this reversible entity.","['Lakmali JPR', 'Thirumavalavan K', 'Dissanayake D']",2021,21,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Lakmali JPR, et al.

It is often underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed due to non-specific clinical presentation coupled with limited microbiological facilities, leading to adverse clinical outcomes. This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of scrub typhus in febrile patients attending Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH), Nepal, from August 2018 to April 2019. (2) Materials and Method: Blood/serum samples and clinical and demographic data of adult febrile patients (≥19 years) who attended or were referred to the hospital were collected after obtaining written informed consent from the participants excluding immunocompromised individuals. Collected blood/serum samples were subjected to hematological, biochemical, and serological tests. A serological test for scrub typhus was performed using the ImmuneMed scrub typhus rapid diagnostic test kit. Data generated were analyzed using SPSS software version 24.0. (3) Results: Amongst the 2070 febrile patients, 462 (22.3%) were seropositive to at least one etiological agent of febrile illnesses (scrub typhus: 253 cases, dengue: 101 cases, leptospirosis: 9, brucellosis: 52, malaria: 9 and kala-azar: 20 cases). Scrub typhus accounted for 12.2% (n = 253) of total febrile illnesses followed by dengue (4.9%, n = 101). Mixed seropositivity of scrub typhus with dengue, brucellosis, and typhoid was found in 12 (0.6%), 9 (0.4%), and 5 (0.2%) cases, respectively. Among 253 scrub typhus patients, 53.4% were female. Among the 154 patients, the most common symptoms were fever (100%), headache (79.2%), sweating (70.1%), breathing difficulty (51.3%), redness of the eye (43.5%), and pathognomonic eschar was observed in 9.1% patients. Fifty percent of scrub typhus patients had low platelet count and >30% of patients had an elevated level of liver enzymes (such as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGOT).

The disease spectrum ranges from a mild influenza-like presentation to a more serious Weil's syndrome. Leptospirosis rarely presents as a primary neurological syndrome. We report two cases of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Tarasssovi presenting as aseptic meningitis in Sri Lanka.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe case reports of two patients presenting as symptomatic aseptic meningitis due to neuroleptospirosis. Both patients had significant neurological involvement at presentation in the absence of common clinical features of leptospirosis. These patients were initially managed as bacterial or viral meningitis and leptospirosis was suspected due to a history of exposure to contaminated water. Subsequently, they were diagnosed to have neuroleptospirosis by positive Leptospira serology and both patients gained full recovery.
CONCLUSION: Our report highlights the importance of considering leptospirosis as a differential diagnosis in patients with aseptic meningitis in endemic settings. Obtaining a detailed occupational and recreational history is helpful in diagnosing neuroleptospirosis promptly. We report the association of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar (sv.)

34039442,"The correlation between three teleconnections and leptospirosis incidence in the Kandy District, Sri Lanka, 2004-2019.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis. Leptospirosis incidence (LI) in Sri Lanka is high. Infected animals excrete leptospires into the environment via their urine. Survival of leptospires in the environment until they enter into a person and several other factors that influence leptospirosis transmission are dependent upon local weather. Past studies show that rainfall and other weather parameters are correlated with the LI in the Kandy district, Sri Lanka. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), ENSO Modoki, and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are teleconnections known to be modulating rainfall in Sri Lanka. There is a severe dearth of published studies on the correlations between indices of these teleconnections and LI.
METHODS: We acquired the counts of leptospirosis cases notified and midyear estimated population data of the Kandy district from 2004 to 2019, respectively, from weekly epidemiology reports of the Ministry of Health and Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka. We estimated weekly and monthly LI of Kandy. We obtained weekly and monthly teleconnection indices data for the same period from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the USA and Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). We performed wavelet time series analysis to determine correlations with lag periods between teleconnection indices and LI time series. Then, we did time-lagged detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) to verify wavelet analysis results and to find the magnitudes of the correlations detected.
RESULTS: Wavelet analysis displayed indices of ENSO, IOD, and ENSO Modoki were correlated with the LI of Kandy with 1.9-11.5-month lags. Indices of ENSO showed two correlation patterns with Kandy LI. Time-lagged DCCA results show all indices of the three teleconnections studied were significantly correlated with the LI of Kandy with 2-5-month lag periods.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of the two analysis methods generally agree indicating that ENSO and IOD modulate LI in Kandy by modulating local rainfall and probably other weather parameters. We recommend further studies about the ENSO Modoki and LI correlation in Sri Lanka. Monitoring for extreme teleconnection events and enhancing preventive measures during lag periods can blunt LI peaks that may follow.","['Ehelepola NDB', 'Ariyaratne K', 'Aththanayake AMSMCM', 'Samarakoon K', 'Thilakarathna HMA']",2021,49,1,Trop Med Health,"Ehelepola NDB, et al.

Thus, the aim of this study was to describe the first Leptospira isolate from buffalo urine, assigned to the Sejroe serogroup, which does not belong to the Wolffi subgroup, traditionally isolated in Brazil. A total of 244 urine samples of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) raised in the Brazilian Amazon were subjected to bacteriological culturing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of leptospires. The obtained isolate was characterized by serogrouping using polyclonal antibodies, partial DNA sequencing, Hardjo-Bovis-specific PCR, multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA/VNTR) and experimental infection in hamsters. PCR was performed on the urine samples; 11/244 were positive (4.5 %) for Leptospira, and only one isolate was recovered (0.4 %). Regarding characterization, the isolate was assigned to the Sejroe serogroup with high titers (12,800) for the Saxkoebing and Sejroe serovar antisera. The isolate was negative for Hardjo-Bovis-specific PCR, and the species Leptospira borgpetersenii was identified by DNA sequencing. The MLVA results showed that the VNTR profile of the isolate was 1-2-5, compatible with that of serovars Sejroe/Istrica. In the experimental infection in hamsters, the animals did not develop clinical signs, and no macroscopic lesions were observed on the organs at necropsy; however, the strain was detected in the kidneys, uterus, and testicles of the animals. The isolate described herein highlights infection by Sejroe strains that may be overlooked in buffaloes and that may be different from those normally isolated and used in serological studies.","['Guedes IB', 'de Souza GO', 'de Paula Castro JF', 'Cavalini MB', 'Maia ALP', 'do Amaral RR', 'Cortez A', 'Heinemann MB']",2021,77,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Guedes IB, et al.

Latent class models have been proposed as a potential solution as they provide estimates without the need for a gold standard. Using a motivating example of the evaluation of point of care tests for leptospirosis in Tanzania, we show how a realistic violation of assumptions underpinning the latent class model can lead directly to substantial bias in the estimates of the parameters of interest. In particular, we consider the robustness of estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, to the presence of additional latent states when fitting a two-state latent class model. The violation is minor in the sense that it cannot be routinely detected with goodness-of-fit procedures, but is major with regard to the resulting bias.","['Schofield MR', 'Maze MJ', 'Crump JA', 'Rubach MP', 'Galloway R', 'Sharples KJ']",2021,40,22,Stat Med,"Schofield MR, et al.

However, the importance of cats as an infection source for humans remains unclear. In this study, Leptospira infection in cats in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, where leptospirosis is endemic, was investigated by leptospiral antibody and DNA detection using microscopic agglutination test and nested PCR, respectively. Moreover, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were conducted on the Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica isolated from cats, black rats, a mongoose, and humans. Anti-Leptospira antibodies were detected in 16.6% (40/241) of the cats tested, and the predominant reactive serogroup was Javanica. The leptospiral flaB gene was detected in 7.1% (3/42) of cat urine samples, and their sequences were identical and identified as L. borgpetersenii. MLST and WGS revealed the genetic relatedness of L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica isolates. This study indicated that most seropositive cats had antibodies against the serogroup Javanica and that cats excreted L. borgpetersenii in the urine after infection. Further, genetic relatedness between cat and human isolates suggests that cats may be a maintenance host for L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica and a source for human infection.","['Kakita T', 'Kuba Y', 'Kyan H', 'Okano S', 'Morita M', 'Koizumi N']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Kakita T, et al.

33989292,Time series models for prediction of leptospirosis in different climate zones in Sri Lanka.,"In tropical countries such as Sri Lanka, where leptospirosis-a deadly disease with a high mortality rate-is endemic, prediction is required for public health planning and resource allocation. Routinely collected meteorological data may offer an effective means of making such predictions. This study included monthly leptospirosis and meteorological data from January 2007 to April 2019 from Sri Lanka. Factor analysis was first used with rainfall data to classify districts into meteorological zones. We used a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model for univariate predictions and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model for multivariable analysis of leptospirosis with monthly average rainfall, temperature, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SR), and the number of rainy days/month (RD). Districts were classified into wet (WZ) and dry (DZ) zones, and highlands (HL) based on the factor analysis of rainfall data. The WZ had the highest leptospirosis incidence; there was no difference in the incidence between the DZ and HL. Leptospirosis was fluctuated positively with rainfall, RH and RD, whereas temperature and SR were fluctuated negatively. The best-fitted SARIMA models in the three zones were different from each other. Despite its known association, rainfall was positively significant in the WZ only at lag 5 (P = 0.03) but was negatively associated at lag 2 and 3 (P = 0.04). RD was positively associated for all three zones. Temperature was positively associated at lag 0 for the WZ and HL (P < 0.009) and was negatively associated at lag 1 for the WZ (P = 0.01). There was no association with RH in contrast to previous studies. Based on altitude and rainfall data, meteorological variables could effectively predict the incidence of leptospirosis with different models for different climatic zones. These predictive models could be effectively used in public health planning purposes.","['Warnasekara J', 'Agampodi S', 'Abeynayake R R']",2021,16,5,PLoS One,"Warnasekara J, et al.

33977853,Vaccination practices for Leptospira spp. on New Zealand dairy farms.,"AIMS: To describe leptospiral vaccination practices in dairy herds in New Zealand and evaluate conformity with best practice guidelines issued by the New Zealand Veterinary Association using data from a questionnaire administered by participating veterinary practices.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 200 randomly selected dairy farms stratified by herd size and region throughout New Zealand was conducted from January to April 2016 to investigate leptospiral vaccination practices in dairy herds in New Zealand. Using a pre-tested questionnaire administered during a face-to-face interview, vaccination practice details such as vaccine types, time, and age of vaccination and whether vaccines were administered by veterinary or farm staff, were collected.
RESULTS: Leptospiral vaccination programmes had been implemented on 199/200 (99.5 (95% CI = 97.2-99.9)%) farms, and on 178 (89.4%) of those, programmes had been running for ≥5 years. Most farmers used bivalent vaccines containing antigens for leptospiral serovars Pomona and Hardjo (144/179 (80.4%) in calves, 112/167 (60.7%) in heifers, and 112/163 (68.7%) in cows), rather than trivalent vaccines which also include antigens for 
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey suggest that there is almost universal adoption of leptospiral vaccination for dairy cattle in New Zealand. However, there remain areas for improvement regarding the proportion of farmers following best practice guidelines and refinement of vaccination programmes, particularly with respect to timing of vaccination in calves.","['Yupiana Y', 'Wilson PR', 'Collins-Emerson JM', 'Weston JF', 'Benschop J', 'Vallée E', 'Heuer C']",2021,69,5,N Z Vet J,"Yupiana Y, et al.

33976946,Two Atypical Cases of Hantavirus Infection: Experience from a Tertiary Care Unit in Sri Lanka.,"Hantaviruses are a large family of enveloped viruses with two medically important families Cricetidae and Muridae which are known to cause rodent-borne diseases worldwide. Some strains cause clinical syndromes with multiorgan involvement in humans such as hantavirus haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), which is also known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Clinical differentiation of this infection from other endemic infections in Sri Lanka such as leptospirosis and rickettsial infections is extremely difficult due to overlapping clinical and epidemiologic features such as exposure to rodents and farming. Here, we report two serologically confirmed cases of hantavirus infection from Sri Lanka with different presentation. The first patient had a combination of HCPS and HFRS. The second patient was treated for HPS complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both had a significant clinical, biochemical, and radiological response with early initiation of corticosteroids. However, further studies are required to assess whether steroids hasten the recovery of severe hantavirus infections. We believe that hantavirus infection is an important emerging disease in the country and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with an acute febrile illness as well as in patients presenting with ARDS. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment improve prognosis.","['Rupasinghe S', 'Bowattage S', 'Herath L', 'Rajaratnam A']",2021,2021,,Case Rep Infect Dis,"Rupasinghe S, et al.

This study aims to investigate the global and localised relationships between leptospirosis with selected environmental variables. The association between environmental variables and the spatial density of geocoded leptospirosis cases was determined using global Poisson regression (GPR) and geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR). A higher prevalence of leptospirosis was detected in areas with higher water vapour pressure (exp(â): 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.25) and annual precipitation (exp(â): 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.31), with lower precipitation in the driest month (exp(â): 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75 - 0.96) and the wettest quarter (exp(â): 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77 - 1.00). Water vapor pressure (WVP) varied the most in the hotspot regions with a standard deviation of 0.62 (LQ: 0.15; UQ; 0.99) while the least variation was observed in annual precipitation (ANNP) with a standard deviation of 0.14 (LQ: 0.11; UQ; 0.30). The reduction in AICc value from 519.73 to 443.49 indicates that the GWPR model is able to identify the spatially varying correlation between leptospirosis and selected environmental variables. The results of the localised relationships in this study could be used to formulate spatially targeted interventions. This would be particularly useful in localities with a strong environmental or socio-demographical determinants for the transmission of leptospirosis.","['Kira R', 'Bilung LM', 'Ngui R', 'Apun K', ""Su'ut L""]",2021,38,2,Trop Biomed,"Kira R, et al.

Human infection is rare and acquired by exposure to environmental sources (animal urine, contaminated water, soil, or infected animal tissue). It can have an extremely broad presentation, ranging from asymptomatic to serious illness. We report the case of a 59-year-old man admitted to the hospital with myalgia, fever, and abdominal discomfort. Routine laboratory tests revealed raised inflammatory markers, thrombocytopenia, kidney dysfunction, and hepatic cytolysis and cholestasis. The hypothesis of zoonosis was raised based on symptoms and analytical changes despite the weak epidemiological history to support it. Although leptospira serology tests were negative on admission, a polymerase chain reaction test was requested due to a high degree of suspicion which came back positive. The patient completed eight days of doxycycline with favorable clinical and analytical progression. This case highlights the changing epidemiology of leptospirosis and the importance of having a high degree of suspicion even outside endemic zones. It also highlights the importance of a wise choice of diagnostic tests according to the disease stage.","['Brito Monteiro M', 'Egídio de Sousa I', 'Piteira M', 'Coelho S', 'Freitas P']",2021,13,4,Cureus,"Brito Monteiro M, et al.

33960475,Characterization of leptospiral DNA in the follicular fluid of non-pregnant cows.,"BACKGROUND: Bovine leptospirosis is mainly characterized by reproductive disorders. Contamination of the oocyte was previously demonstrated in vitro, resulting in some apparent damage. However, it is not clear whether it occurs under natural conditions. The present study aimed to characterize the presence of pathogenic Leptospira DNA in the ovarian follicles of non-pregnant cows.
METHODS: Follicular fluid samples were collected from 65 animals and subjected to lipL32 PCR and secY sequencing.
RESULTS: In total, seven of 65 (10.8%) were positive, indicating a possible early infection of the oocyte. Moreover, secY sequencing identified L. interrogans and L. santarosai, both very closely related to bovine strains from the Sejroe serogroup (Hardjoprjitno and Guaricura). We demonstrated that ovarian follicles can also be infected.
CONCLUSIONS: It was hypothesised that ovarian infection can contribute to embryonic death, causing reproductive failure and estrus repetition. In the present study, we show that the organism identified in the follicle is closely related to one that is known to be associated with reproductive disorders.","['Di Azevedo MIN', 'Pires BC', 'Barbosa LFC', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2021,188,9,Vet Rec,"Di Azevedo MIN, et al.

33914782,"An outbreak of acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) among the Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh: Findings from enhanced epidemiological surveillance.","In the summer of 2017, an estimated 745,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in what has been described as one of the largest and fastest growing refugee crises in the world. Among numerous health concerns, an outbreak of acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) was detected by the disease surveillance system in early 2018 among the refugee population. This paper describes the investigation into the increase in AJS cases, the process and results of the investigation, which were strongly suggestive of a large outbreak due to hepatitis A virus (HAV). An enhanced serological investigation was conducted between 28 February to 26 March 2018 to determine the etiologies and risk factors associated with the outbreak. A total of 275 samples were collected from 18 health facilities reporting AJS cases. Blood samples were collected from all patients fulfilling the study specific case definition and inclusion criteria, and tested for antibody responses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Out of the 275 samples, 206 were positive for one of the agents tested. The laboratory results confirmed multiple etiologies including 154 (56%) samples tested positive for hepatitis A, 1 (0.4%) positive for hepatitis E, 36 (13%) positive for hepatitis B, 25 (9%) positive for hepatitis C, and 14 (5%) positive for leptospirosis. Among all specimens tested 24 (9%) showed evidence of co-infections with multiple etiologies. Hepatitis A and E are commonly found in refugee camps and have similar clinical presentations. In the absence of robust testing capacity when the epidemic was identified through syndromic reporting, a particular concern was that of a hepatitis E outbreak, for which immunity tends to be limited, and which may be particularly severe among pregnant women. This report highlights the challenges of identifying causative agents in such settings and the resources required to do so. Results from the month-long enhanced investigation did not point out widespread hepatitis E virus (HEV) transmission, but instead strongly suggested a large-scale hepatitis A outbreak of milder consequences, and highlighted a number of other concomitant causes of AJS (acute hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Leptospirosis), albeit most likely at sporadic level. Results strengthen the need for further water and sanitation interventions and are a stark reminder of the risk of other epidemics transmitted through similar routes in such settings, particularly dysentery and cholera. It also highlights the need to ensure clinical management capacity for potentially chronic conditions in this vulnerable population.","['Mazhar MKA', 'Finger F', 'Evers ES', 'Kuehne A', 'Ivey M', 'Yesurajan F', 'Shirin T', 'Ajim N', 'Kabir A', 'Musto J', 'White K', 'Baidjoe A', 'le Polain de Waroux O']",2021,16,4,PLoS One,"Mazhar MKA, et al.

As a result, a trans-disciplinary approach among human, animal and environmental health disciplines gained support. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) decided to establish a National Institute of One Health at Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. In this context, two collaborative research projects, funded by the ICAR and ICMR were initiated to conduct the epidemiological surveillance of selected zoonotic diseases in Central India.
METHODS: Disease surveillance and molecular detection employing standard techniques like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immuno-fluroscent assay (IFA), standard tube agglutination test (STAT) , Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were undertaken based on the disease to be screened.
RESULTS: In animals, the seropositivities for listeriosis (7.66%) and brucellosis (11.69%) were recorded. The occurrence of tuberculosis (3.8%) and leptospirosis (6.33%) was detected by PCR. Through cross-sectional studies from suspected human population with associated risk factors for zoonotic diseases, the seropositivity of brucellosis (1.83-11%), listeriosis (1.01-10.18 %), leptospirosis (8.14-12.67%) and scrub typhus (1.78-20.34%) was recorded. The investigations on scrub typhus indicated bimodal pattern during the months of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season with a peak in post-monsoon in human cases. Ornithonyssus bacoti mites were identified from the rodents as a vector harbouring Orientia tsutsugamushi. The bovine tuberculosis was detected in 1.43 per cent human cases employing molecular assay.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man was retrieved from the jungle with severe weight loss and abdominal symptoms. He succumbed to death despite 22 days of intensive medical treatment. An autopsy revealed a ruptured gangrenous ileal volvulus with peritonitis and subdiaphragmatic abscess. Further laboratory analysis detected systemic Candida tropicalis and intestinal gramnegative bacterial sepsis, systemic Zika virus viremia, leptospirosis complicating rhabdomyolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, Type I Herpes Simplex virus infection of the tongue and upper gastrointestinal tract. The cause of death was the ruptured ileal volvulus, complicated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to Herpes simplex virus esophagitis in a malnourished patient with resolving leptospirosis and underlying Zika virus co-infection.
CONCLUSION: Rare clinical scenarios of adult-onset intestinal volvulus with concomitant multiple infections precludes clinical diagnosis and early treatment, leading to devastating consequences of clinical outcome.

Several studies have detected the presence of leptospiral antibodies in captive Neotropical primates, suggesting that they are asymptomatic carriers. However, the presence of antibodies in free-ranging primates and their potential role as reservoirs for this pathogen is not known. In this study, we used the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) to screen two species of free-ranging tamarins for the presence of Leptospira antibodies using a panel of 21 serogroups. A total of 56 primates (26 Leontocebus weddelli and 30 Saguinus imperator) were screened at the Estación Biológica Río Los Amigos in Madre de Dios, Peru. MAT results with titres of ≥100 in single samples were considered seropositive. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated for age group, sex and host species identity. Overall, 51.8% (29/56) of animals were reactive for at least one Leptospira serogroup. Serogroups were distributed as follows: Iquitos (41.1%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (14.3%), Sejroe (3.6%), Autumnalis (1.8%) and Bataviae (1.8%). No significant differences (p > .05) were found for seropositivity frequencies among categories within assessed variables. These results suggest that free-ranging L. weddelli and S. imperator might serve as reservoirs for pathogenic Leptospira serogroups. Given increasing human-wildlife contact, future studies that test for active infection are required to determine potential transmission risks to humans.","['Aliaga-Samanez GG', 'Lescano J', 'Quevedo Urday MJ', 'Salvatierra Rodríguez GS', 'Erkenswick Watsa M', 'Calderon Escalante JE', 'Erkenswick GA']",2022,69,3,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Aliaga-Samanez GG, et al.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular and serological characteristics of Leptospira spp. isolated from wild animals and a dog in Amami Oshima Island. We obtained seven Leptospira strains by culturing kidney tissues of wild animals, such as black rats (2), wild boars (3), and rabbit (1) as well as blood from a symptomatic dog. Using flaB sequencing and microscopic agglutination test with antisera for 18 serovars, the isolates were identified as Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroups Javanica (black rat), L. interrogans serogroup Australis (black rat and dog), and L. interrogans serogroup Hebdomadis (wild boar and rabbit). The sequence type (ST) of L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica was determined to be ST143 via multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using seven housekeeping genes. For L. interrogans, MLST and multiple-locus variable-tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) revealed identical ST and MLVA types in rat and canine isolates, whereas two STs and MLVA types were identified in wild boar isolates. The STs and MLVA types of rabbit and one of the wild boars were identical. Bacterial culture and flaB-nested polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a high rate of Leptospira infection in wild boars (58.3%, 7/12), whereas Leptospira spp. were detected in 4.8% of black rats (2/42). This study revealed diverse Leptospira genotype and serotype maintenance in wild mammals on Amami Oshima Island. MLST and MLVA indicated that black rats were a source of canine infection. Wild boars carry L. interrogans and are considered an important maintenance host because antibodies against serogroup Hebdomadis were detected in human and canine leptospirosis patients on this island.","['Shinya S', 'Muraoka Y', 'Negishi D', 'Koizumi N']",2021,16,4,PLoS One,"Shinya S, et al.

33878396,hTLR2 interacting peptides of pathogenic leptospiral outer membrane proteins.,"To adapt into the host system from moist environment Leptospira alter their gene expression by inducing differential expression of the genes encoding virulence factors. Knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis and virulent evolution remains limited to Leptospira. The pathogenic organism sense the environmental changes mainly through their outer membrane proteins that in-turn activates the signal transduction pathways to overcome the stress to adaptation into host system and to evade immunity. In this present study, we analyzed the expression profile of virulence associated OMPs regulated under various stress conditions like temperatures, iron deprivation, osmotic stress and low to high passages in single scale and characterized the selected proteins by MALDI-TOF MS/MS and their role in pathogenesis were predicted by implying in-silico analysis. To identify differential expression profile, the extracted OMPs were resolved through 2DE and compared the OMPs profile from various in-vivo like conditions in single scale and found 61 upregulated OMPs and three potentially virulent proteins were earmarked for their significance in pathogenesis. Further, the in-silico analysis revealed that differentially expressed protein has MHC-I T-cell, MHC-II T-cell and B-cell epitopes which showed an interaction between human TLR2 proteins confirmed by CABS docking and interaction network unveiled to understand the leptospiral virulent mechanism and host adaptation.","['Akino Mercy CS', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2021,155,,Microb Pathog,Akino Mercy CS and Natarajaseenivasan K. hTLR2 interacting peptides of pathogenic leptospiral outer membrane proteins. hTLR2 interacting peptides of pathogenic leptospiral outer membrane proteins. 2021; 155:104895. doi: 10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104895,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33878396/

33861353,Leptospirosis and Rickettsial Diseases Sero-Conversion Surveillance Among U.S. Military Personnel in Honduras.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis and rickettsial diseases are global zoonotic diseases. In severe infection cases, mortality can range from 10% to 30%. Currently most epidemiological data available are based on outbreak investigations and hospital-based studies from endemic countries. The U.S. soldiers at military bases in these countries are highly vulnerable due to the fact that most of them are immunologically naïve to these pathogens. No risk assessment of leptospirosis and rickettsial diseases among U.S. military personnel in Honduras is currently available. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of leptospirosis and rickettsial diseases in U.S. military personnel deployed to Honduras using serological assays.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of pre- and post-deployment sera from the most recent 1,000 military personnel stationed in Honduras for at least 6 months between 2000 and 2016 was identified for this study. Serum specimens from these eligible subjects were retrieved. All post-deployment serum specimens were screened at a dilution of 1:100 for the presence of IgG antibodies to Leptospira and Rickettsia pathogens. The pre-deployment sera from those individuals with post-deployment IgG antibodies above cutoff (i.e., seropositive) were tested to determine seroconversion. Seroconversion was defined as conversion of an optical density value from below the cutoff (i.e., negative) in a pre-deployed specimen to above the cutoff (i.e., positive) in a post-deployed specimen at a titer of 100.
RESULTS: The seropositive post-deployment specimens for antibodies against Leptospira (causing leptospirosis), Rickettsia typhi (causing murine typhus [MT]), spotted fever group rickettsioses (SFGR, causing SFG Rickettsia), Orientia tsutsugamushi (causing scrub typhus [ST]), and Coxiella burnetii (causing Q fever [QF]) were 11.6%, 11.3%, 6%, 5.6%, and 8.0%, respectively. The seroconverted rate in those assigned to Honduras from 2000 to 2016 was 7.3%, 1.9%, 3.9%, 4.3%, and 2.7% for leptospirosis, MT, SFGR, ST, and QF, respectively. Among the seroconverted specimens, 27 showed seroconversion of at least two antibodies. These seroconverted individuals accounted for 8.8% (3 out of 34) of the personnel who looked for medical attention during their deployment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a leptospirosis seroconversion rate of 7.3%, which is higher than the 0.9% and 3.9% seroconversion in Korea and Japan, respectively. The higher rate of seroconversion indicates potential risk of Leptospira exposure. Additional testing of water samples in the pools and pits around the training sites to locate the infected areas is important to eliminate or reduce future exposure to Leptospira during trainings. The rates of seroconversion for ST, MT, spotted fever Rickettsia, and QF were 4.3%, 1.9%, 3.9%, and 2.7%, respectively, indicating the potential exposure to a variety of rickettsial-related pathogens. Testing of vectors for rickettsial pathogens in the areas could inform effective vector control countermeasures to prevent exposure. Proper precaution and protective measures are needed to better protect military personnel deployed to Honduras.","['Chao CC', 'Zhang Z', 'Belinskaya T', 'Chen HW', 'Ching WM']",2022,187,7-8,Mil Med,"Chao CC, et al.

Animals and humans acquire this infection through direct contact with contaminated urine or body fluids of infected animals. This prospective study was undertaken to know the proportion of leptospirosis in pediatric patients presented with acute febrile illness at the Post Graduate Department of Microbiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Blood samples were collected over a period of one year from January to December 2018 from 70 pediatric patients aged up to 0-12 years presented with febrile illness for 3-14 days. Out of the 70 samples, 7 (10%) samples were found positive by IgM ELISA, 4 (5.7%) samples were positive by MAT and 3(4.3%) were found positive by PCR. Risk factors such as contact with infected animals and contaminated environment were highly associated with seropositivity of leptospirosis.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of Leptospira spp in rodents captured from peridomestic sites in leptospirosis endemic regions of Nicaragua. Using live traps, 191 rodents were captured in 2012 and 2013 between April and December. Kidney samples were collected and processed for Leptospira detection from 166 animals by direct culture and isolation. The isolates were tested by PCR for LipL32 and lfb1-F genes specific to pathogenic Leptospira species. The trapping success over all sites was 20.2%, with higher rates of success in rainy season (p < 0.05). Leptospira spp were detected in 22.3% of rodents by direct culture methods. Significant differences (p < 0.01) were found in the frequencies of Leptospira positive rodents per month as well as per region. Of the isolated Leptospira spp, 37.5% were positive for pathogenic species by PCR. The frequency of Leptospira positive rodents by isolation could be used as a predictive indicator for the risk of human leptospirosis in Nicaragua.","['Flores B', 'Sheleby-Elias J', 'Pérez-Sánchez T', 'Fischer R', 'Múzquiz J', 'Fuertes H', 'Halaihel N', 'Jirón W', 'Duttmann C']",2020,17,4,Ecohealth,"Flores B, et al.

A country-level evidence gap map was developed to identify gaps on epidemiology of leptospirosis. It is the first such on leptospirosis globally and on any single disease condition in India. The steps for development of evidence gap map were development of a framework to map evidence, retrieval of evidence, data extraction parameters and mapping of available evidence in evidence gap map framework. The prevalence evidence gap map consisted of 157 studies (102 in humans, 55 in animals, and 12 in both). The evidence gap map on risk factors had 120 studies (102 in humans, 11 in animals and 7 in both). There were inter-state differences in availability of research and disparity between animal and human research. Research on high-risk groups was limited and studies did not use the One Health approach to identify epidemiology, which can help understand the issue more comprehensively.

Nees is a medicinal herb of the Asian countries used in many traditional medicinal systems for the treatment of diarrhea, flu, leprosy, leptospirosis, malaria, rabies, upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, syphilis, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS etc. AIM OF THE STUDY: This review aims to provide the comprehensive, accurate and authentic information on traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of various extracts/fractions as well as phytocostituents of A. paniculata. In addition, this review also aims to provide advance and sensitive analytical methods along with chemical markers used in the standardization of herbal products for quality control (QC)/quality assurance (QA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All relevant publications were considered within the years 1983-2020. The publications were searched from Google Scholar, PubChem, Chemspider, PubMed, Elsevier, Wiley, Web of Science, China Knowledge Resource Integrated databases and ResearchGate using a combination of various relevant keywords. Besides, relevant published books and chapters were also considered those providing an overview of extant secondary literature related to traditional knowledge, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicity of the plant.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In this review, 344 compounds, including, terpenoid lactones, flavonoids, phenolic acids, triterpenes and volatile compounds were summarized out of which more than half of the compounds have no reported pharmacological activities yet. Terpenoid lactones and flavonoids are the major bioactive classes of compounds of A. paniculata which are responsible for pharmacological activities such as anticancer and antioxidant activities, respectively. Biosynthetic pathways and active sites for target proteins of both terpenoid lactones and flavonoids were considered. Analgesic, anticancer, antidiabetic, antifertility, antiinflammatory, antimalarial, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antipyretic, antiviral, antiretroviral, antivenom, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective activities have been also reported. Andrographolide is a major characteristic active principle and responsible for most of the pharmacological activities. Therefore, andrographolide has been selected as a marker for the standardization of raw and marketed herbal products by TLC, HPTLC, HPLC, GC-MS, HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS methods for QC/QA.
CONCLUSIONS: Conclusive evidence showed that the pharmacological activities reported in crude extracts and chemical markers are supporting and provides confidence in the traditional use of A. paniculata as a herbal medicine. The andrographolide could be used as a chemical marker for the QC/QA of raw and A. paniculata derived herbal products. Lactone ring in terpenoid lactone is an active site for targeted proteins. More efforts should be focused on the identification of the chemical markers from A. paniculata to provide a practical basis for QC/QA. Several aspects such as the mechanism of therapeutic potential, molecular docking technology and multi-target network pharmacology are very important for drug discovery and needed more investigation and should be considered. This compilation may be helpful in further study and QC/QA.","['Kumar S', 'Singh B', 'Bajpai V']",2021,275,,J Ethnopharmacol,"Kumar S, et al. Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.)

33826628,Distinct transcriptional profiles of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strains JB197 and HB203 cultured at different temperatures.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic, bacterial disease, posing significant health risks to humans, livestock, and companion animals around the world. Symptoms range from asymptomatic to multi-organ failure in severe cases. Complex species-specific interactions exist between animal hosts and the infecting species, serovar, and strain of pathogen. Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strains HB203 and JB197 have a high level of genetic homology but cause different clinical presentation in the hamster model of infection; HB203 colonizes the kidney and presents with chronic shedding while JB197 causes severe organ failure and mortality. This study examines the transcriptome of L. borgpetersenii and characterizes differential gene expression profiles of strains HB203 and JB197 cultured at temperatures during routine laboratory conditions (29°C) and encountered during host infection (37°C).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strains JB197 and HB203 were isolated from the kidneys of experimentally infected hamsters and maintained at 29°C and 37°C. RNAseq revealed distinct gene expression profiles; 440 genes were differentially expressed (DE) between JB197 and HB203 at 29°C, and 179 genes were DE between strains at 37°C. Comparison of JB197 cultured at 29°C and 37°C identified 135 DE genes while 41 genes were DE in HB203 with those same culture conditions. The consistent differential expression of ligB, which encodes the outer membrane virulence factor LigB, was validated by immunoblotting and 2D-DIGE. Differential expression of lipopolysaccharide was also observed between JB197 and HB203.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Investigation of the L. borgpetersenii JB197 and HB203 transcriptome provides unique insight into the mechanistic differences between acute and chronic disease. Characterizing the nuances of strain to strain differences and investigating the environmental sensitivity of Leptospira to temperature is critical to the development and progress of leptospirosis prevention and treatment technologies, and is an important consideration when serovars are selected and propagated for use as bacterin vaccines as well as for the identification of novel therapeutic targets.","['Putz EJ', 'Sivasankaran SK', 'Fernandes LGV', 'Brunelle B', 'Lippolis JD', 'Alt DP', 'Bayles DO', 'Hornsby RL', 'Nally JE']",2021,15,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Putz EJ, et al.

33804076,"Blood Levels of Galectin-9, an Immuno-Regulating Molecule, Reflect the Severity for the Acute and Chronic Infectious Diseases.","Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a β-galactoside-binding lectin capable of promoting or suppressing the progression of infectious diseases. This protein is susceptible to cleavage of its linker-peptides by several proteases, and the resulting cleaved forms, N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and C-terminal CRD, bind to various glycans. It has been suggested that full-length (FL)-Gal-9 and the truncated (Tr)-Gal-9s could exert different functions from one another via their different glycan-binding activities. We propose that FL-Gal-9 regulates the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, HIV co-infected with opportunistic infection (HIV/OI), dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, and tuberculosis (TB). We also suggest that the blood levels of FL-Gal-9 reflect the severity of dengue, malaria, and HIV/OI, and those of Tr-Gal-9 markedly reflect the severity of HIV/OI. Recently, matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) was suggested to be an indicator of respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as useful for differentiating pulmonary from extrapulmonary TB. The protease cleavage of FL-Gal-9 may lead to uncontrolled hyper-immune activation, including a cytokine storm. In summary, Gal-9 has potential to reflect the disease severity for the acute and chronic infectious diseases.","['Iwasaki-Hozumi H', 'Chagan-Yasutan H', 'Ashino Y', 'Hattori T']",2021,11,3,Biomolecules,"Iwasaki-Hozumi H, et al.

Due to the large dengue epidemics that has occurred in Brazil in recent years, it is possible that cases of leptospirosis were unreported. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study to detect leptospirosis in patients who were tested for dengue, but whose laboratory diagnoses were negative.
METHODS: Sera samples from 2,017 patients from 48 cities located in the central region of São Paulo state, Brazil, were studied. All samples were subjected to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), 305 of which were taken from patients five days or less since the onset of symptoms, and were additionally subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of leptospirosis cases was 21 (1.04%), with 20 through MAT (18 for Icterohaemorrhagiae and two for the Cynopteri serogroup) and one through PCR (amplicon sequencing compatible with

We conducted a cross-sectional sero-survey in four urban slums in Salvador, Brazil, to characterize how poverty and sanitation contribute to the transmission of rat-borne leptospirosis. Sero-prevalence in the 1,318 participants ranged between 10.0 and 13.3%. We found that contact with environmental sources of contamination, rather than presence of rat reservoirs, is what leads to higher risk for residents living in areas with inadequate sanitation. Further, poorer residents may be exposed away from the household, and ongoing governmental interventions were not associated with lower transmission risk. Residents at higher risk were aware of their vulnerability, and their efforts improved the physical environment near their household, but did not reduce their infection chances. This study highlights the importance of understanding the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of risk, which ought to guide intervention efforts.","['Khalil H', 'Santana R', 'de Oliveira D', 'Palma F', 'Lustosa R', 'Eyre MT', 'Carvalho-Pereira T', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI', 'Diggle PJ', 'Alzate Lopez Y', 'Begon M', 'Costa F']",2021,15,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Khalil H, et al.

A 14-year-old-girl presented with fever and rash with history of redness of eyes, lips and tongue. Investigations showed anemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytosis with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, Interleukin-6, ferritin and d-dimer. Scrub typhus immunoglobulin M was positive. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was also elevated. A diagnosis of MIS-C with concomitant scrub typhus was proffered. Child received azithromycin, intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. After an afebrile period of 2.5 days, child developed unremitting fever and rash. Repeat investigations showed anemia, worsening lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia and hypofibrinogenemia which were consistent with a diagnosis of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). KD, MIS-C and MAS represent three distinct phenotypes of hyperinflammation seen in children during coronavirus disease pandemic. Several tropical infections may mimic or coexist with MIS-C which can be a diagnostic challenge for the treating physician.

33757897,Immune-enhanced effect of Iris polysaccharide is protective against leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira species, is an essential but neglected zoonosis. There are more than 300 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira, while inactivated bacteria offers only short-term serovar-specific protection. Leptospirosis treatment is mainly dependent on the use of antibiotics. However, the side effects of antibiotics and the risk of antibiotic resistance remain major problems. Thus, alternative agents which are fewer side effects on humans and efficient in leptospirosis would be welcome. Many studies have reported that polysaccharides could be used as immunostimulants in treating infection and cancer. In this study, we examined the protective effect of polysaccharides isolated from Iris against leptospirosis. To our knowledge, it is the first time to report Iris polysaccharides (IP) as an immunostimulant in treating infection. The results showed that IP treatment significantly increased the survival rate of hamsters challenged by a lethal dose of leptospires. Besides, the tissue injury and leptospiral load were reduced in IP-treated infection group compared with the untreated infection group at 4 days post-infection (p.i.). Intriguingly, IP treatment sustained intense immune response at 4 days p.i. analyzed by qPCR. The results exhibited that the gene expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was significantly increased in the group coinjected with IP and leptospires than in the infected controls. And the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α were also up-regulated after IP treatment, except the expression of IL-1β in the kidney. Our results not only broaden the medicinal value of Iris, but also provide a competent candidate for the control of Leptospira infection.","['Liu J', 'Xie X', 'Zhang W', 'Cao Y']",2021,154,,Microb Pathog,"Liu J, et al.

Next-generation sequencing has decreased in price and increased in scale, with the potential to democratize large-scale analysis of pathogens in resource-limited, low/middle-income (LMIC) regions. Consequently, the molecular classification of Leptospira, a pathogen disproportionately affecting LMIC countries, has changed dramatically over the last decade. Leptospira classification and molecular understandings of pathogen diversity have rapidly evolved, now most precisely based on core genome analysis supplemented by new insights provided by culture-independent methods directly using body fluids such as blood and urine. In places where leptospirosis disease burden is highest, genomic technologies have not been available, and serology-based methods remain the mainstay of leptospiral classification. Understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and ultimately new approaches to treating and preventing leptospirosis requires detailed knowledge of regionally circulating Leptospira in highly endemic settings. Next-generation sequencing-based, culture-independent typing overcomes the limitation of culture isolation of Leptospira from clinical samples, with promise of providing public health-actionable information applicable to leptospirosis-endemic LMIC settings.","['Agampodi SB', 'Vinetz JM']",2021,104,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Agampodi SB and Vinetz JM.

33752022,Monitoring the hepatic residues of cis- and trans-diastereoisomers of second generation anticoagulant rodenticides reveals a different bioaccumulation of diastereoisomers in the food chain of the Réunion harrier (Circus maillardi).,"The Réunion harrier is an endangered raptor and endemic species to the Réunion Island. Second generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) are widely used pesticides on the island in order to control rodent populations. The latter are responsible for the transmission of leptospirosis to humans, the damage of sugarcane crops, and the decline of endemic endangered birds. SGARs are very persistent chiral pesticides and consequent secondary exposure or poisoning of the Réunion harrier has been observed (73% of prevalence in a group of 58 harriers). Commercial formulations of SGARs are a mixture of trans- and cis-diastereoisomers. Both diastereoisomers of all SGARs have been shown to inhibit coagulation function with the same potency. On the other hand, they have been shown to have a significant difference in terms of tissue-persistence. This difference has led to residue levels in rats with a significantly lower proportion of one of the isomers compared to the bait composition. In this study, residue levels of the diastereoisomers of all SGARs were evaluated in the livers of 58 harrier carcasses. The respective concentrations and proportions of cis- and trans- diastereoisomers of all SGARs are presented. cis-Brodifacoum and trans-bromadiolone had the highest concentrations (up to 438 and 573 ng/g ww respectively), while trans-brodifacoum was less than 46 ng/g and cis-bromadiolone was barely detected. cis-Difenacoum showed the highest prevalence and the highest concentration was 82 ng/g ww, while trans-difenacoum was never detected. This study demonstrated that only cis-brodifacoum and trans-bromadiolone (and cis-difethialone, but with a low prevalence) had hepatic concentrations above a toxic threshold. The cis- and trans-diastereoisomers of SGARs had differential bioaccumulation in the food chain of the Réunion harrier compared to commercial baits. This suggests that a change of the proportions of SGARs diastereoisomers in baits could reduce the risk of secondary poisoning of predators, but maintain primary toxicity.","['Fourel I', 'Couzi FX', 'Lattard V']",2021,779,,Sci Total Environ,"Fourel I, et al.

33735490,Rat trade and leptospirosis: Molecular epidemiology of Leptospira species in rats exported from Cambodia to Vietnam.,"Rats are an important maintenance host of Leptospira spp., the causative agents of leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution. Rats are traded as food in the Mekong Delta, where Cambodia exports tons of rats to Vietnam. Handling wild rats is a potential health risk, but the information on Leptospira spp. carried by rats traded in the region remains limited. In this study, we investigated the carriage of Leptospira spp. in rats exported from Cambodia to Vietnam using bacterial culture, nested PCR and DNA sequencing. Isolates were then assessed using serological analysis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and Leptospira DNA detected in rat kidney tissues was also analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Seventy-two rats (2 Bandicota indica, 57 Rattus argentiventer, 11 R. losea, 1 R. norvegicus and 1 R. rattus) were subjected to bacterial culture, and three L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica isolates were obtained from R. argentiventer (5.3%). WGS revealed that although Cambodian isolates were genetically related to L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica strains widely distributed in East and South-East Asian countries, they formed a different cluster from other strains. In addition to the three L. borgpetersenii sequences, the flaB sequence of L. interrogans was detected in 18 R. argentiventer and 7 R. losea kidney tissue samples (38.9%) using nested PCR followed by DNA sequencing. The L. interrogans flaB-positive samples were further analysed by MLST, revealing that seven housekeeping genes (glmU, pntA, sucA, tpiA, pfkB, mreA and caiB) contained novel sequences with distinct lineages from other sequence types. This study revealed a high prevalence of Leptospira spp. among rats exported from Cambodia to Vietnam, indicating a potential risk to people engaging in rat trade and demonstrating that a fastidious L. interrogans strain circulates among Cambodian rats.","['Koizumi N', 'Morita M', 'Pheng V', 'Wann C', 'Masuoka H', 'Higa Y', 'Wada T', 'Hirayama K', 'Ohnishi M', 'Miura K']",2022,69,3,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Koizumi N, et al.

Leptospira PCR testing has become increasingly used in veterinary clinical medicine and these data might provide information on recent trends of disease occurrence.
OBJECTIVES: To identify and describe clusters of PCR-positive Leptospira test results in dogs in the United States.
ANIMALS: Leptospira real-time PCR test results from dogs (n = 40 118) in the United States from IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., between 2009 and 2016 were included in the analysis.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, spatio-temporal clusters for a real-time PCR-positive test were identified using the space-time permutation scan statistic and the centroid of the zip code reported for each test. A maximum spatial window of 20% of the population at risk, and a maximum temporal window of 6 months were used.
RESULTS: Seven statistically significant space-time clusters of Leptospira real-time PCR-positive test results were identified across the United States: 1 each located within the states of Arizona (2016), California (2014-2015), Florida (2010), South Carolina (2015), and 1 each located within the south-central region (2015), midwest region (2014), and northeast region (2011). Clusters ranged from 3 to 108 dogs and were identified during all years under study, except 2009, 2012, and 2013.

Diagnostic accuracy evaluations based on Leptospira ELISA mainly rely on hospitalized and severe patients; therefore, studies measuring the pathogen burden may be inaccurate in the community. We evaluated the Panbio Leptospira ELISA IgM among 656 febrile outpatients attending primary care in Chiangrai, Thailand, and Hlaing Tha Yar, Yangon, Myanmar. ELISA demonstrated limited diagnostic accuracy for the detection of acute leptospiral infection using the manufacturer recommended cutoff, with a sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 36.4%, and an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve value of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.41-0.89), compared with our reference test, the PCR assay. ELISA also performed poorly as a screening tool for detecting recent exposure to Leptospira spp. compared with the ""gold-standard"" microscopic agglutination test, with a specificity of 42.7%. We conclude that the utility of the Leptospira IgM ELISA for both serodiagnosis and seroprevalence is limited in our setting.","['Dhawan S', 'Althaus T', 'Lubell Y', 'Suwancharoen D', 'Blacksell SD']",2021,104,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Dhawan S, et al.

She had had fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the previous month. The patient showed signs of hypoperfusion, so a trans-thoracic echocardiography was done, demonstrating the presence of a cardiac tamponade. An emergency pericardiocentesis was performed, draining 500 ml of hematic content. Thoracic-abdominal computed tomography showed bilateral pleural effusion and also peritoneal effusion. Laboratory tests were compatible with an inflammatory situation with neutrophilic leukocytosis, alteration of hepatic function, and a plateau elevation of high-sensitivity troponin T. Colchicine was initiated but the evolution of the patient was torpid, making necessary the performance of a pericardial window due to an abrupt increase of pericardial effusion and echocardiographic signs of impending cardiac tamponade.

33706047,Kidney Injury Molecule-1 in the detection of early kidney injury in dogs with leptospirosis.,"Renal damage, a common feature in canine leptospirosis, ranges from a subclinical affection to kidney dysfunction and death. Chances of recovery can be improved by early intervention. However, traditional biomarkers (serum urea and creatinine) have limited relevance for precocity. Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) is a transmembrane protein upregulated in early stages of tubular injury. This study evaluated the use of urinary KIM-1 to detect early renal injury in naturally occurring canine leptospirosis. This exploratory research included 30 dogs divided into two groups: (1) dogs with leptospirosis (n = 25) and (2) healthy dogs (n = 5). Leptospira sp. infection was diagnosed through urine PCR and/or direct bacteriologic culture and/or serology (single MAT titters ≥800). Additionally, stage of infection was further characterized in acute and subacute phases based on the onset of clinical symptoms from 3 to 7 days. Urinary KIM-1 (uKIM-1) concentrations were measured in both groups with a commercial canine ELISA kit. uKIM-1 levels were statistically different (P < 0.01) between the studied groups, especially in non-azotemic dogs (P = 0.0042). The biomarker showed 88 % sensibility to diagnosis of kidney injury at> 1.49 ng/mL cut-off. Urine KIM-1 was negatively correlated with urine specific gravity (USG) but accompanied histopathological evidence of renal degeneration, necrosis and regeneration processes, extending information on kidney health. Measurement of KIM-1 in the urine of canine patients was able to detect naturally occurring acute and subacute leptospirosis accompanied by tubular injury in early non-azotemic infections.","['Dias CS', 'Paz LN', 'Solcà MS', 'Portela RWD', 'Bittencourt MV', 'Pinna MH']",2021,76,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Dias CS, et al.

33705392,Anti-Leptospira immunoglobulin profiling in mice reveals strain specific IgG and persistent IgM responses associated with virulence and renal colonization.,"Leptospira interrogans is a pathogenic spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, a neglected, zoonotic reemerging disease. Humans are sensitive hosts and may develop severe disease. Some animal species, such as rats and mice can become asymptomatic renal carriers. More than 350 leptospiral serovars have been identified, classified on the basis of the antibody response directed against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similarly to whole inactivated bacteria used as human vaccines, this response is believed to confer only short-term, serogroup-specific protection. The immune response of hosts against leptospires has not been thoroughly studied, which complicates the testing of vaccine candidates. In this work, we studied the immunoglobulin (Ig) profiles in mice infected with L. interrogans over time to determine whether this humoral response confers long-term protection after homologous challenge six months post-infection. Groups of mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2×107 leptospires of one of three pathogenic serovars (Manilae, Copenhageni or Icterohaemorrhagiae), attenuated mutants or heat-killed bacteria. Leptospira-specific immunoglobulin (IgA, IgM, IgG and 4 subclasses) produced in the first weeks up to 6 months post-infection were measured by ELISA. Strikingly, we found sustained high levels of IgM in mice infected with the pathogenic Manilae and Copenhageni strains, both colonizing the kidney. In contrast, the Icterohaemorrhagiae strain did not lead to kidney colonization, even at high dose, and triggered a classical IgM response that peaked at day 8 post-infection and disappeared. The virulent Manilae and Copenhageni serovars elicited high levels and similar profiles of IgG subclasses in contrast to Icterohaemorrhagiae strains that stimulated weaker antibody responses. Inactivated heat-killed Manilae strains elicited very low responses. However, all mice pre-injected with leptospires challenged with high doses of homologous bacteria did not develop acute leptospirosis, and all antibody responses were boosted after challenge. Furthermore, we showed that 2 months post-challenge, mice pre-infected with the attenuated M895 Manilae LPS mutant or heat-killed bacterin were completely protected against renal colonization. In conclusion, we observed a sustained IgM response potentially associated with chronic leptospiral renal infection. We also demonstrated in mice different profiles of protective and cross-reactive antibodies after L. interrogans infection, depending on the serovar and virulence of strains.","['Vernel-Pauillac F', 'Murray GL', 'Adler B', 'Boneca IG', 'Werts C']",2021,15,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Vernel-Pauillac F, et al.

33680388,A case with high bilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia during leptospirosis and a short review of similar cases.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is characterized by very diverse clinical manifestations, which may range from flu-like subclinical forms to very severe presentations characterized by multi-organ failure, or to atypical presentations. One of its most aggressive presentations is Weil's disease, characterized by jaundice, hemorrhagic phenomena and renal failure. Cases with high bilirubinemia over 30mg/dL are not communes in human leptospirosis. Our aims are to present an atypical case presentation of human leptospirosis, characterized by jaundice and hemolytic anemia, and to make a short review in PubMed for similar cases. At the same time we want to emphasize the diversity of the clinical presentation of human leptospirosis.
METHODS: A 54-year-old man presents at the emergency department of the infectious medicine with severe fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness. On exam, he was alert and well oriented; blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg and icteric. First blood examinations confirmed high bilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure.
RESULTS: Based on anamnestic and clinical evaluations, blood and serology examinations, the patient resulted with leptospirosis. The bilirubin reached 73.4mg/dL. At the same time on PubMed research we found only limited cases with leptospirosis associated with bilirubinemia over 30mg/dL and over less with hemolytic anemia.
CONCLUSION: Based on our clinical experience, as well as literature data, we suggest that clinicians should have a high index of suspicion in cases of jaundice with exposure possibilities for infectious diseases. Connection of high bilirubinemi over then 30mg/dL and hemolytic anemia in human leptospirosis is an unical case report.","['Puca E', 'Abazaj E', 'Pipero P', 'Harxhi A', 'Ferizaj R', 'Como N', 'Puca E']",2020,11,4,Caspian J Intern Med,"Puca E, et al.

33666800,Leptospira interrogans serogroup Pomona strains isolated from river buffaloes.,"At present, little is known regarding the prevalence of buffalo leptospirosis worldwide, especially with respect to which Leptospira strains may infect this animal species. Furthermore, most investigations into this disease in buffaloes have only been performed with serological studies. In Brazil, particularly in the Amazon, buffalo production is growing and is just as important as cattle production, although few studies have been performed on buffalo compared to cattle. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterise Leptospira strains from river buffaloes raised in the Brazilian Amazon region. We collected 109 kidney samples from slaughtered buffaloes raised in the Amazon Delta region of Brazil. The samples were analysed by bacteriological culture for the isolation of leptospires, and the obtained isolates were serologically and molecularly characterised by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), DNA sequencing and multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Five isolates were obtained, and in serogrouping analyses, these isolates were only reactive for the Pomona serogroup, with an observed titre of 25,600. The DNA sequencing results revealed that all the isolates belonged to the species Leptospira interrogans, and the MLVA results showed that the VNTR loci 4, 7 and 10 profile of all the isolates was 4-1-10. In this study, we observed that Pomona serogroup strains circulate in buffaloes in the Amazon, showing that in Brazil, buffaloes can be affected by Leptospira strains other than the Sejroe group, which are adapted to cattle.","['Guedes IB', 'de Souza GO', 'de Paula Castro JF', 'Cavalini MB', 'de Souza Filho AF', 'Maia ALP', 'Dos Reis EA', 'Cortez A', 'Heinemann MB']",2021,53,2,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Guedes IB, et al.

However, descriptions of such collaborations between the human, animal and environmental health sectors are still limited for French-speaking tropical countries. The objective of the current survey was to explore the diversity of OH experiences applied to research, surveillance and control of NTDs by scientists from French-speaking countries, and discuss their constraints and benefits. Six zoonotic NTDs were targeted: echinococcoses, trypanosomiases, leishmaniases, rabies, Taenia solium cysticercosis and leptospiroses. Invitations to fill in an online questionnaire were sent to members of francophone networks on NTDs and other tropical diseases. Results from the questionnaire were discussed during an international workshop in October 2019. The vast majority (98%) of the 171 respondents considered OH approaches relevant although only 64% had implemented them. Among respondents with OH experience, 58% had encountered difficulties mainly related to a lack of knowledge, interest and support for OH approaches by funding agencies, policy-makers, communities and researchers. Silos between disciplines and health sectors were still strong at both scientific and operational levels. Benefits were reported by 94% of respondents with OH experience, including increased intellectual stimulation, stronger collaborations, higher impact and cost-efficiency of interventions. Recommendations for OH uptake included advocacy, capacity-building, dedicated funding, and higher communities' involvement. Improved research coordination by NTD networks, production of combined human-animal health NTD impact indicators, and transversal research projects on diagnostic and reservoirs were also considered essential.","['Molia S', 'Saillard J', 'Dellagi K', 'Cliquet F', 'Bart JM', 'Rotureau B', 'Giraudoux P', 'Jannin J', 'Debré P', 'Solano P']",2021,15,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Molia S, et al.

33635995,Is Carriage of Leptospira interrogans by Rats Influenced by the Urban Environment or Population Density?,"Leptospira interrogans is one of the most important zoonotic pathogens globally. In urban settings, Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are important reservoirs of L. interrogans, but it is unclear how this bacterium is transmitted among rats. Both environmental features and rat population density may determine the prevalence of this pathogen in rat populations as well as the spillover risk to people. While these factors could play an important role in transmission between rats, it is unknown whether such factors influence prevalence among rats at a fine scale. Our objective was to determine if carriage of L. interrogans by rats could be explained by variation in the environment or in rat population density. Rats were live-trapped in a single neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada during two study periods (2011-12; 2016-17) and were tested for L. interrogans. The physical environment of each city block was recorded using a comprehensive, in-person environmental survey. Using generalized linear mixed modelling, we found no evidence of an association between carriage of L. interrogans and environmental features or rat population density, suggesting that these were not the primary drivers of its distribution among rats within this neighborhood. Understanding factors that promote L. interrogans transmission can be used to inform management approaches to minimize public health risks.","['Lee MJ', 'Byers KA', 'Donovan CM', 'Patrick DM', 'Himsworth CG']",2021,57,1,J Wildl Dis,"Lee MJ, et al.

33612804,The importance of using a right test method in diagnosing leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a common febrile illness in Malaysia. The disease is caused by pathogenic bacteria called leptospires that are transmitted directly or indirectly from animals to humans via contaminated water or soil. It is a potentially serious but treatable disease. Its symptoms may mimic those of other unrelated febrile illnesses such as dengue, influenza, meningitis, hepatitis or viral haemorrhagic fevers. The spectrum of the disease is extremely wide, ranging from subclinical infection to a severe syndrome of multiorgan infection with high mortality. The diagnosis requires high suspicion with history of exposure to water or environment possibly contaminated with infected animal urine. This is a case of a 13 year-oldgirl with no known medical illness, and a history of exposure to outdoor activities. However, paired sera for leptospirosis serology was not diagnostic. She then developed septic shock on day 14 of illness. But due to high suspicion of leptospirosis, antibiotic therapy was upgraded to ceftriaxone and samples were sent for further testing which revealed that leptospires were detected in the urine, using molecular technique. She improved after treated as leptospirosis.","['Ilham NE', 'Joseph NSM', 'Bahtiar Affendy N', 'Mohd Taib N', 'Vasantha KN', 'Masri SN']",2020,37,2,Trop Biomed,"Ilham NE, et al.

33612725,Leptospirosis: An insight into community structure of small mammal's host in urban environment.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira and most often acquired through contact with environments contaminated with leptospires shed in the urine of infected mammals. In urban environment, rodents are well-known as the main carriers of this bacteria, however there were no intensive study on the population structure of these animals, and how it associated with this disease. Hence, we use a case study from an outbreak in a residential area in Selangor, Malaysia, to investigate how community structure of small mammals, associated with the prevalence of Leptospira. One hundred cage traps were placed randomly in and around these houses in five phases with two months interval for a year. Community structures (species, sex, and age) were assigned for each individual, prior to screening for pathogenic Leptospira, using a partial lipL32 gene from the kidney samples. 185 small mammals from four species were captured, Rattus norvegicus (74.5%, N=138), R. rattus (20%, N=37), Tupaia glis (5%, N=9), and Suncus murinus (0.5%, N=1). From this number, 29 individuals were found PCR positive for pathogenic Leptospira (R. norvegicus, N=20; R. rattus, N=6; T. glis, N=2; S. murinus, N=1).

We investigated the frequency of Leptospira spp. and hantavirus single and double infections in small mammals from 22 sites in Thuringia, central Germany, during 2017. TULV infections were detected at 18 of 22 sites (mean prevalence 13.8%, 93/674). PUUV infections were detected at four of 22 sites (mean prevalence 1.5%, 7/471), and respective PUUV sequences formed a novel phylogenetic clade, but DOBV infections were not detected at all. Leptospira infections were detected at 21 of 22 sites with the highest overall prevalence in field voles (Microtus agrestis) with 54.5% (6/11) and common voles (Microtus arvalis) with 30.3% (205/676). Leptospira-hantavirus coinfections were found in 6.6% (44/671) of common voles but only in two of 395 bank voles. TULV and Leptospira coinfection probability in common voles was driven by individual (age) and population-level factors. Coinfections seemed to be particularly associated with sites where Leptospira spp. prevalence exceeded 35%. Future investigations should evaluate public health consequences of this strong spatial clustering of coinfections.","['Jeske K', 'Jacob J', 'Drewes S', 'Pfeffer M', 'Heckel G', 'Ulrich RG', 'Imholt C']",2021,149,,Epidemiol Infect,"Jeske K, et al.

33610240,Evaluation of TaqMan based real-time PCR assay targeting LipL32 gene for leptospirosis in serologically positive human urine samples from north India.,"PURPOSE: Rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis, through culture and/or serology, can be difficult without proper expertise and is often delayed because of the length of time required to obtain results. In India, especially in north India; leptospirosis is a grossly underreported disease, probably due to the lack of diagnostic modalities and lack of awareness of the disease among physicians. In this study, we aimed to identify leptospires in urine samples from serologically positive patients of leptospirosis through TaqMan based Real-time PCR using the LipL32 gene. Although environmental conditions are suitable in north India nowadays, very few studies were there and none by real-time PCR.
METHOD: A total of 50 urine and blood samples (40 seropositive and 10 seronegative by IgM ELISA) were recruited in the study. Urine samples were tested by real-time PCR to detect Leptospira DNA and blood samples were used for microscopic agglutination test (MAT) evaluation.
RESULT: We were able to detect leptospires in 20% (10/50) cases using our real-time PCR assay. In all 10 PCR positive urine samples, the LipL32 gene was detected and the lower limit of detection in L. interrogans DNA was found to be 20 GE/μL with a 95% cutoff value.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that this real-time PCR assay with high specificity and sensitivity less prone to contamination may prove to be a promising approach for diagnosing acute leptospires in urine samples in the second week of acute febrile illness due to leptospiruria starts approximately in the second week of illness.","['Shukla S', 'Mittal V', 'Singh P', 'Singh A']",2021,39,1,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Shukla S, et al.

33606698,A prospective study to evaluate the accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosis of human leptospirosis: Result from THAI-LEPTO AKI study.,"BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have become widely used in low-resource settings for leptospirosis diagnostic. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the five commercially available RDTs to detect human IgM against Leptospira spp. in Thai population.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ninety-nine serum samples from Leptospirosis suspicious patients were tested with five RDTs, including Medical Science Public Health, Leptocheck-WB, SD bioline, TRUSTline, and J.Mitra. The case definition was based on MAT, qPCR, and culture results. Diagnostic accuracy was determined based on the first day of enrollment in an overall analysis and stratified according to days post-onset of fever. The five RDTs had overall sensitivity ranging from 1.8% to 75% and specificity ranging from 52.3% to 97.7%. Leptocheck-WB had high sensitivity of 75.0%. The sensitivity of five RDTs increased on days 4-6 post-onset of fever, while the specificity of all tests remained relatively stable at different days post-onset of fever.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The tested RDTs showed low sensitivity. Therefore, based on the present study, five commercially available RDTs might not be an appropriate test for acute leptospirosis screening in the Thai population.","['Dinhuzen J', 'Limothai U', 'Tachaboon S', 'Krairojananan P', 'Laosatiankit B', 'Boonprasong S', 'Lumlertgul N', 'Peerapornratana S', 'Srisawat N']",2021,15,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Dinhuzen J, et al.

33593468,Development of a low-cost copro-LAMP assay for simultaneous copro-detection of Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati.,"Toxocariasis is a zoonotic disease caused mainly by Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati and diagnosis in dogs and cats is an important tool for its control. For this reason, a new coprological loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed for the simultaneous detection of these species. The primer set was designed on a region of the mitochondrial cox-1 gene. Amplification conditions were evaluated using a temperature gradient (52°C to 68°C), different incubation times (15–120 min), and different concentrations of malachite green dye (0.004–0.4% w/v). The analytical sensitivity was evaluated with serial dilutions of genomic DNA from T. canis and T. cati adult worms, and with serial dilutions of DNA extracted from feces using a low-cost in-house method. The specificity was evaluated using genomic DNA from Canis lupus familiaris, Felis catus, Escherichia coli, Toxascaris leonina, Ancylostoma caninum, Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto and Taenia hydatigena. The LAMP assay applied to environmental fecal samples from an endemic area showed an analytical sensitivity of 10–100 fg of genomic DNA and 10−5 serial dilutions of DNA extracted from feces using the low-cost in-house method; with a specificity of 100%. Additionally, the total development of the assay was carried out in a basic laboratory and per-reaction reagent cost decreased by ~80%. This new, low-cost tool can help identify the most common agents of toxocariasis in endemic areas in order to manage prevention strategies without having to rely on a laboratory with sophisticated equipment.","['Avila HG', 'Risso MG', 'Ruybal P', 'Repetto SA', 'Butti MJ', 'Trangoni MD', 'Grune Löffler S', 'Pérez VM', 'Periago MV']",2021,148,7,Parasitology,"Avila HG, et al.

33593210,Still 'dairy farm fever'? A Bayesian model for leptospirosis notification data in New Zealand.,"Routinely collected public health surveillance data are often partially complete, yet remain a useful source by which to monitor incidence and track progress during disease intervention. In the 1970s, leptospirosis in New Zealand (NZ) was known as 'dairy farm fever' and the disease was frequently associated with serovars Hardjo and Pomona. To reduce infection, interventions such as vaccination of dairy cattle with these two serovars was implemented. These interventions have been associated with significant reduction in leptospirosis incidence, however, livestock-based occupations continue to predominate notifications. In recent years, diagnosis is increasingly made by nucleic acid detection which currently does not provide serovar information. Serovar information can assist in linking the recognized maintenance host, such as livestock and wildlife, to infecting serovars in human cases which can feed back into the design of intervention strategies. In this study, confirmed and probable leptospirosis notification data from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2016 were used to build a model to impute the number of cases from different occupational groups based on serovar and month of occurrence. We imputed missing occupation and serovar data within a Bayesian framework assuming a Poisson process for the occurrence of notified cases. The dataset contained 1430 notified cases, of which 927 had a specific occupation (181 dairy farmers, 45 dry stock farmers, 454 meatworkers, 247 other) while the remaining 503 had non-specified occupations. Of the 1430 cases, 1036 had specified serovars (231 Ballum, 460 Hardjo, 249 Pomona, 96 Tarassovi) while the remaining 394 had an unknown serovar. Thus, 47% (674/1430) of observations had both a serovar and a specific occupation. The results show that although all occupations have some degree of under-reporting, dry stock farmers were most strongly affected and were inferred to contribute as many cases as dairy farmers to the burden of disease, despite dairy farmer being recorded much more frequently. Rather than discard records with some missingness, we have illustrated how mathematical modelling can be used to leverage information from these partially complete cases. Our finding provides important evidence for reassessing the current minimal use of animal vaccinations in dry stock. Improving the capture of specific farming type in case report forms is an important next step.","['Benschop J', 'Nisa S', 'Spencer SEF']",2021,18,175,J R Soc Interface,"Benschop J, et al.

The determination of anti-Leptospira antibodies was obtained by microscopic agglutination test. Seropositivity was defined from titles > 1:100. Seropositivity of anti-Leptospira antibodies among the population was 46.8% (176/374) (95% Cl 41.9-52.1). Thirty-nine percent (146/74) of the analyzed serum reacted to the Hardjo serovar (Sejröe serogroup). Eighty-eight percent (8/9) slaughterhouse workers tested were seropositive. Those who belonged to an ethnic group had OR 1.78 (IC 1.02-3.11, P = 0.041). Seropositivity was associated with having a secondary school level or lower, with OR 1.79 (IC 0.97-3.29, P = 0.058).

33555432,Identification of Leptospira spp. in the animal-environment interface (swine-water) in pig production cycle.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis, caused by Leptospira spp., is a zoonosis with multiple hosts and reservoirs. Thus, the ""One Health"" approach must be addressed in order to guide prevention and control measures regarding this microorganism. There are few studies involving all stages of the pig production cycle and potential sources of infection such as water sources, which could represent a risk for local rural communities.
OBJECTIVE: To identify Leptospira spp. in the animal-environment interface (swine-water) in the pig production cycle.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in a swine farm in Puerto López in the department of Meta, Colombia. Swine blood samples (n = 65) were collected for microscopic agglutination test (MAT), while urine and water samples (n = 80) were tested for Leptospira using bacterial isolation, serotyping of the isolates, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: A total of 58 (89.2%) porcine sera were positive for at least one Leptospira serogroup, with Grippotyphosa as the most frequent serogroup. Leptospira spp. were isolated in 25% (20/80) of the urine and water samples. Leptospira-positive cultures were 100% (20/20) identified within the genus Leptospira (rrl gene) and 50% (10/20) corresponded to pathogenic species (lipL32 gene) by PCR, and 45% (9/20) were positive to at least one antiserum. None of the direct urine and water samples was positive by PCR.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the bacteria might be transmitted in the animal-environment interface in the pig production cycle.","['Ospina-Pinto MC', 'Hernández-Rodríguez P']",2021,53,1,Trop Anim Health Prod,Ospina-Pinto MC and Hernández-Rodríguez P.

33547388,"Human, animal, water source interactions and leptospirosis in Thailand.","In Thailand, leptospirosis is primarily associated with those who work in agricultural occupations. Leptospirosis control is hampered by a poor understanding of the complex interactions between humans, animal reservoirs, Leptospira, and the variable spatial environment in which these factors coexist. We aimed to address key knowledge gaps concerning leptospirosis disease dynamics and the human-animal-water-source interface in two high-risk areas in Thailand. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 746 study participants in two high-risk areas for leptospirosis in Thailand: Sisaket (SSK) and Nakhon Si Thammarat (NST). Interactions among humans, animals and water sources were quantified and analyzed. The presence of different animal species and thus contact patterns were different in NST and SSK. The consumption of water from the shared sources between the two areas was different. Those whose occupations were related to animals or environmental water and those who consumed water from more than two sources were more likely to have been infected with leptospirosis, with adjusted odds ratios 4.31 (95% CI 1.17-15.83) and 10.74 (95% CI 2.28-50.53), respectively.

33538356,Discriminant value of automated leucocyte VCS parameters in the detection of tropical infections.,"INTRODUCTION: In India, infectious diseases are a leading treatable cause of morbidity and mortality. Mangalore being endemic to many vector-borne diseases, their incidence is known to show seasonal variations with sharp increase during monsoon. Leucocytes have substantial role in the immunological pathogenesis of infections.
METHODS: The present series was a hospital-based cross-sectional study performed in a tertiary care hospital for a period of three months from June-August wherein the cell population data of cases of malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid and rickettsial infections along with equal number of healthy controls were collected and analysed. Effectiveness of leucocyte-related volume (V), conductivity (C) and scatter (S) parameters by Coulter®DXH800 haematology analyser in predicting these infections was appraised.
RESULTS: A total of 324 cases comprising of malaria (50%), dengue (30.9%), leptospirosis (13.9%), typhoid (4.0%) and rickettsial infections (1.2%) were included. There was statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in the mean values of complete blood count parameters-haemoglobin, total leucocyte count, red blood cell count, haematocrit, red cell distribution width, differential leucocyte count, platelet count and plateletcrit between cases and controls and also between specific infections. The mean volumes of neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte were considerably increased in malaria and dengue fever compared to leptospirosis, typhoid and rickettsial infections. VCS parameters were the least altered in typhoid fever, except for a strikingly high conductivity and scatter of eosinophils.
CONCLUSIONS: Haematological analysis is a part of routine evaluation of any case of febrile illness. This study showed that there are specific alterations in VCS parameters in different types of infections such as malaria, dengue, leptospira, typhoid and rickettsia, the information and analysis of which comes without any additional cost.","['Muthunatarajan S', 'Basavaiah SH', 'Shenoy SM', 'Natarajan A', 'Mithra P', 'Suresh PK', 'Sreeram S']",2021,35,4,J Clin Lab Anal,"Muthunatarajan S, et al.

Characterizing knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among high-risk groups is important to develop appropriate prevention programs. Here, we performed a cross-sectional study among 300 visitors of a recreational forest in Malaysia to examine leptospirosis KAP and demographics. These variables were integrated to create knowledge and practice scores for each respondent. All respondents had heard about leptospirosis, and 87% of them correctly identified it as a disease. The majority of respondents had high knowledge (63%), positive attitude, and good practice (68%) toward prevention of the disease. However, there were gaps in knowledge, with 78% of the respondents indicating eating without washing hands as the major cause of leptospirosis transmission. Our final model identified that higher knowledge score was associated with higher practice score. Our results indicate that it is important to increase knowledge, especially on transmission routes of leptospirosis, among visitors in recreational areas. Moreover, more attention needs to be paid to promote good practice habits among visitors, targeting those at higher risk of being infected by leptospirosis to prevent potential outbreaks in the recreational areas.","['Shafie NJ', 'Abdul Halim NS', 'Nor Zalipah M', 'Mohd Amin NAZ', 'Syed Esa SM', 'Md-Nor S', 'Casanovas-Massana A', 'Ko AI', 'Palma F', 'Neves Souza F', 'Costa F']",2021,104,4,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Shafie NJ, et al.

In this study, the genes involved in the LPS biosynthesis were analyzed and compared by bioinformatics tools. Also, the chemical composition analysis of leptospiral lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from 5 pathogenic serovars like Autumnalis, Australis, Ballum, Grippotyphosa, Pomona, and the nonpathogenic serovar Andamana was performed. Methods used were Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (LAL), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). LAL assay showed a significantly higher level of endotoxicity among pathogenic serovars (~0.490 EU/mL) than that of nonpathogenic Andamana (~0.102 EU/mL). FAMES analysis showed the presence of palmitic acid (C16:0), hydroxy lauric acid (3-OH-C12:0), and oleic acid (C18:0). Palmitoleic acid (C16: 1), and 3- hydroxy palmitate (3-OH-C16:0) was detected only in pathogenic serovars. In contrast myristoleic acid (C14:1) and stearic acid (C18:0) were present in Andamana. FTIR analysis revealed C-O-C stretch of esters, 3°ROH functional groups and carbohydrate vibration range were similar among pathogenic serovars. The NMR analysis reveals similarity for 6 deoxy sugars and methyl groups of Autumnalis, Australis, and Ballum. Further, the presence of palmitoleic acid and 3-hydroxy palmitate may be the significant pathogen-associated predisposing factor.

33527732,Urinary shedding of leptospires in palearctic bats.,"Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic infection of worldwide occurrence. Bats, like other mammalian reservoirs, may be long-term carriers that maintain endemicity of infection and shed viable leptospires in urine. Direct and/or indirect contact with these Leptospira shedders is the main risk factor as regards public health concern. However, knowledge about bat leptospirosis in the Palearctic Region, and in Europe in particular, is poor. We collected urine from 176 specimens of 11 bat species in the Czech Republic, Poland, Republic of Armenia and the Altai Region of Russia between 2014 and 2019. We extracted DNA from the urine samples to detect Leptospira spp. shedders using PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA and LipL32 genes. Four bat species (Barbastella barbastellus n = 1, Myotis bechsteinii n = 1, Myotis myotis n = 24 and Myotis nattereri n = 1) tested positive for Leptospira spp., with detected amplicons showing 100% genetic identity with pathogenic Leptospira interrogans. The site- and species-specific prevalence range was 0%-24.1% and 0%-20%, respectively. All bats sampled in the Republic of Armenia and Russia were negative. Given the circulation of pathogenic leptospires in strictly protected Palearctic bat species and their populations, non-invasive and non-lethal sampling of urine for molecular Leptospira spp. detection is recommended as a suitable surveillance and monitoring strategy. Moreover, our results should raise awareness of this potential disease risk among health professionals, veterinarians, chiropterologists and wildlife rescue workers handling bats, as well as speleologists and persons cleaning premises following bat infestation.","['Seidlova V', 'Nemcova M', 'Pikula J', 'Bartonička T', 'Ghazaryan A', 'Heger T', 'Kokurewicz T', 'Orlov OL', 'Patra S', 'Piacek V', 'Treml F', 'Zukalova K', 'Zukal J']",2021,68,6,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Seidlova V, et al.

Bovine leptospirosis is a serious economic problem for cattle production, causing abortions, reduced milk yield, mortality in calves and decreased daily weight gain. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with sonicated Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae serovar Copenhageni M 20. We evaluated its performance for the detection of specific antibodies against multiple Leptospira serogroups in bovine. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used as the gold standard. The performance of this ELISA was evaluated with a panel of sera (118 MAT confirmed positive and 97 MAT negative). The overall sensitivity was close to 85.6 % and the specificity was 83.5 %, according to the MAT reference method. Analytical specificity of the IgG-ELISA was evaluated using 50 bovine serum samples from animals showing serum antibodies against other pathogens that cause abortion in bovine, such as Brucella sp., Neospora sp. and Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD), and no cross-reaction was observed.

Pathogenic mechanisms of leptospirosis remain poorly understood mainly because targeted mutations or gene silencing in pathogenic Leptospira continues to be inherently inefficient, laborious, costly and difficult to implement. In addition, pathogenic leptospires are highly fastidious and the selection of mutants on solid agar media can take up to 6 weeks. The catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) is an RNA-guided DNA-binding protein from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR/Cas system and can be used for gene silencing, in a strategy termed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi).

This work also established prediction models based on empirical findings. Panel regression models with random-effect and fixed-effect specifications were used to investigate the association between the remotely sensed environmental factors and the leptospirosis incidence. The Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics were also applied to detect the spatial patterns of leptospirosis and similar results were found (the R2 values of the random-effect and fixed-effect models were 0.3686 and 0.3684, respectively). The outcome thus indicates that remotely sensed environmental factors possess statistically significant contribution in predicting this disease. The highest association in 3 years was observed in LST (random- effect coefficient = -9.787, P<0.001; fixed-effect coefficient = -10.340, P=0.005) followed by rainfall (random-effect coefficient = 1.353, P<0.001; fixed-effect coefficient = 1.347, P<0.001) and NTL density (random-effect coefficient = -0.569, P=0.004; fixed-effect coefficient = -0.564, P=0.001). All results obtained from the bivariate LISA statistics indicated the localised associations between remotely sensed environmental factors and the incidence of leptospirosis. Particularly, LISA's results showed that the border provinces in the northeast, the northern and the southern regions displayed clusters of high leptospirosis incidence. All obtained outcomes thus show that remotely sensed environmental factors can be applied to panel regression models for incidence prediction, and these indicators can also identify the spatial concentration of leptospirosis in Thailand.","['Luenam A', 'Puttanapong N']",2020,15,2,Geospat Health,Luenam A and Puttanapong N.

33452273,The effects of flooding and weather conditions on leptospirosis transmission in Thailand.,"The epidemic of leptospirosis in humans occurs annually in Thailand. In this study, we have developed mathematical models to investigate transmission dynamics between humans, animals, and a contaminated environment. We compared different leptospire transmission models involving flooding and weather conditions, shedding and multiplication rate in a contaminated environment. We found that the model in which the transmission rate depends on both flooding and temperature, best-fits the reported human data on leptospirosis in Thailand. Our results indicate that flooding strongly contributes to disease transmission, where a high degree of flooding leads to a higher number of infected individuals. Sensitivity analysis showed that the transmission rate of leptospires from a contaminated environment was the most important parameter for the total number of human cases. Our results suggest that public education should target people who work in contaminated environments to prevent Leptospira infections.","['Chadsuthi S', 'Chalvet-Monfray K', 'Wiratsudakul A', 'Modchang C']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Chadsuthi S, et al.

33413126,Leptospira in river and soil in a highly endemic area of Ecuador.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospira are shed into the environment via urine of infected animals. Rivers are thought to be an important risk factor for transmission to humans, though much is unknown about the types of environment or characteristics that favor survival. To address this, we screened for Leptospira DNA in two rivers in rural Ecuador where Leptospirosis is endemic.
RESULTS: We collected 112 longitudinal samples and recorded pH, temperature, river depth, precipitation, and dissolved oxygen. We also performed a series of three experiments designed to provide insight into Leptospira presence in the soil. In the first soil experiment, we characterized prevalence and co-occurrence of Leptospira with other bacterial taxa in the soil at dispersed sites along the rivers (n = 64). In the second soil experiment, we collected 24 river samples and 48 soil samples at three points along eight transects to compare the likelihood of finding Leptospira in the river and on the shore at different distances from the river. In a third experiment, we tested whether Leptospira presence is associated with soil moisture by collecting 25 soil samples from two different sites. In our river experiment, we found pathogenic Leptospira in only 4 (3.7%) of samples. In contrast, pathogenic Leptospira species were found in 22% of shore soil at dispersed sites, 16.7% of soil samples (compared to 4.2% of river samples) in the transects, and 40% of soil samples to test for associations with soil moisture.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data are limited to two sites in a highly endemic area, but the scarcity of Leptospira DNA in the river is not consistent with the widespread contention of the importance of river water for leptospirosis transmission. While Leptospira may be shed directly into the river, onto the shores, or washed into the river from more remote sites, massive dilution and limited persistence in rivers may reduce the environmental load and therefore, the epidemiological significance of such sources. It is also possible that transmission may occur more frequently on shores where people are liable to be barefoot. Molecular studies that further explore the role of rivers and water bodies in the epidemiology of leptospirosis are needed.","['Miller E', 'Barragan V', 'Chiriboga J', 'Weddell C', 'Luna L', 'Jiménez DJ', 'Aleman J', 'Mihaljevic JR', 'Olivas S', 'Marks J', 'Izurieta R', 'Nieto N', 'Keim P', 'Trueba G', 'Caporaso JG', 'Pearson T']",2021,21,1,BMC Microbiol,"Miller E, et al.

The infection has a broad range of effects, from mild clinical manifestation to multiple organ failure, and ultimately death. A 5-months-old male unvaccinated dog was admitted to the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital presenting dullness, dehydration, jaundiced mucous, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and hyporexia. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) detected serological titers of 1:1.600 for serogroup Canicola. After five days of monitoring by the medical team he developed fever and swelling of carpal and tarsal joints, accompanied by functional limitation. Initial antimicrobial treatment was instituted for leptospirosis. Polyarthritis responsiveness to glucocorticoid therapy was observed through decreasing signs of inflammation of the affected joints. The diagnosis of leptospirosis was further confirmed by molecular investigation for Leptospira spp. on blood and synovial fluid samples. Amplification and sequencing of the secY partial gene characterized the infective bacterial as Leptospira interrogans. From the 7th day the respiratory condition worsened and on Day 14 the patient evolved to death, when necropsy and histological evaluation were performed. Prominent anatomopathological findings included: fibrinous polyarthritis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, intense hepatocyte dissociation, cholestasis, and periportal multifocal hepatitis, diffuse acute tubular necrosis, and significant dystrophic mineralization in the renal parenchyma, lungs, and atrial endocardium.

33378129,Suspected hepatotoxicity secondary to trazodone therapy in a dog.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of suspected hepatotoxicity in a dog secondary to administration of trazodone.
CASE SUMMARY: A 6-year-old, neutered, mixed breed dog was evaluated for a progressive increased liver enzyme activity over a 6-week period. The patient originally presented for raisin toxicosis, and hence, was having serial blood work monitoring performed. Trazodone was initially started at that time due to severe separation anxiety while hospitalized (consistently 5 out of 7 days of the week, for a 6-week duration). Due to continued increased liver enzyme activity, extensive workup was performed which included abdominal ultrasound, leptospirosis titers, bile acids, and liver biopsies. Histopathologic findings were consistent with acute hepatotoxicity. In the absence of other toxicants and the close proximity to drug administration, a drug-induced hepatopathy secondary to trazodone was presumed. Following discontinuation of trazodone therapy, the hepatopathy completely resolved and the patient fully recovered.
NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED: While acute hepatotoxicity has been reported in human medicine secondary to the administration of trazodone, this is the first reported case of suspected hepatotoxicity in a dog secondary to trazodone therapy. Veterinary professionals should be aware of the rare potential adverse effect that may be seen in canine patients secondary to trazodone therapy. Appropriate clinicopathologic monitoring should occur in patients on chronic trazodone therapy.","['Arnold A', 'Davis A', 'Wismer T', 'Lee JA']",2021,31,1,J Vet Emerg Crit Care (San Antonio),"Arnold A, et al.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted from 11 March to 4 May 2020 in the only intensive care unit (ICU) authorised to manage COVID-19 patients in Reunion Island, a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean region. All patients with unknown COVID-19 status were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on ICU admission; those who tested negative were transferred to the COVID-19-free area of the ICU.
RESULTS: Over the study period, 99 patients were admitted to our ICU. A total of 33 patients were hospitalised in the COVID-19 isolation ward, of whom 11 were positive for COVID-19. The main differential diagnoses of severe COVID-19 were as follows: community-acquired pneumonia, dengue, leptospirosis causing intra-alveolar haemorrhage and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The median age of COVID-19-positive patients was higher than that of COVID-19-negative patients (71 [58-74] vs. 54 [46-63.5] years, P = 0.045). No distinguishing clinical, biological or radiological characteristics were found between the two groups of patients. All COVID-19-positive patients had recently travelled or been in contact with a recent traveller.

33347965,Inactivation of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 by pathogenic Leptospira.,"Leptospires are aerobic, Gram-negative spirochetes with a high invasive capacity. Pathogenic leptospires secrete proteases that inactivate a variety of host's proteins including molecules of the extracellular matrix and of the human complement system. This strategy, used by several pathogens of medical importance, contributes to bacterial invasion and immune evasion. In the current work we present evidence that Leptospira proteases also target human cathelicidin (LL-37), an antimicrobial peptide that plays an important role in the innate immune response. By using six Leptospira strains, four pathogenic and two saprophytic, we demonstrated that proteases present in the supernatants of pathogenic strains were capable of degrading LL-37 in a time-dependent manner, whereas proteolytic degradation was not observed with the supernatants of the two saprophytic strains. Inactivation of LL-37 was prevented by using the 1,10-phenanthroline inhibitor, thus suggesting the involvement of metalloproteinases in this process. In addition, the antibacterial activity of LL-37 against two Leptospira strains was evaluated. Compared to the saprophytic strain, a greater resistance of the pathogenic strain to the action of the peptide was observed. Our data suggest that the capacity to inactivate the host defense peptide LL-37 may be part of the virulence arsenal of pathogenic Leptospira, and we hypothesize that its inactivation by the bacteria may influence the outcome of the disease.","['Oliveira PN', 'Courrol DS', 'Chura-Chambi RM', 'Morganti L', 'Souza GO', 'Franzolin MR', 'Wunder EA', 'Heinemann MB', 'Barbosa AS']",2021,150,,Microb Pathog,"Oliveira PN, et al.

33333213,Incidence of leptospirosis in the French armed forces from 2004 to 2018: Retrospective analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The French military personnel may be exposed to leptospirosis during their training or on duty on the field in continental France, and most of all, in intertropical areas in the French departments and in Africa. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of leptospirosis from epidemiological surveillance and cases data from 2004 to 2018, and to propose tools to assess leptospirosis risk prior to any mission or leisure activity.
METHOD: A retrospective epidemiological study on leptospirosis cases among French Armed Forces was conducted. More data were collected for 2 clusters in Martinique, as most of leptospirosis cases among French military personnel were identified in Martinique.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight cases of leptospirosis were reported, 15 cases in continental France and 73 cases in overseas (including 42 cases in the French West Indies). The global leptospirosis incidence rate in continental France was 0.3/100,000 person-years and in overseas 24/100,000 person-years with the higher incidence rate in Martinique (99/100,000 person-years) and in Mayotte (36.9/100,000 person-years). For the clusters in Martinique, between January and June 2009, 7 cases were declared; between 2016 and 2018, 16 cases were reported, high proportions of severe cardiac, renal and neurological forms (6/16) and hospitalizations (9/16).
CONCLUSION: The occupational risk is real in French Armed Forces, particularly in malaria-free intertropical areas where chemoprophylaxis by doxycycline is not applied. Prevention can be optimized by the use of practical tools such as tables and cartographies, leading to a better leptospirosis risk assessment and application of preventive recommendations.","['Gentile G', 'Tong C', 'Renaud C', 'Menoud N', 'Casanova L', 'Blatteau JE', 'Christen JR', 'Texier G', 'Mayet A', 'Simon F']",2021,39,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Gentile G, et al.

33332656,An overview on the molecular diagnosis of animal leptospirosis.,"The most common presentation of animal leptospirosis is the subclinical and silent chronic form, that can lead to important reproductive disorders. The diagnosis of this chronic form remains a challenge. The aim of the present study is to gather and critically analyse the current information about molecular tools applied to animal leptospirosis diagnosis, particularly the silent chronic presentation of the infection. Regarding clinical specimens, samples from urinary tract were the most used (69/102, 67·7%), while few studies (12/102, 11·8%) investigated samples from reproductive tract. Concerning the molecular methods applied, the most used is still the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (46/102, 45%), followed by real-time PCR (38/102, 37·2%). The lipL32 gene is currently the most common target used for Leptospira detection, with 48% of studies applying this genetic marker. From all the studies, only few (21/102, 20·5%) performed gene sequencing. According to the majority of authors, current evidence suggests that lipL32-PCR is useful for an initial screening for Leptospira DNA detection in animal clinical samples. Posteriorly, if DNA sequencing could be performed on positive lipL32-PCR samples, we encourage the use of secY gene as a genetic marker. The molecular methods appear as the most important tools for the diagnosis of the chronic silent leptospirosis on domestic animals, reinforcing its evident impact not only on animal reproduction but also on a One Health context.","['Di Azevedo MIN', 'Lilenbaum W']",2021,72,5,Lett Appl Microbiol,Di Azevedo MIN and Lilenbaum W.

The rose Bengal test and a commercial competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) were used to detect Brucella spp. exposure, and the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with 22 live serovars was used to determine anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies. We found evidence of Brucella spp. exposure in 3 of 35 (8.6%) SESs tested via the c-ELISA displaying high percentage inhibition (PI), similar to other studies in pinnipeds in which Brucella spp. antibodies have been determined. Two of the 3 positives were pups (PI = 70.4 and 86.6%), while the third was an adult female (PI = 48.8%). The 3 c-ELISA positive SESs were additionally tested via the serum agglutination test but were found to be negative. All individuals were negative for antibodies against 22 Leptospira spp. serovars by MAT. These results contribute to the knowledge and monitoring of zoonotic pathogens with epizootic potential in Southern Ocean pinnipeds. Given the potential impact that pathogens may have on the abundance of wild (sometimes threatened and endangered) populations, constant monitoring and surveillance are required to prevent pathogen spread, particularly under forecast climate change scenarios.","['Sánchez-Sarmiento AM', 'Ruoppolo V', 'Muelbert MM', 'Ferreira Neto JS', 'Catão-Dias JL']",2020,142,,Dis Aquat Organ,"Sánchez-Sarmiento AM, et al.

33292631,Relevance of Leptospira in boar and for the development of alternative antimicrobial concepts in boar semen preservation.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of importance to public health and in livestock productions. It causes significant economic losses in pig breeding farms worldwide. However, actual transmission cycles and disease epidemiology in the pig population remain largely unknown. Despite the fact that the potential risk of venereal transmission of pathogenic Leptospira serovars in pigs has been a topic of discussion since the 1970s, reliable data are still lacking compared to other livestock species. Consequently, antibiotics are added to semen extenders to reduce bacterial contamination including pathogens like Leptospira. In view of the global threat of antimicrobial resistances, the routine use of antibiotics in porcine semen extenders is now under debate. Information about the prevalence of Leptospira infections in boar used for artificial insemination is needed for the development of novel antimicrobial concepts in pig insemination.This short report provides a summary of the state of knowledge, together with negative results from real-time PCR analyses for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira DNA in boar semen. Molecular analyses were performed on 96 raw and extended samples obtained from normospermic ejaculates of 58 boar housed in six different studs in Germany. In the absence of reliable data, it is important to raise the awareness for a subject that can represent a challenge for pig productions in keeping reproductive health and food safety at high levels. The present molecular results indicate that Leptospira might not be a common threat in boar semen. Conclusive evidence would require results from a systematic serological surveillance of boar, combined with seasonal molecular analyses of semen to identify potential carriers, and assess actual seroprevalences, associated Leptospira serovars and transmission events.","['Scheinpflug K', 'Schiller S', 'Jäkel H', 'Schulze M', 'Waberski D', 'Mühldorfer K']",2020,6,1,Porcine Health Manag,"Scheinpflug K, et al.

33274738,Effects of Accounting for Interval-Censored Antibody Titer Decay on Seroincidence in a Longitudinal Cohort Study of Leptospirosis.,"Accurate measurements of seroincidence are critical for infections undercounted by reported cases, such as influenza, arboviral diseases, and leptospirosis. However, conventional methods of interpreting paired serological samples do not account for antibody titer decay, resulting in underestimated seroincidence rates. To improve interpretation of paired sera, we modeled exponential decay of interval-censored microscopic agglutination test titers using a historical data set of leptospirosis cases traced to a point source exposure in Italy in 1984. We then applied that decay rate to a longitudinal cohort study conducted in a high-transmission setting in Salvador, Brazil (2013-2015). We estimated a decay constant of 0.926 (95% confidence interval: 0.918, 0.934) titer dilutions per month. Accounting for decay in the cohort increased the mean infection rate to 1.21 times the conventionally defined rate over 6-month intervals (range, 1.10-1.36) and 1.82 times that rate over 12-month intervals (range, 1.65-2.07). Improved estimates of infection in longitudinal data have broad epidemiologic implications, including comparing studies with different sampling intervals, improving sample size estimation, and determining risk factors for infection and the role of acquired immunity. Our method of estimating and accounting for titer decay is generalizable to other infections defined using interval-censored serological assays.","['Owers Bonner KA', 'Cruz JS', 'Sacramento GA', 'de Oliveira D', 'Nery N', 'Carvalho M', 'Costa F', 'Childs JE', 'Ko AI', 'Diggle PJ']",2021,190,5,Am J Epidemiol,"Owers Bonner KA, et al.

33273787,Distribution and Determinants of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology: A Brief Overview.,"Globally, 33187000 DALYs and 956000 deaths are attributed to chronic kidney disease (CKD) every year. Diabetes and hypertension are the two most common causes of CKD. Another category of CKD without any known common causes, chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is also increasingly reported from different regions of the world such as Central America, Sri Lanka, and India. They are predominately observed in agricultural communities where crops such as sugarcane and coconut are commonly cultivated. Young adults and males are at higher risk of developing CKDu. It mainly affects individuals belonging to lower socioeconomic status. Exposure to silica, arsenic, and fluoride might be associated with increased prevalence of CKDu. The role of heat stress in contributing to CKD through dehydration is unclear but cannot be ruled out. Mycotoxins such as aflatoxins and ochratoxins are also found to be associated with CKDu in some settings. Several studies have reported that CKDu has a significant positive association with pesticides used in agriculture such as HCH, Endosulfan, Alachlor, and Pendimethalin. There is also a possible role of infections by Hantavirus and Leptospirosis in acute febrile phase of CKDu. However, there is no conclusive evidence from studies conducted on CKDu regarding its causes and risk factors. Therefore, large-scale studies with better methodology need to be conducted to study the etiology and pathogenesis of CKDu in various settings.","['Stalin P', 'Purty AJ', 'Abraham G']",2020,30,4,Indian J Nephrol,"Stalin P, et al.

In a previous study, 52 Leptospira isolates were obtained from urine of cattle raised in the Brazilian Amazon and, to achieve a greater understanding of Leptospira infection in cattle of this region, the present study aimed to serologically and molecularly characterizes all these isolates. The laboratory assays used were the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) adopting a panel of polyclonal antisera against Leptospira spp. for serogrouping the isolates, DNA sequencing (secY) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). The isolates belonged to five species: 20/52 were identified as L. borgpetersenii (38.5 %); 18/52 as L. kirschneri (34.6 %); 9/52 as L. santarosai (17.3 %); 3/52 as L. noguchii (5.8 %) and 2/52 as L. interrogans (3.8 %). With serogrouping, nine different serogroups were detected, with a high frequency of the Sejroe serogroup. MLVA showed that all L. borgpetersenii isolates had a profile compatible with serovar Hardjo; moreover, the other isolates demonstrated a diversity of patterns, and some of them may represent strains not yet characterized. In the Brazilian Amazon, the leptospires circulating in cattle revealed the unique aspects of infections in this area which, in addition to a variety of strains, were characterized by a high frequency of the Sejroe serogroup, highlighting the serovar Hardjo, which has not been reported in other regions of Brazil.","['Guedes IB', 'Souza GO', 'Rocha KS', 'Cavalini MB', 'Damasceno Neto MS', 'Castro JFP', 'Souza Filho AF', 'Negrão MP', 'Cortez A', 'Moraes CCG', 'Heinemann MB']",2021,74,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Guedes IB, et al.

33232366,The pre-activated immune response induced by LPS protects host from leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is an important global zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira. It is estimated that more than 1 million people are infected by Leptospira each year, and the death toll is about 60,000. Some studies showed that delayed immune response was associated with severe leptospirosis, and TLR4 was very important in the control of leptospirosis. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of the classical activator (LPS) of TLR4 on leptospirosis in susceptible and resistant hosts. The results showed that LPS pretreatment increased the survival rate of hamsters to 80%. And LPS pre-treatment also significantly reduced the leptospiral load and alleviated the pathological injury in organs of hamsters and mice. The result detected by ELISA in mice showed that the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were increased in the LPS-treated group compared to the control group before infection. However, two days after infection, the level of cytokines in LPS group was down-regulated compared with that in control group. In addition, in vitro results showed that LPS pre-treatment enhanced the phagocytosis and bactericidal ability of macrophages on Leptospira. Collectively, our results indicated that the pre-activated immune response induced by LPS enhanced the ability of host against leptospirosis.","['Chen X', 'Xie X', 'Wu D', 'Zhang S', 'Zhang W', 'Cao Y']",2020,15,11,PLoS One,"Chen X, et al.

This study aimed to analyse the spatiotemporal distribution of the incidence of leptospirosis and its association with social determinants in health in a state of northeastern Brazil.
METHODS: An ecological study of temporal series with techniques of spatial analysis using secondary data of the cases of leptospirosis notified in the Information System of Notifiable Diseases of the state of Sergipe (2008-2017) was conducted. The analysis of temporal trends was performed using Poisson regression. Spatial analyses were performed using the Moran index, the local empirical Bayesian model, scan statistics and spatial regression.
RESULTS: The incidence rate decreased from 3.66 to 1.44 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in 2008 and 2017, respectively. Leptospirosis was associated with social inequities, mostly affecting males aged 20-49 y living in urban areas. The space-time scan indicated the formation of a risk cluster in municipalities in the metropolitan region of the state.

Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the use of serological, molecular and microbial tools applied to diagnosis of Leptospira sp. Infection in rams maintained in semiarid conditions. Biological samples of urinary (urine, kidney and bladder) and genital (vas deferens, epididymis tail and vesicular gland) tracts were collected from 40 slaughtered rams for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacterial isolation, as well as blood samples for antibody detection through microscopic serum agglutination test (MAT). Anti-Leptospira antibodies were found in five (12.5%) animals with antibody titer of 50 and 2 (5%) for the titer 100 for serogroups Pyrogenes, Ballum, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Australis. Leptospira sp. DNA was found in PCR of organs and urine of 30 (75%) animals. Overall, 240 fragments of organs from the urinary and genital tracts and urine were evaluated, with 93 (38.7%) positive samples, being 48/120 (40%) for the urinary tract and 45/120 (37.5%) for the genital. There was no statistically significant difference between the tracts. A bladder sample was sent for sequencing and showed 99% similarity with L. interrogans. Of the 240 cultures evaluated, 59 (24.5%) had leptospire growth, being that 23 (39%) were confirmed in PCR. Considering the PCR of organs and urine and bacterial growth as gold standards, the cut-off 50 in MAT showed greater sensitivity when compared to cut-off 100, regardless of the material used. The great proportion of leptospiral DNA in organs, urine and culture and bacterial growth from the genital tracts reinforce its importance as an extra-renal site and highlights the possible role of rams in venereal transmission, as well as the sensitivity of the cut-off 50 suggested its adoption in the serology of rams maintained in semiarid conditions.","['Soares RR', 'Barnabé NNDC', 'Nogueira DB', 'da Silva LSC', 'Júnior JPA', 'Malossi CD', 'Ullmann LS', 'da Costa DF', 'Silva MLCR', 'Dos Santos Higino SS', 'de Azevedo SS', 'Alves CJ']",2021,213,,Acta Trop,"Soares RR, et al.

33196883,New insights on the infection of pathogenic Leptospira species in American mink (Neovison vison) in southern Chile.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of global distribution, caused by the infection of pathogenic Leptospira, a group of bacteria capable of infecting both domestic and wild animals. Mink (Neovison vison) in southern Chile is recognized as a wild and synanthropic rodent predator (among various other prey), and Leptospira infection in them can be acquired through contact with the pathogen in the environment or by eating infected prey. Thus, the aim of this study was to provide more specifics regarding the source of the infection for the American mink under the conditions of Southern Chile. Minks were captured in the Los Ríos region, southern Chile, in an area with well-developed dairy farming. Two areas were selected for mink trapping, one with a high degree of dairy farming and a second with a low degree of dairy farming. Within them, 16 study sites were visited, and 45 American mink were trapped and euthanized to obtain kidney tissue and blood serum samples for bacteria isolation and determination of antibodies titers, respectively. Molecular characterization of the isolated strains was performed. Three minks from sites of high-dairy farming industry and only one from sites with low-degree dairy farming were detected as infected through molecular confirmation. This study shows evidence that confirms previous findings made in southern Chile, regarding mink as host of Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo-prajitno associated to cattle-farming areas. However, typing information ( Leptospira interrogans Copenhageni and Icterohaemorrhagiae ) suggests that the consumption of rodents may also be a potential source of infection.","['Alfaro MAS', 'Raffo E', 'Bustos MI', 'Tomckowiack C', 'Tejeda C', 'Collado L', 'Medina-Vogel G']",2020,53,1,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Alfaro MAS, et al.

Although leptospirosis is predicted to be a significant public health threat in Africa, studies from the continent are limited.
METHODS: Rattus spp. (n = 171) were sampled (January-May 2016) across the City of Johannesburg, South Africa's largest inland metropole. Rattus spp. genetic diversity was evaluated by full length (1140 bp) cyt b sequencing of 42 samples. For comparison, a further 12 Rattus norvegicus samples collected in Cape Town, South Africa's largest coastal metropole, were also genotyped. Leptospira infections were identified and genotyped using real-time PCR and multi-locus (lfb1, secY and lipL41) DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Five R. norvegicus haplotypes were identified across Johannesburg, four of which have not previously been detected in South Africa, and one in Cape Town. Across Johannesburg we identified a Leptospira spp. infection prevalence of 44% (75/171) and noted significant differences in the prevalence between administrative regions within the metropole. Multi-locus sequence analyses identified a clonal genotype consistent with L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica (serovar Ceylonica).
DISCUSSION: The prevalence of infection identified in this study is amongst the highest detected in Rattus spp. in similar contexts across Africa. Despite the complex invasion history suggested by the heterogeneity in R. norvegicus haplotypes identified in Johannesburg, a single L. borgpetersenii genotype was identified in all infected rodents. The lack of L. interrogans in a rodent community dominated by R. norvegicus is notable, given the widely recognised host-pathogen association between these species and evidence for L. interrogans infection in R. norvegicus in Cape Town. It is likely that environmental conditions (cold, dry winters) in Johannesburg may limit the transmission of L. interrogans. Spatial heterogeneity in prevalence suggest that local factors, such as land use, influence disease risk in the metropole.

The high prevalence of infection in urban rodents in Johannesburg suggest that further work is urgently needed to understand the potential public health risk posed by this neglected zoonotic pathogen.","['Moseley M', 'Naidoo K', 'Bastos A', 'Retief L', 'Frean J', 'Telfer S', 'Rossouw J']",2020,13,1,Parasit Vectors,"Moseley M, et al.

33174979,Immunohistochemical detection of Lp25 and LipL32 proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscles of fatal human leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is an acute infection caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira, which affects humans and animals in all world. In severe forms of the disease, kidneys, liver and lungs are the main affected organs, resulting in acute kidney injury, jaundice and pulmonary hemorrhage. Previous post-mortem studies have shown that lesions are not limited to these organs. Cardiac and striated muscle injuries have already been reported, but the pathophysiology of cardiac and skeletal lesions in leptospirosis is not fully understood. It has been suggested that the tissue damage observed in leptospirosis could be directly mediated by leptospires or by their toxic cellular components. LipL32 and Lp25 are leptospira membrane proteins with unknown functions, that are present only in pathogenic strains of Leptospira spp. Both proteins induce skeletal muscle lesions similar to those observed when normal guinea pigs are inoculated with leptospires. Through immunohistochemistry, this study showed the presence of LipL32 and Lp25 proteins on muscle cell membranes and in the underlying cytoplasm of skeletal muscles, as well as focal lesions in cardiac tissues of fatal cases of leptospirosis. Altogether, these results reinforce that both proteins can be important factors in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.","['Iglezias SD', 'Abreu PAE', 'Kanamura C', 'Magaldi AJ', 'Seguro AC', 'Brito T']",2020,62,,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"Iglezias SD, et al.

33159901,Congenital chagas disease: Development and assessment of a specific IgM capture-based assay for diagnosis of transmission.,"Transplacental transmission by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection can be effectively treated if parasiticide drugs are administered as early as possible during childhood. Furthermore, an ideal situation would be to diagnose the infection near birth in order to avoid the loss of patients during the subsequent follow-up. These situation are desirable due to the maximum benefit of drugs in early stages which, consequently, implies a relevant contribution to eliminate mother-to-child transmission. However, available techniques for that purpose have limitations as being operator-dependent (microhematocrit), require several months follow-up (IgG detection) or specialized laboratories (PCR). In this study we propose to detect specific IgM antibodies (Ab) by developing a capture-based ELISA employing an improved antigen (Ag) to diagnose the transplacental transmission of T. cruzi, and in consequence, to enhance access to effective treatment. Firstly, a new chimera Ag (CP4) was obtained from the fusion of CP1 and CP3 protein, carrying FRA, SAPA, MAP, TSSAII/V/VI and TcD Ag from T. cruzi. Then, we optimized the assay by capturing IgM Ab with a polyclonal anti-IgM Ab and evaluating three Ag formulations to detect specific IgM bound. The formulations were formed as follows: i) F1: CP1 and CP3; ii) F2: CP1, CP3, B13 and P2β; iii) F3: by CP4. Detection of Ab-binding Ag was carried out using an anti-His Ab since all Ag were expressed with a His-tag. The evaluation panel consisted of sera from vertically infected children under 1-year-old (6 younger than 15 days, 7 older) and samples from non-infected children of women with chronic Chagas Disease. The ELISA assay employing CP4 showed better performance with notable high sensitivity and specificity (92.3% and 93.9%, respectively). Positive and negative likelihood ratios of the test (15.2 and 0.082) suggest its potential clinical relevance in term of post-test probability of infection. In conclution, we developed a standardized and non-operator dependent test to detect specific anti-T. cruzi IgM Ab. Although increased sample size is needed for its validation, our results indicate that this capture-based technique employing CP4 Ag can certainly improve the diagnosis of connatal infection.","['Peverengo LM', 'Rodeles LM', 'Maldonado C', 'Ballering G', 'Pujato N', ""D'Amico I"", 'Vicco MH', 'Garcia L', 'Jurado L', 'Altcheh J', 'Marcipar I']",2021,213,,Acta Trop,"Peverengo LM, et al.

Although low-genetic biodiversity is expected in these regions, the introduction of domestic and synanthropic mammals may contribute to the wider diversity of leptospiral strains in insular settings. This study proposes a large-scale seroepidemiological investigation of Leptospira infection in animals from Fernando de Noronha archipelago and describes the characterization of the first leptospiral strain ever isolated from an insular setting in Brazil. A total of 1,265 blood samples from domestic (n = 682), synanthropic (n = 133) and wild (n = 450) animals were collected between 2007 and 2014, totalling 12 species. The presence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies was investigated by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and kidney samples from 20 synanthropic rodents were collected for the isolation of Leptospira spp. The leptospires recovered were further characterized by serogrouping with polyclonal antibodies, whole-genome sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The MAT results revealed the presence of agglutinins in 90 samples (7.1%) and the most frequently found serogroup was Icterohaemorrhagiae (n = 57) in practically all species included. Viable leptospires were recovered from one brown rat, and characterization revealed that the isolate belongs to L. interrogans serogroup Pyrogenes. The results suggest that synanthropic rodents might play an important role in leptospiral infection among wildlife and domestic species in the archipelago.","['Silva JCR', 'Marvulo MFV', 'Ferreira F', 'Dias RA', 'Ferreira Neto JS', 'Heinemann MB', 'Andrade Filho GV', 'Souza GO', 'Lima Filho CDF', 'Magalhães FJR', 'Lilenbaum W', 'Dellagostin OA', 'de Oliveira NR', 'Jorge S', 'Kremer FS', 'Santos CM', 'Esteves SB', 'Miotto BA']",2021,68,4,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Silva JCR, et al.

33143199,Emerging Natural Focal Infectious Diseases in Russia: A Medical-Geographical Study.,"In Russia, as in other countries, the problem of emerging natural focal infectious diseases (EIDs) became more acute toward the end of the 20th century. However, the situation in Russia is unknown to foreign readers, while the prevention and control of these diseases require international collaboration. The aim of the study is to provide a medical-geographical assessment of the distribution of the main natural focal EIDs in Russia, as well as to present the approaches used in the country to create aggregate maps of risk assessment. To consider its current status, we determined the most important natural focal EIDs for Russia (tick-borne encephalitis, ixodid tick-borne borrelioses, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever, Astrakhan spotted fever, leptospiroses, and tularemia) and analyzed the patterns of their epidemic manifestation. As a result, a working classification of such infections and a series of maps showing the current situation of EID morbidity in Russia were created. To design an aggregated risk map, we developed an original mapping methodology and recalculated the model disease incidence by taking data from administrative units and adjusting them for natural geographical boundaries (biomes) for European Russia, and then evaluated the risk of infection for separate model diseases and for a set of them. The highest risk rates are confined to the northwest regions of European Russia, the Cis-Urals and the Volga region, which are naturally related to forest biomes, as well as to the southern steppe regions of the interfluves between the Volga and the Don, and the foothills of the North Caucasus.","['Malkhazova S', 'Pestina P', 'Prasolova A', 'Orlov D']",2020,17,21,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Malkhazova S, et al.

33141517,"A Mouse Model of Sublethal Leptospirosis: Protocols for Infection with Leptospira Through Natural Transmission Routes, for Monitoring Clinical and Molecular Scores of Disease, and for Evaluation of the Host Immune Response.","Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species that are maintained in sylvatic and domestic environments by transmission among rodents and other carriers. Humans become infected after contact of breached skin or mucosa with contaminated water or soil. Understanding persistent or sublethal infection in a host is critical for controlling human risk of exposure to pathogenic Leptospira. Animal models that recapitulate disease progression after infection via natural transmission routes are more appropriate for validation of vaccines and therapeutics. Furthermore, the ability to measure shedding of live Leptospira in urine of reservoir and carrier hosts can be used to develop new diagnostic assays and sensors to evaluate human risk of exposure. We developed inbred mouse models of Leptospirosis, that bypass survival as a criterion, in which we can analyze both pathogen and host factors affecting sublethal infection (<1 month), including shedding of Leptospira in urine. Mice are infected with pathogenic Leptospira using a physiologic route, and the clinical, histological, and molecular scores of disease are measured. Furthermore, the host immune response to Leptospira is evaluated. This mouse model also provides a tool in which to test fundamental hypotheses related to host-pathogen interactions and the immune mechanisms engaged in protective and pathogenic immune responses. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC Basic Protocol 1: Culture and maintenance of virulent Leptospira Basic Protocol 2: Infection of mice through a physiologic route and collection of clinical scores and biological samples Basic Protocol 3: Analysis of pathogenesis after Leptospira infection.","['Nair N', 'Gomes-Solecki M']",2020,59,1,Curr Protoc Microbiol,"Nair N and Gomes-Solecki M.

33139235,"Clinical characteristics, outcomes, and predictors of leptospirosis in patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit: A retrospective analysis.","BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and detection of clinical deterioration of leptospirosis are challenges to all clinicians. This study aimed to report the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for severe leptospirosis and to identify the clinical predictors of MICU admission.
METHODS: This was a 10-year retrospective study that included all patients diagnosed as leptospirosis, based on either serology or a Thai-Lepto score (TLS) of >4. All clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected and compared between MICU cases and general ward cases. Binary logistic regression was applied to identify the independent factors for MICU admission.
RESULTS: Of the 68 patients who were diagnosed as leptospirosis based on inclusion criteria, 43 serologically-confirmed cases were subsequently analyzed. Fifty percent of the cases were admitted to the MICU and, compared with those admitted to the general ward, had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [10 (7-13) vs. 5 (2.2-5.6), p < 0.001]; higher TLS [7.5 (6.5-9.25) vs. 5.5 (3.5-6.5), p < 0.001]; lower mean arterial blood pressure (74.7 ± 15 mmHg vs. 84.2 ± 16.3 mmHg, p = 0.04); lower platelet count in ×10
CONCLUSION: Among patients with leptospirosis, TLS, SOFA score, inotrope or vasopressor requirement, and mechanical ventilator support were the independent predictors of MICU admission.

OBJECTIVES: To apply reverse vaccinology (RV) and antigenic selection on the assortment of leptospiral targets and evaluate their potential for use as reagents for the diagnosis of equine leptospirosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: The antigenic selection parameters were: proteins with antigenicity score ≥0.5 (VaxiJen), at least one B cell epitope and size between 10 and 275 KDa. New leptospiral proteins were cloned, expressed and serologically screened against equine sera (n = 128) on a single analysis and comparative combinations. Sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp), accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. A BLAST with nucleotide and protein sequences was used to identify the serovar or species specificity.
MAIN LIMITATIONS: This cross-sectional analysis had three main limitations: (a) The equine sera used in these tests were limited to sera submitted to the Animal Health Diagnosis Center and were only tested against seven serovars; (b) MAT results were considered being 'perfect', and the highest titre presented was considered being the infecting serovar, which may not hold true; (c) The strains used to represent the serovars and the limited number of different serovars and species included in the genetic analysis, which leads to the possibility that these proteins might be present in different species or serovars that perhaps would be seroprevalent in another geographic region.
CONCLUSIONS: The new leptospiral antigens described in this research could increase the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA for detection of Leptospira exposure and the detection of leptospirosis in horses along with support from other clinical signs. Some of these new antigens might be used to improve the detection of infecting serovar.","['Zilch TJ', 'Lee JJ', 'Bressan GC', 'McDonough SP', 'Mohammed HO', 'Divers TJ', 'Chang YF']",2021,53,5,Equine Vet J,"Zilch TJ, et al.

33132620,"The prevalence and risk factors associated with Leptospira in donkeys in Ngaka Modiri Molema District, North West Province, South Africa.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Leptospirosis is one of the major emerging global economic and health problems affecting donkeys, thereby reducing their work output. Furthermore, the disease has public health importance because of its zoonotic nature. Despite the significant contribution donkeys make to the national economy, less attention is given to diseases that afflict donkeys and reduce their productivity and performance. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of Leptospira and identify risk factors associated with the occurrence of the disease among donkeys in the study area.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was used to collect the following data: Demographic, environmental, management, and health-related factors. Blood samples were aseptically collected from 365 randomly selected donkeys from 19 villages. The sera were tested using the microscopic agglutination test. Categorical variables were summarized and presented as proportions and their 95% confidence interval (CI). A binary logistic regression model was fitted to the data to identify risk factors associated with Leptospira seroprevalence in donkeys within the study areas.
RESULTS: The majority of the donkeys (29.6%; n=108/365) were from Mafikeng local municipality, and the rest (19.7%; n=72/365) were from Ratlou. Just over half (58.1%; n=212/365) of the donkeys tested were female, and the remaining (41.9%; n=153/365) were males. In addition, most donkeys (42.7%; n=156/365) were between 6 and 12 years old, followed by those between 0 and 5 years (37%; n=135/365), and only 20.3% (n=74/365) were above 12 years. Out of the donkeys tested, 11.5% (95% CI: 4.86-18.14) donkeys tested positive for Leptospira antibodies. The most common serovar was Bratislava (81%; n=34/42), followed by Tarassovi (19.04%; n=8/42). While gender was positively associated with seroprevalence of the disease (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=4.88; p=0.0001), the presence of horses (AOR=0.226; p=0.002) and agricultural activities (AOR=0.093; p=0.0001) in the vicinity of the dwellings of the donkeys were negatively associated with Leptospira seropositivity in the study area.
CONCLUSION: Findings reported here show that donkeys in the study area are reservoirs for the predominant serovar Bratislava and the less dominant serovar Tarassovi. The gender of the donkey was a risk factor for Leptospira seroprevalence. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of agricultural activities in the vicinity of the dwellings of donkeys on the occurrence of Leptospira in the study area.","['Daddy KK', 'Mwanza M', 'Oguttu JW', 'Ngoma L']",2020,13,9,Vet World,"Daddy KK, et al.

Once acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs as a secondary condition, treatment is extremely difficult and the mortality rate is very high.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 49-year-old. He was admitted to the hospital because he had experienced a fever and cough for 4 days. Hemorrhage, respiratory failure, ARDS and other symptoms appeared soon after admission. Due to severe pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to ARDS, mechanical ventilation was performed through tracheal intubation. During intubation, the patient suffered cardiac arrest, and the patient's condition worsened. He was confirmed to have leptospirosis through second-generation sequencing of the alveolar lavage fluid. Finally, we successfully treated the patient with penicillin as an anti-infective medication and venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (v-vECMO). To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the successful application of ECMO in mainland China.

33107122,Amplification of pathogenic Leptospira infection with greater abundance and co-occurrence of rodent hosts across a counter-urbanizing landscape.,"Land use change can elevate disease risk by creating conditions beneficial to species that carry zoonotic pathogens. Observations of concordant global trends in increased pathogen prevalence or disease incidence and landscape change have generated concerns that urbanization could increase transmission risk of some pathogens. Yet host-pathogen relationships underlying transmission risk have not been well characterized within cities, even where contact between humans and species capable of transmitting pathogens of concern occurs. We addressed this deficit by testing the hypothesis that areas in cities experiencing greater population loss and infrastructure decline (i.e., counter-urbanization) can support a greater diversity of host species and a larger and more diverse pool of pathogens. We did so by characterizing pathogenic Leptospira infection relative to rodent host richness and abundance across a mosaic of abandonment in post-Katrina New Orleans (Louisiana, USA). We found that Leptospira infection loads were highest in areas that harboured increased rodent species richness (which ranged from one to four rodent species detected). Areas with greater host co-occurrence also harboured a greater abundance of hosts, including the host species most likely to carry high infection loads, indicating that Leptospira infection can be amplified by increases in overall and relative host abundance. Evidence of shared infection among rodent host species indicates that cross-species transmission of Leptospira probably increases infection at sites with greater host richness. Additionally, evidence that rodent co-occurrence and abundance and Leptospira infection load parallel abandonment suggests that counter-urbanization can elevate zoonotic disease risk within cities, particularly in underserved communities that are burdened with disproportionate concentrations of derelict properties.","['Peterson AC', 'Ghersi BM', 'Riegel C', 'Wunder EA', 'Childs JE', 'Blum MJ']",2021,30,9,Mol Ecol,"Peterson AC, et al.

33103800,Evaluation of changes in the epidemiology of leptospirosis in dogs after introduction of a quadrivalent antileptospiral vaccine in a highly endemic area.,"BACKGROUND: Since 2003, a marked increase in leptospirosis serogroup Australis has been observed in dogs in Switzerland. In 2013, a new quadrivalent antileptospiral vaccine (L4) was introduced, adding serogroups Australis and Grippotyphosa to Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae of the previous bivalent vaccines (L2).
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether introduction of L4 was associated with decreased incidence of leptospirosis and decreased odds for dogs with acute kidney injury (AKI) to be diagnosed with leptospirosis.
ANIMALS: Four hundred and sixty-nine dogs with AKI presented to a referral hospital, including 269 dogs with leptospirosis and 200 controls with other causes.
METHODS: Descriptive section: disease incidence was evaluated for 3 consecutive periods: before (PRE, 2011-2012), transition (TRANS, 2013-2014), and after introduction of L4 (POST, 2015-2017). Analytical section: variables associated with a diagnosis of leptospirosis were investigated in a case-control study using multivariable logistic regression, and focusing on vaccination.
RESULTS: The number of dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis (AKI-L) decreased from 56.5 (PRE) to 15.7 (POST) cases/year while controls increased from 16.5 to 38.0 cases/year. Control dogs (AKI-nL) showed a decrease in L2 vaccination (100% to 26%) and an increase in L4 vaccination (0% to 70%). The odds ratio for vaccinated dogs to be diagnosed with leptospirosis was 0.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.22; P < .001) for L4 and 2.08 (0.58-7.42; P = .26) for L2.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The introduction of L4 was associated with a marked decrease in dogs with leptospirosis and AKI in Switzerland.

33097187,Structural analysis of CACHE domain of the McpA chemoreceptor from Leptospira interrogans.,"Leptospira is a genus of spirochete bacteria highly motile that includes pathogenic species responsible to cause leptospirosis disease. Chemotaxis and motility are required for Leptospira infectivity, pathogenesis, and invasion of bacteria into the host. In prokaryotes, the most common chemoreceptors are methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins that have a role play to detect the chemical signals and move to a favorable environment for its survival. Here, we report the first crystal structure of CACHE domain of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (McpA) of L. interrogans. The structural analysis showed that McpA adopts similar α/β architecture of several other bacteria chemoreceptors. We also found a typical dimerization interface that appears to be functionally crucial for signal transmission and chemotaxis.

33094809,Crystal structure of Leptospira leucine-rich repeat 20 reveals a novel E-cadherin binding protein to induce NGAL expression in HK2 cells.,"Leptospirosis is the most common zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira, which is classified into three groups according to virulence. Its pathogenic and intermediate species contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins that are rarely expressed in non-pathogenic strains. In this study, we presented the crystal structure of LSS_11580 (rLRR20) from pathogenic L. santarosai serovar Shermani. X-ray diffraction at a resolution of 1.99 Å revealed a horseshoe-shaped structure containing seven α-helices and five β-sheets. Affinity assays indicated that rLRR20 interacts with E-cadherin on the cell surface. Interestingly, its binds to the extracellular (EC) 1 domain in human epithelial (E)-cadherin, which is responsible for binding to another E-cadherin molecule in neighboring cells. Several charged residues on the concave face of LRR20 were predicted to interact with EC1 domain. In the affinity assays, these charged residues were replaced by alanine, and their affinities to E-cadherin were measured. Three vital residues and mutation variants of LRR20, namely D56A, E59A, and E123A, demonstrated significantly reduced affinity to E-cadherin compared with the control. Besides, we also demonstrated that rLRR20 induced the expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in HK2 cells. The low ability of the three mutation variants to induce NGAL expression further demonstrates this induction. The present findings indicate that LRR20 from pathogenic Leptospira binds to E-cadherin and interacts with its EC1 domain. In addition, its induction of NGAL expression in HK2 cells is associated with acute kidney injury in human.","['Hsu SH', 'Chu CH', 'Tian YC', 'Chang MY', 'Chou LF', 'Sun YJ', 'Yang CW']",2020,477,21,Biochem J,"Hsu SH, et al.

33091006,Cats shedding pathogenic Leptospira spp.-An underestimated zoonotic risk?,"Shedding of DNA of pathogenic Leptospira spp. has been documented in naturally infected cats in several countries, but urinary shedding of infectious Leptospira spp. has only recently been proven. The climate in Southern Chile is temperate rainy with high annual precipitations which represents ideal preconditions for survival of Leptospira spp., especially during spring and summer. The aims of this study were to investigate shedding of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in outdoor cats in Southern Chile, to perform molecular characterization of isolates growing in culture, and to assess potential risk factors associated with shedding. Urine samples of 231 outdoor cats from rural and urban areas in southern Chile were collected. Urine samples were investigated for pathogenic Leptospira spp. by 4 techniques: qPCR targeting the lipL32 gene, immunomagnetic separation (IMS)-coupled qPCR (IMS-qPCR), direct culture and IMS-coupled culture. Positive urine cultures were additionally confirmed by PCR. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to molecularly characterize isolates obtained from positive cultures. Overall, 36 urine samples (15.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.4-20.9) showed positive results. Eighteen (7.8%, 95% CI 4.9-12.1), 30 (13%, 95% CI 9.2-18), 3 (1.3%, 0.3-3.9) and 4 cats (1.7%; 95% CI 0.5-4.5) were positive in qPCR, IMS-qPCR, conventional culture, and IMS-coupled culture, respectively. MLST results of 7 culture-positive cats revealed sequences that could be assigned to sequence type 17 (6 cats) and sequence type 27 (1 cat) corresponding to L. interrogans (Pathogenic Leptospira Subgroup 1). Shedding of pathogenic Leptospira spp. by cats might be an underestimated source of infection for other species including humans. The present study is the first one reporting growth of leptospires from feline urine in culture in naturally infected cats in South-America and characterisation of culture-derived isolates. So far, very few cases of successful attempts to culture leptospires from naturally infected cats are described worldwide.","['Dorsch R', 'Ojeda J', 'Salgado M', 'Monti G', 'Collado B', 'Tomckowiack C', 'Tejeda C', 'Müller A', 'Eberhard T', 'Klaasen HLBM', 'Hartmann K']",2020,15,10,PLoS One,"Dorsch R, et al.

33080359,Chemokine expression profiles in liver and kidney of mice with different susceptibilities to leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a global disease that affects humans and animals, impacting public health and the economy. The symptoms caused by Leptospira infection can vary from mild to severe, affecting liver, lungs, and kidneys. The host-pathogen interaction in leptospirosis is still poorly understood, but there is evidence for the role of the host immune response in the pathogenesis. Chemokines are a family of structurally-related low-molecular-mass proteins (8-14 kDa) that signal the recruitment of leukocytes. In this study the profile of 22 chemokines were evaluated in liver and kidney of three mice strains with different phenotypes of susceptibility to leptospirosis. We extended our previously reported observations showing that expression of chemokines with homeostatic function, activation and chemotaxis of leukocytes are essential to modulate and to induce resistance to leptospirosis. Our findings support that an early induction of CXC chemokines in resistant BALB/c mice can be associated with the control of the infection. The correlation of chemokine expression between liver and kidney observed in BALB/c suggests that a balance of chemokine induction in the organs may contribute to resistance to leptospirosis.","['Silva PL', 'Nakajima E', 'Costa RMD', 'Lee Ho P', 'Martins EA', 'Carvalho E', 'da Silva JB']",2020,149,,Microb Pathog,"Silva PL, et al.

33068363,Toll-like receptor 2-mediated induction of human beta-defensin 2 expression by Leptospira interrogans in human kidney cells.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira interrogans. Severe leptospirosis is often accompanied by kidney dysfunction caused by chronic infection. The kidney pathology involves bacterial invasion and inflammation caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Human beta defensins (hBDs) are antimicrobial peptides induced by microbial infection and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines. One function of hBDs is the recruitment of immune cells that leads to inflammation. However, the expression of hBDs by kidney epithelium in response to pathogenic Leptospira has never been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of hBDs in human kidney epithelium responses to Leptospira.
METHODS: Human kidney cells were infected with Leptospira interrogans serovar Autumnalis in the presence or absence of anti-TLR2 neutralizing antibody (Ab) for 6 hours. TLR2, hBDs and pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA expressions were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
RESULTS: Pathogenic Leptospira upregulated the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hBD2, but not TLR2, hBD1 and hBD3 in kidney cells. The expressions of hBD2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines were inhibited in the presence of anti-hTLR2 neutralizing Ab.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first evidence that pathogenic Leptospira induces hBD2 expression in kidney cells. The expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and hBD2 in the cells in response to pathogenic Leptospira are regulated by TLR2. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and hBD2 might be play role in recruitment of immune cells to the kidney and contribute to the development of inflammation-mediated tissue damage in the kidney. However, further study is needed to improve the understanding of the role of these molecules in immune response activation.","['Inthasin N', 'Boonwong C', 'Matamnan S', 'Sueasuay J', 'Wongprompitak P', 'Tanttibhedhyangkul W', 'Ekpo P']",2020,,,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,"Inthasin N, et al.

However, recent data suggest changes in these patterns, hence, serovar-specific epidemiology of leptospirosis from 1999 to 2017 was investigated. The 19-year average annual incidence is 2.01/100,000. Early (1999-2007) and late (2008-2017) study period comparisons showed a significant increase in notifications with serovar Ballum (IRR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.22-2.09) in all cases and serovar Tarassovi (IRR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.13-2.78) in Europeans and a decrease in notifications with serovars Hardjo and Pomona in all cases. Incidences of Ballum peaked in winter, Hardjo peaked in spring and Tarassovi peaked in summer. Incidence was highest in Māori (2.24/100,000) with dominant serovars being Hardjo and Pomona. Stratification by occupation showed meat workers had the highest incidence of Hardjo (57.29/100,000) and Pomona (45.32/100,000), farmers had the highest incidence of Ballum (11.09/100,000) and dairy farmers had the highest incidence of Tarassovi (12.59/100,000). Spatial analysis showed predominance of Hardjo and Pomona in Hawke's Bay, Ballum in West Coast and Northland and Tarassovi in Waikato, Taranaki and Northland.

33035771,"Leptospira spp. in horses in southern Brazil: Seroprevalence, infection risk factors, and influence on reproduction.","Leptospirosis in horses is often associated with reproductive disorders. In the southern states of Brazil, horses are used for various jobs and cultural practices; nevertheless, serological surveillance for Leptospira is rare. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. in horses in southern Brazil, as well as to identify the risk factors for infection and its impacts on reproduction. We performed microscopic agglutination tests for 12 serovars that corresponding 9 serogroup (Sejroe, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Australis, Pyrogenes, Pomona, Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Tarassovi and Ballum) in 595 samples from 60 herds. A brief history was obtained to analyze risk factors for reproductive disorders. A total of 45.9% of the tested horses were seropositive, of which the most frequent serogroups were Icterohaemorrhagiae (Icterohaemorrhagiae and Copenhageni serovars) and Ballum (Ballum serovar). Simple infections were found in 45.4% of seropositive animals, while mixed infections occurred in 54.6% of horses. There was a correlation between seropositivity and age and sex, that is, seropositivity was more frequent in animals over 6 years old and in females. There was no correlation between seropositivity and reproductive disorders. We conclude that there is a high seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. in southern Brazil with predominance of Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup, mainly in older animals. Location, breeds, contact with dogs or other domestic animals are not risk factors, whereas gender is a risk factor.

33021995,The transcriptional response of pathogenic Leptospira to peroxide reveals new defenses against infection-related oxidative stress.,"Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of the waterborne zoonotic disease leptospirosis. Leptospira are challenged by numerous adverse conditions, including deadly reactive oxygen species (ROS), when infecting their hosts. Withstanding ROS produced by the host innate immunity is an important strategy evolved by pathogenic Leptospira for persisting in and colonizing hosts. In L. interrogans, genes encoding defenses against ROS are repressed by the peroxide stress regulator, PerR. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize both the L. interrogans response to low and high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the PerR regulon. We showed that Leptospira solicit three main peroxidase machineries (catalase, cytochrome C peroxidase and peroxiredoxin) and heme to detoxify oxidants produced during peroxide stress. In addition, canonical molecular chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins from the SOS response were required for Leptospira recovering from oxidative damage. Identification of the PerR regulon upon exposure to H2O2 allowed to define the contribution of this regulator in the oxidative stress response. This study has revealed a PerR-independent regulatory network involving other transcriptional regulators, two-component systems and sigma factors as well as non-coding RNAs that putatively orchestrate, in concert with PerR, the oxidative stress response. We have shown that PerR-regulated genes encoding a TonB-dependent transporter and a two-component system (VicKR) are involved in Leptospira tolerance to superoxide. This could represent the first defense mechanism against superoxide in L. interrogans, a bacterium lacking canonical superoxide dismutase. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenic Leptospira to overcome oxidative damage during infection-related conditions. This will participate in framing future hypothesis-driven studies to identify and decipher novel virulence mechanisms in this life-threatening pathogen.","['Zavala-Alvarado C', 'Sismeiro O', 'Legendre R', 'Varet H', 'Bussotti G', 'Bayram J', 'G Huete S', 'Rey G', 'Coppée JY', 'Picardeau M', 'Benaroudj N']",2020,16,10,PLoS Pathog,"Zavala-Alvarado C, et al.

33010572,Extra-renal bovine leptospirosis: Molecular characterization of the Leptospira interrogans Sejroe serogroup on the uterus of non-pregnant cows.,"Bovine genital leptospirosis is a chronic disease that causes reproductive disorders such as abortions, stillbirths, and estrus repetition, as well as economic losses. Despite clinical signs related to reproductive failure, the majority of studies have focused on the detection of Leptospira spp. in the urine, while few have considered the reproductive tract. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to investigate the uterus as an important extra-renal site of leptospiral infection in cows. A total of 42 non-pregnant cows were studied at a slaughterhouse. Blood samples and uterine fragments were collected for serology and molecular analysis, respectively. Concerning serologic results, 20.5 % presented as reactive, all of them against the Sejroe serogroup. Regarding lipL32 PCR, 26.2 % (11/42) of samples were positive for pathogenic Leptospira sp. Sequencing the secY gene short region enabled nine strains to be characterized, all of which were L. interrogans, with high identity (98.8 %-99.8 %) with serovar Hardjo. The use of molecular tools substantially improved the sensitivity of Leptospira sp. detection at species level and demonstrated that the uterus is an important site of bovine leptospiral infection. The findings of the present study reinforce our understanding that leptospiral uterine infection are associated to members of the Sejroe serogroup.","['Di Azevedo MIN', 'Pires BC', 'Libonati H', 'Pinto PS', 'Cardoso Barbosa LF', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2020,250,,Vet Microbiol,"Di Azevedo MIN, et al.

The Lsa27 lacking signal peptide coding gene sequences from L. interrogans serovar Pomona was amplified (~ 660 bp) by PCR and the amplicon was cloned into pETiteN-HisKan vector. The expressed recombinant Lsa27 histidine-tagged fusion protein (rLsa27) was Ni-NTA affinity purified under denaturation followed by renaturation methods. The purified rLsa27 was characterized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot, which confirmed the leptospiral protein with a MW of ~ 25 kDa. Further, the prepared sensitized latex beads coated with rLsa27 were evaluated as a diagnostic antigen for detection of pathogenic Leptospira antibodies by using known microscopic agglutination test (MAT) positive (n = 74) and negative (n = 62) sera for Leptospira antibodies in LAT, which revealed the relative diagnostic sensitivity of 91.89% and specificity of 87.10% against the gold standard serological test, MAT. Furthermore, on evaluation of developed rLsa27 LAT using serum samples from cattle associated with the history of abortions and reproductive disorder (n = 309), the relative sensitivity of 96.15%, and specificity of 89.11% were observed.

32986693,Circulating genotypes of Leptospira in French Polynesia : An 9-year molecular epidemiology surveillance follow-up study.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonosis with global impact, particularly among vulnerable populations in resource-poor settings in tropical countries. Rodents have been considered to be the main reservoir of the disease; however, a wide variety of mammals can act as hosts as well. Here we examine the genetic diversity of Leptospira strains from biological samples of patients and animals in French Polynesia (FP) from 2011 to 2019.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From 2011 to 2019, we have collected 444 blood samples from patients diagnosed as having leptospirosis. The limited volume of clinical material and low amount of leptospiral DNA in blood samples led us to develop a nested PCR targeting the secY locus that enabled us to amplify and sequence 244 samples (55%). In addition, 20 Leptospira strains recovered from the blood of patients from 2002 to 2011 were sequenced and fully characterized at the serogroup level and used as reference strains for the association of different phylogenetic branches with respective serogroups. The secY sequences were compared with publicly available sequences from patients and animal reservoirs in FP (n = 79). We identified rats as the main source of infection for L. borgpetersenii serogroup Ballum and L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae, dogs as the main source of infection for L. interrogans serogroup Australis, and farm pigs as the main source of infection for L. interrogans serogroups Pomona or Canicola. L. interrogans was associated with the most severe infections with 10 and 5 fatal cases due to serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae and Australis, respectively. Mortality was significantly associated with older age (p-value < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We described the population dynamics of leptospires circulating among patients in FP, including two patients who were reinfected with unrelated Leptospira genotypes, and clarified the local role of the animal reservoirs in the transmission route of leptospirosis to humans. Routine Leptospira genotyping directly on biological samples should allow the epidemiological follow-up of circulating strains and assess the impact of control interventions on disease transmission.","['Grillová L', 'Angermeier H', 'Levy M', 'Giard M', 'Lastère S', 'Picardeau M']",2020,14,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Grillová L, et al.

32980802,An historical view of the experimental leptospiral infection in ruminants.,"The first experimental infections with Leptospira in ruminants were conducted in the 1950s, primarily assessed the pathogenesis caused by serovar Pomona in cows. Throughout the decades, experimental infections have also demonstrated the clinical aspects of the infection by other strains, mainly Hardjo. Despite the important outcomes observed in experimental infections in ruminants, there is still a large discrepancy regarding the ideal dose, route, strain, model species or animal age that should be used to reproduce the acute and chronic leptospirosis in ruminants. In this context, the present study aimed to review the historical processes involved on the experimental leptospiral infection in ruminants. The inclusion criteria were papers that clearly described inoculation route, strain, dose, clinical signs and animal age. Overall, 37 experiments were noted. The most frequently reported clinical signs were fever, prostration, hematuria and death, with the majority of them occurring in young animals infected by incidental strains. Regarding reproductive problems, they occurred in the majority of the experiments and were also more related to incidental strains. In this context, abortions, retained placenta and weak fetuses were the most frequent symptoms. Noteworthy that although the mechanisms of the clinical acute disease either systemic or reproductive, is reasonably well understood, the physiopathology involved on reproductive problems due to the silent chronic infection is less discussed and remains to be elucidated. In this context, it is evident the need for studies focused on the genital infection and reproductive aspects of leptospiral infection in ruminants.","['Rocha BR', 'Martins G', 'Lilenbaum W']",2020,73,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Rocha BR, et al.

32957955,The wrong Spirochaete? Acute kidney injury in a returning traveller with syphilis - a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Syphilis has seen an increased incidence in recent years and can have serious and irreversible consequences if left un-diagnosed and untreated. This case report describes a presentation of syphilis and acute kidney injury - a scenario sparsely described in existing literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: This 43-year old Man who has Sex with Men (MSM) presented to the emergency department with a 3-week history of vomiting and headaches, progressing to include pyrexia. These symptoms started following his return from a 2-week cruise in Central America throughout which he had been well. He had a background of well-controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). On admission he had an Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) stage 3, without hydronephrosis, presumed to be pre-renal. Leptospirosis, the main differential, was negative serologically. 'Pyrexia of unknown origin' testing was performed, and cefuroxime commenced. Later in the admission, syphilis testing indicated an acute infection and he completed a full treatment course of benzylpenicillin. This, alongside intravenous fluids, resulted in symptom and renal resolution in 9 days and restoration of renal function.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal complications in syphilis are rare, furthermore the majority of those documented occur in latent syphilis and are irreversible. There are limited numbers of other documented cases of AKI in acute syphilis, which like the gentleman in this case were reversible and did not lead to permanent kidney damage. This case adds to the knowledge base of AKI in initial presentation of syphilis. It also demonstrates not only the importance of taking a sexual history in patients with new infective symptoms but that testing for syphilis in at-risk groups regardless of history should be performed given its rising incidence. These considerations by physicians can lead to prompt diagnosis and management of syphilis and improve patient care and long-term outcomes.","['Cook H', 'Gompels M']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,Cook H and Gompels M.

32882876,Perceived Severity and Susceptibility towards Leptospirosis Infection in Malaysia.,"BACKGROUND: Perceived severity and susceptibility refers to one's belief of the seriousness and the risk of contracting a specific disease. It is an essential study in public health as it assists in the understanding of the motivating factors towards disease prevention. This qualitative study aimed to explore perceived severity and susceptibility towards leptospirosis infection among respondents in two states of Malaysia.
METHODS: Focus group discussions using the phenomenology approach was conducted involving 72 respondents in Selangor and Kelantan. Data were examined using content analysis.
RESULTS: Respondents perceived leptospirosis infection as severe due to its poor disease prognosis and complications. However, some rated it less severe when compared with other chronic diseases such as cancer and AIDS. Their perceptions were influenced by their knowledge about the disease, media portrayal and frequency of health campaigns by the government. All respondents believed they were not susceptible to the disease.
CONCLUSION: The low perceived susceptibility of leptospirosis infection is a matter of concern as it may contribute to respondents' lack of motivation towards preventing the disease. The study findings may provide the basis for health promotional activities designed to heighten public perceived threat towards leptospirosis infection and thereby improving preventive health behaviors for avoiding leptospirosis.","['Sukeri S', 'Zahiruddin WM', 'Shafei MN', 'Hamat RA', 'Osman M', 'Jamaluddin TZMT', 'Daud AB']",2020,17,17,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Sukeri S, et al.

32864128,Systematic analysis of disease-specific immunological signatures in patients with febrile illness from Saudi Arabia.,"OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the prevalence of febrile illness in the Arabian region as clinical, laboratory and immunological profiling remains largely uncharacterised.
METHODS: A total of 2018 febrile patients from Jazan, Saudi Arabia, were recruited between 2014 and 2017. Patients were screened for dengue and chikungunya virus, 
RESULTS: Approximately 20% of febrile patients were tested positive for one of the pathogens, and they presented overlapping clinical and laboratory parameters. Nonetheless, eight disease-specific immune mediators were identified as potential biomarkers for dengue (MIP-1α, MCP-1), malaria (TNF-α), streptococcal and meningococcal (eotaxin, GRO-α, RANTES, SDF-1α and PIGF-1) infections, with high specificity and sensitivity profiles. Notably, based on the conditional inference model, six of these mediators (MIP-1α, TNF-α, GRO-α, RANTES, SDF-1α and PIGF-1) were revealed to be 68.4% accurate in diagnosing different febrile infections, including those of unknown diseases.

32853287,Canine vaccination in Germany: A survey of owner attitudes and compliance.,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is the most important preventive measure for protection against infectious diseases in humans and companion animals. Nevertheless, scepticism about the safety and importance of vaccines is increasing in human and in veterinary medicine. Although owner attitudes towards vaccination have been investigated in cats, there are no similar studies in dogs. The goals of this study were therefore to investigate the vaccination status of dogs in Germany, to determine owner compliance with vaccination and to identify factors that play a role in owners' decisions to have their dogs vaccinated.
METHODS: Data were collected from August 2018 to February 2019 using an online survey targeting dog owners in Germany. A total of 3,881 questionnaires were evaluated, and factors associated with the vaccination status of dogs were determined by a linear logistic regression model using Akaike information criterion. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to evaluate agreement between questionnaire and 340 vaccination passports submitted voluntarily by owners.
RESULTS: A total of 46.8% (n = 1,818/3,881) of dogs were vaccinated with core vaccines according to current guidelines with the lowest vaccination rate for leptospirosis (50.1%; n = 1,941/3,874). Dog's age (16 weeks to 15 months) (odds ratio (OR): 3.08; 95% CI: 2.05-4.68), type (working dog) (OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.22-3.53) and travelling abroad within previous 36 months (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.12-2.96) had the strongest 'positive' association with the vaccination status. Recommendation from a veterinarian not to vaccinate against leptospirosis had the strongest 'negative' association (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04-0.18).
CONCLUSION: The study revealed a need for improvement in vaccination compliance because of inadequate vaccination coverage, especially for leptospirosis, in dogs. Factors influencing owner compliance were numerous. Vaccination recommendations made by the veterinarian had a strong association with the vaccination status and should be used to increase canine vaccination rates.","['Eschle S', 'Hartmann K', 'Rieger A', 'Fischer S', 'Klima A', 'Bergmann M']",2020,15,8,PLoS One,"Eschle S, et al.

32849896,First description of reactive arthritis secondary to leptospirosis in a dog.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is common worldwide, with a wide spectrum of clinical signs. It commonly infects the kidneys and the liver but can damage a number of organ systems.
CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-month-old boxer dog was referred because of reluctance to walk and sickness.
FINDINGS/TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: His clinical presentation, including swollen and inflamed joints fulfilled the requirements for a diagnosis of immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA).

CONCLUSION: In human medicine, this case would be considered as a reactive arthritis (ReA), which is mistakenly cited in the current veterinary literature for cases associated with chronic infections. In humans, ReA is described as inflammatory arthritis not directly caused by culture-proven infection of joint tissue but by infection at another site due to a complex interplay of host antimicrobial factors. This case presentation reports for the very first time, a case of canine leptospirosis mimicking an IMPA and fitting the description of ReA in human medicine.","['Furlanello T', 'Reale I']",2020,21,2,Iran J Vet Res,Furlanello T and Reale I.

Leptospirosis was not considered for 10 days because of the low incidence of the disease in the country, absent animal contact and physicians' low index of suspicion. Presentation without fever and without the commonly associated abdominal pain, myalgia, headache, thrombocytopaenia or elevated serum creatine kinase added to the diagnostic challenge.

32841248,Multilocus sequence typing reveals diverse known and novel genotypes of Leptospira spp. circulating in Sri Lanka.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis has gained much attention in Sri Lanka since its large outbreak in 2008. However, most of the cases were clinically diagnosed and information on Leptospira genotypes and serotypes currently prevailing in the country is lacking.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively analyzed 24 Leptospira strains from human patients as well as isolated and characterized three Leptospira strains from black rats using the microscopic agglutination test with antisera for 19 serovars and multilocus sequence typing. The isolates were identified as Leptospira borgpetersenii sequence types (STs) 143 and 144; L. interrogans STs 30, 34, 43, 44, 74, 75, 80, 308, 313, 314, 316, and 317; and L. kirschneri ST318. Six of the 15 STs were identified for the first time in this study. Five serogroups such as Autumnalis, Grippotyphosa, Hebdomadis, Javanica, and Pyrogenes were detected among the isolates. Contrary to previous studies, various genotypes including novel STs were isolated during an outbreak in Southern Province. L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica ST143 was isolated both from a human and black rat.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed that genetically diverse Leptospira strains currently circulate in Sri Lanka: some genotypes have been circulating and others have emerged recently, which may explain the recent surge of leptospirosis patients with varying clinical manifestations and frequent outbreaks of leptospirosis. Black rats were identified as the source of infection for humans, but reservoir animals for other genotypes remain unknown.","['Karunanayake L', 'Gamage CD', 'Gunasekara CP', 'De Silva S', 'Izumiya H', 'Morita M', 'Muthusinghe DS', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Niloofa R', 'Karunanayake P', 'Uluwattage W', 'Ohnishi M', 'Koizumi N']",2020,14,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Karunanayake L, et al.

32828405,Leptospira sp. vertical transmission in ewes maintained in semiarid conditions.,"Leptospirosis is a globally distributed disease associated with reproductive failures in livestock; however, its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Results from the present study indicate there is a presence of Leptospira sp. in organs and fluids of fetuses from ewes slaughtered in the semiarid region of Brazil. Twenty-nine fetuses from 23 ewes determined to be Leptospira sp.-positive using PCR were sampled (14 and 15 in dry and rainy seasons, respectively). Fetal samples of blood, central nervous system (CNS), lung, liver, spleen, stomach contents, peritoneal fluid, kidney, bladder, urine and reproductive system were collected. Diagnostic methods included the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacterial isolation. Of the 29 fetuses, 24 (82.8 %) had at least one Leptospira sp.-positive organ or fluid, as determined using PCR, and of a total of 209 samples, 62 (29.7 %) contained leptospiral DNA. Of the 99 samples collected during the dry season, 42 (42.4 %) were positive, and of 110 samples collected during the rainy season, 20 (18.2 %) were positive (P = 0.0001). There was deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing of three samples of kidney, CNS and liver, and in all of these, there was 99.3 % similarity with Leptospira interrogans. Leptospires were present in cultures of pooled samples from fetuses with deformities. Results indicate there is vertical (maternal-to-fetus) transmission which would represent an alternative transmission route for the spread of Leptospira sp. in ewes, suggesting molecular detection is essential in the investigation of leptospirosis in fetuses to identify animals that have been infected with this bacterium.","['Nogueira DB', 'da Costa FTR', 'de Sousa Bezerra C', 'Soares RR', 'da Costa Barnabé NN', 'Falcão BMR', 'Silva MLCR', 'da Costa DF', 'Araújo JP', 'Malossi CD', 'Ullmann LS', 'Alves CJ', 'de Azevedo SS']",2020,219,,Anim Reprod Sci,"Nogueira DB, et al.

32801110,"Seroprevalence and risk factors of bovine leptospirosis in the province of Manabí, Ecuador.","Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution. The disease affects dairy and beef cattle, causing infertility, abortion, and reduced milk yield. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of leptospirosis in cattle and the associated risk factors in the province of Manabí, Ecuador. Serum samples from 749 animals from 55 cattle herds were analyzed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Animals were considered positive when titers were ≥ 1:100. The association between the potential risk factors and the positive Leptospira result was modeled at both animal and herd level using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and logarithmic link. The seroprevalence was 56.21% at the individual level and 98.18% at the herd level. The most prevalent serovars were Pomona (28.57%) and Icterohaemorragiae (22.30%). At the animal level, only the age was associated with leptospirosis seropositivity. Seroprevalence in animals over three years of age was 1.197 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.032 - 1.390), higher compared to animals up to three years old. The seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. was higher in farms with no veterinary assistance (PR = 1.209; 95%CI 1.053 - 1.388) and without a vaccination program against Leptospira (PR = 1.399; 95%CI 1.09 - 1.794). In addition, herds from Junín canton had a significantly higher seroprevalence of Leptospira spp (PR = 1.548; 95%CI 1.213 - 1.977) compared to the Bolívar canton, which had the lowest seroprevalence. In conclusion, more than half of the animals were positive to Leptospiraspp, and almost all herds had at least one positive animal. Furthermore, veterinary assistance and vaccination of cattle must be considered as essential aspects of the disease control program.","['Ruano MP', 'Burgos Macías DI', 'Goicochea CAB', 'Zambrano Aguayo MD', 'Sandoval Valencia HP', 'Falconi Flores MA', 'Vera Loor LA', 'Revelo Ruales AP', 'Fonseca-Rodríguez O']",2020,72,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Ruano MP, et al.

32790762,Survival time of Leptospira kirschneri on strawberries.,"In the past decade, two leptospirosis outbreaks occurred among strawberry harvesters in Germany, with 13, and 45 reported cases respectively. In both outbreaks, common voles (Microtus arvalis) infected with Leptospira kischneri serovar Grippotyphosa were identified as the most likely outbreak source. In an univariate analysis, eating unwashed strawberries was identified as one of the risk factors associated with Leptospira infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival time of L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa on strawberries under varying conditions. Strawberries were spiked with 5x109 of both a laboratory reference strain (strain Moskva V) and an outbreak field strain (94-6/2007) of L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa sequence type 110. Survival times were investigated in a fully crossed design with three incubation times (2h, 4h, 6h and 8h) and three temperatures (15°C, 21°C and 25°C) with three replicated for each condition. A wash protocol was developed and recovered Leptospira were determined by qPCR, dark field microscopy and culturing. Viable L. kirschneri of both the reference strain and the field strain were identified in all samples at 25°C and an incubation time of 2h, but only 1/9 (11%) and 4/9 (44%) of the samples incubated at 15°C were positive, respectively. Both reference and field strain were viable only in 2/9 (22%) at 25° after 6h. After an 8h incubation, viable Leptospira could not be identified on the surface of the strawberries or within the fruit for any of the tested conditions. Based on these results, the exposure risk of consumers to viable Leptospira spp. through the consumption of strawberries bought at the retail level is most likely very low. However, there is a potential risk of Leptospira infection by consumption of strawberries on pick-your-own farms.","['Tekemen D', 'Franz M', 'Bier NS', 'Richter M', 'Nöckler K', 'Luge E', 'Mayer-Scholl A']",2020,15,8,PLoS One,"Tekemen D, et al.

32790743,Leptospiral LPS escapes mouse TLR4 internalization and TRIF‑associated antimicrobial responses through O antigen and associated lipoproteins.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide re-emerging zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. All vertebrate species can be infected; humans are sensitive hosts whereas other species, such as rodents, may become long-term renal carrier reservoirs. Upon infection, innate immune responses are initiated by recognition of Microbial Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs) by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs). Among MAMPs, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is recognized by the Toll-Like-Receptor 4 (TLR4) and activates both the MyD88-dependent pathway at the plasma membrane and the TRIF-dependent pathway after TLR4 internalization. We previously showed that leptospiral LPS is not recognized by the human-TLR4, whereas it signals through mouse-TLR4 (mTLR4), which mediates mouse resistance to acute leptospirosis. However, although resistant, mice are known to be chronically infected by leptospires. Interestingly, the leptospiral LPS has low endotoxicity in mouse cells and is an agonist of TLR2, the sensor for bacterial lipoproteins. Here, we investigated the signaling properties of the leptospiral LPS in mouse macrophages. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we showed that the LPS of L. interrogans did not induce internalization of mTLR4, unlike the LPS of Escherichia coli. Consequently, the LPS failed to induce the production of the TRIF-dependent nitric oxide and RANTES, both important antimicrobial responses. Using shorter LPS and LPS devoid of TLR2 activity, we further found this mTLR4-TRIF escape to be dependent on both the co-purifying lipoproteins and the full-length O antigen. Furthermore, our data suggest that the O antigen could alter the binding of the leptospiral LPS to the co-receptor CD14 that is essential for TLR4-TRIF activation. Overall, we describe here a novel leptospiral immune escape mechanism from mouse macrophages and hypothesize that the LPS altered signaling could contribute to the stealthiness and chronicity of the leptospires in mice.","['Bonhomme D', 'Santecchia I', 'Vernel-Pauillac F', 'Caroff M', 'Germon P', 'Murray G', 'Adler B', 'Boneca IG', 'Werts C']",2020,16,8,PLoS Pathog,"Bonhomme D, et al.

32760523,Estimating prevalence and test accuracy in disease ecology: How Bayesian latent class analysis can boost or bias imperfect test results.,"Obtaining accurate estimates of disease prevalence is crucial for the monitoring and management of wildlife populations but can be difficult if different diagnostic tests yield conflicting results and if the accuracy of each diagnostic test is unknown. Bayesian latent class analysis (BLCA) modeling offers a potential solution, providing estimates of prevalence levels and diagnostic test accuracy under the realistic assumption that no diagnostic test is perfect.In typical applications of this approach, the specificity of one test is fixed at or close to 100%, allowing the model to simultaneously estimate the sensitivity and specificity of all other tests, in addition to infection prevalence. In wildlife systems, a test with near-perfect specificity is not always available, so we simulated data to investigate how decreasing this fixed specificity value affects the accuracy of model estimates.We used simulations to explore how the trade-off between diagnostic test specificity and sensitivity impacts prevalence estimates and found that directional biases depend on pathogen prevalence. Both the precision and accuracy of results depend on the sample size, the diagnostic tests used, and the true infection prevalence, so these factors should be considered when applying BLCA to estimate disease prevalence and diagnostic test accuracy in wildlife systems. A wildlife disease case study, focusing on leptospirosis in California sea lions, demonstrated the potential for Bayesian latent class methods to provide reliable estimates under real-world conditions.We delineate conditions under which BLCA improves upon the results from a single diagnostic across a range of prevalence levels and sample sizes, demonstrating when this method is preferable for disease ecologists working in a wide variety of pathogen systems.","['Helman SK', 'Mummah RO', 'Gostic KM', 'Buhnerkempe MG', 'Prager KC', 'Lloyd-Smith JO']",2020,10,14,Ecol Evol,"Helman SK, et al.

32758519,Leptospiral protein LIC11334 display an immunogenic peptide KNSMP01.,"Leptospirosis is considered as a neglected tropical disease which is caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. The precise mechanisms of leptospirosis pathogenesis are unclear and hence, the progress in development of treatment modalities has been dismal. The present study aimed to identify novel virulent factors of leptospires to understand the disease pathogenesis and to develop treatment modalities. Leptospira interrogans contains two chromosomes and encodes for ~3703 genes, but the functions of several open reading frames have not yet been explored. Among them, novel virulent associated leptospiral proteins (LIC11334, LIC11542, LIC11436, LIC11120 and LIC12539) were identified using VirulentPredict and the antigenicity of these targets was explored by VaxiJen server. Domain architecture of the pathogen specific proteins revealed that LIC11334 had potential to evoke significant immune response against leptospiral infection and LIC11436 contains four folds of immunoglobulin-like domain and plays a vital role in pathogenesis. Therefore, B-cell epitopes were predicted and the epitope of high virulence (and VaxiJen score from LIC11334) was chemically synthesized as peptide (KNSMP01) and labeled with Biotin (Biotin-SGSGEVENPDPKVAQEC). Binding affinity of KNSMP01 with MHC molecules was predicted and the molecule was discovered to have potential to elicit both humoral and cell mediated immune responses and found to interact with host components via hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. Rabbit antisera was raised against KNSMP01 and found to elicit antigenicity using Western, ELISA and dot blot assays. In silico and in vitro experiments show KNSMP01 to be a promising immunogen and may be a better vaccine candidate for leptospirosis.","['Prasad M', 'Bothammal P', 'Akino Mercy CS', 'Sumaiya K', 'Saranya P', 'Muralitharan G', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2020,149,,Microb Pathog,"Prasad M, et al.

Dogs are known to be the reservoir animal of L. interrogans serovar Canicola, but the importance of dogs in zoonotic transmission of other Leptospira serotypes/genotypes remains unclear. This study reports the isolation of L. interrogans serogroup Autumnalis from two human patients in Japan and describes the genetic comparison between canine and mouse isolates using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA).

32730816,Contribution of Complement System pathways to the killing of Leptospira spp.,"The Complement System (CS) plays an important role in the immune response against leptospirosis and can be activated by the Alternative and Lectin Pathways (Innate Immunity) and by the Classical Pathway (Acquired Immunity). Here we analyzed a broad range of nonpathogenic and pathogenic Leptospira strains considering their interaction with each CS pathway. We determined bacterial survival rate and CS protein deposition in the presence of purified proteins, specific component depleted sera and NHS treated with the chelating agents EDTA (inhibits all three activation pathways) or EGTA (inhibits the Classical and Lectin Pathways). We suggest that the Lectin and the Alternative Pathways have an important role to eliminate saprophytic leptospires since i) approximately 50% survival of both saprophytic strains was observed in the presence of MBL-deficient serum; ii) approximately 50% survival of Leptospira biflexa Patoc I was observed in the presence of NHS - EGTA and iii) C1q-depleted serum caused significant bacterial lysis. In all serovars investigated the deposition of C5-C9 proteins on saprophytic Leptospira strains was more pronounced when compared to pathogenic species confirming previous studies in the literature. No difference on C3 deposition was observed between nonpathogenic and pathogenic strains. In conclusion, Leptospira strains interact to different degrees with CS proteins, especially those necessary to form MAC, indicating that some strains and specific ligands could favor the binding of certain CS proteins.","['Alves da Silva PYO', 'Midon LM', 'Heinemann MB', 'de Moraes Vasconcelos D', 'Barbosa AS', 'Isaac L']",2020,22,10,Microbes Infect,"Alves da Silva PYO, et al.

They result in disability, stigma and disfigurement, and also push families into poverty. Tropical infections can involve the kidney, presenting as a wide variety of ways, varying from transient urinary abnormalities to severe acute kidney injury (AKI). It is important to assess renal function in patients with tropical infections for earlier detection of AKI, appropriate treatment and prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) outcome in some of them. There was an exponential increase in research on new kidney biomarkers that were earlier and specific for renal damage but few in the scope of tropical infections. In this review, we focus on kidney biomarkers that are being studied in some of the most prevalent tropical infections such as visceral leishmaniasis, leptospirosis, malaria, schistosomiasis and leprosy. Further studies are needed to evaluate the usefulness of renal biomarkers in the early diagnosis of renal diseases associated with tropical infections.","['Duarte DB', 'Lacerda MCSR', 'Ribeiro YJP', 'Ribeiro MZD', 'Frederico MA', 'Oliveira MJC']",2020,114,6,Pathog Glob Health,"Duarte DB, et al.

32710920,Successful Leptospira genotyping strategy on DNA extracted from canine biological samples.,"Leptospirosis is an emerging worldwide zoonosis with a changing epidemiology responsible for an acute disease in humans and dogs. A better knowledge of the responsible bacterium Leptospira and in particular its various serovars and serogroups prevalence is essential for better diagnosis and prevention of the disease. The gold standard for leptospirosis diagnosis is the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) but it requires long and fastidious laboratory work and sometimes results in controversial data. For these reasons, PCR-based techniques for detection of pathogenic leptospiral DNA in biological samples are currently replacing the MAT. However, these strategies do not provide any information regarding the infecting serovar or serogroup. In this study, an optimized genotyping method is described to allow the identification of Leptospira ssp. directly at serovars level using DNA extracted from canine blood and urine. 16S rDNA, Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) and Multispacer Sequence Typing (MST) protocols were adapted to biological samples. Eighty-eight DNA samples were analyzed from 72 different European canine clinical cases of leptospirosis confirmed by real-time PCR. 92% of DNA samples with Ct values below 34 were fully typed, and typing success decreased to about 30% for the other samples. Typing failure also showed a specie-specific correlation, with 63% of complete typing for L. interrogans and only 40% for L. kirschneri. Additionally, an exact match was observed between serological and molecular data for the few investigated cases where MAT data were available. This methodology is a suitable alternative to the MAT for determining the infecting serovar when Leptospira DNA from blood or urine is detected at Ct values below 34, contributing to clinical surveillance of leptospirosis.","['Le Guyader M', 'Fontana C', 'Simon-Dufay N', 'Balzer HJ', 'Pantchev N', 'Thibault JC', 'Cupillard L', 'Bomchil N', 'Kodjo A']",2020,176,,J Microbiol Methods,"Le Guyader M, et al.

32701971,Understanding leptospirosis eco-epidemiology by environmental DNA metabarcoding of irrigation water from two agro-ecological regions of Sri Lanka.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is one of the most significant zoonoses across the world not only because of its impact on human and animal health but also because of the economic and social impact on agrarian communities. Leptospirosis is endemic in Sri Lanka where paddy farming activities, the use of draught animals in agriculture, and peridomestic animals in urban and rural areas play important roles in maintaining the infection cycle of pathogenic Leptospira, especially concerning animals as a potential reservoir. In this study, an environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding methodology was applied in two different agro-ecological regions of Sri Lanka to understand the eco-epidemiology of leptospirosis.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Irrigation water samples were collected in Kandy District (wet zone mid-country region 2) and Girandurukotte, Badulla District (intermediate zone low-country region 2); and analysed for the presence of pathogenic Leptospira, associated microbiome and the potential reservoir animals. Briefly, we generated PCR products for high-throughput sequencing of multiple amplicons through next-generation sequencing. The analysis of eDNA showed different environmental microbiomes in both regions and a higher diversity of Leptospira species circulating in Kandy than in Girandurukotte. Moreover, the number of sequence reads of pathogenic Leptospira species associated with clinical cases such as L. interrogans was higher in Kandy than in Girandurukotte. Kandy also showed more animal species associated with pathogenic bacterial species than Girandurukotte. Finally, several pathogenic bacterial species including Arcobacter cryaerophilus, responsible for abortion in animals, was shown to be associated with pathogenic Leptospira.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospirosis has been considered to be endemic in wet regions, consistently, leptospiral sequences were detected strongly in Kandy. The great Leptospira species diversity in Kandy observed in this study shows that the etiological agents of leptospirosis in Sri Lanka might be underestimated. Furthermore, our eDNA metabarcoding can be used to discriminate bacterial and animal species diversity in different regions and to explore environmental microbiomes to identify other associated bacterial pathogens in the environment.","['Gamage CD', 'Sato Y', 'Kimura R', 'Yamashiro T', 'Toma C']",2020,14,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Gamage CD, et al.

32700658,An Observational Study of Human Leptospirosis in Seychelles.,"A 1-year population-based prospective study was launched in Seychelles, a country with one of the highest human incidence of leptospirosis worldwide, to describe the characteristic features of the epidemiology of the disease and highlight the most prominent risk factors. Diagnosis was based on the IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, microscopic agglutination test, and real-time PCR. A standardized questionnaire was administered to 219 patients aged ≥ 13 years consulting for acute febrile illness. The high incidence of leptospirosis in Seychelles was confirmed. The disease was particularly severe, as the case fatality rate was 11.8%. Leptospirosis was positively associated in univariate analysis with socio-professional and clinical variables including gardening/farming, oliguria, jaundice, conjunctivitis, history of hepatitis C virus infection, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or biological renal failure. Epidemiological analyses of the questionnaires highlighted a link of the disease with living in houses (versus apartment), the presence of animals around and in houses, gardening, and misuse of personal protective equipment. Multivariate analyses indicated that being a farmer/landscaper and having cattle and cats around the home are the most significant drivers of leptospirosis. Biological features most associated with leptospirosis were thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, high values for renal function tests, and elevated total bilirubin. We report changes in behavior and exposure compared with data collected on leptospirosis 25 years ago, with indication that healthcare development has lowered case fatality. Continuous health education campaigns are recommended as well as further studies to clarify the epidemiology of human leptospirosis, especially the role of domestic animals.","['Biscornet L', 'de Comarmond J', 'Bibi J', 'Mavingui P', 'Dellagi K', 'Tortosa P', 'Pagès F']",2020,103,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Biscornet L, et al.

We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of Leptospira borgpetersenii sv Hardjo and Leptospira interrogans sv Pomona in cattle in dairy herds in South-Western Victoria, Australia. Fifty-three herds were enrolled in the study. Urine samples were collected from 15 late-lactation cows in each herd. A questionnaire was provided to herd managers at the time of each herd visit, asking them to describe the methods they used for controlling leptospirosis, including vaccination. Urine samples were pooled at the herd level and tested for leptospira spp. using real time PCR. Urine samples from individual cows within the positive pooled samples were then tested for Leptospira Hardjo and Leptospira Pomona using qPCR. Four of the 53 herds showed positive leptospirosis results giving an apparent prevalence of 8 (95% CI 2-18) leptospira-positive herds per 100 herds at risk. Based on the 53 completed questionnaires, leptospirosis vaccination programs were not compliant with label directions in 36 of the 52 vaccinated herds: 69 (95% CI 55-81) of 100 herd managers that routinely vaccinated for leptospirosis did not comply with label directions. One herd was completely unvaccinated. Based on our findings, we estimate that approximately 10% of dairy farms in South-Western Victoria are likely to be infected with leptospirosis. While most herds are vaccinating for leptospirosis, most are not doing so according to label directions. We conclude that herd managers need to be better educated regarding leptospirosis vaccination programs.","['Erregger E', 'Stevenson MA', 'Beggs DS', 'Oswin S', 'Jagoe SP', 'Mansell PD', 'Pyman MF']",2020,98,9,Aust Vet J,"Erregger E, et al.

32683468,Leptospira interrogans Retains Direct Virulence After Long Starvation in Water.,"Mostly studied as a zoonosis, leptospirosis is also an environment-borne infection and most human cases originate from soil or water contaminations. Yet, only few studies have been interested in the survival of pathogenic Leptospira in freshwater. In this study, water microcosms were designed to evaluate the survival and virulence of Leptospira spp. for 2 years. Four commercial bottled drinking waters and a non-ionized water, all previously filter-sterilized, were studied. Either one of two Leptospira interrogans strains, one Leptospira borgpetersenii strain, or a saprophytic Leptospira biflexa was inoculated in these waters under nutrient-deprived conditions. Molecular, microscopic and cultural approaches were used to study Leptospira survival. Direct virulence of the pathogens was assessed using animal challenge without re-culturing. Our results confirmed the capacity of pathogenic Leptospira to survive for more than a year in water. In addition, we showed the ability of L. interrogans in nutrient-deprived conditions to directly cause systemic infection in susceptible animals. To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct infection of a susceptible host with Leptospira following a long starvation and survival period in nutrient-deprived water. Our results also suggest that Leptospira turned into a physiological ""survival"" state in harsh freshwater conditions. These data are of prime importance considering that freshwater is a major source of Leptospira infections. Environmental survival and virulence of pathogenic Leptospira spp. are becoming a crucial challenge to determine the environmental risk and adopt relevant prevention and control strategies.","['Bierque E', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Thibeaux R', 'Girault D', 'Guentas L', 'Goarant C']",2020,77,10,Curr Microbiol,"Bierque E, et al.

Leptospirosis symptoms are often confused or misdiagnosed with other febrile illness like malaria, viral hepatitis, influenza, dengue, typhoid, melioidosis, and scrub typhus as the clinical manifestations are almost similar. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis of leptospirosis is indeed critical for proper and prompt treatment. Herein, we report the development of single-walled carbon nanotubes based immunofluorescence probe (Carbo-Lip) for the detection of leptospirosis at an early phase by utilising major outer membrane protein, LipL32 of Leptospira. The Carbo-Lip probe was fabricated through immuno recognition method with fluorescent dye functionalized LipL32 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), secondary antibody and Leptospira. Surface characterization studies such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with the attenuated total reflectance, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Zeta potential, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques were used to demonstrate the successful fabrication of Carbo-Lip probe.

Therefore, biomarkers that are more effective are urgently needed for the early diagnosis of leptospirosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved regulatory RNAs that have shown the potential to be used as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of infectious diseases. In this study, we performed an unbiased screen using the miRNome miRNA array to identify circulating miRNAs with the potential to serve as authentic biomarkers for early diagnosis of leptospirosis.

32668449,Survival time of Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa under different environmental conditions.,"Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease of high medical importance that affects humans worldwide. Humans or animals acquire an infection with pathogenic leptospires either by direct contact with infected animals or by indirect contact to contaminated environment. Survival of Leptospira spp. in the environment after having been shed via animal urine is thus a key factor to estimate the risk of infection, but not much is known about the tenacity of pathogenic leptospires. Here, the survival time of both a laboratory strain and a field strain of L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa in animal urine and their tenacity while drying was investigated and compared at different temperatures (15°C-37°C). Leptospira spp. are also often found in rivers and ponds. As the infection risk for humans and animals also depends on the spreading and survival of Leptospira spp. in these environments, the survival of L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa was investigated using a 50-meter-long hose system simulating a water stream. Both strains did not survive in undiluted cattle or dog urine. Comparing different temperatures and dilution media, the laboratory strain survived the longest in diluted cattle urine with a slightly alkaline pH value (3 days), whilst the field strain survived in diluted dog urine with a slightly acid pH value up to a maximum of 24 h. Both strains did not survive drying on a solid surface. In a water stream, leptospires were able to move faster or slower than the average velocity of the water due to their intrinsic mobility but were not able to survive the mechanical damage caused by running water in the hose system. From our results we conclude, that once excreted via animal urine, the leptospires immediately need moisture or a water body to survive and stay infectious.","['Nau LH', 'Obiegala A', 'Król N', 'Mayer-Scholl A', 'Pfeffer M']",2020,15,7,PLoS One,"Nau LH, et al.

ANIMALS: Sixty-four (presumed antemortem diagnosis) and 137 (postmortem diagnosis only) client-owned dogs at two tertiary care facilities were included.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of dogs with clinical or histopathological diagnosis of myocarditis were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Common examination findings in dogs with a presumed antemortem diagnosis included fever (21%) and heart murmur (19%). Median cardiac troponin I was 12.2 ng/mL (range: 0.2-808.0 ng/mL), and troponin exceeded 1.0 ng/mL in 26 of 29 (90%) dogs. Ventricular ectopy was the most common arrhythmia (54%), whereas decreased left ventricular systolic function was the most common echocardiographic abnormality (56%). An infectious etiology was diagnosed in 35 of 64 (55%) dogs. Confirmed infectious etiologies included bacterial sepsis (n = 9) or extension of endocarditis (3), toxoplasmosis or neosporosis (3), parvovirus (2), and one case each of bartonellosis, trypanosomiasis, leptospirosis, and dirofilariasis. Median survival time was 4 days (range: 0-828 days) for all dogs vs. 82 days for dogs who survived at least 2 weeks after diagnosis. Presence of pericardial effusion or azotemia was a significant predictor of non-survival. The most common inflammatory infiltrate on histopathology was neutrophilic (47%), and 20 of 137 (14.5%) dogs had concurrent bacterial endocarditis on postmortem.
CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infection was the most common confirmed etiology of myocarditis in this study. Prognosis for canine myocarditis is guarded and similar to that reported for infective endocarditis.

32636638,Relationship Between the Prevalence of Blood Groups and Severity of Leptospirosis: A Case-Control Study.,"INTRODUCTION: The correlation between the prevalence and severity of leptospirosis with blood groups has not been investigated so far, but several studies have been conducted to link the infectious diseases with blood groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of blood type in patients with leptospirosis and its association with disease severity.
METHODS: This is a case-control study performed on hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of leptospirosis in Mazandaran province, Iran, in 2018. The control group was selected from among the families of patients. Blood groups (ABO and Rh) and severity of the disease were assessed. Data were analyzed by SPSS 22.
RESULTS: A total of 300 people (150 in the case and 150 in the control) enrolled in the study. The mean age was 44.35 ± 15.39 years and 81.3% were men. The highest frequency of blood type in both groups was O+, A+, and B+, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the frequency of blood groups (
CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, O+ was the most common among patients with leptospirosis. The frequency of O in patients was significantly higher than in the control group, but there was no significant relationship between leptospirosis and Rh. The prevalence of this blood type was higher in people with a severe form of the disease. Finally, there is no statistically significant difference between the severity of the disease and ABO and Rh.","['Davoodi L', 'Razavi A', 'Jafarpour H', 'Heshmati M', 'Soleymani E', 'Ghasemian R']",2020,13,,Infect Dis (Auckl),"Davoodi L, et al.

32632878,Laboratory Diagnosis of Leptospirosis.,"The diagnosis of leptospirosis depends on specific laboratory tests because nonspecific and diverse clinical manifestations make clinical diagnosis difficult and it is easily confused with other infectious diseases in the tropics. Suitable laboratory diagnostic tests vary depending on the stage of the disease, requiring the combination of diagnostic tests using appropriate specimens at each disease stage.",['Koizumi N'],2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Koizumi N.

32632877,Leptospira and Leptospirosis.,"Leptospira spp. are morphologically and phylogenetically unique bacteria that are ubiquitous in the environment. Pathogenic species are the agents of leptospirosis, an emerging zoonotic disease transmitted to both human and animals from the environment contaminated with the urine of reservoir animals. The taxonomy of Leptospira has recently undergone extensive revisions with the use of whole-genome sequences, thus expanding considerably the number of species.",['Picardeau M'],2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Picardeau M.

32632876,Evaluation of Vaccine Candidates against Leptospirosis using Golden Syrian Hamsters.,"Leptospirosis is a major public health problem, especially in developing countries. Current vaccine studies focus on identifying Leptospira proteins that elicit protective immunity. Here, we describe a method to assess recombinant proteins for their ability to protect hamsters from fatal infection against Leptospira and to provide sterilizing immunity.","['Evangelista KV', 'Lourdault K']",2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Evangelista KV and Lourdault K.

32632875,Use of Golden Syrian Hamster as an Animal Model to Study Leptospirosis-Associated Immune Responses.,"Experimental infections greatly contribute to further deepen our knowledge of infectious diseases. In the case of leptospirosis, hamsters as well as gerbils and guinea pigs have been used as animal models of acute leptospirosis in studying the pathophysiology of the disease. Here we describe a typical Leptospira infection using golden Syrian hamsters. We will also present techniques we use to study the resulting bacterial burden and gene expression patterns in the host in order to decipher the innate immune response to leptospirosis.","['Cagliero J', 'Huet K', 'Matsui M']",2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,"Cagliero J, et al.

32632874,Cultivation of Leptospira interrogans Within Rat Peritoneal Dialysis Membrane Chambers.,"In order to sustain its zoonotic lifecycle, leptospires must adapt to growth within the host milieu. Signals encountered within the mammal also trigger regulatory programs required by Leptospira for the expression of virulence-related gene products. The complex transcriptional, antigenic, and physiological changes leptospires undergo within the mammal are collectively referred to as ""host adaptation."" In this chapter, we describe the procedures for the generation of host-adapted Leptospira spp. by cultivation within dialysis membrane chambers (DMCs) implanted in rat peritoneal cavities. In this model, Leptospira spp. diluted in EMJH medium are sequestered within sterile dialysis membrane tubing closed at both ends. The chamber then is surgically implanted within the peritoneal cavity of a rat and incubated for 7-10 days. During this period, leptospires are exposed to many, if not all, of the physiological and nutritional cues required for host adaptation while at the same time protected from clearance by host innate and adaptive immune defenses.","['Grassmann AA', 'Caimano MJ']",2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Grassmann AA and Caimano MJ.

32632870,Complement Resistance Assays.,"Like many other pathogens of medical importance, pathogenic Leptospira employ diverse strategies to circumvent Complement System activation. Under physiological conditions, this central humoral arm of innate immunity is tightly controlled by negative Complement regulatory proteins. However, upon infection, pathogenic microorganisms interfere with normal Complement host defense mechanisms by recruiting or mimicking Complement regulators and by secreting endogenous proteases or acquiring host's proteases that inactivate key Complement components. In this chapter, we describe in detail some of the most frequently used assays to evaluate Leptospira Complement resistance.","['Isaac L', 'Barbosa AS']",2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Isaac L and Barbosa AS.

32632869,Cell Adhesion Assay to Study Leptospiral Proteins: An Approach to Investigate Host-Pathogen Interaction.,"The adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to host cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is considered an important step in the pathogenesis of microorganisms. It has been described that Leptospira spp. bind to multiple receptors on host cells and to the ECM to initiate infection. Most studies of Leptospira adherence described until now have focused on the in vitro attachment of recombinant L. interrogans proteins to ECM components. These putative adhesins may be involved in the colonization of the host, contributing to the bacterial invasion process. Certainly, in vitro cell adhesion studies have contributed to the elucidation of leptospiral pathogenesis mechanisms. Here, we describe a cell adhesion assay that can be used for studying the interactions between putative leptospiral adhesins and host components.","['Teixeira AF', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Teixeira AF and Nascimento ALTO.

32632868,Cell Monolayer Translocation Assay.,"An essential property associated with leptospiral virulence is the pathogen's ability to translocate across host cells, enabling Leptospira to evade the host immune response, disseminate, and establish infection. Cell monolayer translocation assay allows for the quantification of Leptospira strain's competence to cross cell barriers while measuring the integrity of the polarized eukaryotic cell monolayer during this process.",['Wunder EA'],2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Wunder EA.

32632867,In Vivo Imaging of Bioluminescent Leptospires.,"The study of pathological processes is often limited to in vitro or ex vivo assays, while understanding pathogenesis of an infectious disease requires in vivo analysis. The use of pathogens, genetically modified to express with luminescent enzymes, combined to charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras, constitutes a major technological advance for assessing the course of infection in an intact, living host in real time and in a noninvasive way. This technology, also called bioluminescence imaging, detects the photons emitted from biological sources of light through animal tissues. Here, we describe the method we developed to monitor leptospirosis in a mouse model, by following in a spatiotemporal scale, the dissemination and spread of leptospires. These bacteria have been genetically modified to express the firefly luciferase, which produces light in the presence of the substrate D-luciferin. This useful and accessible technology facilitates the study of the kinetics of blood and tissue dissemination of live leptospires, and the pharmacological impact of treatments and host directed therapeutics.","['Vernel-Pauillac F', 'Werts C']",2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Vernel-Pauillac F and Werts C.

These experiments have demonstrated a role of motility and potentially chemotaxis in leptospirosis pathogenesis. We describe extensively the methods and provide the key steps to use this toolbox.",['Lambert A'],2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Lambert A. Leptospira spp. Toolbox for Chemotaxis Assay.

32632857,Cell Enumeration of Leptospira by Flow Cytometry.,"Rapid and reliable enumeration of Leptospira spp., the causative agent of leptospirosis, represents a technical challenge because leptospires are thin, highly motile, and slow-growing bacteria. The current gold standard for cell enumeration is the use of a Petroff-Hausser counting chamber and a dark-field microscope, but this method remains time-consuming and lacks reproducibility. New alternative techniques are then of great interest. Here we describe the protocol for counting leptospires by flow cytometry. This method is rapid, reproducible, sensitive, and hence suitable to become a new standard to enumerate Leptospira spp.","['Fontana C', 'Reyes J']",2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,Fontana C and Reyes J.

32632856,Use of MALDI-ToF Mass Spectrometry for Identification of Leptospira.,"Medical microbiology has used phenotypical and metabolic criteria to identify bacterial pathogens for decades. However, no such criteria have been applied to identify leptospires at the species level. In the recent years, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as new tool for the identification of bacterial species in the medical microbiology laboratory. This technology has rapidly gained more and more popularity. Actually, this technique is sensitive and economic, saving both labor and bench costs, but also rapid, significantly reducing turnaround time from isolation to identification. MALDI-ToF MS provides an unprecedented tool for the rapid identification of Leptospira at the species level.","['Girault D', 'Kainiu M', 'Barsac E', 'Thibeaux R', 'Goarant C']",2020,2134,,Methods Mol Biol,"Girault D, et al.

In cgMLST, hundreds of loci are used for gene-by-gene comparisons of assembled genomes for studying the genetic diversity of clinically important pathogens. Combination of the cgMLST data and metadata of the isolates is useful for epidemiological investigations.Here we present a cgMLST scheme for the high-resolution typing of isolates from the whole Leptospira genus, enabling identification at the level of species, clades, clonal groups, and sequence types. We show several examples how the cgMLST Leptospira database, which is a publicly available web-based database, can be used for the analyses of WGS data of Leptospira isolates.

32619638,"Comparative genomic analysis of Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica isolated from Rattus species in Southern Japan, Philippines, and Taiwan.","Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a zoonosis that occurs worldwide, and are maintained by various mammals. Recent molecular typing studies have indicated the existence of a specific Leptospira genotype-host association; however, few studies have shown the colonization of a single genotype in multiple animal genera. To gain further insights into the Leptospira genotype-host association, we conducted whole genome sequencing of 35 strains of L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica isolated from various Rattus species in Southern Japan, Philippines, and Taiwan. The SNP-based phylogenetic tree showed that the strains were grouped into five clusters based on their geographic location, indicating geographical structuring of genetic diversity in L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica strains. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica can infect various animal species, thus making these strains generalist pathogens. This study reports the whole genome comparison of L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica strains isolated from Rattus species in East Asian states.

32617371,Previously Derived Host Gene Expression Classifiers Identify Bacterial and Viral Etiologies of Acute Febrile Respiratory Illness in a South Asian Population.,"BACKGROUND: Pathogen-based diagnostics for acute respiratory infection (ARI) have limited ability to detect etiology of illness. We previously showed that peripheral blood-based host gene expression classifiers accurately identify bacterial and viral ARI in cohorts of European and African descent. We determined classifier performance in a South Asian cohort.
METHODS: Patients ≥15 years with fever and respiratory symptoms were enrolled in Sri Lanka. Comprehensive pathogen-based testing was performed. Peripheral blood ribonucleic acid was sequenced and previously developed signatures were applied: a pan-viral classifier (viral vs nonviral) and an ARI classifier (bacterial vs viral vs noninfectious).
RESULTS: Ribonucleic acid sequencing was performed in 79 subjects: 58 viral infections (36 influenza, 22 dengue) and 21 bacterial infections (10 leptospirosis, 11 scrub typhus). The pan-viral classifier had an overall classification accuracy of 95%. The ARI classifier had an overall classification accuracy of 94%, with sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 95%, respectively, for bacterial infection. The sensitivity and specificity of C-reactive protein (>10 mg/L) and procalcitonin (>0.25 ng/mL) for bacterial infection were 100% and 34%, and 100% and 41%, respectively.

We describe clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings in individuals who died following chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection.
METHODS: We identified individuals who died in Puerto Rico during 2014 following an acute illness and had CHIKV RNA detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a pre- or postmortem blood or tissue specimen. We performed histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CHIKV antigen on tissue specimens and collected medical data via record review and family interviews.
RESULTS: Thirty CHIKV-infected fatal cases were identified (0.8/100 000 population). The median age was 61 years (range: 6 days-86 years), and 19 (63%) were male. Death occurred a median of 4 days (range: 1-29) after illness onset. Nearly all (93%) had at least 1 comorbidity, most frequently hypertension, diabetes, or obesity. Nine had severe comorbidities (eg, chronic heart or kidney disease, sickle cell anemia) or coinfection (eg, leptospirosis). Among 24 fatal cases with tissue specimens, 11 (46%) were positive by IHC. CHIKV antigen was most frequently detected in mesenchymal tissues and mononuclear cells including tissue macrophages, blood mononuclear cells, splenic follicular dendritic cells, and Kupffer cells. Common histopathologic findings were intra-alveolar hemorrhage and edema in the lung, chronic or acute tenosynovitis, and increased immunoblasts in the spleen. CHIKV infection likely caused fatal septic shock in 2 patients.

RESULTS: From 259 suspected cases with acute central nervous system infection, 171 cases were included for analysis, comprising 141 encephalitis, 22 myelitis and eight encephalomyelitis. The annual incidence peaked at 15.0/100 000 during the Zika 2016 outbreak. Children accounted for 22.2% of cases. Eight adults died during hospital stay, all encephalitis. Seventeen infectious agents, two of which had never been described in Guadeloupe so far, were identified in 101 cases (59.1%), including 35 confirmed cases (34.7%), 48 probable cases (47.5%), 15 possible cases (14.9%) and three clinical cases (3.0%). The most frequent etiologic agents were Zika virus in 23 cases (13.5%), herpes simplex in 12 (7.0%), varicella zoster virus in 11 (6.4%), dengue virus in 11 (6.4%) and leptospirosis in 11 (6.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: The Zika outbreak had a major influence on the annual incidence of acute central nervous system infection. Acute neuroleptospirosis is over-represented in our series. Further efforts are mandatory to develop new diagnostic tools for pathogen profiling.","['Chaumont H', 'Roze E', 'Tressières B', 'Lazarini F', 'Lannuzel A']",2020,27,11,Eur J Neurol,"Chaumont H, et al.

32598393,Linking longitudinal and cross-sectional biomarker data to understand host-pathogen dynamics: Leptospira in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) as a case study.,"Confronted with the challenge of understanding population-level processes, disease ecologists and epidemiologists often simplify quantitative data into distinct physiological states (e.g. susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered). However, data defining these states often fall along a spectrum rather than into clear categories. Hence, the host-pathogen relationship is more accurately defined using quantitative data, often integrating multiple diagnostic measures, just as clinicians do to assess their patients. We use quantitative data on a major neglected tropical disease (Leptospira interrogans) in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) to improve individual-level and population-level understanding of this Leptospira reservoir system. We create a ""host-pathogen space"" by mapping multiple biomarkers of infection (e.g. serum antibodies, pathogen DNA) and disease state (e.g. serum chemistry values) from 13 longitudinally sampled, severely ill individuals to characterize changes in these values through time. Data from these individuals describe a clear, unidirectional trajectory of disease and recovery within this host-pathogen space. Remarkably, this trajectory also captures the broad patterns in larger cross-sectional datasets of 1456 wild sea lions in all states of health but sampled only once. Our framework enables us to determine an individual's location in their time-course since initial infection, and to visualize the full range of clinical states and antibody responses induced by pathogen exposure. We identify predictive relationships between biomarkers and outcomes such as survival and pathogen shedding, and use these to impute values for missing data, thus increasing the size of the useable dataset. Mapping the host-pathogen space using quantitative biomarker data enables more nuanced understanding of an individual's time course of infection, duration of immunity, and probability of being infectious. Such maps also make efficient use of limited data for rare or poorly understood diseases, by providing a means to rapidly assess the range and extent of potential clinical and immunological profiles. These approaches yield benefits for clinicians needing to triage patients, prevent transmission, and assess immunity, and for disease ecologists or epidemiologists working to develop appropriate risk management strategies to reduce transmission risk on a population scale (e.g. model parameterization using more accurate estimates of duration of immunity and infectiousness) and to assess health impacts on a population scale.","['Prager KC', 'Buhnerkempe MG', 'Greig DJ', 'Orr AJ', 'Jensen ED', 'Gomez F', 'Galloway RL', 'Wu Q', 'Gulland FMD', 'Lloyd-Smith JO']",2020,14,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Prager KC, et al.

32590226,Meta-analysis of risk factors for canine leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases, with more than one million human cases reported worldwide every year. Dogs could develop infections that range from asymptomatic to severe, and shed leptospires with their urine. Given their close contact with humans, dogs may act both as epidemiological links or as sentinels of pathogenic leptospires in the environment. The aims of our study were to quantitatively summarize the overall prevalence of leptospiral antibodies and to identify factors associated with the probabilities of infection. We searched the electronic databases Scopus, PubMed, PMC and ScienceDirect for observational studies on canine leptospirosis published between 1989 and December 2019 and written in English, Spanish or Portuguese. We fitted a series of multilevel random effects meta-analysis models to estimate the prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira for different types of dogs, health statuses, diagnostic tests, geographic regions and income categories of the countries. We also fitted a number of random effects meta-analysis models to estimate the pooled odds-ratio of factors associated with canine leptospirosis. After removing duplicates and articles not meeting selection criteria, a total of 130 studies in 91 articles were included in this work. We found lower seroprevalence estimates in North America countries (P<0.001) and other high income countries (P<0.001). We also found higher probabilities of leptospiral infection in adult (P=0.017), male dogs with access to the streets (P<0.001). Identifying the profile of dogs that are more exposed to leptospirosis could be useful in the design of public health strategies for the prevention and control of leptospirosis.","['Ricardo T', 'Previtali MA', 'Signorini M']",2020,181,,Prev Vet Med,"Ricardo T, et al.

Its spread is related to certain ecological factors. The aim of the current research was to assess potential exposure to the infection as a function of environmental determinants in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russian Federation. We applied environmental niche modeling using leptospirosis cases in livestock and wild animals in 1995-2019 with regard to a set of landscape, climatic, and socioeconomic variables, both for the current climate and for the projected climate for 2041-2060. The MaxEnt model performed well (AUC = 0.930), with the mean temperature of the warmest quarter, mean diurnal range, land cover type, and altitude being the most contributing variables. Consequent zoning based on the proportion of high-risk cells within each administrative unit suggested that five out of the 36 districts of the Republic are at high risk in the current climate conditions, with three more districts expected to demonstrate a high risk by 2060. This study presents the first-ever attempt at leptospirosis ecological modeling in Russia. Its results correspond well to the findings of other authors and underline the importance of considering ecological factors when conducting a leptospirosis risk assessment.","['Zakharova OI', 'Korennoy FI', 'Toropova NN', 'Burova OA', 'Blokhin AA']",2020,9,6,Pathogens,"Zakharova OI, et al.

32578717,Biomechanical and biochemical investigation of erythrocytes in late stage human leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira, which can cause lipid changes in the erythrocyte membrane. Optical tweezers were used to characterize rheological changes in erythrocytes from patients with leptospirosis in the late stage. Biochemical methods were also used for quantification of plasma lipid, erythrocyte membrane lipid, and evaluation of liver function. Our data showed that the mean elastic constant of erythrocytes from patients with leptospirosis was around 67% higher than the control (healthy individuals), indicating that patient's erythrocytes were less elastic. In individuals with leptospirosis, several alterations in relation to control were observed in the plasma lipids, however, in the erythrocyte membrane, only phosphatidylcholine showed a significant difference compared to control, increasing around 41%. With respect to the evaluation of liver function of individuals with leptospirosis, there was a significant increase in levels of alanine transaminase (154%) and aspartate transaminase (150%), whereas albumin was 43.8% lower than control (P<0.01). The lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase fractional activity was 3.6 times lower in individuals with leptospirosis than in the healthy individuals (P<0.01). The decrease of the erythrocyte elasticity may be related to the changes of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids composition caused by disturbances that occur during human leptospirosis, with phosphatidylcholine being a strong candidate in the erythrocyte rheological changes.","['Silva JAX', 'Albertini AVP', 'Fonseca CSM', 'Silva DCN', 'Carvalho VCO', 'Lima VLM', 'Fontes A', 'Costa EVL', 'Nogueira RA']",2020,53,8,Braz J Med Biol Res,"Silva JAX, et al.

32568280,"Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of leptospirosis compared to other acute febrile illnesses.","BACKGROUND: Background Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease. Many waterborne diseases and mosquito-borne diseases are common causes of acute febrile illnesses in the southern Indian state of Kerala posing diagnostic challenges. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of leptospirosis diagnosed using the modified Faine's criteria (with amendment) compared to other common acute febrile illnesses.
METHODS: In this prospective study, all consecutive patients with acute febrile illness, headache and myalgia presenting to our tertiary care hospital's single unit from March 2013 to February 2015 were subjected to detailed history taking and thorough clinical examination. Leptospiral immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology was confirmed by RecombiLISA ELISA and modified Faine's criteria were used for diagnosis of leptospirosis. Other diagnoses for acute febrile illnesses were assigned based on clinical and laboratory investigations. Bivariate and regression analysis was carried out to analyse epidemiological, clinical and laboratory parameters of both groups.
RESULTS: A total of 389 patients were enrolled, out of which 110 patients had the presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis. Among the 279 with non-leptospirosis acute febrile illness, dengue (39%) and other viral febrile illnesses (25%) were the most common diagnoses. Regression analysis identified several epidemiological (contact with contaminated animals or water and drinking unboiled water), clinical (conjunctival congestion and muscle tenderness) and laboratory investigations (leucocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and aspartate aminotransferase) which were helpful in distinguishing leptospirosis from other acute febrile illnesses.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that certain epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features in patients with leptospirosis may allow an early diagnosis. Our study also underscores the usefulness of confirming the leptospiral serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in combination with relevant epidemiological and clinical features in diagnosing leptospirosis using the modified Faine's criteria.","['Balasundaram PK', 'Kanakamma LG', 'Jayageetha K', 'Selvarajan B']",2020,50,2,J R Coll Physicians Edinb,"Balasundaram PK, et al.

32555593,Performance of Treponema pallidum recombinant proteins in the serological diagnosis of syphilis.,"Syphilis serodiagnosis is challenging because distinct clinical forms of the infection may influence serological performance and discordant results between tests make clinical decisions difficult. Several recombinant Treponema pallidum-proteins have already been tested for syphilis diagnosis and they are critical to achieve high accuracy in serological testing. Our aim was to assess the varied from performance of T. pallidum-recombinant proteins TmpA, TpN17 and TpN47 for syphilis serodiagnosis. The proteins were evaluated using sera of 338 T. pallidum-negative, 173 T. pallidum-positive individuals and 209 sera from individuals infected with unrelated diseases. The diagnostic potential was validated by analysis of ROC curves. In the liquid microarray analyses, the ROC curve varied from 99.0% for TmpA and TpN17 to 100% for TpN47. The sensitivity score yielded values of up to 90% for TpN17, 100% for TpN47 and 80.0% for TmpA. The lowest and highest specificity values were presented by TpN47 (91.9%) and TmpA antigens (100%), respectively. TpN47 showed the highest accuracy score (95.5%) among all the recombinant proteins assayed. For the ELISA, the ROC curve was 97.2%, 91.8% and 81.6% for TpN17, TmpA and TpN47, respectively. TpN17 and TmpA yielded a sensitivity of 69.9%, while TpN47 obtained a value of 53.8%. Specificity was almost 100% for all three proteins. No cross-reaction was observed for TpN17 in the serum samples from non-bacterial infections. Regarding leptospirosis-positive samples, cross-reactivity score was varied from 8.6 to 34.6%. This is most probably due to conservation of the epitopes in these proteins across bacteria. The use of recombinant proteins in immunoassays for syphilis diagnosis was showed provide greater reliability to results of the treponemal assays. Despite the low sensitivity, the proteins showed high diagnostic capacity due to the AUC values found. However, an improvement in sensitivity could be achieved when antigenic mixtures are evaluated.","['Silva ÂAO', 'de Oliveira UD', 'Vasconcelos LCM', 'Foti L', 'Leony LM', 'Daltro RT', 'Leitolis A', 'Lima FWM', 'Krieger MA', 'Zanchin NIT', 'Santos FLN']",2020,15,6,PLoS One,"Silva ÂAO, et al.

He was initially managed as severe leptospirosis with multiorgan dysfunction with antibiotics, steroids, and N-acetyl cysteine. A diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection was made subsequently. He made an uneventful recovery.
CONCLUSION: Hantavirus infections need to considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute febrile illness with multiorgan involvement.

32532998,The zoonotic pathogen Leptospira interrogans mitigates environmental stress through cyclic-di-GMP-controlled biofilm production.,"The zoonotic bacterium Leptospira interrogans is the aetiological agent of leptospirosis, a re-emerging infectious disease that is a growing public health concern. Most human cases of leptospirosis result from environmental infection. Biofilm formation and its contribution to the persistence of virulent leptospires in the environment or in the host have scarcely been addressed. Here, we examined spatial and time-domain changes in biofilm production by L. interrogans. Our observations showed that biofilm formation in L. interrogans is a highly dynamic process and leads to a polarized architecture. We notably found that the biofilm matrix is composed of extracellular DNA, which enhances the biofilm's cohesiveness. By studying L. interrogans mutants with defective diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase genes, we show that biofilm production is regulated by intracellular levels of bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and underpins the bacterium's ability to withstand a wide variety of simulated environmental stresses. Our present results show how the c-di-GMP pathway regulates biofilm formation by L. interrogans, provide insights into the environmental persistence of L. interrogans and, more generally, highlight leptospirosis as an environment-borne threat to human health.","['Thibeaux R', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Kainiu M', 'Girault D', 'Bierque E', 'Fernandes J', 'Bähre H', 'Douyère A', 'Eskenazi N', 'Vinh J', 'Picardeau M', 'Goarant C']",2020,6,1,NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes,"Thibeaux R, et al.

The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the health sector is propitious and has been adopted by human and animal health professionals as an important tool in spatial analyses of health. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the geoprocessing and spatial analysis techniques adopted for mapping risk areas of human and animal leptospirosis. The articles were collected on scientific platforms by entering the following terms: SIG/GIS, leptospirose/leptospirosis, area de risco/risk area and distribuicao espacial/spatial distribution, and included in the study if they met the following criteria: a) publication in the period from 1998 to 2017; b) identification of risk areas and/or spatial distribution of leptospirosis as one of the research topics; and c) application of GIS in the methodology. As a result, we found 40 articles, published by 15 different countries, which adopted GIS for the spatial analysis and identification of risk areas of leptospirosis. Among these, only 45% (18) conducted an spatial statistical analysis. Brazil and USA had the highest numbers of publications, 16 and 7 articles, respectively. From 2007, the use of GIS and spatial analysis techniques, applied to the theme of this study, have been intensified and diversified, and 93% of the articles elected for this review were published from 2007 to 2017. The results point to a progressive interest of health professionals in applying these techniques for monitoring and conducting epidemiological analyses of leptospirosis, besides indicating a greater need for intersectoral integration between health professionals and others, in the use of spatial analysis and GIS techniques.","['Souza IPO', 'Uberti MS', 'Tassinari WS']",2020,62,,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"Souza IPO, et al.

Boa constrictor snakes are commonly found in Atlantic rainforest fragments in peri‑urban areas, which indicates a greater possibility of the contact of these animals with humans residing there. Therefore, the aim of this work was to detect Leptospira spp infection through molecular assays in wild B. constrictor snakes rescued in peri‑urban areas and verify seroreactivity, by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), as well as the most common serogroups. Among the 46 samples tested, 7 (15.21%) were positive according to PCR and confirmed as Leptospira interrogans through secY gene sequencing. In MAT, 37 (80.43%) of the 46 samples were classified as reactive. Panama was the serogroup with the highest occurrence. The results showed the presence of Leptospira spp DNA in asymptomatic snakes rescued in rainforest fragments located in peri‑urban areas and support further investigations on the influence of these animals in the epidemiology of leptospirosis in tropical peri‑urban areas.","['Rodamilans GM', 'Fonseca MS', 'Paz LN', 'Fernandez CC', 'Biondi I', 'Lira-da-Silva RM', 'Meyer R', 'Pinna MH', 'Portela RD']",2020,209,,Acta Trop,"Rodamilans GM, et al.

In France, Corsica is the area where the highest incidences have been reported. The present study was focused on the analysis of pathogenic Leptospira species in rodents of Corsica, as these micromammals are the main natural reservoirs of the bacteria, in order to identify the circulating species and to locate possible risk focuses of transmission, as no previous study on the presence of Leptospira species has been carried out in the island. Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, Apodemus sylvaticus and Mus musculus domesticus were captured in the proximity of water sources along Corsica, the detection of pathogenic Leptospira species was carried out by amplification of the LipL32 gene. The bacteria were found in all the rodent species analyzed and widely. The general prevalence was 10.4%, reaching the maximum value in Bastia (45%). Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira borgpetersenii were identified by phylogenetic analysis, but also two sequences which corresponded to an unnamed Leptospira species, only previously found in rodents of New Caledonia. The high incidence of human leptospirosis in Corsica could be partially explained by the wide distribution of pathogenic Leptospira species identified in this study. Also, the presence of an unknown pathogenic species of Leptospira in an area with high prevalence, may be involved in the higher incidence of Leptospirosis in this island, however, the zoonotic capacity of this species remains unknown. The results obtained are interesting for public health since all positive samples were found near water sources and one of the routes of transmission of leptospirosis is contact with contaminated water. This information could help the competent entities to take preventive measures, reducing the incidence of human leptospirosis in Corsica.","['Izquierdo-Rodríguez E', 'Fernández-Álvarez Á', 'Martín-Carrillo N', 'Marchand B', 'Feliu C', 'Miquel J', 'Foronda P', 'Quilichini Y']",2020,15,6,PLoS One,"Izquierdo-Rodríguez E, et al.

32491052,"Spatio-temporal analysis of leptospirosis in Eastern Amazon, State of Pará, Brazil.","INTRODUCTION: Brazil has registered more than 62,000 confirmed cases of leptospirosis between 2001 and 2017, with more than 2,000 cases confirmed in the State of Pará. Despite a large number of cases, no study has been conducted to trace the spatio-temporal profile of the disease.
METHODOLOGY: Confirmed cases of leptospirosis from 2001 to 2017 from the state of Pará were the basis for this space-time study. The database of the Department of Informatics of the Ministry of Health was used to access data on leptospirosis. The spatio-temporal analysis was performed in the SaTScan software for the detection of clusters, and maps were generated in the QGIS software.
RESULTS: The municipalities of Belém and Santarém were among the ones with the highest incidence rates of leptospirosis for the whole study period. Increased number of cases in Soure, Inhangapi, São João da Ponta and Magalhães Barata, Ponta de Pedras, Breves, Bragança, Castanhal, and São Domingos do Capim were identified in different time periods. Santarém and Belém are the main foci of leptospirosis because they are the most urbanized and densely populated municipalities in the State. The cases found in smaller municipalities may be associated with periods of more frequent rainfall and circulation of Leptospira sp. in marsupials and cattle, in the northeastern part of the State.
CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to help identify the risk factors that contribute to the occurrence of leptospirosis in the State of Pará, particularly in areas with lower population density.","['Cerveira RA', 'Ferreira LO', 'Oliveira EF', 'Felipe HKDS', 'Almeida MCA', 'Lima SS', 'Ribeiro KTS']",2020,23,,Rev Bras Epidemiol,"Cerveira RA, et al.

32479497,Chikungunya in Indonesia: Epidemiology and diagnostic challenges.,"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is often overlooked as an etiology of fever in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Lack of diagnostic testing capacity in these areas combined with co-circulation of clinically similar pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), hinders CHIKV diagnosis. To better address CHIKV in Indonesia, an improved understanding of epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic approaches is needed.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Acutely hospitalized febrile patients ≥1-year-old were enrolled in a multi-site observational cohort study conducted in Indonesia from 2013 to 2016. Demographic and clinical data were collected at enrollment; blood specimens were collected at enrollment, once during days 14 to 28, and three months after enrollment. Plasma samples negative for DENV by serology and/or molecular assays were screened for evidence of acute CHIKV infection (ACI) by serology and molecular assays. To address the co-infection of DENV and CHIKV, DENV cases were selected randomly to be screened for evidence of ACI. ACI was confirmed in 40/1,089 (3.7%) screened subjects, all of whom were DENV negative. All 40 cases initially received other diagnoses, most commonly dengue fever, typhoid fever, and leptospirosis. ACI was found at five of the seven study cities, though evidence of prior CHIKV exposure was observed in 25.2% to 45.9% of subjects across sites. All subjects were assessed during hospitalization as mildly or moderately ill, consistent with the Asian genotype of CHIKV. Subjects with ACI had clinical presentations that overlapped with other common syndromes, atypical manifestations of disease, or persistent or false-positive IgM against Salmonella Typhi. Two of the 40 cases were possibly secondary ACI.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CHIKV remains an underdiagnosed acute febrile illness in Indonesia. Public health measures should support development of CHIKV diagnostic capacity. Improved access to point-of-care diagnostic tests and clinical training on presentations of ACI will facilitate appropriate case management such as avoiding unneccessary treatments or antibiotics, early response to control mosquito population and eventually reducing disease transmission.","['Arif M', 'Tauran P', 'Kosasih H', 'Pelupessy NM', 'Sennang N', 'Mubin RH', 'Sudarmono P', 'Tjitra E', 'Murniati D', 'Alam A', 'Gasem MH', 'Aman AT', 'Lokida D', 'Hadi U', 'Parwati KTM', 'Lau CY', 'Neal A', 'Karyana M']",2020,14,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Arif M, et al.

Hence, we have developed a simple and cheap paper fluidic device to detect multiple gene targets in Leptospira. Fluidic channels of the penta-clover device are drawn using a correction pen on Whatman filter paper 1. The fluid blocks the pores of the paper, avoiding leakage and ensuring the equal flow of sample to the reaction pads. The target genes are amplified by performing Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) with dry reaction components. Thecolor change of leuco crystal violetallows real-time monitoring of a positive amplification.

32463609,Prevalence of leptospirosis in vaccinated working dogs and humans with occupational risk.,"Introduction: Working dogs have been identified as a risk group for developing leptospirosis because they can be infected by Leptospira spp., which can be kept in the renal tubules and interstices for a long time, making them carriers and sources of infection for other hosts, including humans. Objective: To establish the prevalence of Leptospira spp. in vaccinated working dogs and in the occupationally exposed population in six police units in Colombia. Materials and methods: A total of 92 vaccinated dogs (65 males and 27 females) and 69 people from six police units in the municipalities of Manizales, Pereira, Armenia, Ibagué, Tuluá, and Cali were tested. Three structured instruments were applied and blood samples were obtained from people and dogs, which were processed with the microagglutination test (MAT) in 24 serogroups. A clinical examination of the dogs was performed and urine samples were obtained for urine cultures. Results: The seroprevalence of human leptospirosis was 2.9% (n=2) and in dogs, it was 57.61% (n=53). Among the dogs, serogroups L. canicola and L. panama were the most prevalent. Urine cultures were positive in 58.7% (54/92) of the samples. A statistically significant association was found between the age of the dogs (≥10 years; p=0.043) and the location of the police unit (p=0.016) with the urine culture. Conclusion: The epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in dogs suggest an endemic presentation of the infection. There is an urgent need to improve current diagnostic methods to investigate canine leptospirosis and differentiate between vaccine and natural infection antibodies.","['Murcia CA', 'Astudillo M', 'Romero MH']",2020,40,Supl. 1,Biomedica,"Murcia CA, et al.

32448167,Underdiagnoses of Rickettsia in patients hospitalized with acute fever in Indonesia: observational study results.,"BACKGROUND: Reports of human rickettsial infection in Indonesia are limited. This study sought to characterize the epidemiology of human rickettsioses amongst patients hospitalized with fever at 8 tertiary hospitals in Indonesia.
METHODS: Acute and convalescent blood from 975 hospitalized non-dengue patients was tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by ELISA. Specimens from cases with seroconversion or increasing IgM and/or IgG titers were tested for Rickettsia IgM and IgG by IFA and Rickettsia genomes using primers for Rickettsia (R.) sp, R. typhi, and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Testing was performed retrospectively on stored specimens; results did not inform patient management.
RESULTS: R. typhi, R. rickettsii, and O. tsutsugamushi IgG antibodies were identified in 269/872 (30.8%), 36/634 (5.7%), and 19/504 (3.8%) of samples, respectively. For the 103/975 (10.6%) non-dengue patients diagnosed with acute rickettsial infection, presenting symptoms included nausea (72%), headache (69%), vomiting (43%), lethargy (33%), anorexia (32%), arthralgia (30%), myalgia (28%), chills (28%), epigastric pain (28%), and rash (17%). No acute rickettsioses cases were suspected during hospitalization. Discharge diagnoses included typhoid fever (44), dengue fever (20), respiratory infections (7), leptospirosis (6), unknown fever (6), sepsis (5), hepatobiliary infections (3), UTI (3), and others (9). Fatalities occurred in 7 (6.8%) patients, mostly with co-morbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Rickettsial infections are consistently misdiagnosed, often as leptospirosis, dengue, or Salmonella typhi infection. Clinicians should include rickettsioses in their differential diagnosis of fever to guide empiric management; laboratories should support evaluation for rickettsial etiologies; and public policy should be implemented to reduce burden of disease.","['Lokida D', 'Hadi U', 'Lau CY', 'Kosasih H', 'Liang CJ', 'Rusli M', 'Sudarmono P', 'Lukman N', 'Laras K', 'Asdie RH', 'Murniati D', 'Utama IMS', 'Mubin RH', 'Karyana M', 'Gasem MH', 'Alisjahbana B']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Lokida D, et al.

32428003,"Seroprevalence of leptospirosis in an endemic mixed urban and semi-urban setting-A community-based study in the district of Colombo, Sri Lanka.","Leptospirosis is endemic in Sri Lanka. There is a need for updated seroprevalence studies in endemic areas, to improve the understanding of disease dynamics, risk factors, control methods, and for clinical diagnosis. The cut-off titres for the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for diagnosis of acute leptospirosis depend on community seroprevalence, and can vary based on locality and serovar. This study aimed to identify the seroprevalence, geographical determinants, and associations of seropositivity of leptospirosis in the district of Colombo in Sri Lanka, and to determine diagnostic cut-off titres for MAT in the community studied. This study utilized a stratified cluster sampling model in the Colombo district of Sri Lanka, to sample individuals living in urban and semi-urban areas. Serovar specific MAT titres were measured on recruited individuals using a panel of saprophytic (Leptospira biflexa) and 11 pathogenic Leptospira spp. serovars. Associations between environmental risk factors and MAT positivity were examined, with location mapping using GIS software. A total of 810 individuals were included. The mean age was 51.71 years (SD 14.02) with male predominance (60%). A total of 429 (53%) tested positive at a titer of 1/40 or more for the saprophytic Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc. Pathogenic serovar MAT was positive at a titer of 1/40 or more for at least one serovar in 269 (33.2%) individuals. From the perspective of screening for clinical disease, serovar-specific cut-off titres of 1/80 for Leptospira spp. serovars Hebdomadis, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, Ratnapura and Patoc, 1/160 for serovars Pyrogenes and Cynopteri, and 1/40 for other serovars were determined, based on the 75th quartile MAT titre for each serovar. Serovar Pyrogenes (15.9%) had the highest seroprevalence, with serovars Ratnapura, Bankinang and Australis accounting for 9.9%, 9.6% and 9.3% respectively. When the proposed new cut-offs were applied, Bankinang(9.6%) Australis(9.3%), Pyrogenes(6.9%) and Ratnapura(6.9%) were the most prevalent serovars. No significant differences in seroprevalence or serovar patterns were noted between urban and semi-urban settings. Individuals seropositive for Australis, Ratnapura and Icterohaemorrhagiae were clustered around main water bodies as well as around smaller tributaries and paddy fields. Those positive for the serovar Pyrogenes were clustered around inland tributaries, smaller water sources and paddy fields. Associations of MAT positivity included high risk occupational exposure, environmental exposure including exposure to floods, bathing in rivers and lakes, using well-water for bathing, contact with stagnant water, propensity to skin injuries, presence of rats in the vicinity, and proximity to water sources. For pathogenic serovars, high-risk occupational exposure remained statistically significant following adjustment for other factors (adjusted OR = 2.408, CI 1.711 to 3.388; p<0.0001; Nagelkerke R2 = 0.546). High risk occupational exposure was determined to be independently associated with seropositivity. Baseline community MAT titres vary according to serovar, and presumably the locality. Testing against saprophytic serovars is unreliable. Thus, diagnostic MAT titre cut-offs should be determined based on region and serovar, and the use of a single diagnostic MAT cut-off for all populations is likely to result in false negatives.","['Rajapakse S', 'Weeratunga PN', 'Balaji K', 'Ramchandani KC', 'de Silva US', 'Ranasinghe SA', 'Gunarathne D', 'Wijerathne PPB', 'Fernando N', 'Handunnetti SM', 'Fernando SD']",2020,14,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Rajapakse S, et al.

32422911,The Predictive Factors for Severe Leptospirosis Cases in Kedah.,"Over the past decade, increased awareness about leptospirosis disease in developing and industrialized countries has resulted in increased numbers of leptospirosis cases being reported worldwide. About 5% to 15% of leptospirosis patients end up with severe forms of the disease. Complication due to leptospirosis requires monitoring, specific treatments, and intensive care admission, thus increasing the cost of treating severe leptospirosis cases. Currently, we have data on incident and mortality rates, but we do not have data on the number of patients with severe form of leptospirosis or how many patients have complications, and whether or not these complications were resolved. Therefore, we carried out this study to determine the predictive factors for severe leptospirosis cases in Kedah. We conducted a cross-sectional study. The data of patients diagnosed with leptospirosis were obtained from the surveillance unit, Kedah Health Department, through the e-notification system. These data were then sorted according to the hospitals where the patients were admitted. The patients' medical records were collected, and their information was obtained using a checklist. A total of 456 confirmed leptospirosis cases were included in the study, with 199 patients classified as severe cases and 257 patients as mild cases, based on the Malaysian leptospirosis guidelines. Most patients were male (71.5%) with a mean SD age of 36.62 ± 20.75 years. The predictive factors for severe leptospirosis include abnormal lung sounds (OR: 3.07 [CI 1.58-6.00]), hepatomegaly (OR: 7.14 [1.10-45.98]), hypotension (OR: 2.16 [1.08-4.34]), leukocytosis (OR: 2.12 [1.37-3.29]), low hematocrit (OR: 2.33 [1.43-3.81]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (SGPT ALT) (OR: 2.12 [1.36-3.30]). In conclusion, knowing these predictive factors will help clinicians identify severe leptospirosis cases earlier and develop their treatment plans accordingly, to reduce the complications and death from severe leptospirosis.","['Sandhu RS', 'Ismail HB', ""Ja'afar MHB"", 'Rampal S']",2020,5,2,Trop Med Infect Dis,"Sandhu RS, et al.

32418554,On-farm risk factors associated with Leptospira shedding in New Zealand dairy cattle.,"This study aimed to evaluate risk factors associated with shedding of pathogenic Leptospira species in urine at animal and herd levels. In total, 200 dairy farms were randomly selected from the DairyNZ database. Urine samples were taken from 20 lactating, clinically normal cows in each herd between January and April 2016 and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using gyrB as the target gene. Overall, 26.5% of 200 farms had at least one PCR positive cow and 2.4% of 4000 cows were shedding Leptospira in the urine. Using a questionnaire, information about risk factors at cow and farm level was collected via face-to-face interviews with farm owners and managers. Animals on all but one farm had been vaccinated against Hardjo and Pomona and cows on 54 of 200 (27%) farms had also been vaccinated against Copenhageni in at least one age group (calves, heifers and cows). Associations found to be statistically significant in univariate analysis (at P < 0.2) were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. Factors associated with shedding included cattle age (Odds ratio (OR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95), keeping sheep (OR 5.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-21.25) or dogs (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.97) and managing milking cows in a single as opposed to multiple groups (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-0.99). We conclude that younger cattle were more likely to be shedding Leptospira than older cattle and that the presence of sheep and dogs was associated with an increased risk of shedding in cows. Larger herds were at higher risk of having Leptospira shedders. However, none of the environmental risk factors that were assessed (e.g. access to standing water, drinking-water source), or wildlife abundance on-farm, or pasture were associated with shedding, possibly due to low statistical power, given the low overall shedding rate.","['Yupiana Y', 'Vallée E', 'Wilson P', 'Weston JF', 'Benschop J', 'Collins-Emerson J', 'Heuer C']",2020,148,,Epidemiol Infect,"Yupiana Y, et al.

32374085,Estimating acute human leptospirosis incidence in northern Tanzania using sentinel site and community behavioural surveillance.,"Many infectious diseases lack robust estimates of incidence from endemic areas, and extrapolating incidence when there are few locations with data remains a major challenge in burden of disease estimation. We sought to combine sentinel surveillance with community behavioural surveillance to estimate leptospirosis incidence. We administered a questionnaire gathering responses on established locally relevant leptospirosis risk factors and recent fever to livestock-owning community members across six districts in northern Tanzania and applied a logistic regression model predicting leptospirosis risk on the basis of behavioural factors that had been previously developed among patients with fever in Moshi Municipal and Moshi Rural Districts. We aggregated probability of leptospirosis by district and estimated incidence in each district by standardizing probabilities to those previously estimated for Moshi Districts. We recruited 286 community participants: Hai District (n = 11), Longido District (59), Monduli District (56), Moshi Municipal District (103), Moshi Rural District (44) and Rombo District (13). The mean predicted probability of leptospirosis by district was Hai 0.029 (0.005, 0.095), Longido 0.071 (0.009, 0.235), Monduli 0.055 (0.009, 0.206), Moshi Rural 0.014 (0.002, 0.049), Moshi Municipal 0.015 (0.004, 0.048) and Rombo 0.031 (0.006, 0.121). We estimated the annual incidence (upper and lower bounds of estimate) per 100,000 people of human leptospirosis among livestock owners by district as Hai 35 (6, 114), Longido 85 (11, 282), Monduli 66 (11, 247), Moshi Rural 17 (2, 59), Moshi Municipal 18 (5, 58) and Rombo 47 (7, 145).

32352624,Leptospiral antibody prevalence and surgical treatment outcome in horses with Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) in Switzerland.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate leptospiral antibody prevalence in 65 horses with ERU and compare outcome in 36 surgically treated eyes (2010-2015).
PROCEDURES: Retrospective data analysis of horses with ERU (n = 65). C-value calculation with microagglutination assay titer (MAT) results for Leptospira spp. Evaluation of follow-up data after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV, n = 21 eyes) and suprachoroidal cyclosporine device implantation (SCDI, n = 15 eyes). Differences between groups were statistically analyzed using Fishers exact test, significance set at P < .05.
RESULTS: Positive leptospiral titers were found in 28/65 blood, 31/65 aqueous humor (AH), and 19/20 vitreal (post-PPV) samples. The most common intraocular serovars were Leptospira interrogans grippotyphosa, pomona, and bratislava. Intraocular antibody production was suspected in samples of 22 horses (c-values > 1). Mean follow-up of surgical cases was 3.8 years (PPV) and 3.4 years (SCDI). PPV was performed in 21 eyes with positive, SCDI in 15 eyes with negative leptospiral test results. Uveitis recurred less often after PPV (2/21) compared to SCDI (6/15, P = .04). Retinal detachment occurred after PPV only (5/21, SCDI 0/15, P = .06), whereas only SCDI-treated eyes were enucleated (PPV 0/21, SCDI 3/15, P = .06). Blindness or visual impairment was equally likely to occur in both treatment groups after surgery (PPV 7/21, SCDI 7/15, P = .5).
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospiral antibody prevalence is high in horses with ERU in Switzerland. Recurrence of uveitis is uncommon following PPV in the present study; an increased risk of retinal detachment exists. Enucleation is more often warranted in horses after SCDI in this study due to a higher uveitis recurrence.","['Voelter K', 'Vial Z', 'Pot SA', 'Spiess BM']",2020,23,4,Vet Ophthalmol,"Voelter K, et al.

32351698,Leptospirosis as an important differential of pulmonary haemorrhage on the intensive care unit: a case managed with VV-ECMO.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal zoonosis. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including diffuse alveolar haemorrhage which occurs in a minority of cases but carries a mortality of over 70%. These patients may present with severe acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is broad whereas prompt diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old previously fit and well trout farm worker presented with a 3-day history of malaise, fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting and jaundice. He developed haemoptysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness and photophobia on the day of emergency admission. He was anaemic and thrombocytopenic. Anuric acute kidney injury (urea 32, creat 507) required immediate haemofiltration. In view of progressive respiratory failure with four-quadrant lung infiltrates on imaging, he was given broad spectrum antibiotics and pulsed methylprednisolone empirically, in case of a vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation. He was intubated within 48 h of admission. Despite attempted protective ventilatory management, he remained hypoxaemic and developed pneumomediastinum. He was retrieved to a specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit on femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO. Three days from admission, results showed positive 
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis is a rare but important differential to be considered in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presenting to the ICU, especially in young males. A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors may offer the diagnostic clue. Most patients recover fully with antibiotics. However, resulting acute severe respiratory failure can ensue. In this situation, early consideration for respiratory ECMO support offers time for clearance of endobronchial clot, parenchymal recovery, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Steroids have no clear evidence but may be used to avoid delay in treating suspected vasculitic or autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.","['Barnacle J', 'Gurney S', 'Ledot S', 'Singh S']",2020,8,,J Intensive Care,"Barnacle J, et al.

32330452,Use of serological and molecular techniques for detection of Leptospira sp. carrier sheep under semiarid conditions and the importance of genital transmission route.,"It is possible that there are peculiarities in the epidemiology of leptospirosis in regions with a semiarid climate, where the environment is often adverse, allowing the occurrence of alternative transmission routes. The objective of the work was to generate contributions to the diagnosis and epidemiology of Leptospira sp. infection in sheep reared in semiarid conditions, using serological, molecular and microbiological techniques for diagnosis in dry and rainy seasons. Samples of blood, vaginal fluid, urine, bladder, kidney, uterus, uterine tube, ovary and placenta were collected from 104 sheep (52 animals per season - dry and rainy) slaughtered in the Brazilian semiarid. Diagnostic tests performed were microscopic agglutination test (MAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bacterial isolation. Anti-Leptospira sp. antibodies were found in 26 (25%) of the animals analyzed by MAT at 1:50 dilution (cut-off 50), while 69 (66.3%) animals had at least one organ/fluid with the presence of Leptospira sp. DNA. Overall, PCR was performed on 758 fragments of organs/fluids from the genital and urinary tracts, and 519 (68.5%) samples tested positive. PCR-positivity was statistically different in dry (46.2%) and rainy (11.5%) seasons for vaginal fluid. It was possible to perform the DNA sequencing in nine samples with 99% similarity to L. interrogans and recovery of viable strains in three samples of vaginal fluid. Regardless of the biological material used in PCR to detect carrier animals and the season, the highest MAT sensitivity values were obtained with cut-off 50 compared to 100. The results obtained indicate that, even in the adverse environmental conditions of the semiarid region, leptospires may survive and propagate by alternative routes of transmission, such as sexual, and the presence of PCR-positive genital tracts in ewes suggests that sexual transmission may play an important role in the epidemiology of the disease in sheep in Brazilian semiarid. In addition, it is suggested the use of titer 50 as cut-off point at serology in semiarid conditions.","['Nogueira DB', 'da Costa FTR', 'Bezerra CS', 'Silva MLCR', 'da Costa DF', 'Viana MP', 'da Silva JD', 'Júnior JPA', 'Malossi CD', 'Ullmann LS', 'Santos CSAB', 'Alves CJ', 'de Azevedo SS']",2020,207,,Acta Trop,"Nogueira DB, et al.

32330132,"Seroprevalence of leptospiral antibodies in rodents from riverside communities of Santa Fe, Argentina.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted by contact with the urine of infected mammals. Rodents play a mayor role in the transmission of leptospires to humans. The province of Santa Fe reports the greatest number of cases in Argentina. Yet, in this region, there are still knowledge gaps regarding the diversity of rodent species that may be hosts of pathogenic leptospires. The aims of this study were to evaluate the presence of leptospiral antibodies in rodents from three riverside communities of Santa Fe, and to identify factors associated with leptospiral infection.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Each community was divided into three environmental settings based on the level of human disturbance, and sampled during two springs (Sep-Oct 2014 and 2015) and one autumn (Mar-Apr 2015). Serum samples of captured sigmodontine and murine rodents were tested for leptospiral antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and microagglutination test (MAT) was used to assess the infecting serovar in seropositive individuals. Factors influencing seropositivity were analyzed using logistic regression models. We caught 119 rodents, of which 101 serums were suitable for analysis. Most frequently trapped species were Scapteromys aquaticus, Akodon azarae and Oligoryzomys spp., with seroprevalences of 41.3%, 42.9% and 55% respectively. Seropositivity was higher in individuals with an average body condition score and in those that were sexually mature, but in the latter the differences were marginally significant.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that native rodents may be playing a role in the environmental circulation of pathogenic leptospires and provide relevant information for public health policies in the area.","['Ricardo T', 'Jacob P', 'Chiani Y', 'Schmeling MF', 'Cornejo P', 'Ojeda AA', 'Teta PV', 'Vanasco NB', 'Previtali MA']",2020,14,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Ricardo T, et al.

32321154,DNA nanovaccines prepared using LemA antigen protect Golden Syrian hamsters against Leptospira lethal infection.,"BACKGROUND: Nanoparticles (NPs) are viable candidates as carriers of exogenous materials into cells via transfection and can be used in the DNA vaccination strategy against leptospirosis.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficiency of halloysite clay nanotubes (HNTs) and amine-functionalised multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NH2-MWCNTs) in facilitating recombinant LemA antigen (rLemA) expression and protecting Golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) against Leptospira interrogans lethal infection.
METHODS: An indirect immunofluorescent technique was used to investigate the potency of HNTs and NH2-MWCNTs in enhancing the transfection and expression efficiency of the DNA vaccine in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Hamsters were immunised with two doses of vaccines HNT-pTARGET/lemA, NH2-MWCNTs-pTARGET/lemA, pTARGET/lemA, and empty pTARGET (control), and the efficacy was determined in terms of humoral immune response and protection against a lethal challenge.
FINDINGS: rLemA DNA vaccines carried by NPs were able to transfect CHO cells effectively, inducing IgG immune response in hamsters (p < 0.05), and did not exhibit cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, 83.3% of the hamsters immunised with NH2-MWCNTs-pTARGET/lemA were protected against the lethal challenge (p < 0.01), and 66.7% of hamsters immunised with HNT-pTARGET/lemA survived (p < 0.05).

Over time and after a successful reintroduction project, otters are now abundant and occur throughout North Carolina. However, there is a concern that diseases may have an impact on the otter population, as well as on other aquatic mammals, either through exposure to emerging diseases, contact with domestic animals such as domestic cats (Felis catus), or less robust condition of individuals through declines in water quality. We tested brain and kidney tissue from harvested otters for the pathogens that cause leptospirosis, parvovirus, and toxoplasmosis. Leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis are priority zoonoses and are maintained by domestic and wild mammals. Although parvovirus is not zoonotic, it does affect pets, causing mild to fatal symptoms. Across the 2014-15 and 2015-16 trapping seasons, we tested 220 otters (76 females, 144 males) using real-time PCR for Leptospira interrogans, parvovirus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Of the otters tested, 1% (3/220) were positive for L. interrogans, 19% (41/220) were positive for parvovirus, and 24% (53/220) were positive for T. gondii. Although the pathogens for parvovirus and toxoplasmosis are relatively common in North Carolina otters, the otter harvest has remained steady and the population appears to be abundant and self-sustaining. Therefore, parvovirus and toxoplasmosis do not currently appear to be negatively impacting the population. However, subsequent research should examine transmission parameters between domestic and wild species and the sublethal effects of infection.","['Sanders CW', 'Olfenbuttel C', 'Pacifici K', 'Hess GR', 'Livingston RS', 'DePerno CS']",2020,56,4,J Wildl Dis,"Sanders CW, et al.

For this, we collected 1,405 serum samples from buffaloes raised in the Amazon delta region, which is considered a major area of buffalo production in Brazil. The test used was a microscopic agglutination test (MAT) adopting 34 Leptospira antigens, some of which have never been tested for buffaloes in Brazil, including autochthonous strains; in total, 20 serogroups were evaluated. From the total of 1,405 serum samples, 894 (63.6%) reacted in the MAT to at least one of the 20 serogroups, and 511 (36.4%) did not react. The serogroups Sejroe, Autumnalis and Pomona were the most prevalent, with titres ranging from 100 to 12,800, and the autochthonous strains used were not significant in relation to the reference serovars. Leptospirosis in buffaloes seems to have a serological profile similar to leptospirosis in cattle, mainly due to the prevalence of the Sejroe serogroup; however, the results of this study suggested that in the Brazilian Amazon, Leptospira strains that are serologically distinct from the autochthonous strains isolated in the southeastern region of Brazil may be circulating in these animals. Other serovars could also be inserted into the panel of antigens used in MAT for serological studies on buffaloes.","['Guedes IB', 'de Souza GO', 'de Oliveira LAR', 'Castro JFP', 'de Souza Filho AF', 'Maia ALP', 'Heinemann MB']",2020,6,3,Vet Med Sci,"Guedes IB, et al.

In French Guiana, a French overseas department of South America, this bacterial infection is endemic with the increase of human cases since the last 5 years. Nevertheless, the epidemiological data on the circulating infecting strain remains scarce due to the lack of specific symptoms and the used diagnostic approaches. We report a severe case of leptospirosis in a 52-years-old male, working as a street cleaner, hospitalized at the Intensive Care Unit of city capital hospital of French Guiana because of hemodynamic, neurological, renal, and respiratory failure. At ICU admission, the patient was comatose, his temperature was 37.3°C, heart rate 104 beats per minute, blood pressure 84/45mmHg, and oxygen saturation 95% while under mechanical ventilation. Retrospective exploration using molecular and serological approaches from the samples allowed reporting an infection by Leptospira santarosai serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo. To our knowledge, this is the first human case infected with this species in French Guiana.

32298905,"Spatial distribution of leptospirosis incidence in the Upper Yangtze and Pearl River Basin, China: Tools to support intervention and elimination.","BACKGROUND: Since 2011 human leptospirosis incidence in China has remained steadily low with persistent pockets of notifications reported in communities within the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) and Pearl River Basin (PRB). To help guide health authorities within these residual areas to identify communities where interventions should be targeted, this study quantified the local effect of socioeconomic and environmental factors on the spatial distribution of leptospirosis incidence and developed predictive maps of leptospirosis incidence for UYRB and PRB.
METHODS: Data on all human leptospirosis cases reported during 2005-2016 across the UYRB and PRB regions were geolocated at the county-level and included in the analysis. Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) models with zero-inflated Poisson link for leptospirosis incidence were developed after adjustment of environmental and socioeconomic factors such as precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), land surface temperature (LST), elevation, slope, land cover, crop production, livestock density, gross domestic product and population density.
RESULTS: The relationship of environmental and socioeconomic variables with human leptospirosis incidence varied between both regions. While across UYRB incidence of human leptospirosis was associated with MNDWI and elevation, in PRB human leptospirosis incidence was significantly associated with NDVI, livestock density and land cover. Precipitation was significantly and positively associated with the spatial variation of incidence of leptospirosis in both regions. After accounting for the effect of environmental and socioeconomic factors, the predicted distribution of residual high-incidence county is potentially more widespread both in the UYRB and PRB compared to the observed distribution. In the UYRB, the highest predicted incidence was found along the border of Chongqing and Guizhou towards Sichuan basin and northwest Yunnan. The highest predicted incidence was also identified in counties in the central and lower reaches of the PRB.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant geographical heterogeneity in leptospirosis incidence within UYRB and PRB, providing an evidence base for prioritising targeted interventions in counties identified with the highest predicted incidence. Furthermore, environmental drivers of leptospirosis incidence were highly specific to each of the regions, emphasizing the importance of localized control measures. The findings also suggested the need to expand interventional coverage and to support surveillance and diagnostic capacity on the predicted high-risk areas.","['Dhewantara PW', 'Zhang W', 'Al Mamun A', 'Yin WW', 'Ding F', 'Guo D', 'Hu W', 'Soares Magalhães RJ']",2020,725,,Sci Total Environ,"Dhewantara PW, et al.

Nosocomial spread is described secondary to body fluid contact.
METHODS: Patients meeting the case definition for viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) from August to November 2019 were tested for CCHF after ruling out dengue, malaria, scrub typhus and leptospirosis in a tertiary teaching hospital in western Rajasthan, India. Diagnosis was confirmed using both quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for all patients. All hospital contacts were line listed and tested and symptomatic high-risk contacts received ribavirin post-exposure prophylaxis. Cohorting, personal protective equipment use and hand washing were employed to prevent nosocomial spread.
RESULTS: Four patients tested positive for CCHF. We encountered uncommon initial presentations involving motor weakness and supraventricular tachycardia. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase were useful in clinical diagnosis. Only one patient survived despite ribavirin therapy. There was zero nosocomial transmission. A partial segment of nucleocapsid of amplified CCHF virus was 99.62% identical to the Afghanistan and Oman strains.

32286565,Incidence of human dog-mediated zoonoses and demographic characteristics/vaccination coverage of the domestic dog population in Algeria.,"Control of zoonotic diseases requires a One Health integrated action from both human and animal health sectors. The aims of the present study were to estimate the incidence of dog-mediated zoonoses in humans and to describe demographic characteristics and vaccination coverage of the domestic dog population in Algeria. The results show that rabies, leishmaniosis and echinococcosis are the major zoonoses in Algeria, with an average of 20.6 (deaths), 8,276 and 455 human cases per year, respectively. A door-to-door survey was conducted among 652 households with at least one dog, of which 334 (51.33%) were located in urban areas and 318 (48.77%) in rural areas. The mean number of dogs per household in rural areas (2.02) is higher than that in urban areas (1.41). Furthermore, a high percentage of semi-confined and free-roaming and a low proportion of vaccinated dogs were recorded in rural areas. Vaccination coverage for rabies, canine distemper virus, Rubarth hepatitis, leptospirosis and parvovirus was lowest in rural dog populations. The analysis of risk factors established that semi-confined or free-roaming dogs, non-pedigree breeds, hunting dogs, herding dogs and the presence of more than three dogs per household are risk factors for dogs not being vaccinated.","['Kardjadj M', 'Yahiaoui F', 'Ben-Mahdi MH']",2019,38,3,Rev Sci Tech,"Kardjadj M, et al.

32274497,M16-Type Metallopeptidases Are Involved in Virulence for Invasiveness and Diffusion of Leptospira interrogans and Transmission of Leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic infectious disease caused by Leptospira interrogans. The pathogen rapidly invades into hosts and diffuses from bloodstream into internal organs and excretes from urine to cause transmission of leptospirosis. However, the mechanism of leptospiral invasiveness remains poorly understood.
METHODS: Proteolytic activity of M16-type metallopeptidases (Lep-MP1/2/3) of L. interrogans was determined by spectrophotometry. Expression and secretion of Lep-MP1/2/3 during infection of cells were detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot assay, and confocal microscopy. Deletion and complementation mutants of the genes encoding Lep-MP1/2/3 were generated to determine the roles of Lep-MP1/2/3 in invasiveness using transwell assay and virulence in hamsters.
RESULTS: Leptospira interrogans but not saprophytic Leptospira biflexa strains were detectable for Lep-MP-1/2/3-encoding genes. rLep-MP1/2/3 hydrolyzed extracellular matrix proteins, but rLep-MP1/3 displayed stronger proteolysis than rLep-MP2, with 123.179/340.136 μmol/L Km and 0.154/0.159 s-1 Kcat values. Expression, secretion and translocation of Lep-MP1/2/3 during infection of cells were increased. ΔMP1/3 but not ΔMP2 mutant presented attenuated transmigration through cell monolayers, decreased leptospiral loading in the blood, lungs, liver, kidneys, and urine, and 10/13-fold decreased 50% lethal dose and milder histopathologic injury in hamsters.
CONCLUSIONS: Lep-MP1 and 3 are involved in virulence of L. interrogans in invasion into hosts and diffusion in vivo, and transmission of leptospirosis.","['Ge YM', 'Sun AH', 'Ojcius DM', 'Li SJ', 'Hu WL', 'Lin X', 'Yan J']",2020,222,6,J Infect Dis,"Ge YM, et al.

32272157,Research status and perspectives for pathogenic spirochete vaccines.,"Leptospira interrogans, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Treponema pallidum are important pathogenic spirochetes. The incidence of human diseases caused by pathogenic spirochetes, e.g., leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and syphilis, has been recently increased, posing a threat to public health. Mechanisms of spirochete pathogenicity are not yet fully understood, and no safe and effective vaccine to prevent and control the infection by pathogenic spirochetes is currently available. In this article, we review the progress of research into the pathogenic spirochete vaccine, mainly in terms of vaccine types. The development of relevant vaccines against pathogenic spirochetes has generally proceeded via several stages, such as the whole-cell inactivated vaccine, live attenuated vaccine, and gene-engineered vaccine, and will likely enter a new stage with the application of gene editing technology. In this review, we mainly summarized the types of pathogenic spirochete vaccines and conducted a preliminary analysis on the protective effect of immunity, and proposed a further prospect for the development of pathogenic spirochete vaccines.","['Duan J', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang X', 'Jiang H', 'Xie B', 'Zhao T', 'Zhao F']",2020,507,,Clin Chim Acta,"Duan J, et al.

32260454,Spirochete Flagella and Motility.,"Spirochetes can be distinguished from other flagellated bacteria by their long, thin, spiral (or wavy) cell bodies and endoflagella that reside within the periplasmic space, designated as periplasmic flagella (PFs). Some members of the spirochetes are pathogenic, including the causative agents of syphilis, Lyme disease, swine dysentery, and leptospirosis. Furthermore, their unique morphologies have attracted attention of structural biologists; however, the underlying physics of viscoelasticity-dependent spirochetal motility is a longstanding mystery. Elucidating the molecular basis of spirochetal invasion and interaction with hosts, resulting in the appearance of symptoms or the generation of asymptomatic reservoirs, will lead to a deeper understanding of host-pathogen relationships and the development of antimicrobials. Moreover, the mechanism of propulsion in fluids or on surfaces by the rotation of PFs within the narrow periplasmic space could be a designing base for an autonomously driving micro-robot with high efficiency. This review describes diverse morphology and motility observed among the spirochetes and further summarizes the current knowledge on their mechanisms and relations to pathogenicity, mainly from the standpoint of experimental biophysics.",['Nakamura S'],2020,10,4,Biomolecules,Nakamura S.

While hepatic injury during pregnancy mostly has minimal adverse influence on maternal and fetal outcomes, severe maternal and fetal morbidities, and even death, sometimes occur. Here, we review the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of hepatitis during pregnancy caused by the less common pathogens, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses (HSVs), dengue fever, malaria, leptospirosis, Q fever, typhoid fever, and other occasional infections, as well as the implications on breastfeeding of the infants. Hepatitis during pregnancy with fever and systemic clinical presentations, which are not attributable to the common infectious agents, should raise the suspicion of infection with above-mentioned pathogens, and appropriate laboratory tests are required. Early recognition of severe hepatitis or acute liver failure is critical in initiating appropriate and specific therapy, together with systemic supportive care, to reduce maternal and fetal mortality and long-term sequelae.","['Zhao H', 'Dai Y', 'Zhou YH']",2020,68,,Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol,"Zhao H, et al.

32218590,New strategies for Leptospira vaccine development based on LPS removal.,"Pathogenic spirochetes from genus Leptospira are etiologic agents of leptospirosis. Cellular vaccines against Leptospira infection often elicit mainly response against the LPS antigen of the serovars present in the formulation. There is no suitable protein candidate capable of replacing whole-cell vaccines, thus requiring new approaches on vaccine development to improve leptospirosis prevention. Our goal was to develop a whole-cell vaccine sorovar-independent based on LPS removal and conservation of protein antigens exposure, to evaluate the protective capacity of monovalent or bivalent vaccines against homologous and heterologous virulent Leptospira in hamster. Leptospire were subjected to heat inactivation, or to LPS extraction with butanol and in some cases further inactivation with formaldehyde. Hamsters were immunized and challenged with homologous or heterologous virulent serovars, blood and organs were collected from the survivors for bacterial quantification, chemokine evaluation, and analysis of sera antibody reactivity and cross-reactivity by Western blot. Immunization with either heated or low LPS vaccines with serovar Copenhageni or Canicola resulted in 100% protection of the animals challenged with homologous virulent bacteria. Notably, different from the whole-cell vaccine, the low LPS vaccines produced with serovar Canicola provided only partial protection in heterologous challenge with the virulent Copenhageni serovar. Immunization with bivalent formulation results in 100% protection of immunized animals challenged with virulent serovar Canicola. All vaccines produced were able to eliminate bacteria from the kidney of challenged animals. All the vaccines raised antibodies capable to recognize antigens of serovars not present in the vaccine formulation. Transcripts of IFNγ, CXCL16, CCL5, CXCL10, CXCR6, and CCR5, increased in all immunized animals. Conclusion: Our results showed that bivalent vaccines with reduced LPS may be an interesting strategy for protection against heterologous virulent serovars. Besides the desirable multivalent protection, the low LPS vaccines are specially promising due to the expected lower reatogenicity.","['Lauretti-Ferreira F', 'Silva PLD', 'Alcântara NM', 'Silva BF', 'Grabher I', 'Souza GO', 'Nakajima E', 'Akamatsu MA', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Abreu PAE', 'Carvalho E', 'Martins EAL', 'Ho PL', 'da Silva JB']",2020,15,3,PLoS One,"Lauretti-Ferreira F, et al.

32204939,Bovine immune response to leptospira antigen in different novel adjuvants and vaccine delivery platforms.,"Leptospirosis is a global zoonosis causing significant economic losses for cattle production. Current cattle vaccines against leptospirosis need improvement to provide efficacy against multiple serovars, reduce shedding in urine, and to induce earlier and more robust immune responses. In this study, Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strain 203 antigen was combined with novel adjuvants (a biodegradable polyanhydride compressed rod implant (VPEAR), poly(diaminosulfide) microparticles, a water-oil-water emulsion adjuvant, and aluminum hydroxide) to develop novel vaccines. Cattle were immunized twice, at a 4 week interval, with inoculums containing adjuvants alone or leptospira antigens and immune responses were compared to responses of cattle receiving a commercial monovalent leptospirosis vaccine (Spirovac). All animals were inoculated with a single dose of Spirovac at 20 weeks to assess antigen recall responses. Serum antibody responses were increased (P > 0.05) at 8 and 20 weeks after vaccination in cattle receiving inoculums containing leptospira antigens combined with water-oil-emulsion, poly(diaminosulfide) microparticles (PNSN-MP), or aluminum hydroxide and in cattle vaccinated with Spirovac. Humoral responses were predominantly IgG1 isotypes. Antigen-specific proliferative responses were detected after initial vaccination in cattle vaccinated with Spirovac, PNSN-MP and water-oil-water treatments. Most proliferative responses occurring within CD4+ and gamma delta T cell populations expressing CD45RO and CD25 markers, a response consistent with an effector memory phenotype. Antigen-specific immune responses were not detected in cattle vaccinated with VPEAR after initial inoculation, but were detected in the antigen recall responses. PBMCs from cattle vaccinated with Spirovac, oil-water-oil, or PNSN-MP treatments had increased (P < 0.05) IL-17A release after in vitro stimulation with leptospirosis antigens, whereas all groups produced IFN-γ and IL-17A after in vitro stimulation during the antigen recall response. Our data demonstrates that combining leptospirosis antigens with these adjuvants enhances immunogenicity in cattle. Interpretative Summary: Vaccination of livestock is a key mechanism for minimizing transmission of leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease. Leptospirosis vaccines for cattle need to be improved to provide greater levels of protection from kidney colonization, better immune responses, and protection against multiple serovars. This could be accomplished using new vaccine adjuvants. In this study, several novel adjuvants were evaluated for their ability to induce effective immune responses in cattle to leptospira antigens as compared to currently available vaccines. Data suggested that vaccines containing biodegradable polymer microparticles and oil-emulsion adjuvants induced similar or greater immune responses as compared to a commercial vaccine. Our data suggest these new vaccine formulations warrant further investigation as new vaccine formulations for cattle and other livestock.","['Wilson-Welder JH', 'Boggiatto P', 'Nally JE', 'Wafa EI', 'Alt DP', 'Hornsby RL', 'Frank A', 'Jones DE', 'Olsen SC', 'Bowden NB', 'Salem AK']",2020,38,18,Vaccine,"Wilson-Welder JH, et al.

32203511,Leptospira interrogans  and Leptospira kirschneri are the dominant Leptospira species causing human leptospirosis in Central Malaysia.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, commonly known as rat-urine disease, is a global but endemic zoonotic disease in the tropics. Despite the historical report of leptospirosis in Malaysia, the information on human-infecting species is limited. Determining the circulating species is important to understand its epidemiology, thereby to strategize appropriate control measures through public health interventions, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We investigated the human-infecting Leptospira species in blood and serum samples collected from clinically suspected leptospirosis patients admitted to three tertiary care hospitals in Malaysia. From a total of 165 patients, 92 (56%) were confirmed cases of leptospirosis through Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) (n = 43; 47%), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (n = 63; 68%) or both MAT and PCR (n = 14; 15%). The infecting Leptospira spp., determined by partial 16S rDNA (rrs) gene sequencing revealed two pathogenic species namely Leptospira interrogans (n = 44, 70%) and Leptospira kirschneri (n = 17, 27%) and one intermediate species Leptospira wolffii (n = 2, 3%). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) identified an isolate of L. interrogans as a novel sequence type (ST 265), suggesting that this human-infecting strain has a unique genetic profile different from similar species isolated from rodents so far.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira kirschneri were identified as the dominant Leptospira species causing human leptospirosis in Central Malaysia.

32200953,Leptospirosis is an invasive infectious and systemic inflammatory disease.,"Pathogenic Leptospira species are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a world-spreading zoonotic infectious disease. The pathogens possess a powerful invasiveness by invading human body through mucosal/skin barriers, rapid entry into bloodstream to cause septicemia, diffusion from bloodstream into internal organs and tissues to cause aggravation of disease, and discharge from urine through renal tubules to form natural infectious sources. Leptospirosis patients present severe inflammatory symptoms such as high fever, myalgia and lymphadenectasis. Hemorrhage and jaundice are the pathological features of this disease. Previous studies revealed that some outer membrane proteins of Leptospira interrogans, the most important pathogenic Leptospira species, acted as adherence factors to binding to receptor molecules (fibronectin, laminin and collagens) in extracellular matrix of host cells. Collagenase, metallopeptidases and endoflagellum contributed to the invasiveness of L. interrogans. Except for lipopolysaccharide, multiple hemolysins of L. interrogans displayed a powerful ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and hepatocyte apoptosis. vWA and platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase-like proteins from L. interrogans could induce severe pulmonary hemorrhage in mice. L. interrogans utilized cellular endocytic recycling and vesicular transport systems for intracellular migration and transcellular transport.

32178664,Leptospira infection and shedding in dogs in Thailand.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonosis and has been recognized as a re-emerging infectious disease in humans and dogs, but prevalence of Leptospira shedding in dogs in Thailand is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine urinary shedding of Leptospira in dogs in Thailand, to evaluate antibody prevalence by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and to assess risk factors for Leptospira infection. In Northern, Northeastern, and Central Thailand, 273 stray (n = 119) or client-owned (n = 154) dogs from rural (n = 139) or urban (n = 134) areas were randomly included. Dogs that had received antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to sampling were excluded. No dog had received vaccination against Leptospira. Urine was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira. Additionally, urine was cultured for 6 months in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium. Antibodies were measured by ELISA and MAT against 24 serovars belonging to 15 serogroups and 1 undesignated serogroup. Risk factor analysis was performed with backwards stepwise selection based on Wald.
RESULTS: Twelve of 273 (4.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-6.8%) urine samples were PCR-positive. In 1/273 dogs (0.4%; 95% CI: 0.01-1.1%) Leptospira could be cultured from urine. MAT detected antibodies in 33/273 dogs (12.1%; 95% CI: 8.2-16.0%) against 19 different serovars (Anhoa, Australis, Ballum, Bataviae, Bratislava, Broomi, Canicola, Copenhageni, Coxi, Grippotyphosa, Haemolytica, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Khorat, Paidjan, Patoc, Pyrogenes, Rachmati, Saxkoebing, Sejroe). In 111/252 dogs (44.0%; 95% CI: 37.9-50.2%) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were found by ELISA. Female dogs had a significantly higher risk for Leptospira infection (p = 0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospira shedding occurs in randomly sampled dogs in Thailand, with infection rates comparable to those of Europe and the USA. Therefore, the potential zoonotic risk should not be underestimated and use of Leptospira vaccines are recommended.","['Altheimer K', 'Jongwattanapisan P', 'Luengyosluechakul S', 'Pusoonthornthum R', 'Prapasarakul N', 'Kurilung A', 'Broens EM', 'Wagenaar JA', 'Goris MGA', 'Ahmed AA', 'Pantchev N', 'Reese S', 'Hartmann K']",2020,16,1,BMC Vet Res,"Altheimer K, et al.

This report describes six cases presenting to our hospital with symptoms such as fever and muscle pain and diagnosed as leptospirosis. All cases presented with fever, muscle pain, and lethargy and were engaged in activities such as farming, hunting, and fishing. Thrombocytopenia and impaired liver function tests were found in all patients, increased creatine-kinase in five, and increased creatinine in four. Leptospirosis was diagnosed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The course of the disease resulted in cure in three cases, chronic kidney disease sequelae in one, and death in two. In conclusion, the possibility of leptospirosis should be considered in patients presenting with non-specific symptoms such as fever and muscle pain and developing thrombocytopenia, and liver and kidney function disorder. Risk factors should also be investigated when taking histories.

Current research for vaccine development is mainly focused on recombinant-, subunit-, and peptide-based vaccine. At this point, immunoinformatics has been proven as a powerful method for identification of potential vaccine candidates, by analyzing immunodominat B- and T-cell epitopes. This method can reduce the time and cost of experiment to a great extent, by reducing the number of vaccine candidates for experimental testing for their efficacy.

32160864,Evaluation of real-time PCR targeting the lipL32 gene for diagnosis of Leptospira infection.,"BACKGROUND: Different diagnostic methods have been used for the laboratory confirmation of leptospirosis. Molecular diagnostic techniques are not only faster and more sensitive than culture analysis, but can also detect a Leptospira infection before the appearance of antibodies. The aim of the present study was to analyze and compare two different PCR approaches applied to blood and urine specimens obtained from patients with clinical manifestations that were suggestive of leptospirosis. Furthermore, the results of these different PCR approaches were compared with the results of culture and serology analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 400 samples (234 blood or 58.5% and 166 urine of 41.5%) from 310 Slovenian patients with clinical manifestations suggestive of leptospirosis were tested using conventional PCR assays targeting the rrs gene and RT-PCR targeting the lipL32 gene. Additionally, culture, serology and sequence analysis were performed for the majority of these samples. The PCR and RT-PCR results were concordant in 376 out of 400 of these samples (94.0%). Conventional PCR was positive for 27 out of 400 samples (6.8%) and RT-PCR was positive for 47 out of 400 samples (11.8%). Culture and microscopic agglutination tests supported these diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of the two PCR methods indicated that the RT-PCR targeting of the lipL32 gene was faster, more sensitive and more specific for the determination of Leptospira DNA in these clinical samples.","['Podgoršek D', 'Ružić-Sabljić E', 'Logar M', 'Pavlović A', 'Remec T', 'Baklan Z', 'Pal E', 'Cerar T']",2020,20,1,BMC Microbiol,"Podgoršek D, et al.

To achieve this goal, we compared data on morbidity, mortality, hospital and social costs, population profiles, vector habits, social health determinants and diagnostic practices related to leptospirosis with another disease of higher recognition in Brazil: dengue fever. Our analysis shows that the arbitrariness of criteria for assigning health priorities, the invisibility of the population profile of human leptospirosis in official data and its mimetic character in clinic corroborate the production of a version of human leptospirosis that is invisible and, because of that, doubly neglected by the Brazilian public health policy. We conclude that these discrepancies and informational gaps are related to the fact that human leptospirosis affects a population which the State has no interest in keeping alive.","['Martins MHDM', 'Spink MJP']",2020,25,3,Cien Saude Colet,Martins MHDM and Spink MJP.

32155209,First report of pathogenic Leptospira spp. isolated from urine and kidneys of naturally infected cats.,"Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases and can infect both humans and animals worldwide. Healthy cat, as a potential source of exposure to humans, are likely underestimated owing to the lack of overt clinical signs associated with Leptospira spp. infection in this species. The aim of the study was to determine the exposure, shedding, and carrier status of leptospires in shelter cats in Malaysia by using serological, molecular, and bacteriological methods. For this study, 82 healthy cats from two shelters were sampled. The blood, urine, and kidneys were tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and bacterial culture. On the basis of serological, molecular, and/or culture techniques, the total detection of leptospiral infection was 29.3% (n = 24/82). Through culture techniques, 16.7% (n = 4/24) of the cats that tested positive were carriers with positive kidney cultures, and one cat was culture positive for both urine and kidney. The Leptospira spp. isolates were identified as pathogenic L. interrogans serovar Bataviae through serological and molecular methods. Through serological techniques, 87.5% (n = 21/24) had positive antibody titers (100-1600) and most of the Bataviae serogroup (n = 19/21). Using PCR, 16.7% (n = 4/24) of cats were shown to have pathogenic Leptospira spp. DNA in their urine. Furthermore, three out of four culture positive cats were serology negative. The present study reports the first retrieval of pathogenic leptospires from urine and kidneys obtained from naturally infected cats. The results provide evidence of the potential role of naturally infected cats in the transmission of leptospires. Additionally, leptospiral infection occurs sub-clinically in cats. The culture isolation provides evidence that healthy cats could be reservoirs of leptospiral infection, and this information may promote the development of disease prevention strategies for the cat population.","['Alashraf AR', 'Lau SF', 'Khairani-Bejo S', 'Khor KH', 'Ajat M', 'Radzi R', 'Roslan MA', 'Abdul Rahman MS']",2020,15,3,PLoS One,"Alashraf AR, et al.

Currently, there is impaired knowledge on zoonotic pathogens in rodents and insectivores in the Netherlands. This limits opportunities for preventive measures and complicates risk-assessments for zoonotic transmission to humans. Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii are present on a list of prioritized emerging pathogens in the Netherlands and were therefore the focus of this study. Both pathogens have the ability to survive under moist environmental conditions. In total, a group of 379 small mammals (rodents & insectivores) were tested on pathogenic Leptospira spp., and 312 on T. gondii. Rodents and insectivores were trapped at various sites, but mostly on pig and dairy farms throughout the country. Over five percent of the animals (5.3%, n = 379) tested positive for Leptospira DNA, and five of the animals (1.6%, n = 312) tested were positive for T. gondii DNA. The animals positive for T.gondii were all brown rats and the ones for Leptospira spp. were various species.

32134015,Molecular confirmation &amp; characterization of Rickettsia conorii in north India: A report of three cases.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In India, spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) are an underdiagnosed cause of acute febrile illness (AFI). The non-specific Weil-Felix test is the first diagnostic modality for the diagnosis of SFGR in many laboratories due to the lack of advanced diagnostic facilities in developing countries. The aim of this study was to detect SFGR using molecular methods in the patients, presenting with AFI in a tertiary care centre in north India.
METHODS: Consecutive patients (>14 yr of age) with AFI were enrolled over a six month period. Standard investigations for common pathogens causing AFI in India (malaria, dengue, scrub typhus, leptospirosis and enteric fever) were carried out. In patients who were negative for all of the above investigations, blood was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene of Rickettsia.
RESULTS: Of the 51 patients with an undiagnosed aetiology, three were positive by ompA PCR. Two of the PCR products produced good sequences and BLAST identification confirmed them as Rickettsia conorii. The sequences of R. conorii reported from south India clustered with two previously reported novel rickettsial genotypes. The study sequences clustered in a group different from that of Rickettsia spp. of the south Indian sequences reported earlier.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the existence of R. conorii in north India. Testing for SFGR may be included in the diagnostic workup of AFI for better disease management.","['Biswal M', 'Zaman K', 'Suri V', 'Gopi S', 'Kumar A', 'Gopi T', 'Vig S', 'Sharma N', 'Bhalla A']",2020,151,1,Indian J Med Res,"Biswal M, et al.

However, its characteristics are not fully described in dogs. The purpose of this pilot study was to characterize the impact of ERRT on hematological, hemostatic, and thromboelastometric parameters in dogs with AKI. We conducted a prospective observational single cohort study in 10 client-owned dogs with AKI associated leptospirosis undergoing ERRT. Results from the CBC, coagulation tests (prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times [aPTT]) and rotational thromboelastometry (TEM; intrinsic TEM [inTEM] and heparinase-based TEM [hepTEM]) were recorded before and after the first ERRT session. Blood abnormalities observed before the ERRT session included thrombocytopenia (10/10), anemia (8/10), leukocytosis (4/10), prolonged aPTT (4/10) and leukopenia (1/10). After ERRT, the platelet count decreased (-25%; P = .012) whereas leukocytes (+15%; P = .046) and aPTT (+24%; P = .006) increased. The clotting time (CT) on inTEM assay and the relative variation of CT based on inTEM and hepTEM profiles increased after the ERRT session (P = .037 and P = .048, respectively). Seven dogs, 2 dogs, and 1 dog were defined as having a normal, hypocoagulable, and hypercoagulable inTEM profile after ERRT, respectively. After ERRT, no hepTEM parameter was significantly different from before treatment. Platelet count, leukocytes, aPTT and CT were altered after the first ERRT session.

32111168,Leptospirosis in an asplenic patient -case report.,"BACKGROUND: The presentation of clinical leptospirosis has been historically associated with animal workers, slaughterhouse workers and medical veterinarians. This association has shifted to be related to flooding events and outdoor activities; few cases are related to high-risk factors found in immunosuppressed patients. Scarcely a handful of cases have serological evidence of immune response against Leptospira serovar Bratislava representing serogroup Australis, a serovar associated with poor reproductive performance in swine and horses, and recently with cats.
CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we describe a rare clinical presentation of disseminated Leptospira infection in an immunosuppressed 65-year-old woman. She was admitted to the emergency room with fever, bacteraemia, bilateral uveitis and pulmonary involvement. The patient denied outdoor activities; she only had wide exposure to faeces and urine from cats living in her home. Her medical history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) diagnosed at the age of 18. She did not respond to medical treatment, and a splenectomy was performed. At age 60, she was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), and was treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) -Imatinib. The patient voluntarily discontinued the treatment for the last 6 months. After extensive workup, no microorganisms were identified by the commonly used stains in microbiology. The diagnosis was performed through dark-field microscopy, microagglutination test (MAT), Leptospira genus-specific PCR, the IS1500 PCR for identification of pathogenic species, and 16S based sequencing for the genus identification.
CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressed patients may acquire uncommon infections from ubiquitous microorganisms. In this case, serology evidence of exposure to Leptospira serovar Bratislava by MAT and the presence of the Leptospira genus were identified. It should be on mind for the diagnosis in otherwise healthy patients, and thoroughly search on splenectomised patients exposed to animals. Additionally, this report highlights the usefulness of PCR for diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening illness.","['García-Méndez J', 'Cervera-Ceballos E', 'Atilano-López D', 'Arroyo-Escalante S', 'Moncada-Barrón D', 'Leyva-Leyva M', 'Hernández-Castro R', 'Carrillo-Casas EM']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"García-Méndez J, et al.

32106244,A first insight into the genomic diversity of Leptospira strains isolated from patients in Cuba.,"Leptospirosis is a neglected disease causing severe infections in humans and animals. Due in part to misdiagnosis, this infectious disease results in nearly 60,000 deaths per year around the globe. This study represents the first effort to describe the diversity of pathogenic Leptospira in Cuba based on whole-genome sequencing. We have collected nineteen whole-blood samples from patients that were diagnosed as having leptospirosis between 2008 and 2012 in Cuba. In addition, we have enhanced our sample set by three historical strains that were used for the development of a human vaccine in 1990s. The Leptospira strains were grown and serotyped by the microscopic agglutination test, and the draft genomes were generated by NGS (Illumina). Subsequently, the core genomes were analyzed and compared to the genetic data available from other Caribbean islands and countries in Central America. Core genome Multi-locus Sequence Typing (cgMLST) revealed four different core genome clonal groups (cgCGs), with the highest number of samples belonging to L. interrogans, followed by L. borgpetersenii and L. kirschneri. All cgCGs that were found in Cuba have been also identified from multiple origins across the globe, except in neighbor countries and Central America. Serotyping divided the samples into the serogroups Canicola, Ballum and Pomona. The most frequent cgCGs, cgCG28, associated with serogroup Canicola, and cgCG15, associated with serogroup Ballum, have also been identified from samples isolated from dogs, rodents, and pigs; suggesting that these hosts represent the major source of human infection in Cuba. The vaccine strains did not significantly differ from the recent patient isolates. However, the increasing prevalence of samples belonging to the serogroup Ballum combined with the fact that the available vaccine in Cuba represents inactivated Leptospira belonging to serogroups other than Ballum, should be a valuable information for the National and Regional Leptospirosis Control Programs.","['Noda AA', 'Grillová L', 'Mariet JF', 'Paiffer NB', 'Ruiz YC', 'Rodríguez I', 'Echevarría E', 'Obregón AM', 'Lienhard R', 'Picardeau M']",2020,15,2,PLoS One,"Noda AA, et al.

32103771,Leptospirosis in Indonesia: diagnostic challenges associated with atypical clinical manifestations and limited laboratory capacity.,"BACKGROUND: The burden of leptospirosis in Indonesia is poorly understood. Data from an observational study conducted from 2013 to 2016 in seven cities across Indonesia was used to estimate the incidence of leptospirosis and document its clinical manifestations in patients requiring hospitalization.
METHODS: Specimens from patients hospitalized with acute fever were collected at enrollment, 14-28 days, and 3 months. Demographic and clinical information were collected during study visits and/or retrieved from medical records and double-entered into clinical report forms. After initially screening for dengue virus and other pathogens, specimens were tested at a central Reference Laboratory for anti-Leptospira IgM using commercial ELISA kits and for Leptospira DNA using an in-house quantitative real-time PCR assay.
RESULTS: Of 1464 patients enrolled, 45 (3.1%) confirmed cases (by PCR and/or sero-coversion or four-fold increase of IgM) and 6 (0.4%) probable cases (by high titer IgM) of leptospirosis were identified by the Reference Laboratory. Disease incidence at sites ranged from 0 (0%) cases in Denpasar to 17 (8.9%) cases in Semarang. The median age of patients was 41.2 years (range of 5.3 to 85.0 years), and 67% of patients were male. Twenty-two patients (43.1%) were accurately diagnosed at sites, and 29 patients (56.9%) were clinically misdiagnosed as having another infection, most commonly dengue fever (11, 37.9%). Clinically, 20 patients (39.2%) did not present with hyperbilirubinemia or increased creatinine levels. Two patients (3.9%) died, both from respiratory failure. Fifteen patients (29.4%) clinically diagnosed with leptospirosis at sites were negative based on IgM ELISA and/or PCR at the Reference Laboratory.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis remains an important cause of hospitalization in Indonesia. It can have diverse clinical presentations, making it difficult to differentiate from other common tropical infections. PCR combined with ELISA is a powerful alternative to the cumbersome gold-standard microscopic agglutination test, particularly in resource-limited settings.","['Gasem MH', 'Hadi U', 'Alisjahbana B', 'Tjitra E', 'Hapsari MMDEAH', 'Lestari ES', 'Aman AT', 'Lokida D', 'Salim G', 'Kosasih H', 'Merati KTP', 'Laras K', 'Arif M', 'Lukman N', 'Sudarmono P', 'Lisdawati V', 'Lau CY', 'Neal A', 'Karyana M']",2020,20,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Gasem MH, et al.

32093581,Leptospirosis in cats: Current literature review to guide diagnosis and management.,"GLOBAL IMPORTANCE: Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis worldwide. Mammals (eg, rats, horses, cows, pigs, dogs, cats and aquatic species, such as sea lions and northern elephant seals) can all be infected by leptospires. Infection in animals occurs through contact with urine or water contaminated with the bacteria. In people, the disease is acquired mainly from animal sources or through recreational activities in contaminated water.
PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Literature on the clinical presentation of leptospirosis in cats is scarce, although it has been demonstrated that cats are susceptible to infection and are capable of developing antibodies. The prevalence of antileptospiral antibodies in cats varies from 4% to 33.3% depending on the geographical location. Urinary shedding of leptospires in naturally infected cats has been reported, with a prevalence of up to 68%. Infection in cats has been associated with the consumption of infected prey, especially rodents. Thus, outdoor cats have a higher risk of becoming infected.
CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Clinical presentation of this disease in cats is rare and it is not known what role cats have in the transmission of leptospirosis. Ongoing work is needed to characterise feline leptospirosis.
AUDIENCE: This review is aimed at all veterinarians, both general practitioners who deal with cats on a daily basis in private practice, as well as feline practitioners, since both groups face the challenge of diagnosing and treating infectious and zoonotic diseases.
EVIDENCE BASE: The current literature on leptospirosis in cats is reviewed. To date, few case reports have been published in the field, and information has mostly been extrapolated from infections in people and dogs. This review is expected to serve as a guide for the diagnosis and management of the disease in cats.","['Murillo A', 'Goris M', 'Ahmed A', 'Cuenca R', 'Pastor J']",2020,22,3,J Feline Med Surg,"Murillo A, et al.

32088698,Impact of El Niño-Southern oscillation on human leptospirosis in Colombia at different spatial scales.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by a bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Climate is key in order to understand leptospirosis dynamics. El Niño Southern Oscillation is the main modulator of climate in Colombia. Our goal was to analyze the changes that occurred in number of cases and incidence rate of leptospirosis during La Niña and El Niño episodes in Colombia at three spatial scales in the period between 2007 and 2015.
METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional retrospective study was performed.
DATA ANALYSIS: correlation and lagged cross correlation between time series of Oscillation Niño Index and time series of standardized number of leptospirosis cases; construction of annual cycle of leptospirosis; comparison of changes of number of cases between Neutral, periods with El Niño and Neutral periods with La Niña.
RESULTS: At the national level, monthly number of cases raised a 25% during La Niña and decreased of 17% during El Niño. At departmental level, increase of cases in both phases of ENSO, depending on the location in the country, was found. At the municipal level, 17 have a rise in the number of cases during La Niña months. Of those, seven presented also an increase of cases during El Niño months and eight have a significant negative correlation with ONI.
CONCLUSIONS: In Colombia, there exists a relationship between leptospirosis and the excess and lack of rainfall related with ENSO. The contrasting results from each spatial scale, reinforce that leptospirosis is a multidimensional disease with high complex interactions among its determinants.","['Arias-Monsalve C', 'Builes-Jaramillo A']",2019,13,12,J Infect Dev Ctries,Arias-Monsalve C and Builes-Jaramillo A.

32078713,Leptospira interrogans Bat proteins impair host hemostasis by fibrinogen cleavage and platelet aggregation inhibition.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide spread zoonosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira. Evidences suggest that compromised hemostasis might be involved in the leptospirosis pathophysiology. In the genome of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, we found two genes coding for proteins which comprise von Willebrand factor (VWF) A domains (BatA and BatB). As VWF A domains exhibit multiple binding sites which contributes to human VWF hemostatic functions, we hypothesized that the L. interrogans BatA and BatB proteins could be involved in the hemostatic impairment during leptospirosis. We have cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified recombinant BatA and BatB. The influence of recombinant BatA and BatB on different in vitro hemostatic assays evaluating the enzymatic activity, platelet aggregation and fibrinogen integrity was investigated. We describe BatB as a new serine protease which is able to cleave thrombin chromogenic substrate, fibrin, fibrinogen, gelatin and casein; while BatA is active only towards fibrinogen. BatA and BatB interfere with the platelet aggregation induced by VWF/ristocetin and thrombin. Our results suggest an important role of the L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni Bat proteins in the hemostasis dysfunction observed during leptospirosis and contribute to the understanding of the leptospirosis pathophysiological mechanisms.","['Passalia FJ', 'Heinemann MB', 'de Andrade SA', 'Nascimento ALTO', 'Vieira ML']",2020,209,2,Med Microbiol Immunol,"Passalia FJ, et al.

Natural hosts are asymptomatic or show moderate signs of the disease. Accidental hosts develop a severe, often lethal, form of the disease. All young southern tamanduas died suddenly at the zoo in the city of João Pessoa, Brazil. The animals were found dead without any noticeable clinical signs. Necropsy revealed extensive haemorrhage in the subcutaneous tissues, kidneys, lungs in addition to the presence of red fluid in the thoracic, abdominal and pericardial cavities. Histopathology of kidneys exhibited acute interstitial nephritis and tubular necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed typical leptospiral wavy forms and aggregates in the lumen of several kidney tubules and lungs. Pathological and molecular investigations confirmed Leptospira interrogans infection. The adult tamanduas did not present with clinical alterations. To our knowledge, this investigation is the first study to report that leptospirosis should be considered as a possible cause of death in tamanduas.

32074217,Novel kidney injury biomarkers in tropical infections: a review of the literature.,"Tropical diseases are mainly found in the tropical regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America. They are a major Public Health problem in these regions, most of them are considered neglected diseases and remain as important contributors to the development of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury), which is associated with increased patients' morbidity and mortality. In most countries, kidney disease associated to tropical diseases is attended at health services with poor infrastructure and inadequate preventive measures. The long-term impacts of these infections on kidney tissue may be a main cause of future kidney disease in these patients. Therefore, the investigation of novel kidney injury biomarkers in these tropical diseases is of utmost importance to explain the mechanisms of kidney injury, to improve their diagnosis and prognosis, as well as the assessment to health systems by these patients. Since 2011, our group has been studying renal biomarkers in visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, leptospirosis and leprosy. This study has increased the knowledge on the pathophysiology of kidney disease in the presence of these infections and has contributed to the early diagnosis of kidney injury, pointing to glomerular, endothelial and inflammatory involvement as the main causes of the mechanisms leading to nephropathy and clinical complications. Future perspectives comprise establishing long-term cohort groups to assess the development of kidney disease and the patients' survival, as well as the use of new biomarkers such as urinary exosomes to detect risk groups and to understand the progression of kidney injuries.","['Meneses GC', 'Silva Junior GBD', 'Tôrres PPBF', 'Castro VQ', 'Lopes RL', 'Martins AMC', 'Daher EF']",2020,62,,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"Meneses GC, et al.

During the past 70 years, the Chinese government spent huge efforts in infectious disease prevention and treatment by promulgating and implementing series of relative policies, laws and strategies, and also encouraged all Chinese people to participate in. The achievements of these efforts in controlling infectious disease epidemic were extremely successful. Today, the outbreaks and epidemic of infectious diseases in China were rarely happened with the rapid decreases in incidence and mortality rates of all notifiable infectious diseases. Smallpox was eradicated, and polio, filariasis, leprosy and neonatal tetanus were nearly eradicated. In addition, the incidence rates of vaccine-preventable diseases, i.e. measles, diphtheria, pertussis, meningitis, encephalitis B, hepatitis A, mumps, rubella, tuberculosis, were dramatically decreased and remained at relatively low levels for years. The incidence and prevalence rates of hepatitis B infection in Children decreased significantly and reached the phase objectives. Moreover, incidence rates of natural iatrogenic infectious diseases, i.e. diarrhea, typhoid and other intestinal infectious diseases, leptospirosis and schistosomiasis, and vectorborne diseases, i.e. typhus, malaria, Kala Azar, reached the lowest and some even closed to be eliminated in China.

METHOD: The following incidence rates were mapped: dengue, acute Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, Hansen's disease, hepatitis A, cutaneous leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leptospirosis, malaria, and tuberculosis. The analyses were performed for the period from 2010 to 2017 based on a synthetic indicator calculated as the mean of mean incidence coefficients for each disorder, normalized by the mean and standard deviation during the period of analysis. A 2014 population estimate was used. The calculated coefficients were stratified for classification of municipalities into very high, high, medium, low, or very low criticality according to each disorder. Indicators expressing several socioeconomic dimensions and space segregation in Brazilian municipalities were also selected and tested regarding their association with the transmission of the diseases under study.
RESULTS: The indicator showed that 40.5% of Brazilian municipalities had high criticality for the diseases of interest, especially in the North, parts of the Northeast, and Midwest. Indicators ""proportion of poverty,"" ""garbage in surroundings,"" and ""families headed by women"" increased the chance of higher criticality for the diseases. The indicator ""adequate sewer system"" was a potential protection factor.

32049960,Diagnostic accuracy of genetic markers and nucleic acid techniques for the detection of Leptospira in clinical samples: A meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is often difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific symptoms. The drawbacks of direct isolation and serological tests have led to the increased development of nucleic acid-based assays, which are more rapid and accurate. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of genetic markers for the detection of Leptospira in clinical samples.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: A literature search was performed in Scopus, PubMed, MEDLINE and non-indexed citations (via Ovid) by using suitable keyword combinations. Studies evaluating the performance of nucleic acid assays targeting leptospire genes in human or animal clinical samples against a reference test were included. Of the 1645 articles identified, 42 eligible studies involving 7414 samples were included in the analysis. The diagnostic performance of nucleic acid assays targeting the rrs, lipL32, secY and flaB genes was pooled and analyzed. Among the genetic markers analyzed, the secY gene showed the highest diagnostic accuracy measures, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.50-0.63), a specificity of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.98), a diagnostic odds ratio of 46.16 (95% CI: 6.20-343.49), and an area under the curve of summary receiver operating characteristics curves of 0.94. Nevertheless, a high degree of heterogeneity was observed in this meta-analysis. Therefore, the present findings here should be interpreted with caution.
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic accuracies of the studies examined for each genetic marker showed a significant heterogeneity. The secY gene exhibited higher diagnostic accuracy measures compared with other genetic markers, such as lipL32, flaB, and rrs, but the difference was not significant. Thus, these genetic markers had no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy for leptospirosis. Further research into these genetic markers is warranted.","['Lam JY', 'Low GK', 'Chee HY']",2020,14,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lam JY, et al.

32026195,High frequency of seropositive and carriers of Leptospira spp. in pigs in the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil.,"Carrier animals are considered key in the transmission cycle of leptospirosis. Although investigations have been carried out on several species, the role of pigs in the epidemiology of the disease is still poorly studied in the semi-arid region. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the presence of Leptospira spp. in the genitourinary tract of pigs intended for slaughter. Fifty pigs were used: adults and unvaccinated. Samples of the kidney, urine, and vaginal fluid were collected for the molecular detection of Leptospira spp. and blood samples for the serological test. The molecular test was performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the serological test was performed with the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Samples with DNA amplification were submitted to genetic sequencing. Twenty (40%) animals were found with anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies, and the majority of the reactions (50%) occurred for the serogroup Tarassovi. Leptospiral DNA was found in the tissue of 11 (22%) pigs. The gene from a urine sample was sequenced and showed similarity to L. borgpetersenii. The results evidenced a high rate of porcine carriers; therefore, they appear to be important sources of agent infection, being potential transmitters of the disease to other animal species and man.","['Fernandes JJ', 'Araújo Júnior JP', 'Malossi CD', 'Ullmann LS', 'da Costa DF', 'Silva MLCR', 'Alves CJ', 'de Azevedo SS', 'Higino SSDS']",2020,52,4,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Fernandes JJ, et al.

32024441,Elevated levels of IL-8 in fatal leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis causes a wide range of clinical outcomes, including organ failure and death. Early treatment significantly increases the chances of cure. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemoattractant cytokine for neutrophil and is associated with multiple organ failure. Research has indicated IL-8 to be raised in severe and fatal cases of leptospirosis, but its suitability as a prognostic biomarker has yet to be confirmed. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of IL-8 with the clinical outcomes of leptospirosis patients. Plasma IL-8 was measured in fifty-two samples from hospitalized patients and nineteen healthy controls. The comparisons were made between mild, severe-survived and fatal groups identified by clinical or laboratory findings. IL-8 was significantly higher in fatal (p = 0.01) compared to mild cases. IL-8 was also significantly higher in fatal (p = 0.02) when compared to survived cases of leptospirosis. IL-8 levels in the plasma of fatal leptospirosis cases were significantly elevated compared to survived cases and may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in determining the possible outcome of leptospirosis patients.","['Wan Yusoff WSY', 'Abdullah M', 'Sekawi Z', 'Amran F', 'Yuhana MY', 'Mohd Taib N', 'Md Shah A', 'Amin Nordin S']",2020,114,2,Pathog Glob Health,"Wan Yusoff WSY, et al.

32007620,Full-genome sequences of porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) and high prevalence in mummified fetuses from commercial farms in Brazil.,"The clinical implications of recently discovered porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) infections are still unknown. The potential role of this emerging virus in reproductive loss in swine has been described. Herein, we report a high prevalence of PCV3 in mummified fetuses from sows maintained in modern farms in Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, Goiás, and Mato Grosso do Sul states, Brazil. For this analysis, 276 mummified fetuses from 11 commercial swine farms were included. The presence of PCV3 DNA was confirmed using PCR, and the complete sequence of five different viral strains was obtained. Sequences of PCV3 genomes available on GenBank were then used for phylogenetic tree construction. Of the 276 mummified fetuses examined, 270 (nearly 97%) were positive for PCV3. In 93.1% of the fetuses, co-infections with at least one of the following agents were identified: porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) and Leptospira spp. Twelve fetuses were positive for PCV3 alone. The amino acid sequence of the capsid gene for the five viral strains shared 98-100% homology among them. Analysis of the DNA sequence indicates that the viruses identified in this study belong to the PCV3a1 subgroup. In summary, PCV3 DNA was detected in mummified fetuses at a surprisingly high rate. The role of PCV3 in porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) is still uncertain. However, considering that PCV3 has been detected in a variety of conditions, even in healthy animals, the present results confirm the need to investigate PCV3 as a causative agent of fetal mummification in swine.","['Dal Santo AC', 'Cezario KC', 'Bennemann PE', 'Machado SA', 'Martins M']",2020,141,,Microb Pathog,"Dal Santo AC, et al.

31999733,Leptospiral shedding and seropositivity in shelter dogs in the Cumberland Gap Region of Southeastern Appalachia.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., is a zoonotic infection that affects humans, dogs and many other mammalian species. Virtually any mammalian species can act as asymptomatic reservoir, characterized by chronic renal carriage and shedding of a host-adapted leptospiral serovar. Environmental contamination by chronic shedders results in acquisition of infection by humans and susceptible animals.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated if clinically normal shelter dogs and cats harbor leptospires in their kidneys by screening urine samples for the presence of leptospiral DNA by a TaqMan based-quantitative PCR (qPCR) that targets pathogen-associated lipl32 gene. To identify the infecting leptospiral species, a fragment of leptospiral rpoB gene was PCR amplified and sequenced. Additionally, we measured Leptospira-specific serum antibodies using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), a gold standard in leptospiral serology.
RESULTS: A total of 269 shelter animals (219 dogs and 50 cats) from seven shelters located in the tri-state area of western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and southeastern Kentucky were included in this study. All cats tested negative by both qPCR and MAT. Of the 219 dogs tested in the study, 26/198 (13.1%, 95% CI: 8.4-17.8%) were positive for leptospiral DNA in urine by qPCR and 38/211 (18.0%, 95% CI: 12.8-23.2%) were seropositive by MAT. Twelve dogs were positive for both qPCR and MAT. Fourteen dogs were positive by qPCR but not by MAT. Additionally, leptospiral rpoB gene sequencing from a sub-set of qPCR-positive urine samples (n = 21) revealed L. interrogans to be the leptospiral species shed by dogs.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings have significant implications regarding animal and public health in the Cumberland Gap Region and possibly outside where these animals may be adopted.","['Spangler D', 'Kish D', 'Beigel B', 'Morgan J', 'Gruszynski K', 'Naikare H', 'Nahar VK', 'Coarsey MD', 'Verma A']",2020,15,1,PLoS One,"Spangler D, et al.

31986154,A systematic review of Leptospira in water and soil environments.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira, is a zoonosis of global distribution. This infectious disease is mainly transmitted by indirect exposure to urine of asymptomatic animals via the environment. As human cases generally occur after heavy rain, an emerging hypothesis suggests that rainfall re-suspend leptospires together with soil particles. Bacteria are then carried to surface water, where humans get exposed. It is currently assumed that pathogenic leptospires can survive in the environment but do not multiply. However, little is known on their capacity to survive in a soil and freshwater environment.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on Leptospira and leptospirosis in the environment in order to collect current knowledge on the lifestyle of Leptospira in soil and water. In total, 86 scientific articles retrieved from online databases or institutional libraries were included in this study.
PRINCIPALS FINDINGS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work identified evidence of survival of Leptospira in the environment but major gaps remain about the survival of virulent species associated with human and animal diseases. Studies providing quantitative data on Leptospira in soil and water are a very recent trend, but must be interpreted with caution because of the uncertainty in the species identification. Several studies mentioned the presence of Leptospira in soils more frequently than in waters, supporting the hypothesis of the soil habitat and dispersion of Leptospira with re-suspended soil particles during heavy rain. In a near future, the growing use of high throughput sequencing will offer new opportunities to improve our understanding of the habitat of Leptospira in the environment. This better insight into the risk of leptospirosis will allow implementing efficient control measures and prevention for the human and animal populations exposed.","['Bierque E', 'Thibeaux R', 'Girault D', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Goarant C']",2020,15,1,PLoS One,"Bierque E, et al.

31934459,Liver Transplantation for Acute Liver Failure Attributed to Leptospirosis: A Report of Two Cases.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Although it may be limited to nonspecific fever, leptospirosis may also be responsible for neurological symptoms or fulminant diseases such as Weil's disease. Diagnosis is challenging due to the difficulty in isolating the organism and the delays required for performing the serological test.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two cases of leptospirosis are presented here. The clinical picture differed from a real Weil's disease in the first case and from a neuro-leptospirosis in the second. However, both patients underwent liver transplantation because of the severity of the associated acute liver failure. Unfortunately, one of the cases had a fatal outcome.
CONCLUSION: Antibiotic treatment for leptospirosis should not be delayed by the lack of a positive serology test for this potentially lethal disease. In the context of a history of exposure to risk factors for leptospirosis, a negative serology must be repeated 7 days to 2 weeks following the first test. Although not always present, acute liver injury may, in rare cases, require liver transplantation.","['Lebreton T', 'Aubrun F', 'Mabrut JY', 'Heyer L', 'Perrin C']",2019,2019,,Case Rep Crit Care,"Lebreton T, et al.

31917796,Development and Validation of a simple score for diagnosis of Leptospirosis at outpatient departments.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease within the tropics. Diagnosing leptospirosis is a clinical obstacle, as clinical presentations are similar to other tropical infectious diseases. Available serological tests are often insensitive and not cost-effective. Many clinical diagnostic scorings had been developed but most were based on hospitalized patients, and wound not be suitable for use in suspected patients in setting of ambulatory care.
OBJECTIVES: To develop and internal validate multivariable diagnostic prediction score of leptospirosis in patients suspicious of leptospirosis at out-patient clinics of community hospitals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, multisite diagnostic prediction research with development of a diagnostic score. The development cohort was based on patients suspicious of leptospirosis who visited five community hospitals in Si Sa Ket province, Thailand during December 2017 to November 2018. Leptospirosis confirmed cases were defined when one of the three standard confirmatory tests was positive. Multivariable logistic regression was used for score derivation. Test of AuROC equality was done to compare diagnostic performance of the newly derived score and conventional WHO score.
RESULTS: A total of 262 leptospirosis suspicious patients were enrolled. Eighty-two patients (31.5%) were leptospirosis confirmed cases. Five final predictors remained within the reduced logistic model which were history of exposure to wet ground at workplace, history of contact water reservoir used by animal, urine protein and urine blood positive from dipstick test, and neutrophil count from CBC ≥80%. The OPD score diagnostic performance was AuROC 0.72 (95%CI 0.65-0.79). Test of equality revealed significant differences of AuROC between the OPD and WHO score (0.72 vs 0.62, p-value 0.014). Patients were categorized into low and high probability of having leptospirosis at score point of 3.5 with sensitivity 72.4% and specificity 61.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed and internal validated the OPD score. This clinical risk score could be one of the important tools for diagnosis of leptospirosis at the outpatient clinic.","['Temeiam N', 'Jareinpituk S', 'Phinyo P', 'Patumanond J', 'Srisawat N']",2020,14,1,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Temeiam N, et al.

The diseases that affect amnion have rarely been reported in horses. Amnionitis and funiculitis have been implicated as components of abortions as observed in abortions caused by the mare reproductive loss syndrome. Here, we report an abortion at 240-day gestation of a 7-year-old Anglo-Arabian mare with a history of previous stillbirth. Blood samples from both mare and foetus were collected for serological testing. Fragments from the placenta were taken for macroscopic and histopathological examinations. The results of these tests ruled out leptospirosis and concluded that the cause of the abortion was non-infectious chronic amnionitis. Moreover, the decreased vascularization in the placenta was consistent with placental insufficiency. This case highlights the importance of monthly ultrasound monitoring in equine pregnancy in order to diagnose placental insufficiency. The study also confirmed the efficiency of the histopathological examination for the definitive diagnosis of placental inflammation and for the study of foetal vascularization to rule out placental insufficiency in equine reproduction.","['Campos I', 'Batista B', 'Matos AC', 'Dutra F', 'Gomes G', 'Pinna A', 'Leite J', 'Ferreira A']",2020,55,4,Reprod Domest Anim,"Campos I, et al.

In this report, we present a case of leptospirosis manifested with severe pulmonary haemorrhagic syndrome successfully treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). A 39-year-old man who lives in Bangkok presented with fever, severe myalgia and haemoptysis. With rapid progression of acute respiratory failure in 6 hours, he was intubated and a litre of fresh blood was suctioned. Chest x-ray showed diffuse alveolar infiltrates compatible with ARDS, then mechanical ventilator with lung protective strategy was used. Diagnosis of leptospirosis with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage was made. Refractory hypoxaemia was not responsive to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); thus, VV-ECMO was initiated on the first day. Other treatments included plasmapheresis, intravenous pulse methylprednisolone and intravenous antibiotics. The outcome of treatment was successful, and this patient was discharged to home on day 14 after admission.","['Chaikajornwat J', 'Rattanajiajaroen P', 'Srisawat N', 'Kawkitinarong K']",2020,13,1,BMJ Case Rep,"Chaikajornwat J, et al.

31914888,Increased inflammation with crude E. coli LPS protects against acute leptospirosis in hamsters.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease that causes acute kidney injury, liver disease, bleeding disorders, and even death. Treatment of the disease is largely dependent on the use of antibiotics, but recent studies on pathogenesis of leptospirosis have shown that immunomodulation may also be an effective treatment for this disease. Since the delay in inflammation correlates with higher pathogenicity of leptospira, we studied the effect of inducing inflammation on leptospirosis by using TLR4 activator LPS. In accordance with our hypothesis, treatment with LPS protected against leptospirosis by enhancing the inflammatory response in hamsters. The gene expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, NLRP3 and inflammatory factors were higher in LPS-treated group during leptospira infection in hamsters. Although the levels of NO and iNOS were higher in LPS-treated group than in Leptospira-infected group, the protective effect induced by LPS is iNOS-independent. Treatment with LPS induced higher anti-leptospira IgG level than infection with leptospira alone. Then, expressions of costimulatory molecules and maturation markers were analysed. The data showed that treatment with LPS enhanced the expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86.

Here, we describe the spatiotemporal distribution of leptospirosis incidence reported to China's National Infectious Disease Surveillance System from 2004-2014 in an endemic region in western China, and employ distributed lag models at annual and sub-annual scales to analyze its association with hydroclimatic risk factors and explore evidence for the potential role of a soil reservoir in the transmission of Leptospira spp. More than 97% of the 2,934 reported leptospirosis cases occurred during the harvest season between August and October, and most commonly affected farmers (83%). Using a distributed lag Poisson regression framework, we characterized incidence rate ratios (IRRs) associated with interquartile range increases in precipitation of 3.45 (95% confidence interval 2.57-4.64) over 0-1-year lags, and 1.90 (1.18-3.06) over 0-15-week lags. Adjusting for soil moisture decreased IRRs for precipitation at both timescales (yearly adjusted IRR: 1.05, 0.74-1.49; weekly adjusted IRR: 1.36, 0.72-2.57), suggesting precipitation effects may be mediated through soil moisture. Increased soil moisture was positively associated with leptospirosis at both timescales, suggesting that the survival of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in moist soils may be a critical control on harvest-associated leptospirosis transmission in the study region. These results support the hypothesis that soils may serve as an environmental reservoir and may play a significant yet underrecognized role in leptospirosis transmission.","['Cucchi K', 'Liu R', 'Collender PA', 'Cheng Q', 'Li C', 'Hoover CM', 'Chang HH', 'Liang S', 'Yang C', 'Remais JV']",2019,13,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Cucchi K, et al.

The prospective gathering of these data over decades allowed us to describe the trends of infectious diseases in a tertiary hospital. The results concerning the period between 1965 and 1994 described the exponential increase in the incidence of HIV infection and its important effects on our institutional mortality. The present study describes the demand for the same hospital between 1995 and 2016.

Four positive samples including two MAT positive samples were subjected to DNA sequencing for further confirmation and phylogenetic tree was constructed. Out of the total of 190 samples, 24 patients were found positive by ELISA and 29 by PCR. Two samples were found reactive in MAT with L. interrogans serovars like hebdomadis and copenhageni. Phylogenetic analysis of four isolates based on partial secY gene nucleotide sequences revealed that species obtained from the Aligarh region clustered with the several published pathogenic Leptospira interrogans, while some of our isolates nucleotide sequences also clustered with the published sequence of intermediate and saprophytic Leptospira serovars like Leptospira inadai and Leptospira meyeri. This pilot study will help us to decipher the present scenario of circulating serovars of leptospira as well as to identify the nucleotide changes in secY gene, in this region.","['Mahtab M', 'Khan F', 'Azam M', 'Rizvi M', 'Sultan A', 'Shukla I', 'Almatroudi A']",2019,113,6,Pathog Glob Health,"Mahtab M, et al.

31800570,Gene expression is associated with virulence in murine macrophages infected with Leptospira spp.,"Leptospira genus contains species that affect human health with varying degrees of pathogenicity. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the differences in the modulation of host gene expression by strains of Leptospira varying in virulence. Our data showed a high number of differentially expressed transcripts in murine macrophages following 6h of infection. Leptospira infection modulated a set of genes independently of their degree of virulence. However, pathway analysis indicated that Apoptosis, ATM Signaling, and Cell Cycle: G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint Regulation were exclusively regulated following infection with the virulent strain. Taken together, results demonstrated that species and virulence play a role during host response to Leptospira spp in murine macrophages, which could contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.","['Araújo Junior EC', 'Garcia LE', 'Araújo MJ', 'Oliveira-Junior IS', 'Arnold DR', 'Lopes FL', 'Marinho M']",2019,14,12,PLoS One,"Araújo Junior EC, et al.

33597476,Evaluation of IgM LAT and IgM ELISA as compared to microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for early diagnosis of Leptospira sp.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. The clinical manifestation of leptospirosis is non-specific and frequently misdiagnosed as other illnesses. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracies of two commercial tests for early diagnosis of Leptospira species: the IgM latex agglutination test (IgM LAT) and the IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IgM ELISA). A total of 140 serum samples were obtained from patients suspected of leptospirosis at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). These serum samples were tested for the presence of Leptospira sp. using IgM LAT, IgM ELISA and MAT. From Table 1, IgM LAT showed 21% (n = 29) positive, 18% (n = 25) inconclusive and 61% (n = 86) negative, while IgM ELISA showed 6% (n = 8) positive, 6% (n = 8) inconclusive, 88% (n = 124) negative and MAT showed 11% (n = 16) positive, 47% (n = 65) inconclusive, 42% (n = 59) negative. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of IgM LAT were 68.8%, 57.6%, 30.6% and 87.2% respectively, while for IgM ELISA they were 37.5%, 89.8%, 50% and 84.1%, respectively as compared to MAT (Table 2). The results showed that IgM LAT had higher sensitivity but lower specificity compared to IgM ELISA. In conclusion, IgM LAT can be useful as an early screening test for early diagnosis of Leptospira sp., while IgM ELISA is a suitable method for reducing false negative detection of Leptospira sp. As both tests show moderate percentages (~65%) in accuracy, an additional test is required for better detection of Leptospira sp.","['Zin NM', 'Othman SN', 'Abd Rahman FR', 'Abdul Rachman AR']",2019,36,4,Trop Biomed,"Zin NM, et al.

His liver function tests showed marked cholestatic and cytolytic abnormalities without liver insufficiency. A liver biopsy was performed, and morphology with routine stains was considered non-specific. Because of the dermatological findings, the non-specific biopsy morphology, and the absence of an identified infectious etiology, a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease was presumed. However, additional colorations on liver biopsy with Warthin-Starry stain revealed multiple thin and coiled microorganisms compatible with spirochetes. His serology for leptospirosis was found to be positive for IgM, supporting the diagnosis of acute leptospirosis with liver involvement. Our case illustrates the diagnostic challenge of leptospirosis and highlights the utility of conventional laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis.

Leptospirosis has recently received increased attention and is considered a re-emerging infectious disease in many countries. The incidence of leptospirosis among people suggests that occupation, age, season, sex and water recreational activities are significant risk factors. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological profiles of leptospirosis in China during the 2007-2018 period. The morbidity data of leptospirosis by age, season (month), gender, occupation and geographic location (different provinces) were obtained from the public health science data centre of China for subsequent epidemiological analysis. The results indicate that the incidence of leptospirosis has shown a slow downward trend from 2007 to 2018, but morbidity rates were still relatively high (0.0660-0.0113). The incidence of leptospirosis varied in different provinces of China; cases localized mainly to the Southern and Central provinces, areas with warm weather and ample rainfall. Older people (aged 60-75), males, farmers, students and field workers were high-risk populations. During the 2007-2018 observation period, morbidity rates increased beginning in May, remained at high levels in August and September and decreased after November. The present investigation highlights the re-emergence of leptospirosis in some provinces of China (especially in Yunnan and Fujian) and shows that leptospirosis remains a serious public health threat. The results of this study should enhance measures taken for the prevention, control, and surveillance of leptospirosis in China.","['Zhang H', 'Zhang C', 'Zhu Y', 'Mehmood K', 'Liu J', 'McDonough SP', 'Tang Z', 'Chang YF']",2020,67,3,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Zhang H, et al.

To overcome limitations of the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), we developed serovar-specific and sensitive blocking ELISA assays. Serovar-specific antibodies against Lg, Lc and Li were detected in 100%, 45% and 91% of dogs, respectively, after the first dose of vaccine, and in 100% of dogs for all serovars after the second dose. In addition, mean ELISA antibody titers increased 14 days after annual revaccination with most dogs remaining ELISA antibody positive against Lg (85.3%), Lc (90%) and Li (100%). Parallel testing of sera from the annual revaccination study in the MAT and ELISA assays resulted in an overall agreement of 72%, 67%, 77% of samples for Lg, Lc and Li serovars, respectively. More sera tested positive by ELISA than by MAT, suggesting that the ELISA assay is more sensitive than the MAT.

In Germany, laboratory confirmation of acute human infection is notifiable based on the Protection Against Infection Act. Disease or occurrence of the pathogen in pigs and sheep must be reported according to the regulation on reportable animal diseases. Transmission occurs via direct and indirect contact with the urine of infected animals, with rodents acting as the main reservoir. With an average annual incidence of 0.1 notified cases per 100,000 inhabitants, leptospirosis is a rare disease in Germany.This review article presents the current knowledge on leptospirosis in Germany in the framework of the project ""Improving public health through a better understanding of the epidemiology of rodent-transmitted diseases"" (RoBoPub) funded by the Ministry of Education and Research. In a One-Health approach, information about clinical manifestation, available prevalence data in humans and animals, knowledge of pathogen distribution, host association, mode of transmission, and survival in the environment is summarized. Preliminary findings on the influence of fluctuations in rodent populations on the occurrence of leptospirosis are also discussed.

Infectious causes are rarely described. We report a case of invasive pneumococcal disease in a patient who developed a Fanconi-like syndrome during the course of her illness. This patient presented with multiple electrolyte derangements consisting predominantly of hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphataemia during hospitalization for invasive pneumococcal disease with possible Austrian syndrome. Further evaluation revealed significant urinary losses of these electrolytes, uric acid and β2-microglobulin. Together with evidence of hypouricaemia, this is suggestive of proximal renal tubulopathy, and hence a Fanconi-like syndrome. The patient's clinical condition and biochemical anomalies improved following pneumococcus treatment.
LEARNING POINTS: Suspect Fanconi syndrome when there are multiple electrolyte derangements consisting of hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphataemia.Recognise the common causes of Fanconi syndrome and appreciate that infections such as legionellosis, leptospirosis and pneumococcal disease can potentially result in Fanconi syndrome.The management of Fanconi syndrome is generally supportive and involves treating the underlying cause.","['Soh JXJ', 'Goh RKH', 'Zheng S']",2019,6,10,Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,"Soh JXJ, et al.

The immune aggression towards erythrocytes can be triggered by many pathological conditions such as infection, inflammatory disease or neoplasia. Upon ruling out any eliciting conditions, a diagnosis of the primary immune-mediated disease can be made. In this particular case of severe anemia (tested positive for circulating antibodies against red blood cells with flow cytometry), vector-borne diseases (which are a common cause of immunopathology in Mediterranean countries) were excluded, leptospirosis was not. This resulted in an unsuccessful immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone, two whole blood transfusions and ultimately death of the patient. Leptospirosis (confirmed positive in two tests, micro-agglutination test for antibodies and PCR for microbial DNA in urine), can mimic a primary IMHA and must be considered in its differential list of causes. A liver involvement, that included elevated serum activity of liver enzymes and increased serum bile acid was observed at the admission and suggested an etiopathogenesis other than a primary IMHA.","['Furlanello T', 'Reale I']",2019,10,3,Vet Res Forum,Furlanello T and Reale I.

31730465,"A cross-sectional study of environmental, dog, and human-related risk factors for positive canine leptospirosis PCR test results in the United States, 2009 to 2016.","BACKGROUND: Canine leptospirosis is a reemerging zoonotic disease concern in North America, and a better understanding of its epidemiology is needed. Wide-scale use and subsequent analyses of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may provide additional insight into leptospirosis. This study aimed to describe temporal trends, to descriptively map, and to identify environmental, dog, and human-level factors associated with positive canine leptospirosis PCR test results in the United States.
RESULTS: Data obtained from IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. on 40,118 canine leptospirosis PCR tests run in the United States between 2009 and 2016 were evaluated. Climate and socioeconomic (e.g. urban influence, income) data were obtained from public databases. Choropleth maps were created to identify high test-positive proportion areas and a cross-sectional analysis was completed with generalized (univariable, followed by multivariable) mixed logistic regression models accounting for county within state to identify significant predictors for a positive test. Overall test-positive proportion was 5.4% across the United States, with the regional point estimate highest in the southwest (8.1%). In the final multivariable model, the odds of a positive test were greater for male dogs (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.28) and dogs 0-4 years of age (ORs ranged from 0.35-0.71 for the other age groups). The odds of a positive test were greater for dogs living in areas with wet environmental conditions (OR = 1.24). Season and temperature, as well as the interaction between them, were significant predictors of a positive test. Dogs had a greater probability of testing positive during cool temperatures (< 4 °C) compared to the other temperature categories in the fall season.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings based on PCR testing allow for an improved understanding of factors influencing a positive canine leptospirosis PCR test and will assist targeted education and prevention efforts.","['Smith AM', 'Arruda AG', 'Evason MD', 'Weese JS', 'Wittum TE', 'Szlosek D', 'Stull JW']",2019,15,1,BMC Vet Res,"Smith AM, et al.

31722678,Diagnostic tools used in the evaluation of acute febrile illness in South India: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Acute febrile illness (AFI) is characterized by malaise, myalgia and a raised temperature that is a nonspecific manifestation of infectious diseases in the tropics. The lack of appropriate diagnostics for the evaluation of AFI leads to increased morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings, specifically low-income countries like India. The review aimed to identify the number, type and quality of diagnostics used for AFI evaluation during passive case detection at health care centres in South India.
METHODS: A scoping review of peer-reviewed English language original research articles published between 1946-July 2018 from four databases was undertaken to assess the type and number of diagnostics used in AFI evaluation in South India. Results were stratified according to types of pathogen-specific tests used in AFI management.
RESULTS: The review included a total of 40 studies, all conducted in tertiary care centres (80% in private settings). The studies demonstrated the use of 5-22 tests per patient for the evaluation of AFI. Among 25 studies evaluating possible causes of AFI, 96% tested for malaria followed by 80% for dengue, 72% for scrub typhus, 68% for typhoid and 60% for leptospirosis identifying these as commonly suspected causes of AFI. 54% studies diagnosed malaria with smear microscopy while others diagnosed dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid and leptospirosis using antibody or antigen detection assays. 39% studies used the Weil-Felix test (WFT) for scrub typhus diagnosis and 82% studies used the Widal test for diagnosing typhoid.
CONCLUSIONS: The review demonstrated the use of five or more pathogen-specific tests in evaluating AFI as well as described the widespread use of suboptimal tests like the WFT and Widal in fever evaluation. It identified the need for the development of better-quality tests for aetiological diagnosis and improved standardised testing guidelines for AFI.","['Bhaskaran D', 'Chadha SS', 'Sarin S', 'Sen R', 'Arafah S', 'Dittrich S']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Bhaskaran D, et al.

We have investigated various media conditions that are prepared based on the wealth of information obtained from 'omic' studies and report a sustainable Leptospira growth medium comprising of serum equivalent elements and nutrients for pyrimidine biosynthesis, which allows a visible growth of organism within 2 days.","['Dhayabaran V', 'Chidambaram D', 'Krishnaswamy PR']",2020,96,1,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"Dhayabaran V, et al.

31703588,"Seroprevalence and associated risk factors of leptospirosis in slaughter pigs; a neglected public health risk, western Kenya.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis of public health importance transmitted through contact with contaminated soil, water or urine of infected animals. In pigs the disease is characterized by abortion, still births and weak piglets. A cross-sectional study was conducted in May to July 2018 to estimate the sero-prevalence of leptospirosis and factors associated with seropositivity in slaughter pigs. A questionnaire was used to collect information on animal demographics. Serum was tested for anti-leptospiral antibodies using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with a panel of 8 serovars. Sera were considered positive for sero-reactivity at a MAT titre ≥1:40 against at least one serovar. Chi-square tests were used to measure the strength of association between the MAT test result and exploratory variables.
RESULTS: A total of 252 pig serum samples from seven slaughterhouses were tested for Leptospira antibodies by MAT. Of the 252 pigs sampled, 88.8% (244/252) were indigenous breeds; 55.6% (140/252) were female and 88.7% (220/252) were reared in extensive production systems. Eighty-three (32.9%; 83/252) sera samples tested positive on MAT against at least one serovar. Of the 8 serovars, the highest prevalence was recorded for serovar Lora 21.4% followed by Kenya 5.2%, Sokoine 3.6% and Grippotyphosa at 3.2%. Risk factors for leptospirosis seropositivity in pigs were: originating from farms with other types of livestock (OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.0-4.5) and mature pigs (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.3).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of leptospirosis positive pigs at slaughter in a small-holder livestock keeping region of the Lake Victoria basin. The potential for cross species transmission of pathogenic serovars is highlighted as well as the potential for occupational exposure to slaughterhouse personnel. Improvements in husbandry practices (confinement and rodent control) and public health education among slaughterhouse workers and other high-risk groups is recommended.","['Ngugi JN', 'Fèvre EM', 'Mgode GF', 'Obonyo M', 'Mhamphi GG', 'Otieno CA', 'Cook EAJ']",2019,15,1,BMC Vet Res,"Ngugi JN, et al.

The role of reptiles in the transmission of this microorganism is poorly understood and historically neglected. This study aimed to investigate the presence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies and leptospiral DNA in captive Caiman latirostris (broad-snouted caiman). Of the 23 reptiles studied by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), 22/23 (95.65%) were considered reactive (titers ≥ 100) and 1/23 (4.35%) non-reactive (titer < 100). The serogroup with highest occurrence was Grippotyphosa (68.18%, n = 15/22) followed by serogroup Djasiman (18.18%, n = 4/22). Specific amplification of Leptospira spp. gene lipL32 was observed in six (26.09%, n = 6/23) blood samples. Five of six samples, previously detected as pathogenic leptospira by PCR, were amplified and sequenced. All the samples corresponded to the pathogenic species Leptospira interrogans (presented 100% of identity) using the PCR targeting to secY gene. We demonstrated high detection of DNA of L. interrogans in crocodilians, and the authors suggest that further research is needed to elucidate the impact of Leptospira spp. infection in health broad-snouted caimans as well as the pathophysiology of leptospirosis in crocodilians.","['Paz LN', 'Hamond C', 'Dias CS', 'Curvelo VP', 'Medeiros MA', 'Oriá AP', 'Pinna MH']",2019,16,4,Ecohealth,"Paz LN, et al.

31698052,Serological evidence of leptospirosis in Iran; A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Leptospirosis is a neglected infectious zoonotic disease that affects domestic animals and wildlife as well as humans. Although leptospirosis is known as an endemic disease in Iran, there is no accurate information on the overall prevalence of this disease in humans and animals. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among human and domestic and wild animals in Iran. A systematic review of English and Persian articles (since 1998 to December 2017) was conducted using Google Scholar, Medline/PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of science and Iranian databases Iranmedex, Scientific Information Database (SID), Magiran, and IRANDOC. Search terms include leptospirosis, Leptospira, serology, seroprevalence, seroepidemiology, serological, Iran, cow, goat, sheep, camel, dog, cat, equine, donkey, horse, mule and rodent. In Eventually 66 articles were selected to analyze based on inclusion criteria. Seroprevalence of leptospirosis in human was 27.84% (95% CI: 13.22-22.47) and 19.71% (95% CI: 6.78-32.65%) based on ELISA and MAT, respectively. The pooled prevalence of leptospirosis in cow, sheep, goat and camel was 26.62% (95% CI: 18.76-34.48), 17.38% (95% CI: 13.32-21.43), 12.18% (95% CI: 9.96-14.41) and 22.68% (95% CI: 18.97-26.40), respectively. The prevalence of leptospirosis in horse, donkey, and mule was 19.99% (95% CI: 13.32-26.68), 40.59% (95% CI: 33.20-47.97) and 9.10% (95% CI: 2.90-15.30), respectively. The prevalence in dog and cat were estimated 14.63% (95% CI: 3.49-25.77) and 14.44% (95% CI: 3.25-25.65), respectively. The prevalence of seropositivity in rodents was estimated 20.96% (95% CI: 10.62-31.30). This study is a very comprehensive report on the status of leptospirosis in Iran. Based on our results, leptospirosis has considerable seroprevalence among human and animals in Iran. This high seroprevalence of leptospirosis showed should be given more attention for this disease in Iran and thus health measures must be taken to diagnosis, control and prevent it.","['Khalili M', 'Sakhaee E', 'Bagheri Amiri F', 'Safat AA', 'Afshar D', 'Esmaeili S']",2020,138,,Microb Pathog,"Khalili M, et al.

31694656,Emerging human infectious diseases of aquatic origin: a comparative biogeographic approach using Bayesian spatial modelling.,"BACKGROUND: With the increase in unprecedented and unpredictable disease outbreaks due to human-driven environmental changes in recent years, we need new analytical tools to map and predict the spatial distribution of emerging infectious diseases and identify the biogeographic drivers underpinning their emergence. The aim of the study was to identify and compare the local and global biogeographic predictors such as landscape and climate that determine the spatial structure of leptospirosis and Buruli Ulcer (BU).
METHODS: We obtained 232 hospital-confirmed leptospirosis (2007-2017) cases and 236 BU cases (1969-2017) in French Guiana. We performed non-spatial and spatial Bayesian regression modeling with landscape and climate predictor variables to characterize the spatial structure and the environmental drivers influencing the distribution of the two diseases.
RESULTS: Our results show that the distribution of both diseases is spatially dependent on environmental predictors such as elevation, topological wetness index, proximity to cropland and increasing minimum temperature at the month of potential infection. However, the spatial structure of the two diseases caused by bacterial pathogens occupying similar aquatic niche was different. Leptospirosis was widely distributed across the territory while BU was restricted to the coastal riverbeds.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that a biogeographic approach is an effective tool to identify, compare and predict the geographic distribution of emerging diseases at an ecological scale which are spatially dependent to environmental factors such as topography, land cover and climate.","['Jagadesh S', 'Combe M', 'Couppié P', 'Le Turnier P', 'Epelboin L', 'Nacher M', 'Gozlan RE']",2019,18,1,Int J Health Geogr,"Jagadesh S, et al.

31677243,"Genetic diversity of pathogenic leptospires from wild, domestic and captive host species in Portugal.","Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution with a significant veterinary and public health impact. It is caused by pathogenic bacteria of the genus Leptospira. The availability of effective tools to accurately identify and type leptospires is of utmost importance for the diagnosis of the disease and for assessing its epidemiology. Several multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) approaches were described for the typing of worldwide isolates of Leptospira but an extensive agreement towards the adoption of a unique consensus scheme for this agent is still lacking. Most genotyped strains originate from Asian and South American countries, with a minority originating from Europe (being most countries represented only by one or a few isolates). The knowledge of the diversity of circulating leptospires is the key to understanding the disease transmission and its zoonotic implications. In this study, we revisited the taxonomy of several isolates of pathogenic Leptospira obtained from domestic, wild and captive animals in Portugal, between 1990 and 2012. A selection of these isolates was genotyped using two previously published MLST schemes. A total of seven distinct sequence types (STs) were detected among the Portuguese isolates with two STs representing L. borgpetersenii (ST149 and ST152), two STs representing L. kirschneri (ST117 and ST100) and three STs representing L. interrogans (ST17, ST24 and ST140). Global widespread (and maybe more virulent) Leptospira genotypes seem to circulate in Portugal, particularly the L. interrogans ST17 isolates which are associated with several outbreaks of leptospirosis among humans and animals in different regions of the world. This study contributes to the enrichment of the global MLST databases with a new set of allele and sequence type information also providing novel data on circulating Leptospira serovars in Portugal.","['Ferreira AS', 'Ahmed A', 'Rocha T', 'Vieira ML', 'Paiva-Cardoso MDN', 'Mesquita JR', 'van der Linden H', 'Goris M', 'Thompson G', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Inácio J']",2020,67,2,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Ferreira AS, et al.

In Bolivia, the reporting of small outbreaks occurred until 2012. The findings of 40 laboratory-confirmed cases diagnosed in two departments are reported herein.
METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study. Data on laboratory-confirmed cases in 2018 were collected from the hospitals and departmental health services (SEDES) of Santa Cruz and Tarija. An ELISA was used for the detection of IgM antibody to hantavirus in the patient blood samples.
RESULTS: Forty patients were IgM-positive. The median age of the patients was 24 years (interquartile range 19-41 years) and 72.5% were male. All patients were hospitalized; 57.5% were admitted to the intensive care unit and had cardiopulmonary compromise, with 83% of these presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome and 89.5% of these requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients died (CFR 15%). Patients <15 or >60 years old were more prone to die (odds ratio 10.33, 95% confidence interval 1.411-75.694), as were those with comorbidities (odds ratio 16.5, 95% confidence interval 1.207-225.540).

31664587,A Case-Control Study of Environmental and Occupational Risks of Leptospirosis in Sri Lanka.,"Sri Lanka has one of the highest incidences of human leptospirosis worldwide. Outbreaks of this zoonotic infection are related to the monsoons and flooding. The study investigates risk factors associated with environmental, animal and occupational exposure while acknowledging the potential bias due to hanta viral infections in the study samples. Data were obtained from structured interviews with 483 patients (276 cases and 207 controls). Risk exposures were studied for the entire population and for two stratified occupational groups: non-paddy workers and paddy workers. A higher odds ratio (OR) of leptospirosis transmission for paddy workers was observed compared to non-paddy workers (OR 1.905, 95% CI 1.274-2.856). Rat exposure was not associated with a significant higher risk for any of the groups. Instead, cattle and household animals seemed to be important for transmission of leptospirosis to humans, especially among non-paddy workers (OR 10.655, 95% CI 1.213-93.582). Leptospirosis in paddy workers was associated with environmental factors linked to contamination and wetness in paddy fields. Interestingly, abandoned paddy fields were found to have a protective effect against transmission to paddy workers (OR 0.421, 95% CI 0.237-0.748). Keeping animals on these dryer fields may act as a boundary for contamination of paddy fields with infectious animal urine. This finding may be considered as a public health intervention targeting leptospirosis among paddy workers.","['Schønning MH', 'Phelps MD', 'Warnasekara J', 'Agampodi SB', 'Furu P']",2019,16,3,Ecohealth,"Schønning MH, et al.

31660403,Usefulness of C-Reactive Protein in Differentiating Acute Leptospirosis and Dengue Fever in French Guiana.,"OBJECTIVE: Leptospirosis and dengue fever (DF) are hard-to-differentiate diseases in cocirculating areas, especially during DF epidemics. Misdiagnosis and ensuing lack of antibiotic therapy can be detrimental in leptospirosis. The objective of this study was to identify factors that help differentiate acute leptospirosis from dengue fever on admission.
METHOD: Patients with leptospirosis (positive serology or polymerase chain reaction) were compared with patients with DF (positive nonstructural 1 [NS1] antigen) in a case-control study with age matching. Data on admission were compared using bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with leptospirosis were compared to 216 patients with DF. In bivariate analysis, the factors associated with leptospirosis were male gender, cough, anemia, and elevated blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes, creatinine, bilirubin, and creatine phosphokinase. Exanthema, purpura, myalgia, headache, and neutropenia were associated with DF. In multivariate analysis, elevated blood levels of leukocytes, bilirubin, and CRP were associated with leptospirosis. The CRP threshold of 50 mg/L taken alone had elevated sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: The CRP level, an easy-to-obtain biomarker, was a powerful tool to differentiate on admission leptospirosis and DF. Facing a dengue-like syndrome in cocirculating areas and awaiting new specific rapid diagnostic tests, CRP dosing could help the clinician to promptly consider the diagnosis of leptospirosis and initiate antibiotic therapy early.","['Le Turnier P', 'Bonifay T', 'Mosnier E', 'Schaub R', 'Jolivet A', 'Demar M', 'Bourhy P', 'Nacher M', 'Djossou F', 'Epelboin L']",2019,6,9,Open Forum Infect Dis,"Le Turnier P, et al.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 162 patients admitted to hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis (LG group, n = 92) and hantavirus infections (HG, group = 70) between January 2000 and January 2019. The two groups were compared in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory features. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined from ROC analysis for findings of significance in the diagnosis of leptospirosis, and a scoring system for diagnosis was developed (""MICE"" score). During the development of this scoring system, we were careful to employ parameters that would not affect one another statistically, to reflect the involvement of very different systems (such as the hematological, hepatic, renal, and musculoskeletal systems) due to the multisystemic effect of the disease in the organism, and to ensure that the system should be simple to apply and understand. Accordingly, five parameters, serum WBC, creatinine, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein, were employed in the ""MICE"" scoring system.
RESULTS: Three cut-off values were determined using ROC analysis for the five parameters included in the MICE system. Accordingly, scores of 0, 1, or 2 were given based on the values WBC (/μL): ≤ 7500, 7500-15,000, and > 15,000; total bilirubin (mg/dL): ≤ 3, 3-10, and > 10; CRP (mg/dL): ≤ 5, 5-15, and > 15; creatinine (mg/dL): ≤ 1.5, 1.5-3, and > 3; CK (U/L): ≤ 500, 500-1000, > 1000. AUC was calculated as 0.964 at ROC analysis, while the most noteworthy cut-off point was obtained when MICE score was ≥ 3, exhibiting 93.5% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, PPV 94.5% and NPV 91.5%. A test score ≥ 3 was regarded as positive. In addition, our patients were evaluated using other current scoring systems in addition to ""MICE,"" and our scoring system exhibited a greater diagnostic power in our subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis and hantavirus infections can be accurately predicted by the MICE scoring system. Early diagnosis and rational treatment will also help to lower the mortality rates in these diseases.","['Kaya S', 'Yılmaz G', 'Aydın M', 'Aksoy F', 'Koksal I']",2020,48,1,Infection,"Kaya S, et al.

31654079,"Severe leptospirosis in non-tropical areas: a nationwide, multicentre, retrospective study in French ICUs.","PURPOSE: To report the incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcome predictors of severe leptospirosis requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission in a temperate zone.
METHODS: LEPTOREA was a retrospective multicentre study conducted in 79 ICUs in metropolitan France. Consecutive adults admitted to the ICU for proven severe leptospirosis from January 2012 to September 2016 were included. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and hierarchical classification on principal components (HCPC) were performed to distinguish different clinical phenotypes.
RESULTS: The 160 included patients (0.04% of all ICU admissions) had median values of 54 years [38-65] for age, 40 [28-58] for the SAPSII, and 11 [8-14] for the SOFA score. Hospital mortality was 9% and was associated with older age; worse SOFA score and early need for endotracheal ventilation and/or renal replacement therapy; chronic alcohol abuse and worse hepatic dysfunction; confusion; and higher leucocyte count. Four phenotypes were identified: moderately severe leptospirosis (n = 34, 21%) with less organ failure and better outcomes; hepato-renal leptospirosis (n = 101, 63%) with prominent liver and kidney dysfunction; neurological leptospirosis (n = 8, 5%) with the most severe organ failures and highest mortality; and respiratory leptospirosis (n = 17, 11%) with pulmonary haemorrhage. The main risk factors for leptospirosis contamination were contact with animals, contact with river or lake water, and specific occupations.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe leptospirosis was an uncommon reason for ICU admission in metropolitan France and carried a lower mortality rate than expected based on the high severity and organ-failure scores. The identification in our population of several clinical presentations may help clinicians establish an appropriate index of suspicion for severe leptospirosis.","['Miailhe AF', 'Mercier E', 'Maamar A', 'Lacherade JC', 'Le Thuaut A', 'Gaultier A', 'Asfar P', 'Argaud L', 'Ausseur A', 'Ben Salah A', 'Botoc V', 'Chaoui K', 'Charpentier J', 'Cracco C', 'De Prost N', 'Eustache ML', 'Ferré A', 'Gauvin E', 'Goursaud S', 'Grall M', 'Guiot P', 'Jonas M', 'Lambiotte F', 'Landais M', 'Lemarié J', 'Lesieur O', 'Lhommet C', 'Michel P', 'Monseau Y', 'Moschietto S', 'Nseir S', 'Osman D', 'Pillot J', 'Piton G', 'Sedillot N', 'Sirodot M', 'Thevenin D', 'Zafrani L', 'Zerbib Y', 'Bourhy P', 'Lascarrou JB', 'Reignier J', 'LEPTOREA']",2019,45,12,Intensive Care Med,"Miailhe AF, et al.

Despite of this importance in livestock, little is known about the epidemiology of leptospirosis in cattle in Brazil and other tropical countries. In this context, the objective of this study was to perform the culture of urine and kidney (n = 372 animals) of slaughtered bovines of Minas Gerais state (Brazil), in order to obtain pure cultures of Leptospira strains and carry out its characterization by serological (microscopic agglutination test) and molecular techniques (rrs, secY sequencing and variable-number tandem-repeat genotyping). One strain, named UFU 02, was obtained from a male bovine without apparent alterations in ante-mortem examination. The strain was characterized belonging to species Leptospira kirschneri and serogroup Grippotyphosa. The serogroup Grippotyphosa is most often described in wild species, suggesting a link between domestic and wild cycles/environments. Considering the importance of the country in livestock breeding, the knowledge about leptospiral strains could help to control the disease in the herds.","['Soares PM', 'Gomes DO', 'Macedo FP', 'Soares MM', 'Lemes KR', 'Jaeger LH', 'Lilenbaum W', 'Lima AMC']",2020,138,,Microb Pathog,"Soares PM, et al.

To this end, 193 bovine serum samples from different Pará State regions (Amazonia) were subjected to a reference microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for the serological diagnosis of leptospirosis using 11 serovars representing the Sejroe serogroup: Hardjo-prajitno; Hardjo-bovis; Sejroe; Wolffi; Guaricura (Bov.G.); Guaricura (M4/98); Ricardi; Gorgas; Recreo; Polonica and Medanensis. The three most prevalent serovars in the MAT were selected for the development of a pooled antigen for use in MSAT; subsequently, the 193 serum were assessed with the macroscopic slide agglutination test (MSAT) containing the developed antigen. The Kappa test was used to determine the general agreement between the MAT and MSAT results. As a result, of the 193 serum samples, 155 (80.3%) were reactive, and 38 (19.7%) were non-reactive in the MAT; Hardjo-prajitno, Wolffi and Medanensis were the three most prevalent serovars. Of the 193 serum samples tested in the MSAT using the developed pooled antigen, 114 were reactive (59.0%), and 79 (41.0%) were non-reactive; the Kappa coefficient was 0.52 (CI 95%, 0.40-0.63), indicating moderate agreement between the two tests. The MSAT with the pooled antigen including the most prevalent serovars detected bovines with the Sejroe serogroup exposure, mainly in animals with high titters in the MAT, and could be used to screen herds suspected of acute infection by this serogroup in Pará State.","['Guedes IB', 'Souza GO', 'de Paula Castro JF', 'de Souza Filho AF', 'de Souza Rocha K', 'Gomes MET', 'de Moraes CCG', 'Heinemann MB']",2019,166,,J Microbiol Methods,"Guedes IB, et al.

The purpose of the study was to identify the determinants of therapeutic delay in hospitalized leptospirosis cases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective multicenter study in the 4 public hospitals of Reunion Island, South Western Indian Ocean. Medical records of confirmed leptospirosis cases occurring in 2014-2015 were reviewed for socio-economic, demographic, geographic and medical data. The primary outcome measure was the therapeutic delay, defined as the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and initiation of antibiotics.
RESULTS: Of the 117 patients included, 107 were men, with an average age of 44.9±15years. The median therapeutic delay was 4 days (interquartile: 2-5 days) and this delay was not found to be associated with severity. The following were found to be at increased risk of having a longer therapeutic delay: cases occurring outside the epidemic period, or rainy season (OR 2.8 [1.08-7.3], P=0.04) and cases with first medical evaluation in primary health care (OR 4.63 [1.43-14.93]; P=0.01) instead of emergency unit. No socio-economic or geographic characteristics were found to be linked to a longer therapeutic delay.
CONCLUSION: Although delayed treatment was not associated to disease severity, our results indicate that leptospirosis awareness is needed all year in the subtropical area of Reunion Island and particularly in primary care.","['Lebeau-Desmoulin L', 'Bruneau L', 'Commins J', 'Herbreteau V', 'Raffray L']",2020,50,4,Med Mal Infect,"Lebeau-Desmoulin L, et al.

One Health recognises that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are all interconnected. Ethiopia has committed itself to controlling five prioritised zoonotic diseases (rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis and echinococcosis), using a One Health approach. The National One Health Steering Committee (NOHSC) provides a framework for national stakeholders to address gaps in multisectoral communication, coordination and collaboration. In addition, the NOHSC oversees the formation of several specialised disease-focused groups, referred to as 'Technical Working Groups' (TWGs). These TWGs are responsible for developing disease prevention and control strategies, as well as implementing disease-focused public health activities and providing recommendations to the NOHSC. Ethiopia's success using the One Health approach and its efficient control of zoonotic diseases will depend on the commitment of all member Ministries to support the NOHSC and TWGs, as well as to build capacity in Ethiopia's workforce and laboratories, a task supported by its many international partners.","['Murphy SC', 'Negron ME', 'Pieracci EG', 'Deressa A', 'Bekele W', 'Regassa F', 'Wassie BA', 'Afera B', 'Hajito KW', 'Walelign E', 'Abebe G', 'Newman S', 'Rwego IB', 'Mutonga D', 'Gulima D', 'Kebede N', 'Smith WA', 'Kramer LM', 'Kibria A', 'Bonnenfant YT', 'Mortenson JA', 'Vieira AR', 'Kadzik M', 'Sugerman D', 'Amare B', 'Kanter T', 'Walke H', 'Belay E', 'Gallagher K']",2019,38,1,Rev Sci Tech,"Murphy SC, et al.

Six pathogenic serovars are currently known to commonly infect and cause disease in dogs in the United States. While canine leptospirosis infection is historically rare in Arizona (≤5 cases reported annually) (ADHS unpublished data) several clusters were reported in Maricopa County (MC) during February 2016-January 2017. Public health initiated an outbreak response and developed a knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey for veterinarians. The goals were to determine awareness and general attitudes about canine leptospirosis and to identify gaps in veterinarians' knowledge in treatment and prevention. We distributed a 40-question self-administered online survey to 1058 Arizona Veterinary Medical Association members, made available during February 9-May 15, 2017. We analyzed the results using Pearson's Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test; a P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We analyzed 202 complete responses. Veterinarians from 10 (66%) of 15 Arizona counties were represented. MC practices were more likely to stock leptospirosis vaccine (80%) than other counties combined (58%) (P = 0.004). The average composite knowledge score was 24.4 out of 38 (range 12-37, median 24); 49% of respondents demonstrated higher knowledge as defined by authors, largely in identification of leptospirosis risk factors (86%) and routes of exposure (73%). Fewer than half (45%) of respondents correctly identified the length of time bacteria can be shed in dogs' urine. Eighty-one percent of respondents demonstrated lower knowledge about clinical signs associated with leptospirosis; only 47% of respondents identified eight clinical signs commonly associated with leptospirosis. Sixty-one percent of MC respondents agreed that leptospirosis is an important canine disease in their geographic area, while only 40% of other county respondents agreed (P=0.03). Seventy percent of respondents identified diagnostic testing options. The majority correctly selected infection-control practices in line with recommendations from 2 national clinical guidelines. More respondents would recommend leptospirosis vaccination if dogs traveled or lived in rural areas (87-96%) than if dogs attended day care or were boarded (63%). We identified opportunities for education, including the local epidemiology of leptospirosis, transmission prevention strategies, vaccine safety, testing, clinical identification, and emerging risk factors. Our findings will help guide the design of educational materials for small animal veterinarians in Arizona regarding recommendations for prevention of animal and human leptospirosis infections; these efforts could also shift the culture of reporting companion animal diseases to improve future One Health collaborations.","['LaFerla Jenni M', 'Woodward P', 'Yaglom H', 'Levy C', 'Iverson SA', 'Kretschmer M', 'Jarrett N', 'Dooley E', 'Narang J', 'Venkat H']",2019,172,,Prev Vet Med,"LaFerla Jenni M, et al.

31550083,"Investigation and response to an outbreak of leptospirosis among raspberry workers in Australia, 2018.","BACKGROUND: In 2018, an outbreak of leptospirosis was identified among raspberry workers from a mixed-berry farm in New South Wales, Australia. Initial testing had not revealed a cause, but eventually leptospirosis was detected via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Further serological testing detected Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Arborea, of which rodents are the predominant reservoir. Leptospirosis is rare in Australia, with outbreaks usually related to flooding. We conducted an investigation to identify risk factors for infection, to inform control measures.
METHODS: Cases were detected through laboratory notifications, hospital-based syndromic surveillance, awareness-raising among farm employees and clinician alerts. Confirmed cases had a four-fold rise in antibody titre or single titre ≥400 on microscopic agglutination test, and a positive IgM. Probable cases had a positive Leptospira PCR or IgM, and possible cases had a clinically compatible illness. We conducted a case-control study among raspberry workers on the farm and compared reported exposures between cases and seronegative controls. We assessed environmental risks on-site and tested rodents for leptospirosis.
RESULTS: We identified 84 cases over a 5-month period (50 confirmed, 19 probable and 15 possible). Compared with controls, cases were less likely to wear gloves and more recently employed. Cases also more commonly reported always having scratched hands, likely from the thorns on raspberry plants. We observed evidence of rodent activity around raspberry plants and three of thirteen trapped mice tested positive for Leptospira Arborea. Control measures included enhanced glove use, doxycycline prophylaxis and rodent control.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest known outbreak of leptospirosis in Australia. Workers were likely exposed through scratches inflicted during harvesting, which became contaminated with environmental leptospires from mice. Leptospirosis should be considered an occupational risk for raspberry workers, requiring protective measures. Chemoprophylaxis may assist in controlling outbreaks. PCR assists in the early diagnosis and detection of leptospirosis and should be included in surveillance case definitions.","['Katelaris AL', 'Glasgow K', 'Lawrence K', 'Corben P', 'Zheng A', 'Sumithra S', 'Turahui J', 'Terry J', 'van den Berg D', 'Hennessy D', 'Kane S', 'Craig SB', 'Heading E', 'Burns MA', 'Corner HL', 'Sheppeard V', 'McAnulty J']",2020,67,1,Zoonoses Public Health,"Katelaris AL, et al.

31530819,Resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides in Martinique could lead to inefficient rodent control in a context of endemic leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a re-emergent worldwide zoonosis. It is endemic in Martinique where transmission conditions are favourable. Humans are usually infected through contact with water contaminated with urine of rodents. Recent human leptospirosis outbreaks in Martinique require today effective rodent management to prevent leptospirosis transmission. Nowadays, use of anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) is the main method implemented to control rodent populations. Nevertheless, intensive use of these AR has selected worldwide many VKORC1-based resistant rodent strains to AR. Our aim was to characterize the sensitivity of Martinique commensal rodents to AR to better prevent leptospirosis transmission. Resistance of house mice to first-generation and in rare cases even to second-generation ARs were clearly demonstrated in Martinique with the detection of the Y139C mutation with a very high allelic frequency of 40% and the A26T/Y139C double-mutation with an allelic frequency of 0.9%. In black rat, the most prevalent rodent in Martinique, 3 new Vkorc1 coding mutations were detected, the H68N, A115T and S149N mutations associated with moderate resistance to first generation AR. Therefore, rodent management in Martinique must be carried carefully to avoid resistance diffusion and maintain long-term effective rodent management, to be able to efficiently prevent leptospirosis transmission.","['Marquez A', 'Khalil RA', 'Fourel I', 'Ovarbury T', 'Pinot A', 'Rosine A', 'Thalmensi G', 'Jaffory G', 'Kodjo A', 'Benoit E', 'Lattard V']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Marquez A, et al.

Results: We analyzed 87 patients, 74% of them were men, and 84% were older than 18 years; 35% had a comorbidity, the most common being arterial hypertension (16%) and diabetes mellitus (9%). The most frequent symptoms were fever, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. The majority of patients required hospitalization in general wards (61%), with a median stay of six days; 34% required management in the intensive care unit, with a median stay of five days. Mortality was 1.1% (n=1). All patients received treatment with either ceftriaxone or doxycycline. Conclusions: There is a risk of leptospira infections having a late diagnosis given their unspecific clinical presentation, which generates a high number of differential diagnoses. The early management in the intensive care unit could decrease the incidence of complications and the mortality of patients with leptospirosis.","['Cedano J', 'Rodríguez S', 'Kujundzic W', 'Arana JS', 'Pacheco R', 'Rosso F']",2019,39,s1,Biomedica,"Cedano J, et al.

31529846,Epidemiological characterization of Leptospira spp. infection in working horses and in an occupationally exposed population in six Colombian police stations.,"Introduction: Police working horses are in close contact with their managers and the general population during recreational and patrol activities, which can favor the transmission of leptospirosis among the horses and the occupationally exposed personnel. Objective. To characterize epidemiologically leptospirosis through serology, urine culture and PCR in working horses and in the occupationally exposed population in six police stations in Colombia. Materials and methods. We tested 153 castrated male horses and 123 people in six police stations in the municipalities of Manizales, Pereira, Armenia, Ibagué, Tuluá, and Cali. Three structured formats were applied and blood samples were obtained from people and horses, which were processed with the Macroscopic Agglutination Test, (MAT) for 24 serogroups. Horses were subject to a clinical examination, and urine samples were obtained for urine culture and conventional PCR. Results. The seroprevalence of human Leptospira spp. was 3.25% (n=4) while in horses it was 85% (n=130). Among the horses, serogroups Djasiman and Shermani were the most prevalent. The urine culture was positive in 64.7% (99/153) of the samples, whereas PCR analyzes were negative. A statistically significant association was found between the frequency of exiting the facilities (p=0.009) and the presence of wildlife (p=0.0051) with the infection by serogroup Shermani. Conclusion. The epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in horses suggest an endemic presentation of the infection and its role as reservoirs of the bacteria; however, it is necessary to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease with complementary studies.","['Calderón JC', 'Astudillo M', 'Romero MH']",2019,39,s1,Biomedica,"Calderón JC, et al.

31529307,"Raised levels of Il-6, Il-17a, and Il-22 in fatal leptospirosis.","Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis range from mild, common cold-like illness, to a life-threatening condition. The host immune response has been hypothesized to play a major role in leptospirosis outcome. Increased levels of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, may promote tissue damage that lead to increased disease severity. The question is whether cytokines levels may predict the outcome of leptospirosis and guide patient management. This study aimed to assess the association between Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-related cytokines with the clinical outcome of patients with leptospirosis. Different cytokine levels were measured in fifty-two plasma samples of hospitalized patients diagnosed with leptospirosis in Malaysia (January 2016-December 2017). Patients were divided into two separate categories: survived (n = 40) and fatal outcome (n = 12). Nineteen plasma samples from healthy individuals were obtained as controls. Cytokine quantification was performed using Simple Plex™ assays from ProteinSimple (San Jose, CA, USA). Measurements were done in triplicate and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software and SPSS v20. IL-6 (p = 0.033), IL-17A (p = 0.022), and IL-22 (p = 0.046) were significantly elevated in fatal cases. IL-17A concentration (OR 1.115; 95% CI 1.010-1.231) appeared to be an independent predictor of fatality of leptospirosis. Significantly higher levels of TNF-α (p ≤ 0.0001), IL-6 (p ≤ 0.0001), IL-10 (p ≤ 0.0001), IL-12 (p ≤ 0.0001), IL17A (p ≤ 0.0001), and IL-18 (p ≤ 0.0001) were observed among leptospirosis patients in comparison with healthy controls. Our study shows that certain cytokine levels may serve as possible prognostic biomarkers in leptospirosis patients.","['Wan Yusoff WSY', 'Abdullah M', 'Sekawi Z', 'Amran F', 'Yuhana MY', 'Mohd Taib N', 'Yap IKS', 'Than LTL', 'Md Shah A', 'van Belkum A', 'Amin Nordin S']",2019,38,12,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Wan Yusoff WSY, et al.

31518727,Genital bovine leptospirosis: A new look for an old disease.,"Bovine leptospirosis is often associated with host-adapted leptospires infections, such as strains belonging to the Sejroe serogroup. Although bovine leptospirosis by adapted strains may result in abortions, fetal death, premature births and the birth of weak and/or low-weight calves, this infection is more closely associated with subtler syndromes, such as subfertility and early embryonic death. In this way, this silent disease can go unnoticed and undiagnosed, compromising reproductive efficiency with a consequent decrease in the productivity of herds over long periods. For many years, genital tract infection has been considered a secondary effect of renal infection with the assumption being that leptospires are found in the genital tract due to bacteremia caused by renal colonization. In contrast to this hypothesis, there is some evidence in the literature that suggests that genital leptospirosis should be considered a specific syndrome dissociated from renal/systemic disease. Therefore, this paper aims to gather and critically analyze information about genital leptospirosis in cattle, considering the disease a distinct syndrome, herein denominated bovine genital leptospirosis (BGL), that requires a unique approach to diagnosis and treatment.","['Loureiro AP', 'Lilenbaum W']",2020,141,,Theriogenology,Loureiro AP and Lilenbaum W.

31517138,Sub-internal limiting membrane hemorrhage associated with Weil's disease.,"PURPOSE: Leptospirosis is a rare, typically tropical disease associated with water sources infected with rat urine. Symptoms can range from asymptomatic to a severe, deadly form known as Weil's disease, and ocular manifestations can arise. As global temperatures continue to rise, leptospirosis will become a larger problem worldwide. Here we describe the first case to our knowledge of foveal sub-internal limiting membrane (sub-ILM) hemorrhage due to Weil's disease.
OBSERVATIONS: A 56-year-old female presented with floaters and decreased vision to 20/200 in the right eye after being hospitalized for Weil's disease. Funduscopic examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a foveal sub-ILM hemorrhage in the right eye. The patient was treated with pars-plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane removal and blood aspiration, and her best corrected visual acuity improved to 20/60.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Here we report the first case of sub-ILM hemorrhage following Weil's disease. Patients with leptospirosis and Weil's disease can develop retinal complications and therefore should be followed with fundoscopic eye examination after resolution of systemic symptoms. For those with retinal hemorrhages, OCT evaluation should be used to differentiate sub-hyaloid and sub-ILM hemorrhages.","['Alvarez-Torres E', 'Acaba LA', 'Berrocal MH']",2019,16,,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,"Alvarez-Torres E, et al.

The US soldiers at the military bases in these countries are extremely vulnerable, as most of them are immunologically naïve to the responsible pathogen. No recent sero-epidemiological data of leptospirosis among US Marines stationed in Japan were available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the presence of leptospirosis in US Marines stationed in Japan. One thousand posttour sera samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Leptospira-specific Immunoglobulin G.
RESULTS: Among these 1,000 posttour samples, 85 of them were positive and corresponding pretour samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay also. Seroconversion occurred for 35 (3.5%) Marines during their assignment to Japan. These results also indicate that 50 Marine personnels were exposed to leptospires before their assignment to Japan, perhaps because of previous exposure to leptospires at home.
CONCLUSION: The 5% rate of seroconversion in 2013 and 2014 suggests that leptospirosis is a potential threat for Marines in the endemic region in Japan.","['Chen HW', 'Zhang Z', 'Belinskaya T', 'Williams M', 'Ching WM']",2020,185,Suppl 1,Mil Med,"Chen HW, et al.

31484225,Molecular epidemiology of Leptospira noguchii reveals important insights into a One Health context.,"Leptospirosis presents a complex and dynamic epidemiology. Bovine leptospirosis has been described as a major infectious disease impairing reproductive efficiency. Although infections by Leptospira interrogans, L. santarosai and L. borgpetersenii are frequently reported in cattle, the presence of L. noguchii in these animals should not be neglected. In this study, we describe serological (MAT) and molecular characterization (rrs and secY gene sequencing, multilocus sequence typing [MLST] and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE]) of eight L. noguchii strains obtained from slaughtered cows. Intraspecific genetic diversity was evaluated, and haplotype networks were constructed based on hosts and geographical localizations. Strains were characterized as belonging to serogroups Australis, Autumnalis and Panama, and molecular characterization showed a high heterogeneity of these strains. Ten different STs were found (including nine new STs and 39 novel alleles) as well as nine different pulsotypes. Two clonal complexes were found. Phylogenetic trees based on secY locus and concatenated MLST loci showed two main clusters, with sequences from the present study included in the first. In general, there was no relationship between the geographical origin and the secY phylogenetic clusters, as well as between secY phylogenetic clusters and serogroups. Molecular diversity indexes confirmed a high variability (H > 0.8). This high intraspecific variation observed may be related to differences in virulence, pathogenicity and antigenicity or even adaptability of the strains. In addition, haplotype networks clearly demonstrated the circulation of genotypes between humans and animals, confirming the zoonotic potential. The present study provides relevant data for the study of leptospirosis in the One Health context, where human, animal and environmental health is closely connected.","['Loureiro AP', 'Jaeger LH', 'Di Azevedo MIN', 'Miraglia F', 'Moreno LZ', 'Moreno AM', 'Pestana CP', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Medeiros MA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2020,67,1,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Loureiro AP, et al.

Despite the increasing prevalence of the disease in many tropical countries, its protean clinical presentations make its timely diagnosis challenging. We report the case of a 44-year-old Filipino man presenting with fever, myalgia, behavioural changes and altered sensorium. Neurological examination did not show any focal neurological deficits or clear signs of meningoencephalitis. Lumbar tap, cranial CT scan and cranial MRI were inconclusive. The diagnosis of leptospirosis with acute encephalitis relied heavily on the patient's clinical clues, appropriate exposure history and patterns in ancillary laboratory tests. Empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone was initiated. Seroconversion and fourfold increase in serological antibody titres by leptospirosis microagglutination test later confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was successfully treated, and all neurological complications were reversed.","['Tomacruz ID', 'Sandejas JC', 'Berba R', 'Sacdalan DR']",2019,12,8,BMJ Case Rep,"Tomacruz ID, et al.

31473483,"Waterborne diseases in waste pickers of Estrutural, Brazil, the second largest open-air dumpsite in world.","Brazil was home to the second largest open-air dump in the world, Estrutural, which officially closed in January of 2018; however, many dumpsites throughout the country continue to operate informally. Prior to government-recognized closure, there were about 1200 waste pickers working at the dump. These workers were subject to a myriad of occupational and environmental risks; one primary hazard involved exposure to contaminated water, which significantly affects health and quality of life. As part of the official closure plan for Estrutural, a study was conducted to determine the occurrence of waterborne diseases and rates of intestinal worms among the workers. A convergent parallel mixed methods approach, using a cross-sectional study and semi-structured interviews, sought to uncover answers to these objectives. There were 1025 waste pickers used in this study. Data confirmed waste pickers experienced continuous bouts of waterborne disease cases through episodic diarrhea (24.9%), intestinal worms (12.6%), hepatitis A (1.7%) and leptospirosis (0.7%). People who lived in unregulated areas (favelas) had increased risk of diarrhea (OR = 1.72) and those who did not use filtered water were at increased risk of intestinal worms (OR = 1.87) and diarrhea (OR = 1.5). Qualitative and quantitative data confirmed that many workers suffered from waterborne diseases, and that women were at greater risk than men. These findings highlight unsanitary and poor occupational health conditions for waste pickers at dumpsites, which likely continue despite official dumpsite closures. Moreover, this data provide evidence of supplemental occupational hazards to assess at dumpsites worldwide, especially for women.","['Cruvinel VRN', 'Zolnikov TR', 'Bashash M', 'Marques CP', 'Scott JA']",2019,99,,Waste Manag,"Cruvinel VRN, et al.

31430340,An in silico approach towards identification of novel drug targets in pathogenic species of Leptospira.,"Leptospirosis is one of the leading zoonotic infections worldwide. As with other infectious diseases, report of antimicrobial resistance to existing therapeutic arsenal poses challenges in the management of disease. Hence, identification of novel drug targets for the pathogen deems essential. Present study used combined approach of comparative and subtractive genomics to identify putative drug targets. Crucial genes of 16 pathogenic Leptospira strains were filtered and subjected to homology search via target identification tool ""TiD"". Thereafter, comparative analysis was performed for non-homologous, essential genes to accomplish the broad-spectrum drug target. Consequently, 37 essential genes were found to be conserved in at least 10 strains of Leptospira. Further, prioritization of resultant set of genes revealed 18 were hubs in protein-protein interaction network. Sixteen putative targets among the hub genes were conserved in all strains of Leptospira. Out of sixteen, fourteen were enzymes while 8 were novel and 4 were involved in virulence mechanism. In addition, genome scale metabolic network reconstruction and choke point analysis revealed cobA (porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism) and thiL (thiamine metabolism) as chokepoints in their respective metabolic pathways. The proposed hub genes could act as putative broad-spectrum drug targets for Leptospira species, however, these putative targets should be validated to ensure them as real one prior to utilizing them for target based lead discovery.","['Gupta R', 'Verma R', 'Pradhan D', 'Jain AK', 'Umamaheswari A', 'Rai CS']",2019,14,8,PLoS One,"Gupta R, et al.

31425612,Nucleic acid and antigen detection tests for leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of leptospirosis may contribute to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy and early outbreak recognition. Nucleic acid and antigen detection tests have the potential for early diagnosis of leptospirosis. With this systematic review, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of nucleic acid and antigen detection tests.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic test accuracy of nucleic acid and antigen detection tests for the diagnosis of human symptomatic leptospirosis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and regional databases from inception to 6 July 2018. We did not apply restrictions to language or time of publication.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included diagnostic cross-sectional studies and case-control studies of tests that made use of nucleic acid and antigen detection methods in people suspected of systemic leptospirosis. As reference standards, we considered the microscopic agglutination test alone (which detects antibodies against leptospirosis) or in a composite reference standard with culturing or other serological tests. Studies were excluded when the controls were healthy individuals or when there were insufficient data to calculate sensitivity and specificity.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently extracted data from each study. We used the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2) to assess risk of bias. We calculated study-specific values for sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled the results in a meta-analysis when appropriate. We used the bivariate model for index tests with one positivity threshold, and we used the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model for index tests with multiple positivity thresholds. As possible sources of heterogeneity, we explored: timing of index test, disease prevalence, blood sample type, primers or target genes, and the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) visualisation method. These were added as covariates to the meta-regression models.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 41 studies evaluating nine index tests (conventional PCR (in short: PCR), real-time PCR, nested PCR, PCR performed twice, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), dot-ELISA, immunochromatography-based lateral flow assay, and dipstick assay) with 5981 participants (1834 with and 4147 without leptospirosis). Methodological quality criteria were often not reported, and the risk of bias of the reference standard was generally considered high. The applicability of findings was limited by the frequent use of frozen samples. We conducted meta-analyses for the PCR and the real-time PCR on blood products.The pooled sensitivity of the PCR was 70% (95% CI 37% to 90%) and the pooled specificity was 95% (95% CI 75% to 99%). When studies with a high risk of bias in the reference standard domain were excluded, the pooled sensitivity was 87% (95% CI 44% to 98%) and the pooled specificity was 97% (95% CI 60% to 100%). For the real-time PCR, we estimated a summary receiver operating characteristic curve. To illustrate, a point on the curve with 85% specificity had a sensitivity of 49% (95% CI 30% to 68%). Likewise, at 90% specificity, sensitivity was 40% (95% CI 24% to 59%) and at 95% specificity, sensitivity was 29% (95% CI 15% to 49%). The median specificity of real-time PCR on blood products was 92%. We did not formally compare the diagnostic test accuracy of PCR and real-time PCR, as direct comparison studies were lacking. Three of 15 studies analysing PCR on blood products reported the timing of sample collection in the studies included in the meta-analyses (range 1 to 7 days postonset of symptoms), and nine out of 16 studies analysing real-time PCR on blood products (range 1 to 19 days postonset of symptoms). In PCR studies, specificity was lower in settings with high leptospirosis prevalence. Other investigations of heterogeneity did not identify statistically significant associations. Two studies suggested that PCR and real-time PCR may be more sensitive on blood samples collected early in the disease stage. Results of other index tests were described narratively.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The validity of review findings are limited and should be interpreted with caution. There is a substantial between-study variability in the accuracy of PCR and real-time PCR, as well as a substantial variability in the prevalence of leptospirosis. Consequently, the position of PCR and real-time PCR in the clinical pathway depends on regional considerations such as disease prevalence, factors that are likely to influence accuracy, and downstream consequences of test results. There is insufficient evidence to conclude which of the nucleic acid and antigen detection tests is the most accurate. There is preliminary evidence that PCR and real-time PCR are more sensitive on blood samples collected early in the disease stage, but this needs to be confirmed in future studies.","['Yang B', 'de Vries SG', 'Ahmed A', 'Visser BJ', 'Nagel IM', 'Spijker R', 'Grobusch MP', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Goris MG', 'Leeflang MM']",2019,8,8,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Yang B, et al.

A total of 47 wild rodents, identified as Apodemus agrarius (A. agrarius), were captured from June to August 2016. The seroprevalence of antibodies against bacterial pathogens in A. agrarius sera was analyzed; 17.4% (8/46) were identified as O. tsutsugamushi through indirect immunofluorescence assay and 2.2% (1/46) were identified as Leptospira species through passive hemagglutination assay. Using polymerase chain reaction, the spleen, kidney and blood samples were investigated for the presence of O. tsutsugamushi, A. phagocytophilum, and L. interrogans. Out of the 47 A. agrarius, 19.1% (9/47) were positive for A. phagocytophilum and 6.4% (3/47) were positive for L. interrogans, while none were positive for O. tsutsugamushi. Four out of 46 (8.7%) blood samples, six out of 45 (13.3%) spleen samples, and one out of 47 (2.1%) kidney samples were positive for A. phagocytophilum. Three out of 47 (6.4%) kidney samples were positive for L. interrogans. The sequencing results of PCR positive samples demonstrated > 99% similarity with A. phagocytophilum and L. interrogans sequences. A. phagocytophilum was mostly detected in the spleen, whereas L. interrogans was mostly detected in the kidneys. Notably, A. phagocytophilum and L. interrogans were detected in A. agrarius living in close proximity to humans in the metropolitan suburban areas. The results of this study indicate that rodent-borne bacteria may be present in wild rodents in the metropolitan suburban areas of ROK.","['Bang MS', 'Kim CM', 'Park JW', 'Chung JK', 'Kim DM', 'Yun NR']",2019,14,8,PLoS One,"Bang MS, et al.

31419070,"Occupational swine exposure and Hepatitis E virus, Leptospira, Ascaris suum seropositivity and MRSA colonization in Austrian veterinarians, 2017-2018-A cross-sectional study.","We investigated the prevalence of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), Leptospira and Ascaris suum (A. suum) seropositivity, and of nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization among Austrian practising veterinarians, and assessed the association with occupational swine livestock exposure. The 261 participants completed a questionnaire on demographics, intensity of occupational swine livestock contact and glove use during handling animals and their secretions. Participants' blood samples were tested for HEV, Leptospira and A. suum seropositivity and nasal swabs cultured for MRSA. We compared swine veterinarians (defined as >3 swine livestock visits/week) to non-swine veterinarians (≤3 swine livestock visits/week) with regard to the outcomes through calculating prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Furthermore, the relationship between occupational swine livestock contact and the study outcomes was examined by age (</≥55 years) and glove usage. The prevalence of nasal MRSA colonization was 13.4% (95% CI: 9.3-17.6), of HEV seropositivity 20.8% (95% CI: 15.8-25.7) and A. suum seropositivity 44% (95% CI: 37.7-50.2). The highest anti-leptospiral antibodies titres were 1:200 (L. hebdomadis) and 1:100 (L. autumnalis, L. caicola) found in three non-swine veterinarians. Compared to non-swine veterinarians, swine veterinarians were 1.9 (95% CI: 1.0-3.4) and 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0-2.3) times more likely HEV seropositive and A. suum seropositive, respectively, and 4.8 (95%CI: 2.5; 9.3) times more likely nasally colonized with MRSA. Among glove-using veterinarians, occupational swine contact was no longer a determinant for HEV seropositivity (PR 1.6; 95% CI: 0.8-2.9). Similar was found for A. suum seropositivity, which was no longer associated with occupational swine livestock contact in the subgroup of glove using, ≥55-year-old veterinarians (PR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.4-3.3). Our findings indicate that >3 occupational swine livestock visits per week is associated with HEV and A. suum seropositivity and nasal MRSA colonization and that glove use may play a putative preventive role in acquiring HEV and A. suum. Further analytical epidemiological studies have to prove the causality of these associations.","['Taus K', 'Schmoll F', 'El-Khatib Z', 'Auer H', 'Holzmann H', 'Aberle S', 'Pekard-Amenitsch S', 'Monschein S', 'Sattler T', 'Steinparzer R', 'Allerberger F', 'Schmid D']",2019,66,7,Zoonoses Public Health,"Taus K, et al.

31401957,Mechanistic dose-response modelling of animal challenge data shows that intact skin is a crucial barrier to leptospiral infection.,"Leptospirosis is a widespread and potentially life-threatening zoonotic disease caused by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira. Humans become infected primarily via contact with environmental reservoirs contaminated by the urine of shedding mammalian hosts. Populations in high transmission settings, such as urban slums and subsistence farming communities, are exposed to low doses of Leptospira on a daily basis. Under these conditions, numerous factors determine whether infection occurs, including the route of exposure and inoculum dose. Skin wounds and abrasions are risk factors for leptospirosis, but it is not known whether broken skin is necessary for spillover, or if low-dose exposures to intact skin and mucous membranes can also cause infection. To establish a quantitative relationship between dose, route and probability of infection, we performed challenge experiments in hamsters and rats, developed mechanistic dose-response models representing the spatial dynamics of within-host infection and persistence, and fitted models to experimental data. Results show intact skin is a strong barrier against infection, and that broken skin is the predominant route by which low-dose environmental exposures cause infection. These results identify skin integrity as a bottleneck to spillover of Leptospira and underscore the importance of barrier interventions in the prevention of leptospirosis. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.","['Gostic KM', 'Wunder EA', 'Bisht V', 'Hamond C', 'Julian TR', 'Ko AI', 'Lloyd-Smith JO']",2019,374,1782,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Gostic KM, et al.

31398190,Leptospira infection in rats: A literature review of global prevalence and distribution.,"BACKGROUND: The role of rodents in Leptospira epidemiology and transmission is well known worldwide. Rats are known to carry different pathogenic serovars of Leptospira spp. capable of causing disease in humans and animals. Wild rats (Rattus spp.), especially the Norway/brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the black rat (R. rattus), are the most important sources of Leptospira infection, as they are abundant in urban and peridomestic environments. In this study, we compiled and summarized available data in the literature on global prevalence of Leptospira exposure and infection in rats, as well as compared the global distribution of Leptospira spp. in rats with respect to prevalence, geographic location, method of detection, diversity of serogroups/serovars, and species of rat.
METHODS: We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed without restrictions on publication date as well as Google Scholar to manually search for other relevant articles. Abstracts were included if they described data pertaining to Leptospira spp. in rats (Rattus spp.) from any geographic region around the world, including reviews. The data extracted from the articles selected included the author(s), year of publication, geographic location, method(s) of detection used, species of rat(s), sample size, prevalence of Leptospira spp. (overall and within each rat species), and information on species, serogroups, and/or serovars of Leptospira spp. detected.
FINDINGS: A thorough search on PubMed retrieved 303 titles. After screening the articles for duplicates and inclusion/exclusion criteria, as well as manual inclusion of relevant articles, 145 articles were included in this review. Leptospira prevalence in rats varied considerably based on geographic location, with some reporting zero prevalence in countries such as Madagascar, Tanzania, and the Faroe Islands, and others reporting as high as >80% prevalence in studies done in Brazil, India, and the Philippines. The top five countries that were reported based on number of articles include India (n = 13), Malaysia (n = 9), Brazil (n = 8), Thailand (n = 7), and France (n = 6). Methods of detecting or isolating Leptospira spp. also varied among studies. Studies among different Rattus species reported a higher Leptospira prevalence in R. norvegicus. The serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae was the most prevalent serovar reported in Rattus spp. worldwide. Additionally, this literature review provided evidence for Leptospira infection in laboratory rodent colonies within controlled environments, implicating the zoonotic potential to laboratory animal caretakers.
CONCLUSIONS: Reports on global distribution of Leptospira infection in rats varies widely, with considerably high prevalence reported in many countries. This literature review emphasizes the need for enhanced surveillance programs using standardized methods for assessing Leptospira exposure or infection in rats. This review also demonstrated several weaknesses to the current methods of reporting the prevalence of Leptospira spp. in rats worldwide. As such, this necessitates a call for standardized protocols for the testing and reporting of such studies, especially pertaining to the diagnostic methods used. A deeper understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of Leptospira spp. in rats in urban environments is warranted. It is also pertinent for rat control programs to be proposed in conjunction with increased efforts for public awareness and education regarding leptospirosis transmission and prevention.","['Boey K', 'Shiokawa K', 'Rajeev S']",2019,13,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Boey K, et al.

31397270,Burden and etiopathogenesis of acute kidney injury in the tropics.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is prevalent and is associated with high morbidity and mortality globally. The epidemiology differs remarkably between developing and developed economies. Infections, diarrheal illnesses, obstetric causes and nephrotoxins are very rampant in the tropics. Even though the etiologies are different, the final common pathway in the pathogenesis is similar - tubular damage or necrosis, tubular blockage, and back leak of glomerular filtrate. The mechanism of AKI in infections could be through ischemic insult consequent to hypovolemia and/or hemoglobinuria, as seen in malaria and viral hemorrhagic fevers, interstitial inflammation, or nephrotoxicity. On the contrary, the mechanism of nephrotoxin-induced AKI includes direct toxic effect on the renal tubules, intratubular precipitation of substances like djenkolic and oxalic acids (crystalluria) as well as intratubular obstruction and AKI. Toxicity could also be indirect by interacting with the pharmacokinetic profile of other coadministered medications. Bites and envenomation as well as obstetric complications also induce AKI through hypovolemia, interstitial nephritis, and other unclear mechanisms in eclampsia and preeclampsia. Outcome is variable and dependent on etiology. Prognosis appears to be significantly better in hypovolemic or prerenal and/or obstructive AKI compared to intrarenal or intrinsic AKI.","['Arogundade FA', 'Omotoso BA', 'Sanusi AA', 'Balogun RA']",2020,93,1,Clin Nephrol,"Arogundade FA, et al.

To determine if common abortifacient bovid infectious diseases are involved, a serological investigation was conducted. Sera was collected from stored and fresh cattle (n = 390) and buffalo (n = 130) samples from 2016-18 from, and then examined for associations in a retrospective risk factor study of 71 herds. The sera were assayed for antibodies to Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo and Brucella abortus using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. These pathogens were detected in buffalo samples at 78.5% (95% CI 71.4-85.6), 0%, 2.3% (95% CI 0-4.9) and 0%, respectively, and in cattle at 4.4% (95% CI 2.4-6.4), 7.7% (95% CI 3.1-12.3), 12.8% (95% CI 9.5-16.1) and 0.26% (95% CI 0-0.8), respectively. Exposure of buffalo to N. caninum was positively associated with buffalo age, with a predicted seropositivity at birth of 52.8%, increasing to 97.2% by 12 years of age (p = 0.037). Exposure of cattle to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo was more prevalent in females compared to males, was associated with higher titres of BVDV, and was more prevalent in the wet season compared to the dry season. Exposure of cattle to BVDV was more prevalent in males compared to females, the wet and dry seasons were comparable, and was associated with rising antibody titres against N. caninum and L. interrogans serovar Hardjo. The risk factor survey identified that the probability of herds being N. caninum positive increased with farmer age, if farmers believed there were rodents on farm, and if farmers weren't aware that canids or rodents could contaminate bovid feed on their farm. The probability of a herd being positive to L. interrogans serovar Hardjo increased on farms where multiple cows shared the same bull, where farmers had lower husbandry knowledge, and on farms that used water troughs. The probability of a herd being BVDV seropositive increased with increasing herd size and increasing titres to N. caninum. The benchmarking of bovid exposure to emerging abortifacient pathogens and identification of their risk factors potentially informs disease prevention strategies, supporting efforts to establish a biosecure beef supply for enhanced smallholder livestock productivity, public health and food security in Laos and surrounding countries.","['Olmo L', 'Reichel MP', 'Nampanya S', 'Khounsy S', 'Wahl LC', 'Clark BA', 'Thomson PC', 'Windsor PA', 'Bush RD']",2019,14,8,PLoS One,"Olmo L, et al.

Actually, common clinical forms are neglected in outpatient medicine and the performance of available diagnostic tests is limited, especially when they are performed in severe, potentially life-threatening forms. In these cases of sepsis or even septic shock, the antibiotic treatment is most often empirical although fortunately adapted thanks to the large sensitivity of the spirochete.","['Peerboom S', 'Senterre JM', 'Potier JP']",2019,74,7-8,Rev Med Liege,"Peerboom S, et al.

31342664,Spatial distribution and spread potential of sixteen Leptospira serovars in a subtropical region of Brazil.,"Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that represents a major problem in animal and public health due to its high prevalence and widespread distribution. This zoonotic disease is most prevalent in tropical environments where conditions favour pathogen survival. The ecological preferences of Leptospira serovars are poorly understood, limiting our knowledge of where and when outbreaks can occur, which may result in misinformed prevention and control plans. While the disease can occur consistently in time and space in tropical regions, research on the ecology of leptospirosis remains limited in subtropical regions. This research gap regarding Leptospira ecology brings public and veterinary health problems, impacting local economies. To fill this gap of knowledge, we suggest to assess geographic and ecological features among Leptospira serovars in a subtropical area of Brazil where leptospirosis is endemic to (a) highlight environmental conditions that facilitate or limit Leptospira spread and survival and (b) reconstruct its geographic distribution. An ecological niche modelling framework was used to characterize and compare Leptospira serovars in both geographic and environmental space. Our results show that despite the geographic overlap exhibited by the different serovars assessed, we found ecological divergence among their occupied ecological niches. Ecological divergences were expressed as ranges of potential distributions and environmental conditions found suitably by serovar, Sejroe being the most asymmetric (<0.15). Most important predictors for the potential distribution of most serovars were soil pH (31.7%) and landscape temperature (24.2%). Identification of environmental preferences will allow epidemiologists to better infer the presence of a serovar based on the environmental characteristics of regions rather than inferences based solely on historical epidemiological records. Including geographic and ecological ranges of serovars also may help to forecast transmission potential of Leptospira in public health and the food animal practice.","['Jara M', 'Escobar LE', 'Rodriges RO', 'Frias-De-Diego A', 'Sanhueza J', 'Machado G']",2019,66,6,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Jara M, et al.

Using the non-linear canonical correlation (NCC) method, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between thirteen epidemiological risk factors and seropositivity to five zoonotic infections (anthrax, Q fever, tularemia, leptospirosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF]) among Georgian military recruits during 2014-2016. According to this multivariate statistical technique, which is suitable for the analysis of two or more sets of qualitative variables simultaneously, two canonical variables were identified. These variables accounted for 68% of the variation between the two sets of categorical variables (""risk factors"" and ""zoonotic infections""). For the first canonical variable, there was a relationship among CCHF (canonical loading, which is interpreted in the same way as the Pearson's correlation coefficient, [cl] = 0.715), tick bites (cl = 0.418) and slaughter of animals (cl = 0.351). As for the second canonical variable, Q fever (cl = -0.604) and leptospirosis (cl = -0.486) were related to rodents inside and outside home (cl = -0.346) and sweeping in or around home (cl = -0.317).

Although neutrophils are a key component of early immune responses to infection, they have been associated with tissue damage and inflammation in some febrile infections. To assess whether neutrophils contribute to the pathogenesis observed in severe leptospirosis, we quantitated levels of neutrophil activation markers in patients with varying disease severities. Hospitalized leptospirosis patients had significantly higher levels of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4, respectively) on peripheral neutrophils than healthy controls, with the highest levels detected in patients with organ dysfunction. We observed no significant differences in other neutrophil baseline activation markers (CD62L and CD11b) or activation capacity (CD62L and CD11b levels following stimulation), regardless of disease severity. Our results provide preliminary evidence supporting the hypothesis that higher initial bacterial loads or inadequate or delayed neutrophil responses, rather than TLR-driven inflammation, may drive severe disease outcomes.","['Lindow JC', 'Tsay AJ', 'Montgomery RR', 'Reis EAG', 'Wunder EA', 'Araújo G', 'Nery NRR', 'Mohanty S', 'Shaw AC', 'Lee PJ', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI']",2019,101,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Lindow JC, et al.

Postmortal findings are similar and, without additional diagnostic methods, an accurate aetiological diagnosis is difficult to achieve. In order to investigate causes of lethal IHA in Croatian dogs, we performed a retrospective study on archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (FFPEB) from dogs that died due to haemolytic crisis, using microscopic and molecular diagnostic tools to determine the aetiological cause of disease. Molecular analysis was performed on kidney, lung, myocardium and spleen on FFPEB from all dogs. The originally stated aetiological diagnosis of B. canis or leptospirosis was confirmed in only 53% of the dogs. PCR and sequencing revealed that, in addition to the expected pathogens, B. canis and Leptospira interrogans, the presence of previously undiagnosed ""new"" pathogens causing anaemia including Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Furthermore, Theileria capreoli was detected for the first time in a dog with postmortal descriptions of lesions. Intensive extravascular hemolysis was noticeable as jaundice of the mucosa, subcutis and fat tissue, green or yellow discoloration of renal parenchyma caused by bilirubin excretion in the renal tubules and bile accumulation within the liver in 90% of the dogs.

Recombinant antigens represent a promising alternative. LigAni, LigBrep, and LipL32 proteins have been shown to promote a protective immune response against the homologous challenge in hamsters. Therefore, the next step is to evaluate the immunological properties of these immunogens in the actual hosts, as ruminants, which has never been performed before. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immunogenicity and potential adverse effects of the recombinant proteins LigAni, LigBrep, and LipL32 in the ovine model. For this, 16 Santa Inês sheep were allocated into three groups: two experimental (Groups A and B) and one control group (Group C). Group A was inoculated with a formulation containing the recombinant proteins in combination with the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant; Group B was inoculated with a formulation containing the recombinant proteins in combination with the Montanide adjuvant; and Group C was inoculated with adjuvants only. The results revealed that formulations containing the recombinant proteins induced total IgG seroconversion and led to a significant increase in antibody titers in the sheep model. Besides, there were no clinical changes or adverse effects. Thus, LigAni, LigBrep, and LipL32 proteins elicited a significant humoral immune response with elevated serum IgG levels, demonstrating that they possess the immunogenic and safety characteristics necessary to sustain their potential use as leptospirosis vaccines in the ruminant model.","['da Rosa MC', 'Martins G', 'Rocha BR', 'Correia L', 'Ferronato G', 'Lilenbaum W', 'Dellagostin OA']",2019,65,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"da Rosa MC, et al.

31283768,Development of multiplex PCR for neglected infectious diseases.,"Scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis are widely neglected infectious diseases caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia typhi, and pathogenic Leptospira spp., respectively. Patients usually present with non-specific symptoms and therefore are commonly diagnosed with acute undifferentiated febrile illness. Consequently, patients face delayed treatment and increased mortality. Antibody-based serological test currently used as gold standard has limitations due to insufficient antibody titers, especially in the early phase of infection. In this study, we aimed to develop multiplex PCR to combine 3 primer pairs that target specific genes encoding 56-kDa TSA of O. tsutsugamushi, 17-kDa antigen of R. typhi, and LipL32 of L. Interrogans and evaluate its performance in comparison to the standard serological tests. Using EDTA blood samples of known patients, the sensitivity and specificity of our multiplex PCR was 100% and 70%, respectively. In addition, the assay was able to diagnose the co-infection of scrub typhus and leptospirosis. The assay may be useful in identifying causative agents during the early phase of these diseases, enabling prompt and appropriate treatment.","['Sea-Liang N', 'Sereemaspun A', 'Patarakul K', 'Gaywee J', 'Rodkvamtook W', 'Srisawat N', 'Wacharaplusadee S', 'Hemachudha T']",2019,13,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Sea-Liang N, et al.

31278217,Investigation of Risk Factors Associated with Leptospirosis in the North of Iran (2011-2017).,"BACKGROUND: The risk factors for infection with leptospirosis in Iran have never been studied. We aimed to determine the risk factors of leptospirosis and the epidemiological pattern of this disease in Golestan Province, Iran during 2011-2017.
STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study.
METHODS: This case-control study was performed on the population of patients diagnosed with leptospirosis. Controls were selected from the residents of Golestan province, northern Iran and were matched with the cases for gender, age group, and place of residence. After coding the data collected in checklists, the analysis was performed in SPSS using independent t-test, logistic regression, contingency tables, and Fisher exact test.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven cases were diagnosed infected with leptospirosis. Most patients were male (69.0%) and residents of rural areas (82.7%). The three leading risk factors for leptospirosis were exposure to stagnant rice paddy water while having a skin scratch/injury (OR=11.21, 95% CI: 3.02, 43.06), washing the face with stagnant rice paddy water (OR=11.33, 95% CI: 5.12, 25.01), and sighting of rats or rat nest in rice paddies (OR=3.30, 95% CI: 1.01, 11.62).
CONCLUSION: For farmers working in stagnant and muddy waters of rice paddies, occupational protection measures such as wearing waterproof boots, gloves, support, and socks can reduce the chance of infection with leptospirosis. Health education of the people with susceptible occupations about the transmission and prevention methods can also play a key role in controlling this disease.","['Sahneh E', 'Delpisheh A', 'Sayehmiri K', 'Khodabakhshi B', 'Moafi-Madani M']",2019,19,2,J Res Health Sci,"Sahneh E, et al.

31272417,Diversity of infectious aetiologies of acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses in south and Southeast Asia: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) is caused by a multitude of diverse pathogens, with significant morbidity and mortality in the developing world. The objective of this review was to characterise the diversity and relative importance of common infectious aetiologies of AUFI in South and Southeast Asia.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify common aetiologies of AUFI in Asian countries. Four medical and life sciences databases including PubMed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from January 1998 to March 2019.
RESULTS: Forty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Among AUFI cases, viral aetiologies at 18.5% (14888) were more common than bacterial aetiologies (12.9% [10384]). From 80,554 cases, dengue fever was the most common aetiology (11.8%, 9511), followed by leptospirosis (4.4%, 3549), typhoid (4.0%, 3258), scrub typhus (4.0%, 3243) and influenza other than H1N1 (3.1%, 2514). In both adults and children: dengue fever was the leading cause of AUFI with 16.6% (1928) and 18.7% (1281) of the total cases. In admitted patients, dengue fever was the main cause of AUFI at 16.4% (2377), however leptospirosis at 13.9% (2090) was the main cause of AUFI for outpatients. In South Asia, dengue fever was the main cause of AUFI, causing 12.0% (6821) of cases, whereas in Southeast Asia, leptospirosis was the main diagnosis, causing 12.1% (2861) of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study the most common causes of AUFI were viral, followed by bacterial and protozoal (malaria) infections. Dengue was the commonest virus that caused AUFI while leptospirosis and typhoid were important bacterial infectious causes. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain a sound epidemiological knowledge of AUFI so that evidence-based diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines can be developed.","['Wangdi K', 'Kasturiaratchi K', 'Nery SV', 'Lau CL', 'Gray DJ', 'Clements ACA']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Wangdi K, et al.

31250522,Bovine leptospirosis in abattoirs in Uganda: Molecular detection and risk of exposure among workers.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease reported worldwide. In Uganda, seropositivity has been reported in both humans and domesticated animals, including cattle. However, it remains unknown whether cattle are shedding leptospires and thus acting as potential source for human leptospirosis. We conducted this cross-sectional study in two cattle abattoirs in Kampala, Uganda between June and July 2017. Kidney and urine samples from 500 cattle sourced from across the country were analysed by real-time PCR to establish the prevalence of Leptospira-positive cattle and risk of exposure to abattoir workers. The species of infecting Leptospira was determined by amplification of secY gene and compared to reference sequences published in GenBank. Of 500 cattle tested, 36 (7.2%) had Leptospira DNA in their kidneys (carriers), 29 (5.8%) in their urine (shedders); with an overall prevalence (kidney and/or urine) of 8.8%. Leptospira borgpetersenii was confirmed as the infecting species in three cattle and Leptospira kirschneri in one animal. Male versus female cattle (OR = 3, p-value 0.003), exotic versus local breeds (OR = 21.3, p-value 0.002) or cattle from Western Uganda (OR = 4.4, p-value 0.001) and from regions across the border (OR = 3.3, p-value 0.032) versus from the central region were more likely to be Leptospira-positive. The daily risk of exposure of abattoir workers to ≥1 (kidney and/or urine) positive carcass ranged from 27% (95% credibility interval 18.6-52.3) to 100% (95% CI 91.0-100.0), with halal butchers and pluck inspectors being at highest risk. In conclusion, cattle slaughtered at abattoirs in Uganda carry and shed pathogenic Leptospira species; and this may pose occupation-related risk of exposure among workers in these abattoirs, with workers who handle larger numbers of animals being at higher risk.","['Alinaitwe L', 'Kankya C', 'Allan KJ', 'Rodriguez-Campos S', 'Torgerson P', 'Dreyfus A']",2019,66,6,Zoonoses Public Health,"Alinaitwe L, et al.

31233503,"Genetic characteristics of pathogenic Leptospira in wild small animals and livestock in Jiangxi Province, China, 2002-2015.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is one of the most important neglected tropical bacterial diseases worldwide. However, there is limited information on the genetic diversity and host selectivity of pathogenic Leptospira in wild small mammal populations.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Jiangxi Province, located in southern China, is a region highly endemic for leptospirosis. In this study, among a total of 3,531 trapped rodents dominated by Apodemus agrarius (59.7%), 330 Leptospira strains were successfully isolated from six different sites in Jiangxi between 2002 and 2015. Adding 71 local strains from humans, various kinds of livestock and wild animals in Jiangxi, a total of 401 epidemic strains were characterized using 16S rRNA gene senquencing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Among them, the most prevalent serogroup was Icterohaemorrhagiae (61.10%), followed by Javanica (19.20%) and Australis (9.73%); the remaining five serogroups, Canicola, Autumnalis, Grippotyphosa, Hebdomadis and Pomona, accounted for 9.97%. Species identification revealed that 325 were L. interrogans and 76 were L. borgpetersenii. Moreover, L. interrogans was the only pathogenic species in Fuliang and Shanggao and was predominant in Shangrao (95.0%); L. borgpetersenii was the most common in the remaining three sites. Twenty-one sequence types (STs) were identified. Similarly, ST1 and serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae were most prevalent in Shangrao (86.0% and 86.4%) and Fuliang (90.4% and 90.4%), ST143 and serogroup Javanica in Shangyou (88.5% and 90.4%) and Longnan (73.1% and 73.1%), and ST105 and serogroup Australis in Shanggao (46.3% and 56.1%). Serogroup Icterohaemorhagiae primarily linked to A. agrarius (86.9%), serogroup Canicola to dogs (83.3%). There were significant differences in the distribution of leptospiral species/serogroups/STs prevalence across host species/collected locations among the 394 animal-associated strains (Fisher's exact test, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrated high genetic diversity of pathogenic Leptospira strains from wild small animals in Jiangxi from 2002 to 2015. A. agrarius was the most abundantly trapped animal reservoir, and serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae and ST1 were the most dominant in Jiangxi. Significant geographic variation and host diversity in the distribution of dominant species, STs and serogroups were observed. Moreover, rat-to-human transmission might play a crucial role in the circulation of Leptospirosis in Jiangxi. Details of the serological and molecular characteristics circulating in this region will be essential in implementing prevention and intervention measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission in China. However, phylogenetic analysis of more Leptospira isolates should explore the impact of ecological change on leptospirosis transmission dynamics and investigate how such new knowledge might better impact environmental monitoring for disease control and prevention at a public health level.","['Zhang C', 'Xu J', 'Zhang T', 'Qiu H', 'Li Z', 'Zhang E', 'Li S', 'Chang YF', 'Guo X', 'Jiang X', 'Zhu Y']",2019,13,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zhang C, et al.

31220434,"First record of Leptospira and Blastocystis infections in captive flying squirrels (Trogopterus xanthipes) from Enshi County, China.","In traditional Chinese medicine, the feces of flying squirrels have long been used to promote blood circulation and relieve bodily stasis. However, the excrement of flying squirrels may harbor zoonotic agents that could be hazardous to public health. To understand the occurrence of bacterial and parasitic infections in this species, we investigated selected zoonotic pathogens including Leptospira and Blastocystis in the urine and feces of flying squirrels in China. Urine and fecal samples from flying squirrels were collected from a family-owned flying squirrel farm located in Enshi County, Hubei Province in China. Leptospira and Blastocystis DNA was extracted from the urine and feces of flying squirrels, and used as targets for PCR amplification, using different specific primers. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing showed that 4.4% (3/69) of flying squirrels were positive for Leptospira, while 30.4% (21/69) of the animals were positive for Blastocystis. Notably, 1.4% (1/69) of flying squirrels were found to be co-infected with Leptospira and Blastocystis. Sequence analyses allowed for the detection of 3 Blastocystis subtypes (ST1, ST3 and ST13), and mixed infections of Blastocystis subtype 1 and subtype 3 were found in 4.4% (3/69) of flying squirrels. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rrs2), the flagellin B gene (flaB), and outer membrane lipoprotein lipL32 gene (LipL32) sequences indicated that the Leptospira species detected in the study was L. interrogans. We concluded that flying squirrels from central China were infected with Leptospira and Blastocystis, suggesting that these animals can be a source of infection for their owners, and using fresh excrement from this animal as traditional medicine could be risky to human health. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Leptospira and Blastocystis infection in flying squirrels from Enshi County, China.

However, yellow fever virus (YFV) is the only pathogen under surveillance in Sierra Leone owing to the undeveloped medical and public health system there. Most of the results of YFV identification are negative. Elucidation of the pathogen spectrum is required to reduce the prevalence of febrile jaundice.
METHODS: In the present study, we used Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing to profile the pathogen spectrum in archived YFV-negative sera from 96 patients in Sierra Leone who presented with unexplained febrile jaundice.
RESULTS: The most frequently identified sequencing reads belonged to the following pathogens: cytomegalovirus (89.58%), Epstein-Barr virus (55.21%), hepatitis C virus (34.38%), rhinovirus (28.13%), hepatitis A virus (20.83%), coxsackievirus (10.42%), Ebola virus (8.33%), hepatitis E virus (8.33%), lyssavirus (4.17%), leptospirosis (4.17%), chikungunya virus (2.08%), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (1.04%), and hepatitis B virus (1.04%).

31203048,"Climate variability, satellite-derived physical environmental data and human leptospirosis: A retrospective ecological study in China.","BACKGROUND: In the past three decades, the incidence rate of notified leptospirosis cases in China have steeply declined and are now circumscribed to discrete areas in the country. Previous research showed that climate and environmental variation may play an important role in leptospirosis transmission. However, quantitative associations between climate, environmental factors and leptospirosis in the high-risk areas in China, is still poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the temporal effects of climate and remotely-sensed physical environmental factors on human leptospirosis in the high-risk counties in China.
METHODS: Time series seasonal decomposition was performed to explore the seasonality pattern of leptospirosis incidence in Mengla County, Yunnan and Yilong County, Sichuan for the period 2006-2016. Time series cross-correlation analysis was carried out to examine lagged effects of rainfall, relative humidity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and land surface temperature (LST) on leptospirosis. The associations of climatic and physical environment factors with leptospirosis in each county were assessed by using a generalized linear regression model with negative binomial link, adjusted by seasonal components.
RESULTS: Leptospirosis incidence in both counties showed strong and unique annual seasonality. Our results show that in Mengla County leptospirosis notifications exhibits a bi-modal temporal pattern while in Yilong County it follows a typical single epidemic curve. After adjusting for seasonality, the final best-fitting model for Mengla County indicated that leptospirosis notifications were significantly associated with present LST values (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 0.857, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.729-0.929) and rainfall at a lag of 6-months (IRR = 0.989; 95% CI: 0.985-0.993). The incidence of leptospirosis in Yilong was associated with rainfall at 1-month lag (IRR = 1.013, 95% CI: 1.003-1.023), LST (3-months lag) (IRR = 1.193, 95% CI: 1.095-1.301), and MNDWI (5-months lag) (IRR = 7.960, 95% CI: 1.241-47.66).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified lagged effects between leptospirosis incidence and climate and remotely-sensed environmental factors in the two most endemic counties in China. Rainfall in combination with satellite derived physical environment factors provided better insight of the local epidemiology as well as good predictors for leptospirosis outbreak in both counties. This would also be an avenue for the development of leptospirosis early warning systems to support leptospirosis control in China.","['Dhewantara PW', 'Hu W', 'Zhang W', 'Yin WW', 'Ding F', 'Mamun AA', 'Soares Magalhães RJ']",2019,176,,Environ Res,"Dhewantara PW, et al.

31186193,Adjuvanted leptospiral vaccines: Challenges and future development of new leptospirosis vaccines.,"Leptospirosis is a neglected infectious disease of global importance. Vaccination is the most viable strategy for the control of leptospirosis, but in spite of efforts for the development of an effective vaccine against the disease, few advances have been made, and to date, bacterin is the only option for prevention of leptospirosis. Bacterins are formulations based on inactivated leptospires that present a series of drawbacks, such as serovar-dependence and short-term immunity. Therefore, bacterins are not widely used in humans, and only Cuba, France and China have these vaccines licensed for at-risk populations. The development of recombinant DNA technology emerges as an alternative to solve the problem. Recombinant protein-based vaccines or DNA vaccines seem to be an attractive strategy, but the use of adjuvants is critical for achievement of a protective immune response. Adjuvants are capable of enhancing and/or modulating immune responses by exposing antigens to antigen-presenting cells. In the last years, several components have been tested as adjuvants, such as aluminum salts, oil based-emulsion adjuvants, bacteria-derived components and liposomes. This review highlights the use of adjuvants in the multiple vaccine approaches that have been used for leptospirosis and their most important immunological aspects. Immune response data generated by these strategies can contribute to the understanding of the immune mechanisms involved in protection against leptospirosis, and consequently, the development of effective vaccines against this disease. This is the first review on leptospiral vaccines focusing on adjuvant aspects.","['Teixeira AF', 'Fernandes LGV', 'Cavenague MF', 'Takahashi MB', 'Santos JC', 'Passalia FJ', 'Daroz BB', 'Kochi LT', 'Vieira ML', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2019,37,30,Vaccine,"Teixeira AF, et al.

(Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) species complex, including the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, have been isolated from ticks, vertebrate reservoirs and humans. Previous analyses based on direct molecular detection in ticks indicated a considerable diversity of B. burgdorferi s.l. complex in Serbia. The present study aimed (a) to isolate borrelia strains from Serbia; (b) to determine their genotypic characteristics; and (c) to establish a collection of viable B. burgdorferi s.l. strains for further biological, ecological and genetic studies. For the present study, 231 adult Ixodes ricinus (Ixodida: Ixodidae) ticks from 16 ecologically different localities in Serbia were individually processed to cultivate B. burgdorferi s.l. This led to the isolation of 36 strains.

33597405,Serological survey of Leptospirosis in high-risk rangers and wild animals from ex-situ captive centers.,"Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira that infect both human and animals. This study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among rangers and wild animals in two ex-situ captive centers, Bukit Merah Orangutan Island (BMOUI) and Taiping Zoo, Perak and to identify the risk factors responsible for the leptospiral seropositivity. Blood samples from rangers and animals of BMOUI and Taiping Zoo were taken to determine the presence of antibodies against Leptospira through microscopic agglutination test (MAT) using 21 serovars of Leptospira commonly found in Malaysia as antigens. Structured surveys in identifying risk factors were given to each ranger from both study sites. It was observed that Rattus exulans (1/10) (10.0%), Rattus rattus (1/5) (20.0%), Niniventer fulvescens (1/1) (100.0%), Callosciurus notatus (0/6) (0.0%), Tupaia tana (1/1) (100.0%), Pongo pygmaeus (5/10) (50.0%) and BMOUI rangers (8/18) (44.4%) were positive for leptospiral antibodies. Samples obtained from Taiping Zoo also revealed the presence of leptospiral antibodies in R. rattus (0/19) (0.0%), R. exulans (1/2) (50.0%) and rangers (2/5) (40.0%).

31150391,Leptospirosis in sugarcane plantation and fishing communities in Kagera northwestern Tanzania.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease of worldwide importance, though relatively neglected in many African countries including sub Saharan Africa that is among areas with high burden of this disease. The disease is often mistaken for other febrile illnesses such as dengue, malaria, rickettsioses and enteric fever. Leptospirosis is an occupational disease likely to affect people working in environments prone to infestation with rodents which are the primary reservoir hosts of this disease. Some of the populations at risk include: sugarcane plantation workers, wetland farmers, fishermen and abattoir workers. In this study we investigated the prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira among sugarcane plantation and factory workers, fishing communities as well as among rodents and shrews in domestic and peridomestic environments within the study areas.
METHODS: The study was conducted in Kagera region, northwestern Tanzania and it involved sugarcane plantation workers (cutters and weeders), sugar factory workers and the fishing community at Kagera Sugar Company in Missenyi district and Musira island in Lake Victoria, Kagera, respectively. Blood was collected from consenting human adults, and from rodents and shrews (insectivores) captured live using Sherman traps. Serological detection of leptospiral antibodies in blood serum was carried out by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).
RESULTS: A total of 455 participants were recruited from the sugarcane plantation (n = 401) and fishing community (n = 54) while 31 rodents and shrews were captured. The overall prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira in human was 15.8%. Sugarcane cutters had higher seroprevalence than other sugar factory workers. Prevalent antibodies against Leptospira serovars in humans were against serovars Lora (6.8%), Sokoine (5.3%), Pomona (2.4%), Hebdomadis (1.1%) and Kenya (0.2%). Detected leptospiral serovars in reservoir hosts were Sokoine (12.5%) and Grippotyphosa (4.2%). Serovar Sokoine was detected both in humans and small mammals.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is a public health threat affecting populations at risk, such as sugarcane plantation workers and fishing communities. Public awareness targeting risk occupational groups is much needed for mitigation of leptospirosis in the study areas and other vulnerable populations in Tanzania and elsewhere.","['Mgode GF', 'Japhary MM', 'Mhamphi GG', 'Kiwelu I', 'Athaide I', ""Machang'u RS""]",2019,13,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Mgode GF, et al.

31141558,Risk factors for human leptospirosis following flooding: A meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Leptospirosis is probably the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world especially in tropical countries. There has been an increase in individual studies, which assessed the frequency of leptospirosis in flood conditions. Some studies showed contact with floods was significantly associated with the occurrence of leptospirosis while other studies reported differently. The objective of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on the risk factors which are associated with human leptospirosis following flooding. We set up the inclusion criteria and searched for the original studies, addressing leptospirosis in human with related to flood in health-related electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Ovid Medline, google scholar and Scopus sources. We used the terms 'leptospirosis', 'flood', 'risk factor' and terms from the categories were connected with ""OR"" within each category and by ""AND"" between categories. The initial search yielded 557 citations. After the title and abstract screening, 49 full-text papers were reviewed and a final of 18 observational studies met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled estimates of 14 studies showed that the contact with flooding was a significant factor for the occurrence of leptospirosis (pooled OR: 2.19, 95%CI: 1.48-3.24, I2:86%). On stratification, the strength of association was greater in the case-control studies (pooled OR: 4.01, 95%CI: 1.26-12.72, I2:82%) than other designs (pooled OR:1.77,95%CI:1.18-2.65, I2:87%). Three factors such as 'being male'(pooled OR:2.06, 95%CI:1.29-2.83), the exposure to livestock animals (pooled OR: 1.95, 95%CI:1.26-2.64), the lacerated wound (pooled OR:4.35, 95%CI:3.07-5.64) were the risk factors significantly associated with the incidence of leptospirosis following flooding in the absence of within-study heterogeneity (I2: 0%). We acknowledge study limitations such as publication bias and type 2 statistical errors. We recommended flood control and other environmental modifications that are expected to reduce the risk of leptospiral infection, and a multi-sectoral effort to this aspect would have long-term benefits.","['Naing C', 'Reid SA', 'Aye SN', 'Htet NH', 'Ambu S']",2019,14,5,PLoS One,"Naing C, et al.

31138261,Liver function assessment using indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate in a young male with icteric leptospirosis: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is one of the leading global zoonotic causes of morbidity and mortality. It is induced by a pathogenic spirochete of the genus Leptospira. The icteric form of leptospirosis is characterized by pronounced hyperbilirubinemia and associated with significantly increased mortality. Conventional static liver function tests insufficiently assess hepatic damage and have limited prognostic value. Dynamic tests, such as indocyanine green plasma (ICG) clearance, more adequately reflect hepatic functional status. In this case report we describe the ICG plasma disappearance rates (ICG-PDR) in a patient with leptospirosis and massive hyperbilirubinemia, expanding our knowledge of liver dysfunction in icteric leptospirosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old Caucasian man presented with acute-onset jaundice, myalgia, fever and headaches. Laboratory tests upon admission revealed, most notably, acute kidney failure and hyperbilirubinemia of 17 mg/dl with mild elevation of aminotransferases. In the course of the following 4 days, total serum bilirubin increased to 54 mg/dl. The clinical outcome was favorable with intravenous ceftriaxone and doxycycline. Presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis was later confirmed by PCR-based amplification of leptospiral DNA in the blood. ICG-PDR values, bilirubin as well as aminotransferases were recorded throughout hospitalization and a 3-month follow-up period. Initially dramatically reduced ICG-PDR (2.0%/min, normal range: 18-25%/min) rapidly normalized within 10 days, while bilirubin remained elevated up to week 7. Mild elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase was at its peak of 124 U/l by day 12 and reached close to normal levels by week 7 upon admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Markedly diminished ICG-PDR values presented in this case report suggest severe liver function impairment in the acute phase of icteric leptospirosis. Prolonged elevation of serum bilirubin may not adequately reflect recovery of liver injury in this disease. ICG clearance appears to be a promising marker for the detection of hepatic dysfunction and recovery in icteric leptospirosis in addition to the static tests.","['Kunikowska AJ', 'Wildgruber M', 'Schulte-Frohlinde E', 'Lahmer T', 'Schmid RM', 'Huber W']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Kunikowska AJ, et al.

31124020,Microhabitat Factors Influenced the Prevalence of Pathogenic Leptospira spp. in Small Mammal Host.,"Leptospirosis, a widespread zoonotic disease, is a public health problem, especially in major urban centres, and is mainly reported to be associated with rats. In Malaysia, focus has been primarily given to the Leptospira prevalence in rodents per se, but there is lack of information on the microhabitat structure of the outbreak areas. We aimed to determine the diversity of small mammal species, microhabitat types, and their prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in the outbreak areas, which were categorized as urban, semi-urban, and recreational forests. Sampling involved deploying 100 to 300 live traps at each study site. Kidney samples were extracted from selected individuals, for screening of pathogenic Leptospira spp. by PCR. Out of 537 individuals from 15 small mammal species captured, 4 species were recorded from urban, 13 from semi-urban, and 11 from recreational forest sites. From 389 individuals screened, 58 were tested positive for pathogenic Leptospira. Recreational forests recorded the highest prevalence with 19.4% (n = 93), followed by urban, 16.6% (n = 163) and semi-urban sites with 9.8% (n = 133). Seven rodent species were tested positive for pathogenic Leptospira from all areas. R. norvegicus was found to harbour the highest prevalence (66.7%) in urban, R. rattus (53.8%) in semi-urban, whereby M. whiteheadi (44.4%) in recreational forest sites. Microhabitat analysis revealed that rubbish quantity contributed especially strongly to a high prevalence of Leptospira. This study contributes to understanding of the host and microhabitat preferences of Leptospira, which is important in controlling the spread of this disease in human's landscapes.","['Yusof MA', 'Mohd-Taib FS', 'Ishak SN', 'Md-Nor S', 'Md-Sah SA', 'Mohamed NZ', 'Azhari NN', 'Neela V', 'Sekawi Z']",2019,16,2,Ecohealth,"Yusof MA, et al.

31120895,Revisiting the taxonomy and evolution of pathogenicity of the genus Leptospira through the prism of genomics.,"The causative agents of leptospirosis are responsible for an emerging zoonotic disease worldwide. One of the major routes of transmission for leptospirosis is the natural environment contaminated with the urine of a wide range of reservoir animals. Soils and surface waters also host a high diversity of non-pathogenic Leptospira and species for which the virulence status is not clearly established. The genus Leptospira is currently divided into 35 species classified into three phylogenetic clusters, which supposedly correlate with the virulence of the bacteria. In this study, a total of 90 Leptospira strains isolated from different environments worldwide including Japan, Malaysia, New Caledonia, Algeria, mainland France, and the island of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean were sequenced. A comparison of average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of genomes of the 90 isolates and representative genomes of known species revealed 30 new Leptospira species. These data also supported the existence of two clades and 4 subclades. To avoid classification that strongly implies assumption on the virulence status of the lineages, we called them P1, P2, S1, S2. One of these subclades has not yet been described and is composed of Leptospira idonii and 4 novel species that are phylogenetically related to the saprophytes. We then investigated genome diversity and evolutionary relationships among members of the genus Leptospira by studying the pangenome and core gene sets. Our data enable the identification of genome features, genes and domains that are important for each subclade, thereby laying the foundation for refining the classification of this complex bacterial genus. We also shed light on atypical genomic features of a group of species that includes the species often associated with human infection, suggesting a specific and ongoing evolution of this group of species that will require more attention. In conclusion, we have uncovered a massive species diversity and revealed a novel subclade in environmental samples collected worldwide and we have redefined the classification of species in the genus. The implication of several new potentially infectious Leptospira species for human and animal health remains to be determined but our data also provide new insights into the emergence of virulence in the pathogenic species.","['Vincent AT', 'Schiettekatte O', 'Goarant C', 'Neela VK', 'Bernet E', 'Thibeaux R', 'Ismail N', 'Mohd Khalid MKN', 'Amran F', 'Masuzawa T', 'Nakao R', 'Amara Korba A', 'Bourhy P', 'Veyrier FJ', 'Picardeau M']",2019,13,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Vincent AT, et al.

31117995,"Leptospirosis and its prevention: knowledge, attitude and practice of urban community in Selangor, Malaysia.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is still endemic in Malaysia and has been prevalent in Selangor where cases have been underreported. Primarily, this was due to lack of awareness in the urban community in this region. This study determined the knowledge, attitude and preventive practice (KAP) of leptospirosis, and identified the significant predictors influencing KAP among urban community in Hulu Langat, Selangor.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 2015 to 2017 using validated questionnaire. Sampling methods included multistage cluster sampling, followed by simple random sampling to obtain 315 respondents. Descriptive analysis was performed to determine the KAP while χ
RESULTS: Respondents were mainly Malaysian Bumiputra with a mean (Standard Deviation (SD)) age of 32.5 (13.0) years. Of 315 respondents, 80.3% (n = 253) had poor knowledge, 87.0% (n = 274) had good attitude, and 81.3% (n = 256) showed unacceptable practice towards leptospirosis and its prevention. Regression analysis identified age as the sole predictor influencing good knowledge (AOR 2.388; 95% CI = 1.298, 4.396; p = 0.005). Education level (AOR 2.197; 95% CI = 1.109, 4.352; p = 0.024) was also noted as the significant predictor influencing the overall practice.
CONCLUSIONS: The urban community in Selangor showed a positive attitude in waste management despite having little knowledge regarding the disease itself. The study also discovered inadequacy in preventive practice, hence marking the importance of the proper integration of knowledge and attitude into forming an acceptable practice to reduce transmission of Leptospira among urban population in Malaysia.","['Abdullah NM', 'Mohammad WMZW', 'Shafei MN', 'Sukeri S', 'Idris Z', 'Arifin WN', 'Nozmi N', 'Saudi SNS', 'Samsudin S', 'Zainudin AW', 'Hamat RA', 'Ibrahim R', 'Masri SN', 'Saliluddin SM', 'Daud A', 'Osman M', 'Jamaluddin TZMT']",2019,19,1,BMC Public Health,"Abdullah NM, et al.

31116784,Molecular detection of Leptospira spp. in rats as early spatial predictor for human disease in an endemic urban area.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is considered a neglected zoonosis associated with infrastructure problems and low socioeconomic status, particularly slums. Since the disease is mainly transmitted in urban settings by rat urine, this risk factor may be important predictor tool for prompt control and effective prevention at the local level in urban endemic areas. Accordingly, the present study aimed to propose an early spatial predictor tool for human leptospirosis in urban settings, to test the methodology of molecular methods for assessing Leptospira spp. in trapped rats, and report associated environmental data.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Official city records and previous study were used to select risk factors for human leptospirosis in an endemic neighborhood of Curitiba, Brazil. Neighborhood census sectors were divided in high- and low-risk areas using 12 selected factors: flood area, water supply, water course, green coverage, afforestation, sewage network, open sewage, open garbage, garbage collection, dumpster, pavement, and rodent complaints. In addition, rats were captured in pre-determined sites from January through March 2017, euthanized, and individual kidneys samples sent for molecular diagnosis. Human cases were obtained from official city records. In total, 95/112 (84.8%) census sectors were classified as low-risk to human leptospirosis. No significant statistical differences were found in human case frequencies between high and low-risk areas. Kidney samples from 17/25 (68.0%) trapped rats were positive for Leptospira spp. The main risk factors associated with rodent presence included inadequate water supply (p = 0.04), sanitary sewage (p = 0.04), unpaved streets (p = 0.04), and complaint of rodents (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study offers a new approach to score leptospirosis transmission risk, and to compare small areas and their heterogeneity in the same census sector of endemic areas. Environmental risk factors for Leptospira spp. transmission within the neighborhood were mainly due to differences in infrastructure and basic services. To the author's knowledge, this is the first study using Leptospira spp. in rats as predictor for human disease in an urban setting of a major city. Although the number of rats trapped was low, this methodology may be used as basis for early and effective interventions, focused on high risk areas for leptospirosis prior to human cases, and potentially reducing morbidity and mortality in low-income areas of urban settings.","['Pellizzaro M', 'Martins CM', 'Yamakawa AC', 'Ferraz DDC', 'Morikawa VM', 'Ferreira F', 'Santos APD', 'Biondo AW', 'Langoni H']",2019,14,5,PLoS One,"Pellizzaro M, et al.

31113404,Sequel and therapeutic modalities of leptospirosis associated severe pulmonary haemorrhagic syndrome (SPHS); a Sri Lankan experience.,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of leptospirosis-associated severe pulmonary hemorrhagic syndrome (SPHS) with high case fatality has been reported from many countries. Understanding of clinical disease and sequel of SPHS needs larger studies with adequate numbers. The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics and sequel by different therapeutic approaches for SPHS in Leptospirosis in Sri Lanka.
METHODS: This study was conducted at Teaching Hospital-Karapitiya (THK), Galle, Sri Lanka from June 2015 to December 2017. THK is the main tertiary care center for the Southern Province. All confirmed-cases of leptospirosis who presented during this period and were admitted to five medical units of THK were included in this study. SPHS was defined as a patient presenting; haemoptysis, arterial hypoxemia (Acute Lung Injury Score < 2.5), haemoglobin drop (10% from the previous value), or diffused alveolar shadows in the chest radiograph, without alternative explanation other than leptospirosis.
RESULTS: Of the 128 MAT confirmed cases of leptospirosis, 111 (86.7%) had acute kidney injury (AKI) whilst SPHS was seen in 80 (62.5%). Patients typically developed SPHS within the first week of illness, mostly on days 4 and 5. The case fatality rate of this study sample was 28.1% (n = 36), while for patients with SPHS, it was 41.5%. Most of the deaths (n = 19) were within the first 3 days of admission (on the same day 8, and within next 48 h 11). Among SPHS patients, 59 received therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). The survival rate was higher (n = 35, 74.5%) when the TPE was performed within the first 48 h of detecting SPHS compared to patients in whom the procedure was done after 48 h (n = 5, 54.5%). Of the 19 leptosprosis patients with SPHS who did not receive TPE, 17 died (89.5%). However, the group of patients who received TPE was primarily the patients survived beyond day 3.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed that during the study period, SPHS was common and the mortality rate was higher in the study area. The treatment modalities tested need further evaluation and confirmation.","['Herath N', 'Uluwattage W', 'Weliwitiya T', 'Karunanayake L', 'Lekamwasam S', 'Ratnatunga N', 'Karunanayake P', 'Wickramasinghe S', 'Patabendi S', 'Senaviratne S', 'Agampodi S']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Herath N, et al.

31107928,Innate immune memory through TLR2 and NOD2 contributes to the control of Leptospira interrogans infection.,"Leptospira interrogans are pathogenic spirochetes responsible for leptospirosis, a worldwide reemerging zoonosis. Many Leptospira serovars have been described, and prophylaxis using inactivated bacteria provides only short-term serovar-specific protection. Therefore, alternative approaches to limit severe leptospirosis in humans and morbidity in cattle would be welcome. Innate immune cells, including macrophages, play a key role in fighting infection and pathogen clearance. Recently, it has been shown that functional reprograming of innate immune cells through the activation of pattern recognition receptors leads to enhanced nonspecific antimicrobial responses upon a subsequent microbial encounter. This mechanism is known as trained immunity or innate immune memory. We have previously shown that oral treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum confers a beneficial effect against acute leptospirosis. Here, using a macrophage depletion protocol and live imaging in mice, we established the role of peritoneal macrophages in limiting the initial dissemination of leptospires. We further showed that intraperitoneal priming of mice with CL429, a TLR2 and NOD2 agonist known to mimic the modulatory effect of Lactobacillus, alleviated acute leptospiral infection. The CL429 treatment was characterized as a training effect since i.) it was linked to peritoneal macrophages that produced ex vivo more pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines against 3 different pathogenic serovars of Leptospira, independently of the presence of B and T cells, ii.) it had systemic effects on splenic cells and bone marrow derived macrophages, and iii.) it was sustained for 3 months. Importantly, trained macrophages produced more nitric oxide, a potent antimicrobial compound, which has not been previously linked to trained immunity. Accordingly, trained macrophages better restrict leptospiral survival. Finally, we could use CL429 to train ex vivo human monocytes that produced more cytokines upon leptospiral stimulation. In conclusion, host-directed treatment using a TLR2/NOD2 agonist could be envisioned as a novel prophylactic strategy against acute leptospirosis.","['Santecchia I', 'Vernel-Pauillac F', 'Rasid O', 'Quintin J', 'Gomes-Solecki M', 'Boneca IG', 'Werts C']",2019,15,5,PLoS Pathog,"Santecchia I, et al.

31107872,The prevalence of Leptospira among invasive small mammals on Puerto Rican cattle farms.,"Leptospirosis, an emerging infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira, is thought to be the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world. A first step in preventing the spread of Leptospira is delineating the animal reservoirs that maintain and disperse the bacteria. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods targeting the LipL32 gene were used to analyze kidney samples from 124 House mice (Mus musculus), 94 Black rats (Rattus rattus), 5 Norway rats (R. norvegicus), and 89 small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) from five cattle farms in Puerto Rico. Renal carriage of Leptospira was found in 38% of the sampled individuals, with 59% of the sampled mice, 34% of Black rats, 20% of Norway rats, and 13% of the mongooses. A heterogeneous distribution of prevalence was also found among sites, with the highest prevalence of Leptospira-positive samples at 52% and the lowest at 30%. Comparative sequence analysis of the LipL32 gene from positive samples revealed the presence of two species of Leptospira, L. borgpetersenii and L. interrogans in mice, detected in similar percentages in samples from four farms, while samples from the fifth farm almost exclusively harbored L. interrogans. In rats, both Leptospira species were found, while mongooses only harbored L. interrogans. Numbers tested for both animals, however, were too small (n = 7 each) to relate prevalence of Leptospira species to location. Significant associations of Leptospira prevalence with anthropogenic landscape features were observed at farms in Naguabo and Sabana Grande, where infected individuals were closer to human dwellings, milking barns, and ponds than were uninfected individuals. These results show that rural areas of Puerto Rico are in need of management and longitudinal surveillance of Leptospira in order to prevent continued infection of focal susceptible species (i.e. humans and cattle).","['Benavidez KM', 'Guerra T', 'Torres M', 'Rodriguez D', 'Veech JA', 'Hahn D', 'Miller RJ', 'Soltero FV', 'Ramírez AEP', 'Perez de León A', 'Castro-Arellano I']",2019,13,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Benavidez KM, et al.

31100812,Environmental and Behavioral Risk Factors for Severe Leptospirosis in Thailand.,"A nationwide prevention and control campaign for leptospirosis in Thailand has led to a decreased incidence rate, but the mortality and case fatality rates have remained stable. Regarding the limited knowledge of risk factors, a case-control study of the association between environmental and behavioral exposure with severe leptospirosis was implemented to identify the risk factors among adults in Thailand. The study was conducted in 12 hospital-based sites. Hospitalized patients with suspected clinical symptoms of leptospirosis were tested for leptospirosis by culture, loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), real-time PCR, and the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). All participants answered a standardized questionnaire about potential risk factors. Risk factors were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Of the 44 confirmed cases, 33 (75.0%) presented with severe illness, as determined by clinical criteria, and were categorized as severe cases. Non-severe cases were defined as patients with non-severe symptoms of leptospirosis. Living nearby a rubber tree plantation (adjusted OR 11.65, 95% CI 1.08-125.53) and bathing in natural bodies of water (adjusted OR 10.45, 95% CI 1.17-93.35) were both significantly associated with an increased risk of severe leptospirosis. We recommend designating rubber plantations in Thailand as high-risk zones and closely monitoring hospitalized patients in those areas.","['Hinjoy S', 'Kongyu S', 'Doung-Ngern P', 'Doungchawee G', 'Colombe SD', 'Tsukayama R', 'Suwancharoen D']",2019,4,2,Trop Med Infect Dis,"Hinjoy S, et al.

31099522,Spatial and statistical analysis of leptospirosis in Thailand from 2013 to 2015.,"This study analyzes the temporal pattern and spatial clustering of leptospirosis, a disease recognized as an emerging public health problem in Thailand. The majority of those infected are farmers and fishermen. Severe epidemics of leptospirosis in association with the rainy reason have occurred since 1996. Still, an understanding of the annual variation and spatial clustering of the disease is lacking. Data were collected from the Center of Epidemiological Information, Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, covering the nationwide incidence of leptospirosis during the period 2013-2015. Clustering techniques, including local indicators of spatial association and local Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, were used for the analysis and evaluation of the annual spatial distribution of the disease. Both these statistics revealed similar results for the areas with the highest clustering patterns of leptospirosis. Specifically, there were persisting hotspots in north-eastern and southern parts of Thailand over the three years covered by the study. This outcome suggests that healthcare resources should be allocated to the areas characterized by leptospirosis clustering.","['Luenam A', 'Puttanapong N']",2019,14,1,Geospat Health,Luenam A and Puttanapong N.

Considering the increasing number of cases of this disease in the northern part of Iran, identifying areas characterized by high disease incidence risk can help policy-makers develop strategies to prevent its further spread. This study presents an approach for generating predictive risk maps of leptospirosis using spatial statistics, environmental variables and machine learning. Moran's I demonstrated that the distribution of leptospirosis cases in the study area in Iran was highly clustered. Pearson's correlation analysis was conducted to examine the type and strength of relationships between climate and topographical factors and incidence of the disease. To handle the complex and nonlinear problems involved, machine learning based on the support vector machine classification algorithm and multilayer perceptron neural network was exploited to generate annual and monthly predictive risk maps of leptospirosis distribution. Performance of both models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve and Kappa coefficient. The output results demonstrated that both models are adequate for the prediction of the probability of leptospirosis incidence.","['Ahangarcani M', 'Farnaghi M', 'Shirzadi MR', 'Pilesjö P', 'Mansourian A']",2019,14,1,Geospat Health,"Ahangarcani M, et al.

31093111,[First report on Leptospira interrogans in the sigmodontine rodent Scapteromys aquaticusPrimeiro relato da presença de Leptospira interrogans em roedores sigmodontíneos Scapteromys aquaticus].,"Leptospirosis is a globally distributed zoonosis that can be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with the urine or tissues of infected animals. In Argentina, leptospirosis is endemic in the province of Santa Fe and epidemic outbreaks occur during floods. However, very little is known about the role that wild rodents play in the spread of the disease in Argentina. The objective of this study was to identify the host species of pathogenic Leptospira among rodents in a riverine settlement in the province of Santa Fe.We conducted a trapping session in October 2015. Kidneys of the captured animals were analyzed by real-time PCR for the LipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira. Animals that were positive were subjected to microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and molecular typing by amplification of the 16S rRNA gene and two multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes.A total of 37 rodents of the species Akodon azarae, Cavia aperea, Oligoryzomys flavescens, Rattus rattus, and Scapteromys aquaticus were captured. Real-time PCR found one male Scapteromys aquaticus that was positive. The serum of this individual and of the rest of the S. aquaticus captured (n = 18) were analyzed by MAT and were non-reactive for the 10 serovars tested.

31068145,Acute pancreatitis and vasoplegic shock associated with leptospirosis - a case report and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis or Weil's disease is caused by pathogenic spirochete bacteria called Leptospira. It is considered the most common zoonosis in the world and is usually transmitted by urine of rodents and dogs with an incubation time of 7-14 days. The clinical spectrum ranges from a subclinical infection to a fulminant septic course.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report the case of a German patient with acute pancreatitis associated with Leptospira interrogans causing fulminant septic shock. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics and left the hospital fully recovered after 18 days.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of leptospirosis with acute pancreatitis as the leading clinical manifestation in Central Europe. Serologic and molecular genetic tests for leptospirosis should be considered, if no other causes for pancreatitis can be identified.","['Maier A', 'Kaeser R', 'Thimme R', 'Boettler T']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Maier A, et al.

31064736,[Vaccinovigilance: Reported adverse reactions of immunological veterinary medicinal products in 2018].,"The registration of adverse events after the use of immunological veterinary medicinal products (VMP) is the aim of the vaccinovigilance reporting system in Switzerland. Adverse events comprise suspected adverse reactions and lack of expected efficacy. Since the Institute of virology and immunology (IVI) is the competent authority for the regulation of immunological VMP in Switzerland, the reporting system is administrated by the IVI. In 2018, 162 reports concerning authorized immunological VMP were received. While most of the reports were submitted by the marketing authorization holders (79%), practicing veterinary surgeons contributed to the reporting system, too (18%). Five reports were submitted by private persons (3%). Dogs were mainly affected (43%) with several terrier breeds and chihuahuas being the most frequently reported dog breeds. Further reports were related to cats (16%), cattle (14%) and horses (14%). Recently, the numbers of reports concerning cats (+26) and horses (+23) have considerably increased after there had been clearly less reports concerning these species (11 and 5, respectively) in the previous year. Most of the reports were based on the application of combined vaccines against canine distemper, hepatitis, parvovirosis and parainfluenza with or without leptospirosis in dogs as well as cat flu and feline panleukopenia in cats. In 29.6% of the submitted cases, the causality assessment between the vaccination and the reaction described was evaluated probable.","['Rogger P', 'Herrmann N', 'Ottiger H']",2019,161,5,Schweiz Arch Tierheilkd,"Rogger P, et al.

31047864,Detection of pathogenic leptospires in the urine of domesticated elephants in Sri Lanka.,"Leptospirosis is a globally common zoonotic infectious disease in humans and animals. This disease is caused by pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. The pathogen is able to survive in mammalian kidneys after infection and is excreted in urine intermittently. Pathogenic leptospires infect humans either by direct contact with infected animal urine or through contaminated soil or water. In Sri Lanka, some studies have demonstrated the involvement of animals, such as livestock species and peridomestic rats, in the transmission of leptospirosis to humans. However, none of the previous studies focused on domesticated elephants, which are in close contact with humans during cultural and religious events and bathe in rivers together with humans. If domesticated elephants act as carriers of pathogenic leptospires, it could be a major public health issue in the country. In this study, 13 healthy domesticated elephants were subjected to leptospiral DNA detection from urine samples collected on three consecutive days. Four elephants (31%) were confirmed to shed pathogenic leptospires in their urine. DNA sequencing followed by phylogenetic distance measurements revealed that all positive elephants were infected with L. interrogans. This study reveals the possibility that elephants act as a source of infection of leptospires to humans and recommends the screening of all domesticated elephants that are in close contact with humans for the shedding of pathogenic leptospires.","['Athapattu TPJ', 'Fernando BR', 'Koizumi N', 'Gamage CD']",2019,195,,Acta Trop,"Athapattu TPJ, et al.

31029530,Plasma proteome profiling reveals differentially expressed lipopolysaccharide-binding protein among leptospirosis patients.,"BACKGROUND: Human leptospirosis, or commonly known as ""rat urine disease"" is a zoonotic disease that is caused by the bacteria called Leptospira sp. The incidence rate of leptospirosis has been under-reported due to its unspecific clinical symptoms and the limitations of current laboratory diagnostic methods. Leptospirosis can be effectively treated with antibiotics in the early stage, and it is a curable disease but the accuracy to diagnose the infection is rarely achieved.
METHODS: The present pilot study investigated plasma protein profiles of leptospirosis patients and compared them against two control groups which consisted of dengue patients and healthy individuals. The plasma protein digests were analyzed using shotgun approach by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Protein abundances were estimated from the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) values. Plasma proteins in leptospirosis patients with at least two-fold differential expression compared to dengue and healthy control groups (p < 0.05, ANOVA) were identified.
RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) was found to be the only protein that has significant different expression between leptospirosis and the two control groups. The expression levels of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG1) and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) were different significantly between leptospirosis and healthy group but not to the dengue control group.
CONCLUSION: This is the first plasma proteome-based study on leptospirosis that reports the differential expression of LBP compared to both dengue and healthy controls, which has not been previously reported in the context of leptospirosis.","['Fish-Low CY', 'Than LTL', 'Ling KH', 'Lin Q', 'Sekawi Z']",2020,53,1,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Fish-Low CY, et al.

Leptospira can infects domestic and wild animals. Spheniscus magellanicus belong to the order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae, and are colonial birds. These seabirds live in temperate waters along the Atlantic shores of South America, and their total population has been estimated to be 1,300,000 breeding pairs. Magdalena Island (Chile) hosts an important breeding colony but, over recent decades, a marked decline in the number of birds has been seen. The objective of this study was to determine occurrences of antibodies against T. gondii and Leptospira spp. in penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) on Magdalena Island, from where no previous data on these agents were available. Serum samples were collected from 132 penguins on Magdalena Island. Antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii were detected using the modified agglutination test (Titer ≥20), and anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies were detected using the microscopic agglutination test (Titer ≥100). T. gondii antibodies were detected in 57 (43.18%) of the 132 serum samples, with titers that ranged from 20 to 320. None of the penguins in this study was reactive to anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies.

31024059,Environmental DNA metabarcoding to detect pathogenic Leptospira and associated organisms in leptospirosis-endemic areas of Japan.,"Leptospires, which cause the zoonotic disease leptospirosis, persist in soil and aqueous environments. Several factors, including rainfall, the presence of reservoir animals, and various abiotic and biotic components interact to influence leptospiral survival, persistence, and pathogenicity in the environment. However, how these factors modulate the risk of infection is poorly understood. Here we developed an approach using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for detecting the microbiome, vertebrates, and pathogenic Leptospira in aquatic samples. Specifically, we combined 4 sets of primers to generate PCR products for high-throughput sequencing of multiple amplicons through next-generation sequencing. Using our method to analyze the eDNA of leptospirosis-endemic areas in northern Okinawa, Japan, we found that the microbiota in each river shifted over time. Operating taxonomic units corresponding to pathogenic L. alstonii, L. kmetyi, and L. interrogans were detected in association with 12 nonpathogenic bacterial species. In addition, the frequencies of 11 of these species correlated with the amount of rainfall. Furthermore, 10 vertebrate species, including Sus scrofa, Pteropus dasymallus, and Cynops ensicauda, showed high correlation with leptospiral eDNA detection. Our eDNA metabarcoding method is a powerful tool for understanding the environmental phase of Leptospira and predicting human infection risk.","['Sato Y', 'Mizuyama M', 'Sato M', 'Minamoto T', 'Kimura R', 'Toma C']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Sato Y, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed.
RESULTS: C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.","['Buser FC', 'Schweighauser A', 'Im Hof-Gut M', 'Bigler B', 'Marti E', 'Mirkovitch J', 'Francey T']",2019,60,8,J Small Anim Pract,"Buser FC, et al.

30995815,Systematic Review of Important Bacterial Zoonoses in Africa in the Last Decade in Light of the 'One Health' Concept.,"Zoonoses present a major public health threat and are estimated to account for a substantial part of the infectious disease burden in low-income countries. The severity of zoonotic diseases is compounded by factors such as poverty, living in close contact with livestock and wildlife, immunosuppression as well as coinfection with other diseases. The interconnections between humans, animals and the environment are essential to understand the spread and subsequent containment of zoonoses. We searched three scientific databases for articles relevant to the epidemiology of bacterial zoonoses/zoonotic bacterial pathogens, including disease prevalence and control measures in humans and multiple animal species, in various African countries within the period from 2008 to 2018. The review identified 1966 articles, of which 58 studies in 29 countries met the quality criteria for data extraction. The prevalence of brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever ranged from 0-40%, 1.1-24% and 0.9-28.2%, respectively, depending on geographical location and even higher in suspected outbreak cases. Risk factors for human zoonotic infection included exposure to livestock and animal slaughters. Dietary factors linked with seropositivity were found to include consumption of raw milk and locally fermented milk products. It was found that zoonoses such as leptospirosis, brucellosis, Q fever and rickettsiosis among others are frequently under/misdiagnosed in febrile patients seeking treatment at healthcare centres, leading to overdiagnoses of more familiar febrile conditions such as malaria and typhoid fever. The interactions at the human-animal interface contribute substantially to zoonotic infections. Seroprevalence of the various zoonoses varies by geographic location and species. There is a need to build laboratory capacity and effective surveillance processes for timely and effective detection and control of zoonoses in Africa. A multifaceted 'One Health' approach to tackle zoonoses is critical in the fight against zoonotic diseases.

This disease is caused by a Leptospira infection. Leptospira is found in rats and other animals that can contaminate soil and water resources. This research aimed to (1) study the perceptions and preventive measures taken to control leptospirosis among local populations and (2) to detect Leptospira in rats and natural surface water.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in both villages with and without case histories of leptospirosis. The research procedures were divided into 2 parts. First, the perceptions and preventive measures for leptospirosis used data from 108 sampled subjects that were recruited in May 2015. Second, the rats and surface water samples were collected. DNA was extracted from collected samples and then specific genes specific to Leptospira were detected using PCR technique.
RESULTS: The awareness of leptospirosis of samples in two villages was at high level with the same percentage being at 91.6%. However, the preventive behaviors to leptospirosis of participants from both villages were found to be at only the moderate level. Leptospira detection in rats and surface water used a PCR technique. There was no Leptospira found in any of the 270 rat samples and 100 surface water samples taken from both villages.
CONCLUSION: Regardless, perception and preventive behaviors for dealing with leptospirosis should be continuously encouraged even when its presence is not detected.

The risk is increased by the taste of urban populations for outdoor activities and by their ignorance of the risks associated with wild and domestic animals. In addition, current climate changes are accompanied by an increase in the incidence of certain zoonoses already present and with a risk of emergence of zoonoses still unknown in France.

We decided to study anti-Leptospira antibodies in the sera of dairy workers, rice laborers, veterinarians, suburban slum dwellers and garbage recyclers. Our aims were to estimate the seroprevalence of infection by Leptospira spp. in these people at risk, the relative importance of the known risk factors associated with infection, and the impact of human infections in each setting. Groups at risk were identified and 35 visits to their locations were made, conducting field surveys and exchange talks for information and education. Simple epidemiological questionnaires were administered and sera samples were taken from 308 persons. The microagglutination Technique (MAT) and the IgM Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) assay were employed to detect antibodies. Environmental water samples, canine and equine sera were also examined. More than 45% of human sera were reactive and the studied groups were confirmed to be widely exposed to infection. Female sera were frequently reactive, though most illnesses occur in men, and the most severe cases in elderly males; the emergence and evolution of the disease may strongly depend on the host condition and functions. Animal contact and unsafe water usage were the main identified risk factors to be considered in prevention. Fifty per cent of the studied horses showed a positive MAT reaction.

30976519,Recreational 'mud fever': Leptospira interrogans induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in a U.S. Navy seaman following 'mud-run' in Hawaii.,"A 23-year-old man with a viral-like prodrome developed sudden severe dyspnea and was found to have renal failure, anemia, shock, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring emergent endotracheal intubation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Travel and exposure history from peripheral sources revealed that the patient had participated in a 'mud-run' in Hawaii two weeks prior to symptom onset. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with leptospirosis and treated with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. He was discharged on hospital day 13 with full recovery. Leptospirosis is associated with exposure to water, soil, or other matter contaminated with urine of carrier animals. It has been associated with a multitude of activities over time; most recently recreational water-based activities including 'mud-runs' in endemic areas have been added to the list of routes of exposure. This case underscores the importance of obtaining a thorough epidemiological exposure and travel history and being aware of areas of endemicity for life-threatening infections. Additionally, to our knowledge this is the second case of a patient in the United States treated with ECMO for leptospirosis induced pulmonary hemorrhage.","['Schmalzle SA', 'Tabatabai A', 'Mazzeffi M', 'Matta A', 'Hollis A', 'Zubrow M', 'Rajagopal K', 'Thom K', 'Scalea T']",2019,15,,IDCases,"Schmalzle SA, et al.

30973158,Treatment of Hydropsical Conditions Using Transcervical Gradual Fetal Fluid Drainage in Mares With or Without Concurrent Abdominal Wall Disease.,"Hydropsical conditions are exceedingly rare in the horse. However, when they occur, they are true emergencies due to the severe enlargement of the pregnant uterus, which can result in clinical signs, such as an enlarged round abdomen, dyspnea, reluctance to walk, and colic, and may lead to the development of abdominal wall disease. The pathogenesis of hydropsical conditions is not fully elucidated, but they have been associated with placentitis and fetal abnormalities. This report describes six cases of hydropsical conditions in mares with or without concurrent abdominal wall disease. Five out of six cases were hydrallantois, and of these five, two mares had abdominal wall disease; the remaining one out of six cases was hydramnios. All mares were treated by termination of the pregnancy through gradual fluid drainage transcervically over a number of hours, and their fetuses were delivered vaginally. All fetuses were euthanized immediately after vaginal delivery. Of the six mares, two had signs of placentitis, two were confirmed seropositive for leptospirosis, and two were euthanized (one because of a vaginal tear that communicated through the peritoneum and one mare that developed abdominal wall rupture and laminitis). The remaining 4 mares were available for follow-up; three mares were not rebred, and one mare became an embryo donor, with a successful embryo recovery. We reported the prevalence of leptospira involvement in two out of six cases of hydrallantois and also described the clinical outcome of the mares after treatment with slow fetal fluid drainage.","['Diel de Amorim M', 'Chenier TS', 'Card C', 'Back B', 'McClure JT', 'Hanna P']",2018,64,,J Equine Vet Sci,"Diel de Amorim M, et al.

30971317,Acute kidney injury management using intermittent low efficiency haemodiafiltration in a critical care unit: 39 dogs (2012-2015).,"BACKGROUND: Veterinary studies describing acute kidney injury (AKI) management using renal replacement therapy (RRT) are limited and have primarily focused on intermittent haemodialysis in North American populations. European data are lacking, although differences in populations, pathogen and toxin exposure and RRT modalities may exist between Europe and North America. The present study reviewed RRT-managed cases from the intensive care unit (ICU) of VetAgro Sup, Lyon, France, for the period 2012-2015. The aims were to describe a 4-h RRT protocol of intermittent low efficiency haemodiafiltration, population characteristics and outcomes in canine AKI cases requiring RRT and to identify prognostic variables. We defined DeltaCreat/h as the difference between the serum creatinine level after RRT treatment N and that before treatment N + 1 divided by the time between treatments (in hours).
RESULTS: Thirty-nine dogs were included, and 67% were males. The median (range) age, weight, hospitalization length and number of RRT treatments were 4.4 (0.25-15) years, 26.6 (6.7-69) kg, 8 (1-23) days and 3 (1-8) treatments, respectively. The main AKI causes were leptospirosis (74.4%) and nephrotoxins (15.4%). Age (4.0 vs 5.4 years; P = 0.04), admission urine output (0.5 mL/kg/h vs 0 mL/kg/h; P = 0.02) and hospitalization length (10 vs 4 days; P < 0.001) differed between survivors and non-survivors. Hospitalization length [odds ratio (OR) = 0.4], number of treatments (OR = 5.1), serum potassium level on day 2 (OR = 1.9), DeltaCreat/h between the first and second treatments (OR = 1.2), and UOP during hospitalization (OR = 0.2) were correlated with outcome. The main causes of death were euthanasia (44%) and haemorrhagic diatheses (33%). The overall survival rate was 54%, with 55% of survivors discharged with a median creatinine < 240 µmol/L.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description in the veterinary literature of a 4-h protocol of intermittent low efficiency haemodiafiltration to provide RRT in a veterinary critical care unit. While this protocol appears promising, the clinical application of this protocol requires further investigation. Among parameters associated with survival, UOP and DeltaCreat/h between the first and second RRT treatments may be prognostic indicators. The applicability of these parameters to other populations is unknown, and further international, multicentre prospective studies are warranted to confirm these preliminary observations.","['Cambournac M', 'Goy-Thollot I', 'Guillaumin J', 'Ayoub JY', 'Pouzot-Nevoret C', 'Barthélemy A', 'Bonnet-Garin JM']",2019,61,1,Acta Vet Scand,"Cambournac M, et al.

The classification and identification of leptospires can be conducted by both genotyping and serotyping which are time-consuming and established in few reference laboratories. This study used matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as rapid and accurate tool for the identification of leptospires. The whole cell protein spectra of 116 Leptospira isolates including 15 references Leptospira spp. (pathogenic, n = 8; intermediate, n = 2; non-pathogenic, n = 5) and 101 Leptospira spp. clinical isolates was created as an in-house MALDI-TOF MS database. Ninety-seven clinical isolates from Thailand and Laos was validated with these protein spectra and revealed 98.9% correct identification when compared with 16S rRNA gene sequences method. Moreover, MALDI-TOF MS could identify spiked leptospires whole cell in urine.

30965020,"Molecular epidemiology of Leptospira interrogans in Rattus norvegicus in Hanoi, Vietnam.","Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that is caused by pathogenic spirochaetes of Leptospira spp. and it has become a public health concern in urban localities in the tropics. Rats are important reservoir animals for the transmission of leptospirosis in urban areas. Leptospirosis is considered endemic in Vietnam. However, information on the causative Leptospira genotypes and serotypes in the country is limited. We investigated the carrier status of Leptospira spp. in rats captured in Hanoi by culturing and DNA detection. Isolates were characterized using a serological method and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). We captured 144 rats (1 Rattus argentiventer, 135 R. norvegicus, and 8 R. rattus) and obtained 17 L. interrogans, determined by rrs sequencing, from R. norvegicus (12.6%). Sixteen of the isolates were serogroup Bataviae. Five of the 16 isolates exhibited an MLVA type identical to that of the serovar Bataviae reference strain Van Tienen, while there were nine repeats for the other 11 isolates at VNTR31 compared with the reference strain. The remaining isolate grew poorly, and we were unable to determine its serogroup. However, it had an MLVA type matching those of serogroup Pomona strains isolated from R. norvegicus in Japan. Three different flaB sequences were detected in 23 out of 81 R. norvegicus kidney tissue samples (28.4%) using nested PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Two of the sequences were identical with those of serogroups Bataviae and Pomona, and no strain with another sequence was detected in the present study. The present study reveals a high prevalence rate of L. interrogans among R. norvegicus in Hanoi, Vietnam, indicating a potential risk of rat-borne leptospirosis in the area. The present study also demonstrates that a fastidious L. interrogans strain circulates among rats and that molecular detection is crucial in facilitating the accurate determination of reservoir animals.","['Koizumi N', 'Miura K', 'Sanai Y', 'Takemura T', 'Ung TTH', 'Le TT', 'Hirayama K', 'Hasebe F', 'Nguyen HLK', 'Hoang PVM', 'Nguyen CN', 'Khong TM', 'Le MTQ', 'Hoang HTT', 'Ohnishi M']",2019,194,,Acta Trop,"Koizumi N, et al.

30942554,Epidemiological investigation of Leptospira spp. in a dairy farming enterprise after the occurrence of three human leptospirosis cases.,"An epidemiological investigation was conducted in an unvaccinated dairy farming enterprise in which three workers on one of the milking herds (Herd 1) were diagnosed with leptospirosis due to serovars Hardjo (H) (n = 2) and Pomona (P) (n = 1) between January and March 2015. Blood and urine samples were collected from milking cows in Herd 1 (N = 230) and Herd 2 (N = 400), rising one- (R1, N = 125) and rising two-year-old (R2, N = 130) replacement heifers, and four pigs associated with Herd 1, in March 2015. Sera were tested using the MAT for serovars H, P, Copenhageni (C), Ballum (B) and Tarassovi (T), and urine samples were tested by qPCR. Seventy-five per cent of 109 cows in Herd 1 and 36% of 121 in Herd 2 were seropositive (≥48), predominantly to H and P, and 23% of 74 cows in Herd 1 and 1% of 90 cows in Herd 2 were qPCR positive. Fifty-five per cent of 42 R2 heifers were seropositive to T. No R1 and 17% of 42 R2 heifers were qPCR positive. Subsequently, all cattle were vaccinated for H and P, and Herds 1 and 2 were given amoxicillin. After the booster vaccination, 7% of 91 in Herd 1, 2% of 82 in Herd 2 and 11% of 38 R1 heifers (sampled as R2) were PCR positive. After the amoxicillin treatment, no cows in Herd 1 and 5% of 62 cows in Herd 2 were urine PCR positive. Calves and pigs were seropositive to H, P, C and B. Vaccination and antibiotic treatment appeared effective in reducing the risk of exposure of workers to vaccine serovars. However, evidence of non-vaccine serovars indicated that workers likely remain at risk of exposure to Leptospira.","['Yupiana Y', 'Wilson PR', 'Weston JF', 'Vallée E', 'Collins-Emerson JM', 'Benschop J', 'Scotland T', 'Heuer C']",2019,66,5,Zoonoses Public Health,"Yupiana Y, et al.

METHOD: This is an ecological study using information from the confirmed cases. A descriptive analysis was carried out according to the selected variables. The relationship between the cases and rainfall was verified through the Spearman's correlation coefficient. The cases/deaths were georeferenced per areas classified according to socioenvironmental deprivation indexes in Campinas.
RESULTS: From the 264 cases, 76.1% occurred in men, 58,4% in the 20 to 49 years old age range. Approximately 55% were hospitalized, with a prevalence of clinical-laboratorial diagnoses of 89.4%, and the lethality was 10.6%. The urban area concentrated 74.2% of the cases, and 48,9% occurred in the household environment. The main risk factor was evidence of the presence of rodents at the site. There was strong correlation between the incidence of cases and rainfall (p < 0.05) in 2010 to 2012. A higher concentration of the cases was observed in the Center-Southwest region. Spatial distribution of cases/deaths showed clusters in regions classified at lower socioeconomic levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of occurrence of leptospirosis in Campinas showed similarity with other Brazilian municipalities. The identification of areas with higher incidence of cases/deaths contributes to the adoption of strategies for intervention and prioritization of resources aiming at the reduction of the risk of infection and at early treatment for those affected.","['Lara JM', 'Von Zuben A', 'Costa JV', 'Donalisio MR', 'Francisco PMSB']",2019,22,,Rev Bras Epidemiol,"Lara JM, et al.

30941181,Doxycycline Usage for Prevention of Leptospirosis among Farmers and Reasons for Failure to Use Chemoprophylaxis: A Descriptive Study from Southern Sri Lanka.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis causes substantial morbidity and mortality in Sri Lanka. Health authorities have implemented a chemoprophylaxis programme for prevention of disease for farmers who are at a high risk of leptospirosis. Only 39% of general population is aware of chemoprophylaxis. Awareness on chemoprophylaxis and its usage among the risk population and the reasons for non-usage was uncertain. Our aim was to assess the chemoprophylaxis usage for prevention of leptospirosis among farmers and reasons for failure to use such preventive strategy.
METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on farmers in community setting in Galle District. Multi-stage cluster sampling method was used. Out of the seventeen ""Ministry of Health"" (MOH) divisions within the Galle district, nine divisions were randomly selected and, subsequently, two subdivisions (""Public Health Midwife"" divisions) were randomly selected from each MOH division. From each PHM division (total of 18), a cluster who does farming as the main source of income was selected. From these farmers, details on demographics, knowledge on leptospirosis and knowledge and practice on chemoprophylaxis usage were obtained through an interviewer administered open-ended questionnaire. From those who have not properly taken chemoprophylaxis, the reasons for non-usage were explored by semistructured interviews.
RESULTS: We recruited 319 (77%-males) farmers to the study. Eighteen (5.6%) have already had leptospirosis. Majority (86.8%) of farmers were aware that doxycycline can be used to prevent the disease occurrence. Only 31% knew about correct recommendations of chemoprophylaxis usage adopted by the national guidelines. Only 28.5% (91) used doxycycline prophylaxis. Out of those, only 60 farmers (65.9%) continued the prophylaxis throughout the contact and followed national recommendations. Themes responsible for non-usage were elicited such as lack of awareness of chemoprophylaxis usage, false sense of security from the disease by perceived ""immunity"" due to prolong exposure or due to low prevalence of disease, lack of motivation, lack of availability of medication, and fear of side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of leptospirosis is better among farmers compared to the general population. Usage of chemoprophylaxis among farmers was highly inadequate. Individual and health system related hypotheses and myths exist for non-usage of chemoprophylaxis. Thus, an urgent concerted campaign aimed at increasing awareness within the target group through education and making medicines effectively distributed is essential for better prevention of the disease.","['Fonseka CL', 'Vidanapathirana BN', 'de Silva CM', 'Athukorala AABB', 'Goonawardena PR', 'Karunathilake AP', 'Rajapakse IH', 'Dissanayake AS']",2019,2019,,J Trop Med,"Fonseka CL, et al.

Here, we report a molecularly confirmed case of fatal CanL caused by L. infantum in the south of Bosnia and Herzegovina where epidemiology data are scarce. A 2.5-year-old, male golden retriever presented with a history of lethargy, prostration, and anorexia. Clinical examination revealed pale mucosae membranes, reduced capillary refill time, anuria, and ulcerated oral mucosae and skin of the legs. Complete blood count discovered severe non-regenerative, normocytic and normochromic anemia. Biochemistry profile showed hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, increased potassium, and considerably elevated creatinine, urea, and phosphorus. Rapid Leishmania SNAP test was negative, as well as the serum neutralization test for leptospirosis. At necropsy, mildly enlarged and firm yellow to tan kidneys were the most prominent lesions. Macrophages laden with amastigotes in bone marrow, liver, spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes and the skin were seen in histopathology. Molecular testing by PCR and sequencing (cpb gene) confirmed and identified the pathogen as L. infantum. This study highlights the lack of key measures necessary to undertake the proper control of this important zoonosis in the country. Nationwide epidemiologic study on CanL and its vector(s), along with adoption and establishment of proper diagnostic approach with quantitative serologic and molecular methods in place are warranted.","['Alić A', 'Prašović S', 'Čamo D', 'Ćoralić A', 'Preldžić D', 'Duscher GG', 'Hodžić A']",2019,15,,Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports,"Alić A, et al.

30923000,Culture-attenuated pathogenic Leptospira lose the ability to survive to complement-mediated-killing due to lower expression of factor H binding proteins.,"Several pathogens including Gram-negative bacteria hijack complement regulators to escape host's innate response. Pathogenic Leptospira species bind Factor H, C4b binding protein and vitronectin from the complement system. We evaluated the ability of low passage (LP) and culture-attenuated (CA) pathogenic strains of Leptospira, to bind Factor H. We used LOCaS46 (Leptospira interrogans sv Canicola), LOVe30 (L. interrogans sv Icterohaemorrhagiae) and MOCA45 (L. santarosai sv Tarassovi), and ten high passage strains of Leptospira [used in the microscopic agglutination test (MAT)]. Afterwards, we assessed their survival in normal human serum (NHS). Interestingly, the ability in binding Factor H was higher for LOCaS46 and LOVe30 LP strains, than for the respective CA strains suggesting that the ability of evading the alternative complement pathway is lost after culture attenuation. Accordingly, the level of mRNA expression of the Factor H binding proteins, LigA, LigB and Lsa23 was higher in these LP strains than in the corresponding CA strains. Unexpectedly, no difference in Factor H binding and surviving was observed between LP and CA MOCA45 strains. The high passage MAT-reference strains showed variation in Factor H binding ability, but, in most cases, the ability for capturing Factor H by Leptospira strains correlated with their survival in NHS.","['Moreno-Torres A', 'Malvido-Jiménez IR', 'de la Peña-Moctezuma A', 'Castillo Sánchez LO', 'Fraga TR', 'Barbosa AS', 'Isaac L', 'Sahagún-Ruiz A']",2019,21,8-9,Microbes Infect,"Moreno-Torres A, et al.

The objectives of this article were to analyze environmental and socioeconomic variables and to evaluate their relationship with human leptospirosis cases. This is an ecological study on human leptospirosis cases aggregated by municipality and reported between 2007 and 2016. Spatial aggregation assessment was made using the Getis-Ord Gi method, and negative binomial regression was used to evaluate the relationship between environmental and socioeconomic variables with human leptospirosis. During the study period, 9,928 cases of human leptospirosis were reported, and 58.9% of municipalities reported at least one case. Four hotspots of human leptospirosis, including 18 municipalities, were identified. The results of the negative binomial model confirmed the importance of the effects of education, poverty and some climatic variables on the decadal incidence rate of human leptospirosis. Our results confirm the importance of socioeconomic determinants such as social marginality associated with violence and education, as well as ecological variables such as rainfall, height above sea level and forest coverage on the incidence rate of human leptospirosis at municipal scale.","['Gutiérrez JD', 'Martínez-Vega RA', 'Botello H', 'Ruiz-Herrera FJ', 'Arenas-López LC', 'Hernandez-Tellez KD']",2019,35,3,Cad Saude Publica,"Gutiérrez JD, et al.

30899522,"Leptospirosis in French Polynesia: 11 years of surveillance data, 2007-2017.","Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis with higher incidence in tropical areas and is a neglected disease in the Pacific region. French Polynesia (FP) is a French overseas territory located in the South Pacific. Data on the epidemiology in FP are scarce. In this study, we describe our understanding of leptospirosis epidemiology in FP and discuss the prospects concerning this disease and its surveillance to better address preventive actions. We report 11 years of surveillance data between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2017. Over the study period, 1356 confirmed and probable leptospirosis cases were reported. The mean annual incidence rate was 46.0 (95% confidence interval, 43.6-48.5) cases per 100 000 inhabitants. We registered 864 (63.7%) hospitalizations; of these, at least 270 (19.9%) were in the intensive care unit, and 24 patients (1.8%) died. Even if the incidence of leptospirosis is lower in FP compared to most of other Pacific countries and territories, our data confirm that the disease is highly endemic in FP. Despite all the preventive measures taken, leptospirosis remains a major public health concern in FP, thus highlighting the need to maintain intensive leptospirosis surveillance, medical staff training and provision of information to the general population.","['Bouscaren N', 'Benoit de Coignac C', 'Lastère S', 'Musso D', 'Teissier Y', 'Formont J', 'Chaix F', 'Giard M']",2019,29,,New Microbes New Infect,"Bouscaren N, et al.

30885170,An outbreak of leptospirosis with predominant cardiac involvement: a case series.,"BACKGROUND: Severe leptospirosis is known to cause multi organ dysfunction including cardiac involvement. In the clinical setting with limited resources, high degree of suspicion is needed to diagnose cardiac involvement including myocarditis. Although myocarditis is not reported as a common complication due to lack of diagnostic facilities, there are evidence to support myocarditis is more prevalent in post mortem studies of patients died due to leptospirosis. We present a case series of severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement observed during a period of one month at Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report here five patients with severe leptospirosis complicated with cardiac involvement, admitted to a single medical ward, Colombo-North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka during a one-month period. Out of six suspected leptospirosis patients admitted during that period, five in a raw developed severe leptospirosis with cardiac involvement. In this case series, four patients were confirmed serologically or quantitative PCR and one patient had possible leptospirosis. All patients developed shock during their course of illness. Two patients developed rapid atrial fibrillation. One patient had dynamic T wave changes in ECG and the other two had sinus tachycardia. Two patients had evidence of myocarditis in 2D echocardiogram, whereas other two patients had nonspecific findings and one patient had normal 2D echocardiogram. All five patients had elevated cardiac troponin I titre and it was normalized with the recovery. All five patients developed acute kidney injury. Four patients needed inotropic/vasopressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure and one patient recovered from shock with fluid resuscitation. All patients were recovered from their illness and repeat 2D echocardiograms after recovery did not show residual complications. One patient had serologically proven dengue co-infection with leptospirosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis and cardiac involvement in leptospirosis may be overlooked due to non-specific clinical findings and co-existing multi-organ dysfunction. Atypical presentation of this case series may be due to micro-geographic variation and unusual outbreak of leptospirosis. Co-infection of dengue with leptospirosis should be considered in managing patients especially in endemic areas.","['Jayathilaka PGNS', 'Mendis ASV', 'Perera MHMTS', 'Damsiri HMT', 'Gunaratne AVC', 'Agampodi SB']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Jayathilaka PGNS, et al.

30875033,Pathology and Host Immune Evasion During Human Leptospirosis: a Review.,"Human leptospirosis is considered as one of the most widespread and potentially fatal zoonotic diseases that causes high mortality and morbidity in the endemic regions of tropical and subtropical countries. The infection can arise from direct or indirect exposure of human through contaminated environment that contains leptospires or animal reservoirs that carry leptospires. The clinical manifestations during human leptospirosis ranges from asymptomatic, mild infections to severe and life-threatening complications involving multi-organ failures with kidneys, lungs and liver severely affected. Despite much efforts have been put in to unravel the pathogenesis during human leptospirosis, it remains obscure to which extent the host factors or the pathogen itself contribute towards the pathogenesis. Host innate immunity, especially, polymorphonuclear neutrophils and complement system are involved in the first line of defense during human leptospirosis. However, pathogenic Leptospira has acquired diverse evasion strategies to evade from host immunity and establish infection in infected hosts. Hence, in this review, we focus on organs pathology during human leptospiral infection and host evasion strategies employed by Leptospira. A profound understanding on leptospiral immunity and how Leptospira subvert the immune system may provide new insights on the development of therapeutic regimens against this species in future.","['Chin VK', 'Basir R', 'Nordin SA', 'Abdullah M', 'Sekawi Z']",2020,23,2,Int Microbiol,"Chin VK, et al.

30870415,A novel diagnostic algorithm equipped on an automated hematology analyzer to differentiate between common causes of febrile illness in Southeast Asia.,"BACKGROUND: Distinguishing arboviral infections from bacterial causes of febrile illness is of great importance for clinical management. The Infection Manager System (IMS) is a novel diagnostic algorithm equipped on a Sysmex hematology analyzer that evaluates the host response using novel techniques that quantify cellular activation and cell membrane composition. The aim of this study was to train and validate the IMS to differentiate between arboviral and common bacterial infections in Southeast Asia and compare its performance against C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 600 adult Indonesian patients with acute febrile illness were enrolled in a prospective cohort study and analyzed using a structured diagnostic protocol. The IMS was first trained on the first 200 patients and subsequently validated using the complete cohort. A definite infectious etiology could be determined in 190 of 463 evaluable patients (41%), including 89 arboviral infections (81 dengue and 8 chikungunya), 94 bacterial infections (26 murine typhus, 16 salmonellosis, 6 leptospirosis and 46 cosmopolitan bacterial infections), 3 concomitant arboviral-bacterial infections, and 4 malaria infections. The IMS detected inflammation in all but two participants. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the IMS for arboviral infections were 69.7%, 97.9%, 96.9%, and 77.3%, respectively, and for bacterial infections 77.7%, 93.3%, 92.4%, and 79.8%. Inflammation remained unclassified in 19.1% and 22.5% of patients with a proven bacterial or arboviral infection. When cases of unclassified inflammation were grouped in the bacterial etiology group, the NPV for bacterial infection was 95.5%. IMS performed comparable to CRP and outperformed PCT in this cohort.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The IMS is an automated, easy to use, novel diagnostic tool that allows rapid differentiation between common causes of febrile illness in Southeast Asia.","['Prodjosoewojo S', 'Riswari SF', 'Djauhari H', 'Kosasih H', 'van Pelt LJ', 'Alisjahbana B', 'van der Ven AJ', 'de Mast Q']",2019,13,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Prodjosoewojo S, et al.

30869033,Feral cats do not play a major role in leptospirosis epidemiology on Reunion Island.,"Although previous studies have reported Leptospira carriage in kidneys and urine of cats, the role of these animals in leptospirosis epidemiology remains poorly understood. Using molecular methods, we investigated Leptospira renal carriage in 172 feral cats from Reunion Island, an oceanic geographically isolated island located in the South West Indian Ocean. Only one out of the 172 analysed specimens tested positive for Leptospira DNA through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Using this positive sample, we could obtain sequences at three Leptospira loci (rrs2, lipL32 and lipL41) allowing to report for the first time Leptospira borgpetersenii naturally infecting cats. Comparisons with bacterial sequences from both acute human cases and animal reservoirs revealed similarities with Leptospira sequences previously reported on Reunion Island. However, the low prevalence (0.6%) reported herein does not support any major role of feral cats in leptospirosis epidemiology on Reunion Island, contrasting with results recently reported on another Indian Ocean Island, Christmas Island. The significance of these discrepancies is discussed.","['Gomard Y', 'Lagadec E', 'Humeau L', 'Pinet P', 'Bureau S', 'Da Silva D', 'Turpin M', 'Soulaimana Mattoir Y', 'Georger S', 'Mavingui P', 'Tortosa P']",2019,147,,Epidemiol Infect,"Gomard Y, et al.

30866876,"Health monitoring during water scarcity in Mayotte, France, 2017.","BACKGROUND: During the 2016-2017 austral summer, unprecedented water scarcity was observed in the south of Mayotte, French island in the Indian Ocean. Therefore, authorities introduced restrictive measures to save the water of this part of the island. The rationing system affected over 65,000 people, for four months. In order to detect a possible deterioration of the health situation, a strengthened epidemiological surveillance system was set up.
METHODS: Surveillance focused on intestinal and skin diseases, which are often associated with a lack of hygiene or poor-quality drinking and bathing water. Three pathologies were monitored: acute diarrhoea, acute gastroenteritis and skin diseases and also, proportion of antidiarrhoeal and rehydration solutions sales in pharmacies. Cases of leptospirosis were also under surveillance. The analyses consisted of comparing the collected data according to the areas that were either affected or not affected by the water restrictions. Comparisons with historical data were also made.
RESULTS: Although none of the surveillance systems were able to demonstrate any impact on skin diseases, they revealed a very sharp increase in the proportion of consultations for acute diarrhoea and gastro-enteritis in the southern area. This was corroborated by a high increase in the sales of antidiarrhoeals and oral rehydration solutions via the sentinel pharmacists in the south of the island compared with those of the north. Comparison with historical data highlighted the occurrence of an unusual situation.
CONCLUSION: These water restrictions caused a real deterioration in the health status of the inhabitants who were deprived of water.","['Subiros M', 'Brottet E', 'Solet JL', 'LeGuen A', 'Filleul L']",2019,19,1,BMC Public Health,"Subiros M, et al.

Besides, the current scenario of Leptospirosis demands the development of advanced diagnostics with the potential of an early and specific diagnosis. This work reports the diagnostic efficacy of a PI-PLC (LA_1375) of Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601. Phospholipases are enzymes that catalyse the degradation of membrane phospholipids, with the after effects of pathophysiological consequences through the impairment of cellular signalling mechanisms. The immunoblotting analysis allows to identify the Leptospirosis positive serum samples demonstrated the expression and exposure of the protein to the immune system and confirmed the antigenic nature of the protein. Furthermore, evaluation of diagnostic efficacy of an ELISA to detect antibodies against recombinant PI-PLC has tested in indirect IgM ELISA using the purified 50 kDa recombinant protein as the coating antigen. A cut-off value of 0.218 at mean + 2SD and a sensitivity value of 100% and a specificity value of 95.65% explored for the rPI-PLC IgM ELISA. The PPV and NPV of ELISA for the Leptospirosis confirmed acute phase samples were 95.87% and 100% respectively. Comparison of the ELISA assay with MAT for the detection of Leptospiral antibodies showed a positive correlation (r value 0.345, p < 0.05), and signified the diagnostic efficacy of rPI-PLC for the definitive diagnosis of the Leptospirosis. In addition, the revealed conservation nature of PI-PLC among different Leptospira species highlights the diagnostic and vaccine candidate potential.

30832578,Genomic analysis of Leptospira interrogans serovar Paidjan and Dadas isolates from carrier dogs and comparative genomic analysis to detect genes under positive selection.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease worldwide that can cause high morbidity and mortality rates in humans and animals. The causative spirochetes have reservoirs in mammalian hosts, but there has been limited analysis of the genomes of isolates recovered from animals. The aims of this study were to characterize genomic features of two Leptospira interrogans strains recently isolated from asymptomatic dogs in Thailand (strains CUDO5 and CDUO8), and to perform comparative genome analyses with other strains. Molecular adaptive evolution in L. interrogans as signaled by positive selection also was analyzed.
RESULTS: Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 had genome sizes of approximately 4.9 Mbp with 35.1% GC contents. Using monoclonal antibodies, strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were identified as serovars Paidjan and Dadas, respectively. These strains harbored genes known to be associated with acute and chronic infections. Using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms phylogeny (SNPs) with 97 L. interrogans strains, CUDO5 and CUDO8 had closest genetic relatedness with each other. Nevertheless, the serovar determinant region (rfb locus) showed variations in the genes encoding sugar biosynthesis. Amongst 13 representative L. interrogans strains examined for molecular adaptive evolution through positive selection under the site-model of Phylogenetic Analysis of Maximum Likelihood, genes responsible for iron acquisition (tlyA and hbpA), motility (fliN2, flgK, and flhB) and thermal adaptation (lpxD1) were under increased selective pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 and serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 had close genetic relatedness as analyzed by SNPs phylogeny. They contained genes with established roles in acute and chronic leptospirosis. The rfb locus in both serovars showed gene variation associated with sugar biosynthesis. Positive selection analysis indicated that genes encoding factors involved in motility, temperature adaptation, and iron acquisition were under strong positive selection in L. interrogans. These may be associated with adaptation in the early stages of infection.","['Kurilung A', 'Keeratipusana C', 'Suriyaphol P', 'Hampson DJ', 'Prapasarakul N']",2019,20,1,BMC Genomics,"Kurilung A, et al.

30831550,Acute respiratory distress syndrome in leptospirosis.,"PURPOSE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a major complication of leptospirosis, leading to the majority of fatalities.
METHODS: Retrospective, descriptive and single-center cohort study. The primary outcome was the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) for ARDS in leptospirosis based on the quartiles of the SAPS2 score in the reference population of 1683 patients hospitalized for ARDS. The second outcomes were to determine the risk factors of mortality of ARDS in leptospirosis and to describe the cases requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).
RESULTS: Of 172 leptospirosis patients from January 2004 to October 2017, 39 (23%) presented a moderate or severe ARDS with a mortality rate of 23% (9 cases). Among patients with ARDS, the SMR with regards to Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 0.49 (CI95%: 0.21; 0.96). Risk factors associated with mortality found by bivariate analysis were Severity Acute Physiology Score II (p = 0.01), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (p = 0.01), base excess (p = 0.002), kaliemia (p = 0.004), bilirubinemia (p = 0.01) and level of aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.01). Eight patients underwent ECMO for refractory ARDS and six survived.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis can induce serious but transient ARDS with a better prognosis than that of other causes of ARDS.

Disease ecology in altered environments is still poorly understood. The golden-headed lion tamarin (GHLT, Leontopithecus chrysomelas) is an endangered species that became invasive in an urban park in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The initially few invasive GHLT individuals became hundreds, adapted to living in proximity to humans and domestic animals. These GHLTs were captured as part of a conservation project; some animals were translocated to Bahia and some were kept in captivity. This study tested 593 GHLT for Leptospira serology; 100 and 95 GHLT for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) toLeptospira and hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV-3), respectively, and 101 familiar groups for PCR to viruses (rotavirus A, norovirus GI and GII, and HEV-3). One animal had antibodies for Leptospira serovar Shermani and another for serovar Hebdomadis. One saprophyticLeptospira was found by the 16S PCR and sequencing. Viruses were not detected in samples tested. Findings suggest that the epidemiological importance of such pathogens in this GHLT population is either low or nonexistent.

30811387,Association of rodent-borne Leptospira spp. with urban environments in Malaysian Borneo.,"Although leptospirosis is traditionally considered a disease of rural, agricultural and flooded environments, Leptospira spp. are found in a range of habitats and infect numerous host species, with rodents among the most significant reservoirs and vectors. To explore the local ecology of Leptospira spp. in a city experiencing rapid urbanization, we assessed Leptospira prevalence in rodents from three locations in Malaysian Borneo with differing levels of anthropogenic influence: 1) high but stable influence (urban); 2) moderate yet increasing (developing); and 3) low (rural). A total of 116 urban, 122 developing and 78 rural rodents were sampled, with the majority of individuals assigned to either the Rattus rattus lineage R3 (n = 165) or Sundamys muelleri (n = 100). Leptospira spp. DNA was detected in 31.6% of all rodents, with more urban rodents positive (44.8%), than developing (32.0%) or rural rodents (28.1%), and these differences were statistically significant. The majority of positive samples were identified by sequence comparison to belong to known human pathogens L. interrogans (n = 57) and L. borgpetersenii (n = 38). Statistical analyses revealed that both Leptospira species occurred more commonly at sites with higher anthropogenic influence, particularly those with a combination of commercial and residential activity, while L. interrogans infection was also associated with low forest cover, and L. borgpetersenii was more likely to be identified at sites without natural bodies of water. This study suggests that some features associated with urbanization may promote the circulation of Leptospira spp., resulting in a potential public health risk in cities that may be substantially underestimated.","['Blasdell KR', 'Morand S', 'Perera D', 'Firth C']",2019,13,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Blasdell KR, et al.

Infection in humans occurs by penetration into the mucous membranes, or into the skin (small wounds or abrasions). Humans are infected when they contact with urine of rodents, the main reservoirs. We aimed to evaluate the presence of anti-Leptospira spp antibodies and leptospiral DNA in sanitation workers (occupational group with increased risk) from Lisbon and Tagus Valley Region (Portugal). Blood samples were collected from 347 sanitation workers, being applied a questionnaire to analyze exposure to rodents and preventive measures. The samples were screened by MACROLepto-test, for the presence of antibodies against pathogenic leptospires. ""Positive"" and ""Non conclusive"" samples were then tested with Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT). Two nested-PCR protocols (primers LeptoA-LeptoB and lipL32) were applied for Leptospira spp DNA detection. It was not observed anti-Leptospira spp antibodies in the worker's samples. However, it was detected non-pathogenic leptospires in a serum sample. Furthermore, 77% had previously seen rodents in the workplace and 94% always used Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Despite the regular presence of rodents in their workplace, the use of PPE and hygiene measures seemed to be able to prevent the workers contact with this infectious agent.","['Fernandes M', 'Vieira ML', 'Carreira T', 'Teodósio R']",2019,12,5,J Infect Public Health,"Fernandes M, et al.

The gold standard for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis is Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT). However, the limitations of this technique make the search for alternative diagnostic methods inevitable. In the present study, ErpY-like recombinant protein (rErpY-like), produced in Escherichia coli and used as antigen in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was evaluated for its efficacy as a novel diagnostic tool for swine leptospirosis. For the study, 72 samples of swine sera characterized by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), were evaluated by indirect ELISA. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values obtained from the analysis were 96.8%, 100%, and 99%, respectively, thereby suggesting that rErpY-like ELISA being a sensitive and specific method for antibodies detection in swine populations could be used as an alternative for diagnosis of swine leptospirosis.","['Padilha BCR', 'Simão HQ', 'Oliveira TL', 'Hartwig DD']",2019,193,,Acta Trop,"Padilha BCR, et al.

Diagnostic difficulties of Lyme disease are partly due to the characteristics of spirochetes as their culture is tedious or even impossible for some of them. We performed a literature review to assess the value of the various diagnostic tests of spirochetes infections of medical interest such as Lyme borreliosis, relapsing fever borreliae, syphilis, and leptospirosis. We were able to draw similarities between these four infections. Real-time PCR now plays an important role in the direct diagnosis of these infections. However, direct diagnosis remains difficult because of a persistent lack of sensitivity. Serological testing is therefore crucial in the diagnostic process. All currently available diagnostic tools are imperfect, with a potential risk of false positive and false negative results depending on the clinical context. Physicians should always take into consideration the clinical and epidemiological context when Lyme disease, relapsing fever borreliae, syphilis, and leptospirosis are suspected.","['Eldin C', 'Jaulhac B', 'Mediannikov O', 'Arzouni JP', 'Raoult D']",2019,49,2,Med Mal Infect,"Eldin C, et al.

30759081,A simple score to predict severe leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: The case-fatality rate of severe leptospirosis can exceed 50%. While prompt supportive care can improve survival, predicting those at risk of developing severe disease is challenging, particularly in settings with limited diagnostic support.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively identified all adults with laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis in Far North Queensland, Australia, between January 1998 and May 2016. Clinical, laboratory and radiological findings at presentation were correlated with the patients' subsequent clinical course. Medical records were available in 402 patients; 50 (12%) had severe disease. The presence of oliguria (urine output ≤500 mL/24 hours, odds ratio (OR): 16.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.9-38.8, p<0.001), abnormal auscultatory findings on respiratory examination (OR 11.2 (95% CI: 4.7-26.5, p<0.001) and hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤100 mmHg, OR 4.3 (95% CI 1.7-10.7, p = 0.002) at presentation independently predicted severe disease. A three-point score (the SPiRO score) was devised using these three clinical variables, with one point awarded for each. A score could be calculated in 392 (98%) patients; the likelihood of severe disease rose incrementally: 8/287 (3%), 14/70 (20%), 18/26 (69%) and 9/9 (100%) for a score of 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively (p = 0.0001). A SPiRO score <1 had a negative predictive value for severe disease of 97% (95% CI: 95-99%).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A simple, three-point clinical score can help clinicians rapidly identify patients at risk of developing severe leptospirosis, prompting early transfer to referral centres for advanced supportive care. This inexpensive, bedside assessment requires minimal training and may have significant utility in the resource-limited settings which bear the greatest burden of disease.","['Smith S', 'Kennedy BJ', 'Dermedgoglou A', 'Poulgrain SS', 'Paavola MP', 'Minto TL', 'Luc M', 'Liu YH', 'Hanson J']",2019,13,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Smith S, et al.

30755626,Gene silencing based on RNA-guided catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9): a new tool for genetic engineering in Leptospira.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by pathogenic bacteria of the genus Leptospira, which also includes free-living saprophyte strains. Many aspects of leptospiral basic biology and virulence mechanisms remain unexplored mainly due to the lack of effective genetic tools available for these bacteria. Recently, the type II CRISPR/Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes has been widely used as an efficient genome engineering tool in bacteria by inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the desired genomic targets caused by an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease called Cas9, and the DSB repair associated machinery. In the present work, plasmids expressing heterologous S. pyogenes Cas9 in L. biflexa cells were generated, and the enzyme could be expressed with no apparent toxicity to leptospiral cells. However, L. biflexa cells were unable to repair RNA-guided Cas9-induced DSBs. Thus, we used a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) to obtain gene silencing rather than disruption, in a strategy called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi). We demonstrated complete gene silencing in L. biflexa cells when both dCas9 and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the coding strand of the β-galactosidase gene were expressed simultaneously. Furthermore, when the system was applied for silencing the dnaK gene, no colonies were recovered, indicating that DnaK protein is essential in Leptospira. In addition, flagellar motor switch FliG gene silencing resulted in reduced bacterial motility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work applying the CRISPRi system in Leptospira and spirochetes in general, expanding the tools available for understanding leptospiral biology.","['Fernandes LGV', 'Guaman LP', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Heinemann MB', 'Picardeau M', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Fernandes LGV, et al.

30723266,Inferring pathogen-host interactions between Leptospira interrogans and Homo sapiens using network theory.,"Leptospirosis is the most emerging zoonotic disease of epidemic potential caused by pathogenic species of Leptospira. The bacterium invades the host system and causes the disease by interacting with the host proteins. Analyzing these pathogen-host protein interactions (PHPIs) may provide deeper insight into the disease pathogenesis. For this analysis, inter-species as well as intra-species protein interactions networks of Leptospira interrogans and human were constructed and investigated. The topological analyses of these networks showed lesser connectivity in inter-species network than intra-species, indicating the perturbed nature of the inter-species network. Hence, it can be one of the reasons behind the disease development. A total of 35 out of 586 PHPIs were identified as key interactions based on their sub-cellular localization. Two outer membrane proteins (GpsA and MetXA) and two periplasmic proteins (Flab and GlyA) participating in PHPIs were found conserved in all pathogenic, intermediate and saprophytic spp. of Leptospira. Furthermore, the bacterial membrane proteins involved in PHPIs were found playing major roles in disruption of the immune systems and metabolic processes within host and thereby causing infectious disease. Thus, the present results signify that the membrane proteins participating in such interactions hold potential to serve as effective immunotherapeutic candidates for vaccine development.","['Kumar S', 'Lata KS', 'Sharma P', 'Bhairappanavar SB', 'Soni S', 'Das J']",2019,9,1,Sci Rep,"Kumar S, et al.

30713004,Identification of a novel protein in the genome sequences of Leptospira interrogans with the ability to interact with host's components.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that affects humans and animals worldwide. The etiological agents of this disease are the pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira. The mechanisms involved in the leptospiral pathogenesis are not full understood. The elucidation of novel mediators of host-pathogen interaction is important in the detection of virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.
OBJECTIVE: This work focused on identification and characterization of a hypothetical protein of Leptospira encoded by the gene LIC10920.
METHODS: The protein of unknown function was predicted to be surface exposed. Therefore, the LIC10920 gene was cloned and the protein expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Star pLysS strain. The recombinant protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography and evaluated with leptospirosis human serum samples. The interaction with host components was also performed.
RESULTS: The recombinant protein was recognized by antibodies present in leptopsirosis human serum, suggesting its expression during infection. Immunofluorescence and intact bacteria assays indicated that the bacterial protein is surface-exposed. The recombinant protein interacted with human laminin, in a dose-dependent and saturable manner and was named Lsa24.9, for Leptospiral surface adhesin, followed by its molecular mass. Lsa24.9 also binds plasminogen (PLG) in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion, fulfilling receptor ligand interaction. Moreover, Lsa24.9 has the ability to acquire PLG from normal human serum, exhibiting similar profile as observed with the human purified component. PLG bound Lsa24.9 was able of generating plasmin, which could increase the proteolytic power of the bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel leptospiral protein may function as an adhesin at the colonization steps and may help the invasion process by plasmin generation at the bacterial cell surface.","['Rossini AD', 'Teixeira AF', 'Souza Filho A', 'Souza GO', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Heinemann MB', 'Romero EC', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2020,53,1,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Rossini AD, et al.

Some dogs may act as asymptomatic carriers, keeping the agent in the renal tubules and eliminating it in the urine for an extended period. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is multifactorial and pathophysiology has been widely discussed. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the occurrence of CKD may possibly be associated with asymptomatic leptospiral infection in dogs in endemic regions. Serology and urine PCR were performed in 16 dogs with CKD and 48 healthy dogs from an endemic area. Dogs with CKD were more frequently shedders (75%) than non-CKD animals (20.8%). Therefore, our results demonstrate that asymptomatic leptospiral infection is associated with canine chronic kidney disease and that differential diagnosis is important for dogs from endemic areas presenting CKD. The early detection of shedders, besides the obvious impact on Public health may also help to improve the animal health and avoid the development of CKD.","[""Sant'Anna R"", 'Vieira AS', 'Oliveira J', 'Lilenbaum W']",2019,62,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Sant'Anna R, et al.

Blood samples from the 12 patients that presented symptoms for febrile illness on clinical examination were subjected to laboratory investigation, comprising Lepto IgM rapid test, IgM ELISA, and microscopic agglutination test (MAT). All these patients were interviewed for possible risk factors for leptospirosis. Rodent trapping and environmental sampling for possible isolation of leptospires in the outbreak site was performed. The isolated leptospires were genetically characterized and investigated for the potential epidemiological link with human leptospirosis.

Two Leptospira species from rodents (L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii) and two from the environment (L. kmetyi and L. wolffii) were identified. The possible epidemiological link between human serovars and animal Leptospira species indicates rodents as the potential reservoir while the environment (soil and water) serves as a transmission route. This investigation highlights the robust presence of pathogenic leptospires on Malaysian environment and rodents which may present the risk of infection, especially among high-risk individuals.

30677033,Discovery of Leptospira spp. seroreactive peptides using ORFeome phage display.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is the most common zoonotic disease worldwide. The diagnostic performance of a serological test for human leptospirosis is mainly influenced by the antigen used in the test assay. An ideal serological test should cover all serovars of pathogenic leptospires with high sensitivity and specificity and use reagents that are relatively inexpensive to produce and can be used in tropical climates. Peptide-based tests fulfil at least the latter two requirements, and ORFeome phage display has been successfully used to identify immunogenic peptides from other pathogens.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two ORFeome phage display libraries of the entire Leptospira spp. genomes from five local strains isolated in Malaysia and seven WHO reference strains were constructed. Subsequently, 18 unique Leptospira peptides were identified in a screen using a pool of sera from patients with acute leptospirosis. Five of these were validated by titration ELISA using different pools of patient or control sera. The diagnostic performance of these five peptides was then assessed against 16 individual sera from patients with acute leptospirosis and 16 healthy donors and was compared to that of two recombinant reference proteins from L. interrogans. This analysis revealed two peptides (SIR16-D1 and SIR16-H1) from the local isolates with good accuracy for the detection of acute leptospirosis (area under the ROC curve: 0.86 and 0.78, respectively; sensitivity: 0.88 and 0.94; specificity: 0.81 and 0.69), which was close to that of the reference proteins LipL32 and Loa22 (area under the ROC curve: 0.91 and 0.80; sensitivity: 0.94 and 0.81; specificity: 0.75 and 0.75).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This analysis lends further support for using ORFeome phage display to identify pathogen-associated immunogenic peptides, and it suggests that this technique holds promise for the development of peptide-based diagnostics for leptospirosis and, possibly, of vaccines against this pathogen.","['Ramli SR', 'Moreira GMSG', 'Zantow J', 'Goris MGA', 'Nguyen VK', 'Novoselova N', 'Pessler F', 'Hust M']",2019,13,1,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Ramli SR, et al.

30670512,Environmental risk factors of leptospirosis in urban settings: a systematic review protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is the most common zoonotic disease that causes morbidity and mortality worldwide. The disease can cause sporadic epidemics and recent epidemics have become more apparent in urban localities. There is lack of documented evidence on the specific risk factors of leptospirosis infection among the urbanites, thereby impeding initiatives for prevention in urban settings. We aim to systematically search published articles and synthesise evidence on the risk factors associated with leptospirosis infection among the susceptible populations in urban localities, particularly to identify the risk factors of non-recreational leptospirosis infection.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review of observational studies that investigated environmental risk factors of leptospirosis in urban localities. The search will be performed for any eligible articles from selected electronic databases from 1970 until May 2018. The study will include any studies that investigated risk factors of confirmed leptospirosis cases who acquired the infection in urban locality, particularly exposures from the non-recreational and non-water-related activities. Study selection and reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline. All data will be extracted using a standardised data extraction form and quality of the studies will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale guideline. Descriptive and meta-analysis will be performed by calculating the standardised median ORs and risk ratios for types of the non-recreational risk factors stratified by social, living conditions and environmental exposures, types of reservoirs and transmissions and types of activities and employments associated with leptospirosis infection in urban locality.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No primary data will be collected thus no formal ethical approval is required. The results will be disseminated though a peer-reviewed publication and conference presentation.

30666001,Persistent febrile illnesses in Nepal: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Although febrile illnesses are a frequent cause of consultation and hospitalization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), research has mainly focused on acute febrile illnesses (AFIs). In contrast, there are limited data on the causes of persistent febrile illnesses (PFIs) in LMIC. Lack of clarity on the differential diagnosis of PFIs in the rural tropics leads to the absence of diagnostic guidance tools.
METHODS: In this study, a review of the potential causes of persistent fever defined as fever of more than seven days was done in Nepal, with a focus on nine pathogen-specific conditions. The current knowledge on their burden, distribution and diagnosis was summarized.
RESULTS: Limited data were found on the incidence and public health burden of leptospirosis, murine typhus and brucellosis due to the absence of diagnostic tools outside reference laboratories and the overlap of signs and symptoms with other febrile conditions. The incidence of malaria and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was found to be decreasing in Nepal, with some changes of the geographical areas at risk.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates a need for more research on the causes of PFIs in Nepal and in the region and for the development of clinical guidance tailored to current local epidemiology. Guidance tools should include specific clinical features (e.g. eschar), results of rapid diagnostic tests (e.g. malaria, VL), appropriate indications for more sophisticated tests (e.g. abdominal ultrasound, polymerase chain reaction) and recommendations for adequate use of empirical treatment.","['Koirala KD', 'Chappuis F', 'Verdonck K', 'Rijal S', 'Boelaert M']",2018,148,4,Indian J Med Res,"Koirala KD, et al.

30639452,Circulating Leptospira species identified in cattle of the Brazilian Amazon.,"The present study aimed to detect the most prevalent serogroups and circulating Leptospira species in cows from Brazilian Amazon. Samples of blood serum, urine and kidney of 208 animals were collected at a municipal slaughterhouse in the Baixo Tocantins region of Pará State, Northern Brazil. The tests used were microscopic agglutination test (MAT), bacteriological isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The frequency of MAT-reactive cows was 46.6% (97/208) with titers ranging from 100 to 3200, being Sejroe serogroup the most prevalent. There was no Leptospira isolation, but the DNA of bacterium was detected in 5.8% (12/208) of the kidney and in 14.9% (31/208) of the urine samples. DNA sequencing was performed directly from PCR products of 30 samples (3 kidneys and 27 urines), with identification of four different species: L. borgpetersenii with 56.7% (17/30), followed by L. kirschneri with 13.3% (4/30), L. interrogans with 6.7% (2/30), L. santarosai with 3.3% (1/30), and 20.0% (6/30) of samples were identified only at the genus level. These results reveal a diversity and peculiarity for bovine leptospirosis in the Amazon region, mainly due to the low frequency of L. santarosai and more surprising, the presence of L. kirschneri, differently of what is observed in other regions of Brazil.","['Guedes IB', 'Araújo SAA', 'de Souza GO', 'de Souza Silva SO', 'Taniwaki SA', 'Cortez A', 'Brandão PE', 'Heinemann MB']",2019,191,,Acta Trop,"Guedes IB, et al.

30638770,"Characterization of a novel protein of Leptospira interrogans exhibiting plasminogen, vitronectin and complement binding properties.","Leptospirosis is a severe zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira. This work focuses on a hypothetical protein of unknown function, encoded by the gene LIC13259, and predicted to be a surface protein, widely distributed among pathogenic leptospiral strain. The gene was amplified from L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, strain Fiocruz L1-130, cloned and the protein expressed using Escherichia coli as a host system. Immunofluorescence assay showed that the protein is surface-exposed. The recombinant protein LIC13259 (rLIC13259) has the ability to interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) laminin, in a dose-dependent manner but saturation was not reach. The rLIC13259 protein is a plasminogen (PLG)-binding protein, generating plasmin, in the presence of urokinase PLG-activator uPA. The recombinant protein is able to mediate the binding to human purified terminal complement route vitronectin, C7, C8 and C9, and to recruit and interact with these components from normal human serum (NHS). These interactions are dose-dependent on NHS increased concentration. The binding of rLIC13259 to C8 and vitronectin was slight and pronounced inhibited in the presence of increasing heparin concentration, respectively, suggesting that the interaction with vitronectin occurs via heparin domain. Most interesting, the interaction of rLIC13259 with C9 protein was capable of preventing C9 polymerization, suggesting that the membrane attack complex (MAC) formation was inhibited. Thus, we tentatively assign the coding sequence (CDS) LIC13259, previously annotated as unknown function, as a novel protein that may play an important role in the host's invasion and immune evasion processes, contributing to the establishment of the leptospiral infection.","['Cavenague MF', 'Teixeira AF', 'Filho AS', 'Souza GO', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Heinemann MB', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2019,309,2,Int J Med Microbiol,"Cavenague MF, et al.

30631369,Role of Plasmapheresis and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the Treatment of Leptospirosis Complicated with Pulmonary Hemorrhages.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease associated with multiorgan involvement and significant morbidity and mortality. Although pulmonary hemorrhage due to leptospirosis has a high fatality, specific treatment options are limited and their efficacy is not adequately proven. We opted to find out the current evidence on plasmapheresis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in pulmonary hemorrhages due to leptospirosis.
METHODS: The first search was conducted in PubMed, OVID, Google Scholar, and Cochrane clinical trial registry using keywords ""leptospirosis"" OR ""Leptospira"" OR ""Weil's disease"" AND ""plasmapheresis"" OR ""plasma exchange"" AND ""pulmonary hemorrhage"" OR ""alveolar hemorrhage"" OR ""lung hemorrhage"" and the second search was done using keyword ""leptospirosis"" OR ""Leptospira"" OR ""Weil's disease"" AND ""ECMO"" OR ""Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation."" The searches were not limited by study design or the date of publication. Only articles written in English were reviewed. Although we intended to include only clinical trials, it was decided later to include other information such as case reports and case series which addressed these treatment modalities. Two authors selected articles independently in a blinded manner using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria and discrepancies were solved after discussions.
RESULTS: The information found was very limited. This included one clinical trial which showed a significant survival benefit with plasmapheresis but the study design had many limitations. Two case reports described the benefit of plasmapheresis in severe leptospirosis with pulmonary hemorrhages. There were eight case reports where ECMO was performed and out of all only one patient has died. One retrospective study on patients with severe leptospirosis mentioned that four out of five patients with pulmonary hemorrhages survived after being treated with ECMO.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to recommend the routine use of plasmapheresis or ECMO for patients presenting with pulmonary hemorrhages due to leptospirosis. ECMO may be a promising mode of treatment in acute respiratory failure in leptospirosis related pulmonary hemorrhages. These treatment modalities, however, can be applied based on the availability of resources and expertise at the discretion of the clinician in charge, considering patient related factors such as cardiovascular stability and derangement of coagulation profile. Clinical trials conducted adhering to standard procedures are urgently required to establish the efficacy of these treatment modalities.","['Fonseka CL', 'Lekamwasam S']",2018,2018,,J Trop Med,Fonseka CL and Lekamwasam S.

30629756,Leptospirosis: An important infectious disease in North American horses.,"North American horses are commonly exposed to Leptospira organisms. Leptospira Bratislava is the most common infecting serovar but this serovar has not been confirmed to cause clinical disease in North American horses. Leptospira Pomona type kennewicki is responsible for most of the clinical diseases (leptospirosis) in North American horses. Leptospirosis is most commonly associated with diseases of the placenta and fetus, the kidneys and the eyes in horses. In-utero infections in pregnant mares may result in abortion, neonatal illness or birth of an antibody positive healthy foal. Acute renal failure in younger horses and recurrent uveitis in adult horses are other well documented clinical syndromes of leptospirosis. Abortions, neonatal disease and acute renal failure are caused by a subacute infection, while horses with Leptospira associated recurrent uveitis develop ocular disease months or years after the initial Leptospira infection. Diagnosis of Leptospirosis is made by a combination of antigen or antibody testing methods. Mares that abort following Leptospira infection have no additional clinical signs at the time of abortion but may shed the offending Leptospira spp. in the urine for several weeks. Antibiotic treatments are sometimes used in hopes of decreasing Leptospira shedding in infected horses or prophylactically in exposed pregnant mares but documentation of efficacy is lacking. Horses with Leptospira - associated acute renal failure can be successfully treated with antibiotics and supportive care. Recurrent uveitis is commonly associated with leptospirosis in North American horses and although horses may have chronic intraocular infection triggering an immune disease, systemic antimicrobial therapy has not been effective in eliminating the organism from the eye. An equine approved Leptospira Pomona type kennewicki vaccine is now available in North America.","['Divers TJ', 'Chang YF', 'Irby NL', 'Smith JL', 'Carter CN']",2019,51,3,Equine Vet J,"Divers TJ, et al.

30628565,"Etiologies of Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Illness in Bangkok, Thailand.","Acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) has been a diagnostic dilemma in the tropics. Without accurate point-of-care tests, information on local pathogens and clinical parameters is essential for presumptive diagnosis. A prospective hospital-based study was conducted at the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases from 2013 to 2015 to determine common etiologies of AUFI. A total of 397 adult AUFI cases, excluding malaria by blood smear, were enrolled. Rapid diagnostic tests for tropical infections were performed on admission, and acute and convalescent samples were tested to confirm the diagnosis. Etiologies could be identified in 271 (68.3%) cases. Dengue was the most common cause, with 157 cases (39.6%), followed by murine typhus (20 cases; 5.0%), leptospirosis (16 cases; 4.0%), influenza (14 cases; 3.5%), and bacteremia (six cases; 1.5%). Concurrent infection by at least two pathogens was reported in 37 cases (9.3%). Furthermore, characteristics of dengue and bacterial infections (including leptospirosis and rickettsioses) were compared to facilitate dengue triage, initiate early antibiotic treatment, and minimize unnecessary use of antibiotics. In conclusion, dengue was the most common pathogen for AUFI in urban Thailand. However, murine typhus and leptospirosis were not uncommon. Empirical antibiotic treatment using doxycycline or azithromycin might be more appropriate, but cost-benefit studies are required. Physicians should recognize common causes of AUFI in their localities and use clinical and laboratory clues for provisional diagnosis to provide appropriate treatment while awaiting laboratory confirmation.","['Luvira V', 'Silachamroon U', 'Piyaphanee W', 'Lawpoolsri S', 'Chierakul W', 'Leaungwutiwong P', 'Thawornkuno C', 'Wattanagoon Y']",2019,100,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Luvira V, et al.

30618076,"Despite high-risk exposures, no evidence of zoonotic transmission during a canine outbreak of leptospirosis.","Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis that affects many mammals, including humans and dogs; dogs can transmit the bacteria to humans, but the frequency of transmission and highest risk exposures are poorly understood. During 2016-2017, the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, Arizona Department of Health Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the zoonotic potential of a canine leptospirosis outbreak in the Phoenix metro area. We identified symptomatic persons exposed to canine leptospirosis cases by conducting active and passive surveillance. We tested dog owners (n = 9) and animal care providers (n = 109) for serological evidence of Leptospira spp. infection (via the microscopic agglutination test [MAT]) and interviewed these persons about their specific exposures to canine cases and general exposures to canine blood and urine. Through surveillance, seven symptomatic persons were identified; six were tested and all were negative by MAT, and of these six, four persons were negative by PCR (two did not have PCR testing). All serosurvey participants (n = 118) were also seronegative. Among animal care providers, bare skin contact with urine/blood from a canine case was reported by 23.2%; two persons reported dog urine splashing in their face. Veterinary technicians were more likely to have bare skin contact with blood from a canine case compared to veterinarians and boarding facility staff (p < 0.001). Infection control practices were inconsistent; when working with specimens from a canine leptospirosis case, 44.6% of participants reported always wearing gloves when working with urine (i.e., collecting specimens), and 54.5% always wore gloves when working with blood. Veterinary technicians were also most likely to engage in all activities involving potential urine/blood contact, such as conducting laboratory tests (p < 0.01). We therefore recommend that veterinary technicians specifically receive targeted education about infection control practices. Our results suggest that dog-to-human transmission of leptospirosis is uncommon.","['Guagliardo SAJ', 'Iverson SA', 'Reynolds L', 'Yaglom H', 'Venkat H', 'Galloway R', 'Levy C', 'Reindel A', 'Sylvester T', 'Kretschmer M', 'LaFerla Jenni M', 'Woodward P', 'Beatty N', 'Artus A', 'Klein R', 'Sunenshine R', 'Schafer IJ']",2019,66,2,Zoonoses Public Health,"Guagliardo SAJ, et al.

30616505,Phagocytosis of Leptospira by leukocytes from mice with different susceptibility to leptospirosis and possible role of chemokines.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonosis caused by pathogenic prokaryotic microbes of the genus Leptospira. Although there are several reports in the literature, host-pathogen interaction is still poorly understood. The role of chemokine expression is important on the chemotaxis, activation and regulation of immune cells. Recent studies have shown that their expression profiles play an important role on the severity of leptospirosis outcome. We evaluated the phagocytosis of Leptospira by spleens cells from C3H/HeJ, C3H/HePas and BALB/c mouse strains, respectively susceptible, intermediate and resistant to leptospirosis, and by RAW 264.7 macrophages. Besides, we evaluated the effects of CCL2 treatment on the phagocytosis. The cells were incubated with or without CCL2 chemokine, and infected with virulent L. interrogans sv Copenhageni. Cells and culture supernatants were collected for subsequent analysis.
RESULTS: The number of leptospires was higher in BALB/c cells, CCL2 pre-treated or only infected groups, when compared to C3H/HeJ and C3H/HePas cells. Indeed, CCL2 activation did not interfere in the phagocytosis of Leptospira. Expression of chemokines CXCL5 and CCL8 levels were significantly inhibited in infected BALB/c cells when compared to the non-infected control.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher ability to phagocytosis and early modulation of some chemokines correlated with the resistance to leptospirosis disease. Exposure to CCL2 did not interfere on phagocytosis of Leptospira in our experimental conditions, but acted in the modulation of chemokines expression during Leptospira infection.","['Silva PLD', 'Lauretti-Ferreira F', 'Caldas de Lima M', 'Lima SS', 'Covarrubias AE', 'De Franco M', 'Carvalho E', 'Ho PL', 'da Costa RMA', 'Martins EAL', 'Da Silva JB']",2019,19,1,BMC Microbiol,"Silva PLD, et al.

There is limited information regarding the seroprevalence of leptospirosis in population from northern states of India. This study reports result of a 4-year-retrospective sero-epidemiological survey of leptospirosis conducted in a teaching tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India. The aim of our study was to explore seroprevalence and clinical pattern of disease occurrence in suspected cases of leptospirosis and to search for any co-existing infections in northern areas such as New Delhi, India.
METHODS: The patients with clinically suspected leptospirosis who attended outpatient or admitted to the Departments of Medicine, Gastroenterology, Pediatrics and Neurology, etc. of our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The qualitative determination of anti-leptospira-specific immunoglobulin (IgM) antibodies was carried out using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Panbio Diagnostics, Brisbane, Australia).
RESULTS: Of these 1545 patients, 6.47% (100/1545) were seropositive for anti-leptospira-specific immunoglobulin (IgM) antibodies. Using modified Faine's criteria, a diagnosis of presumptive and possible leptospirosis was made in 79/100 (79%) and 21/100 (21%) patients.

30593736,Spatial epidemiological approaches to inform leptospirosis surveillance and control: A systematic review and critical appraisal of methods.,"Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease that the transmission is driven by complex geographical and temporal variation in demographics, animal hosts and socioecological factors. This results in complex challenges for the identification of high-risk areas. Spatial and temporal epidemiological tools could be used to support leptospirosis control programs, but the adequacy of its application has not been evaluated. We searched literature in six databases including PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, SciELO and Zoological Record to systematically review and critically assess the use of spatial and temporal analytical tools for leptospirosis and to provide general framework for its application in future studies. We reviewed 115 articles published between 1930 and October 2018 from 41 different countries. Of these, 65 (56.52%) articles were on human leptospirosis, 39 (33.91%) on animal leptospirosis and 11 (9.5%) used data from both human and animal leptospirosis. Spatial analytical (n = 106) tools were used to describe the distribution of incidence/prevalence at various geographical scales (96.5%) and to explored spatial patterns to detect clustering and hot spots (33%). A total of 51 studies modelled the relationships of various variables on the risk of human (n = 31), animal (n = 17) and both human and animal infection (n = 3). Among those modelling studies, few studies had generated spatially structured models and predictive maps of human (n = 2/31) and animal leptospirosis (n = 1/17). In addition, nine studies applied time-series analytical tools to predict leptospirosis incidence. Spatial and temporal analytical tools have been greatly utilized to improve our understanding on leptospirosis epidemiology. Yet the quality of the epidemiological data, the selection of covariates and spatial analytical techniques should be carefully considered in future studies to improve usefulness of evidence as tools to support leptospirosis control. A general framework for the application of spatial analytical tools for leptospirosis was proposed.","['Dhewantara PW', 'Lau CL', 'Allan KJ', 'Hu W', 'Zhang W', 'Mamun AA', 'Soares Magalhães RJ']",2019,66,2,Zoonoses Public Health,"Dhewantara PW, et al.

30591382,[Update on leptospirosis].,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide spirochetal zoonosis whose global incidence is increasing and is probably underestimated. Leptospirosis has long been associated with occupational contact with animals (rats and cattle) and has become in developed countries a pathology more related to recreational activities with exposure to fresh water (canoeing, swimming, canyoning) and to an environment contaminated by urine from leptospires excretory rodents. Leptospirosis should be one of the differential diagnoses to be considered when returning from travel to tropical areas, particularly Southeast Asia, and particularly during the rainy season. The clinical symptoms, particularly in the initial phase, are not specific and can limit to a flu-like syndrome or ""dengue-like"" making diagnosis often difficult. It is then necessary to look carefully for clinical (muscle pain, cough, conjunctival involvement, jaundice) and biological arguments (thrombocytopenia, cholestasis, rhabdomyolysis, frank elevation of CRP) that will help to diagnose leptospirosis and lead to quick antibiotic therapy before the progression to a severe icterohaemorrhagic (Weil's disease) or respiratory form associated with significant mortality. Treatment is based on injectable beta-lactams in severe forms (mainly cephalosporins) and amoxicillin, doxycycline or azithromycin in non-severe forms. Some atypical or delayed forms of leptospirosis occurring in the late immune phase of the disease are to know. Rapid diagnostic tools are currently being studied to improve diagnosis in remote areas and facilitate access to early treatment.","['Le Turnier P', 'Epelboin L']",2019,40,5,Rev Med Interne,Le Turnier P and Epelboin L.

30580489,Leptospira infection and shedding in cats in Thailand.,"In Thailand, leptospirosis is considered an emerging disease in humans and animals. Many species can shed pathogenic Leptospira, including domestic cats (felis catus), which might be able to pose a risk to humans. There are no studies on Leptospira infections in cats in Thailand, but in other countries, it was demonstrated that cats can shed pathogenic Leptospira with high prevalences. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether outdoor cats in Thailand shed pathogenic Leptospira in their urine, and to determine antibody prevalence and risk factors associated with Leptospira infection. Two hundred and sixty outdoor cats were prospectively recruited. Urine samples were tested by real-time PCR targeting the lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira. Urine was additionally cultured for 6 months in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris medium to grow Leptospira. Antibodies against 24 serovars (Anhoa, Australis, Autumnalis, Ballum, Bataviae, Bratislava, Broomi, Canicola, Celledoni, Copenhageni, Coxi, Cynopteri, Djasiman, Grippotyphosa, Haemolytica, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Khorat, Paidja, Patoc, Pomona, Pyrogenes, Rachmati, Saxkoebing, Sejroe) belonging to 16 serogroups were determined using microscopic agglutination tests. Risk factors were analysed by Fisher's exact test. Urine samples of 2/260 cats (0.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1%-2.8%) were PCR-positive, but none of the 260 urine samples were culture positive. Leptospira antibodies were detected in 14/260 cats (5.4%; 95% CI: 3.0%-8.6%) with titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:160 (serovars: Anhoa, Autumnalis, Celledoni, Copenhageni, Djasiman, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Patoc). Cats aged ≥4 years were significantly more often infected with Leptospira than younger cats. No other significant risk factors were found. In conclusion, outdoor cats in Thailand can shed DNA and, possibly, viable, pathogenic Leptospira in their urine, although at a much lower prevalence than expected when compared to countries with similar climate. Thus, cats can be a potential source of infection for people. Further studies are needed to determine the role of cats in transmitting this zoonotic disease in Thailand.","['Sprißler F', 'Jongwattanapisan P', 'Luengyosluechakul S', 'Pusoonthornthum R', 'Prapasarakul N', 'Kurilung A', 'Goris M', 'Ahmed A', 'Reese S', 'Bergmann M', 'Dorsch R', 'Klaasen HLBM', 'Hartmann K']",2019,66,2,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Sprißler F, et al.

Clinical course of leptospirosis varies from mild to severe disease. Here we present a case of leptospirosis complicated with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), papillitis, and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(TTP).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old Asian male presented with fever, myalgia, oliguria and dyspnoea where he was managed as for leptospirosis complicated with pulmonary haemorrhages and acute renal failure. Leptospirosis was confirmed by Microscopic Agglutination Test(MAT) with a fourfold rise in antibody titre between acute and convalescent serum. The highest antibody titre was against Leptospira antigen serogroup Semaranga (strain Patoc) (1:1280) followed by serogroup Australis (strain Australis) (1:640) and serogroup Autumnalis (strain Bankgkinang) (1:320). Two weeks later he developed blindness, ascending weakness of lower limbs with global areflexia and an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy(AIDP) variant GBS was confirmed with nerve conduction studies. TTP complicated the picture several days later. He was initiated on plasmapheresis where clinical improvement was seen after 14 cycles. He had an incomplete neurological recovery with permanent vision loss but completely recovered from TTP. He also had permanent renal impairment.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis should be suspected and treated empirically in the relevant clinical settings where it can present with an atypical clinical picture as in our case with an acute febrile illness followed by GBS as well as TTP.","['Kobawaka Gamage KK', 'Fernando H']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Kobawaka Gamage KK and Fernando H.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After applying a questionnaire to 100 owners, data was analyzed by calculating simple means and quantifiable percentage.
RESULTS: 77% of the sample owned dogs and 37% cats. All of them claimed to know that animals transmit diseases, but 74% said they were unaware of zoonoses and 80% never received information on the subject. Over 90% of respondents said they know of diseases transmitted by dogs and cats, and 94% point dogs as transmitters of rabies, with 90% being associated with bites, and 88% recognizing vaccination as prevention. Regarding leishmaniasis, 45% associated transmission by mosquito bites and 22% knew about prevention with repellent collars. Mice were associated with the transmission of leptospirosis by 57%, and 22% mentioned feces as a source of infection and 19% controlling rodents as a prevention measure. 59% of the sample reported that cats are transmitters of toxoplasmosis, that feces are the main source (26%) and that hygiene is as a prevention measure (25%). Only 9% knew about sporotrichosis, 6% recognized scratching as a form of transmission by cats and 3% indicated the treatment of diseased animals as a prevention measure.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the lack of awareness among the target population of the aforementioned zoonoses.

Objectives: To evaluate perception, knowledge and behaviors adopted for protection and prevention of biological risk, related also to the occupational activity, among construction and agricultural workers.
METHODS: Workers were recruited at farms and construction companies of Molise Region, Central Italy, which were visited within the surveillance activities planned by local institutions. A questionnaire was administered to workers to collect sociodemographic and occupational data, and concerning risk perception and knowledge, and awareness of available prevention measures, also related to the work activity.
RESULTS: total of 143 workers (73.4% males, 42.9±10.7 years old) were interviewed, and 56.6% were construction workers. Only 24% of workers believed that infectious diseases could be frequent and health threatening in carrying out the work activities; half of them declared to be exposed to biological hazards, but 70% were unworried. An underestimation of the severity of some pathologies, such as listeriosis, leptospirosis and viral hepatitis emerged, and only 70% of workers believed that tetanus is highly or very highly dangerous for health. Furthermore, 33% of workers said to have scarce or insufficient knowledge of biological risk, and 97.2%, 80.4% and 45.5% were aware that a vaccine is available for tetanus, hepatitis B and A, respectively. All workers undergone the tetanus vaccination and 39.2% the anti-hepatitis B.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high probability of exposure to biological agents, the results of the survey revealed a lack of perception and knowledge of the risk, as well as a poor awareness of available preventive measures among construction and agricultural workers. These data point out the need to activate information and training programs on exposure to biological agents and on both emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases potentially related to work activities, and to provide prevention procedures specific for these workplaces.","['Tamburro M', 'Anzelmo V', 'Bianco P', 'Sammarco ML', 'Ripabelli G']",2018,40,4,G Ital Med Lav Ergon,"Tamburro M, et al.

30541601,Data and tools to integrate climate and environmental information into public health.,"BACKGROUND: During the last 30 years, the development of geographical information systems and satellites for Earth observation has made important progress in the monitoring of the weather, climate, environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence the reduction or the reemergence of vector-borne diseases. Analyses resulting from the combination of geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing have improved knowledge of climatic, environmental, and biodiversity factors influencing vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as malaria, visceral leishmaniasis, dengue, Rift Valley fever, schistosomiasis, Chagas disease and leptospirosis. These knowledge and products developed using remotely sensed data helped and continue to help decision makers to better allocate limited resources in the fight against VBDs.
MAIN BODY: Because VBDs are linked to climate and environment, we present here our experience during the last four years working with the projects under the, World Health Organization (WHO)/ The Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR)-International Development Research Centre (IDRC) Research Initiative on VBDs and Climate Change to integrate climate and environmental information into research and decision-making processes. The following sections present the methodology we have developed, which uses remote sensing to monitor climate variability, environmental conditions, and their impacts on the dynamics of infectious diseases. We then show how remotely sensed data can be accessed and evaluated and how they can be integrated into research and decision-making processes for mapping risks, and creating Early Warning Systems, using two examples from the WHO TDR projects based on schistosomiasis analysis in South Africa and Trypanosomiasis in Tanzania.
CONCLUSIONS: The tools presented in this article have been successfully used by the projects under the WHO/TDR-IDRC Research Initiative on VBDs and Climate Change. Combined with capacity building, they are an important piece of work which can significantly contribute to the goals of WHO Global Vector Control Response and to the Sustainable Development Goals especially those on health and climate action.","['Ceccato P', 'Ramirez B', 'Manyangadze T', 'Gwakisa P', 'Thomson MC']",2018,7,1,Infect Dis Poverty,"Ceccato P, et al.

30537301,Leptospira species promote a pro-inflammatory phenotype in human neutrophils.,"Leptospirosis is a global zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira. Neutrophils are key cells against bacterial pathogens but can also contribute to tissue damage. Because the information regarding the role of human neutrophils in leptospirosis is scant, we comparatively analysed the human neutrophil's response to saprophytic Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc (Patoc) and the pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni (LIC). Both species triggered neutrophil responses involved in migration, including the upregulation of CD11b expression, adhesion to collagen, and the release of IL-8. In addition, both species increased levels of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-6 associated with the inflammasome and NFκB pathway activation and delayed neutrophil apoptosis. LIC was observed on the neutrophil surface and not phagocytized. In contrast, Patoc generated intracellular ROS associated with its uptake. Neutrophils express the TYRO3, AXL, and MER receptor protein tyrosine kinases (TAM), but only LIC selectively increased the level of AXL. TLR2 but not TLR4-blocking antibodies abrogated the IL-8 secretion triggered by both Leptospira species. In summary, we demonstrate that Leptospira species trigger a robust neutrophil activation and pro-inflammatory response. These findings may be useful to find new diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies against leptospirosis.","['Charo N', 'Scharrig E', 'Ferrer MF', 'Sanjuan N', 'Carrera Silva EA', 'Schattner M', 'Gómez RM']",2019,21,2,Cell Microbiol,"Charo N, et al.

30502041,Diagnostic accuracy of rapid diagnostic tests for the early detection of leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is often misdiagnosed with several other tropical febrile illnesses in Malaysia due to similarities in clinical manifestations. Although treatment regimens could be started based on clinical judgments, early diagnosis has become paramount as a guide to chemotherapeutic interventions. Confirmed laboratory diagnosis through MAT or PCR is time consuming and usually available only in reference laboratories and not practical in healthcare settings. Rapid and easy to perform diagnostic tests are widely used in these settings as the point of care diagnosis. The present study was undertaken to compare the diagnostic performance of two IgM based immunodiagnostic assay kits for acute leptospirosis.
METHODS: A total of 50 serum samples were collected from patients clinically suspected for acute leptospirosis on admission in the Hospital Serdang, from June 2016 to June 2017. All the samples were subjected to MAT, lipL32 PCR and the two rapid tests (Leptocheck-WB and ImmuneMed Leptospira IgM Duo Rapid test).
RESULTS: Out of the 50 clinically suspected patients sampled, 19 were confirmed positive for leptospirosis. Six (12%) were confirmed by MAT and 13 (26%) by PCR. Similarly, of the 50 clinically suspected cases, 17 (34%) showed positivity for Leptocheck-WB and 7 (14%) for ImmuneMed Leptospira IgM Duo Rapid test. The overall sensitivity and specificity was 47.37% and 80.65% for Leptocheck-WB, and 21.05% and 90.32% for ImmuneMed Leptospira IgM Duo Rapid test. In another set of previously confirmed MAT positive samples (1:400-1:3600) obtained from a reference laboratory, Leptocheck-WB showed higher sensitivity (90.72%) than ImmuneMed Leptospira IgM Duo Rapid test (40.21%), and comparable specificity for ImmuneMed Leptospira IgM Duo Rapid test (88.89%) and Leptocheck-WB (82.86%).
CONCLUSION: The sensitivity was higher for Leptocheck-WB and had a comparable specificity with ImmuneMed Leptospira IgM Duo Rapid test. Therefore, based on the present study, Leptocheck-WB is found to be a more sensitive rapid immunodiagnostic test for acute leptospirosis screening in hospital settings.","['Alia SN', 'Joseph N', 'Philip N', 'Azhari NN', 'Garba B', 'Masri SN', 'Sekawi Z', 'Neela VK']",2019,12,2,J Infect Public Health,"Alia SN, et al.

In Peru, one of the most endemic regions to dengue and leptospirosis is Madre de Dios, a region also endemic to emergent bacterial etiologic agents of AFI, such as bartonellosis and rickettsiosis, whose prevalence is usually underreported. We aimed to molecularly identify the presence of Leptospira spp., Bartonella bacilliformis, and Rickettsia spp. by Polymerase Chain Reaction in serum samples from patients with AFI from Puerto Maldonado-Madre de Dios in Peru.
METHODS: Serum samples from patients with acute febrile illness were analyzed by real-time PCR for detecting the presence of Bartonella bacilliformis, Leptospira spp. and Rickettsia spp.
RESULTS: Bartonella bacilliformis was the most prevalent bacteria identified in 21.6% (30/139) of the samples, followed by Leptospira spp. in 11.5% (16/139) and Rickettsia spp. in 6.5% (9/139) of the samples. No co-infections were observed between these bacteria. The most frequent symptoms associated with fever among all groups, were headaches, myalgias, and arthralgias. We found no statistically significant differences in the clinical presentation between patients infected with each bacterium.
CONCLUSIONS: In a previous study, we shown the presence of dengue, chikungunya, Zika and oropouche virus. We were able to identify these pathogens in 29.5% of all the samples, with chikungunya and OROV as the most frequently found in 9.4 and 8.6% of all the samples, respectively. In this study we show that B. bacilliformis (21.6%), Leptospira spp. (11.5%) and Rickettsia spp. (6.5%) accounted for the main etiologies of AFI in samples from Puerto Maldonado-Madre de Dios, Perú.

30497412,A remotely sensed flooding indicator associated with cattle and buffalo leptospirosis cases in Thailand 2011-2013.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease worldwide, caused by spirochetes bacteria of the genus Leptospira. In Thailand, cattle and buffalo used in agriculture are in close contact with human beings. During flooding, bacteria can quickly spread throughout an environment, increasing the risk of leptospirosis infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of several environmental factors with cattle and buffalo leptospirosis cases in Thailand, with a focus on flooding.
METHOD: A total of 3571 urine samples were collected from cattle and buffalo in 107 districts by field veterinarians from January 2011 to February 2013. All samples were examined for the presence of leptospirosis infection by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Environmental data, including rainfall, percentage of flooded area (estimated by remote sensing), average elevation, and human and livestock population density were used to build a generalized linear mixed model.
RESULTS: A total of 311 out of 3571 (8.43%) urine samples tested positive by the LAMP technique. Positive samples were recorded in 51 out of 107 districts (47.66%). Results showed a significant association between the percentage of the area flooded at district level and leptospirosis infection in cattle and buffalo (p = 0.023). Using this data, a map with a predicted risk of leptospirosis can be developed to help forecast leptospirosis cases in the field.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model allows the identification of areas and periods when the risk of leptospirosis infection is higher in cattle and buffalo, mainly due to a seasonal flooding. The increased risk of leptospirosis infection can also be higher in humans too. These areas and periods should be targeted for leptospirosis surveillance and control in both humans and animals.","['Chadsuthi S', 'Chalvet-Monfray K', 'Wiratsudakul A', 'Suwancharoen D', 'Cappelle J']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Chadsuthi S, et al.

32012129,"Comparison of azithromycin vs doxycycline prophylaxis in leptospirosis, A randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial.","INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease in paddy field with 29.5% prevalence rate in Mazandaran province and 4% to 52% mortality rate among hospitalized patients. Prevention is an important strategy for the control of this disease. This study aimed to compare the prophylactic effect of azithromycin versus doxycycline against leptospirosis in an endemic area in north of Iran.
METHODOLOGY: In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, paddy field workers (n = 187) were randomized to receive azithromycin (500mg weekly), doxycycline (200 mg weekly) or placebo starting one week before exposure to paddy field, during and to four weeks after. Paddy field workers aged 18- 65 years who signed the informed consent form were assessed for signs and symptoms of leptospirosis in addition to serologic evidence of the disease 6th and 12th week. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 13 using Chi-square and Fisher exact test and ANOVA.
RESULTS: From June to September 2016, 187 participants were entered the study to receive azithromycin (n = 66), doxycycline (n = 71) or placebo (n = 50). In terms of preventing against clinical leptospirosis, there was not any significant difference between three arms, though there was statistically significant difference of seropositivity after 6 and 12 weeks in comparison to baseline among all three groups (P = 0.029) and between active treatment (eg. azithromycin and doxycycline) groups and placebo group (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Azithromycin like doxycycline decreased seropositivity without significant effect on clinical leptospirosis.","['Alikhani A', 'Salehifar E', 'Zameni F', 'Rafiei A', 'Yazdani-Charati J', 'Delavaryan L', 'Akbari A', 'Babamahmoudi F']",2018,12,11,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Alikhani A, et al.

30483374,Prevalence of dengue and leptospirosis co-infection in a tertiary care hospital in south India.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dengue and Leptospirosis were often discussed separately with rash being more common in dengue and jaundice in leptospirosis. But with increasing reports of co-infection, the situation has become worse. The main objective of this study was to look for the presence of both Dengue and Leptospira IgM antibodies in serum samples of patients, presenting with acute febrile illness. Medical records of the co-infected patients were examined to analyse the clinical features and laboratory findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples of patients presenting with acute febrile illness were screened for the presence of Dengue IgM antibodies and Leptospira antibodies. Clinical features and laboratory parameters of patients with co-infection were compared with patients having dengue alone. Rainfall data was obtained to look for an association between rainfall and Dengue, leptospirosis and co-infected cases.
RESULTS: Co-infection was seen in 33 (3.4%) samples. There was a statistically significant association between clinical features like rashes, bleeding gums and co-infection. There was a statistically significant association between various laboratory parameters like thrombocytopenia and co-infection. There was positive correlation between rainfall and development of dengue, leptospirosis, and co-infection but it was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of co-infection was 3.4%. This study re-emphasizes the fact that dengue and leptospirosis are widely prevalent in south India and clinicians should be aware that co-infection with dengue and leptospirosis is not uncommon.","['Sachu A', 'Madhavan A', 'Vasudevan A', 'Vasudevapanicker J']",2018,10,4,Iran J Microbiol,"Sachu A, et al.

30480504,A Cross-Cutting Approach to Surveillance and Laboratory Capacity as a Platform to Improve Health Security in Uganda.,"Global health security depends on effective surveillance for infectious diseases. In Uganda, resources are inadequate to support collection and reporting of data necessary for an effective and responsive surveillance system. We used a cross-cutting approach to improve surveillance and laboratory capacity in Uganda by leveraging an existing pediatric inpatient malaria sentinel surveillance system to collect data on expanded causes of illness, facilitate development of real-time surveillance, and provide data on antimicrobial resistance. Capacity for blood culture collection was established, along with options for serologic testing for select zoonotic conditions, including arboviral infection, brucellosis, and leptospirosis. Detailed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for all admissions were captured through a web-based system accessible at participating hospitals, laboratories, and the Uganda Public Health Emergency Operations Center. Between July 2016 and December 2017, the expanded system was activated in pediatric wards of 6 regional government hospitals. During that time, patient data were collected from 30,500 pediatric admissions, half of whom were febrile but lacked evidence of malaria. More than 5,000 blood cultures were performed; 4% yielded bacterial pathogens, and another 4% yielded likely contaminants. Several WHO antimicrobial resistance priority pathogens were identified, some with multidrug-resistant phenotypes, including Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. Leptospirosis and arboviral infections (alphaviruses and flaviviruses) were documented. The lessons learned and early results from the development of this multisectoral surveillance system provide the knowledge, infrastructure, and workforce capacity to serve as a foundation to enhance the capacity to detect, report, and rapidly respond to wide-ranging public health concerns in Uganda.","['Lamorde M', 'Mpimbaza A', 'Walwema R', 'Kamya M', 'Kapisi J', 'Kajumbula H', 'Sserwanga A', 'Namuganga JF', 'Kusemererwa A', 'Tasimwa H', 'Makumbi I', 'Kayiwa J', 'Lutwama J', 'Behumbiize P', 'Tagoola A', 'Nanteza JF', 'Aniku G', 'Workneh M', 'Manabe Y', 'Borchert JN', 'Brown V', 'Appiah GD', 'Mintz ED', 'Homsy J', 'Odongo GS', 'Ransom RL', 'Freeman MM', 'Stoddard RA', 'Galloway R', 'Mikoleit M', 'Kato C', 'Rosenberg R', 'Mossel EC', 'Mead PS', 'Kugeler KJ']",2018,16,S1,Health Secur,"Lamorde M, et al.

30472422,Diagnostic accuracy of leptospirosis whole-cell lateral flow assays: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is under-diagnosed by clinicians in many high-incidence countries, because reference diagnostic tests are largely unavailable. Lateral flow assays (LFA) that use antigen derived from heat-treated whole cell Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc have the potential to improve leptospirosis diagnosis in resource-limited settings.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to summarize estimates of sensitivity and specificity of LFA by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of evaluations of the accuracy of LFA to diagnose human leptospirosis.
DATA SOURCES: On 4 July 2017 we searched three medical databases. Study eligibility criteriaArticles were included if they were a study of LFA sensitivity and specificity.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with suspected leptospirosis.
INTERVENTIONS: Nil.
METHODS: For included articles, we assessed study quality, characteristics of participants and diagnostic testing methods. We estimated sensitivity and specificity for each study against the study-defined case definition as the reference standard, and performed a meta-analysis using a random-effects bivariate model.
RESULTS: Our search identified 225 unique reports, of which we included nine (4%) published reports containing 11 studies. We classified one (9%) study as high quality. Nine (82%) studies used reference tests with considerable risk of misclassification. Our pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 79% (95% CI 70%-86%) and 92% (95% CI 85%-96%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: As the evidence base for determining the accuracy of LFA is small and at risk of bias, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity should be interpreted with caution. Further studies should use either reference tests with high sensitivity and specificity or statistical techniques that account for an imperfect reference standard.","['Maze MJ', 'Sharples KJ', 'Allan KJ', 'Rubach MP', 'Crump JA']",2019,25,4,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Maze MJ, et al.

30465742,Peridomestic small Indian mongoose: An invasive species posing as potential zoonotic risk for leptospirosis in the Caribbean.,"In this study, we investigated Leptospira infection and exposure in small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus), an invasive animal species, in two different sites in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts. Overall a low seroprevalence (12/148; 8.1%: 95%CI: 3.7-12.5) was observed. Agglutinating antibodies to serovars Mankarso (3.4%), Copenhageni (2.7%), Icterohemorrhagiae (1.4%), Bratislava (1.4%), Canicola (1.4%), Autumnalis (0.7%), Alexi (0.7%), Pomona (0.7%) and Grippotyphosa (0.7%) was observed on the microscopic agglutination test. The seroprevalence observed in mongooses trapped from peridomestic sites was significantly higher compared to the arid and less inhabited site (p = 0.0268). The real time PCR targeting lipL32 gene was positive for 9 out of 146 mongooses. Bacterial culture of kidneys resulted in two Leptospira isolates. Whole genome sequencing and analysis suggested that these isolates are closely related to L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni. We observed mild to severe chronic renal lesions in 20.2% of mongooses in the absence of an antibody response or active infection. Our findings emphasize the need to investigate other infectious etiologies or atypical outcomes and potential chronic long-term impact of Leptospira infection in animals and people living in an endemic area. In addition, our data reinforces the need for including locally prevalent Leptospira isolates rather than representative members of a serogroup in the microscopic agglutination test panel in epidemiologic and diagnostic investigations. In conclusion, mongoose inhabiting the island are exposed to and harbor pathogenic Leptospira and hence may play a role in the transmission. The invasive nature of the species highlights their presence as a potential risk factor for this widespread zoonotic disease.","['Shiokawa K', 'Llanes A', 'Hindoyan A', 'Cruz-Martinez L', 'Welcome S', 'Rajeev S']",2019,190,,Acta Trop,"Shiokawa K, et al.

Infected dogs may become asymptomatic carriers of the pathogen, which leads to many public health concerns. In this work, we present the complete genome sequencing and in silico analysis from a virulent Brazilian strain of L. interrogans serovar Canicola, previously isolated from a stray dog in Sao Paulo City. Comparative genomic analysis with a reference genome allowed identification of 1031 INDELs and several arrangement variations. Out of 35,361 SNPs identified, 6780 were missense mutations and 16,114 were synonymous mutations. The Gene Ontology terms more affected by mutations were described. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses indicated a genetic relatedness of the isolate with serovar Linhai strain 56,609. In addition, we found several virulence-related genes and main outer membrane proteins associated with pathogenesis. This genomic information about canine isolates may help to elucidate the molecular diversity and mechanisms of Leptospira spp. pathogenicity.","['Jorge S', 'Miotto BA', 'Kremer FS', 'Cagliari R', 'de Oliveira NR', 'Heinemann MB', 'da Silva Pinto L', 'Hagiwara MK', 'Campos VF', 'Dellagostin OA']",2019,111,6,Genomics,"Jorge S, et al.

30429392,Evaluation of an in-house LipL32 polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of leptospirosis and its correlation with various serological diagnostic techniques.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of ubiquitous distribution. During rainy seasons, in spring and summer and also during harvest times, the risk of leptospirosis increases as there are chances of frequent contact with infected rat population which is common in Karnataka as farming is a main source of income to the people here. There is a paucity of data regarding the prevalent serovars from Karnataka. This study was undertaken as an attempt to compare a battery of tools such as immunochromatographic test (ICT), microscopic agglutination test (MAT), immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect leptospirosis.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study using consecutive sampling technique was conducted in a tertiary care centre, Mysore, Karnataka.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Samples from 783 suspected cases of leptospirosis in and around Mysore between April 2013 and April 2016 were processed. Samples from 783 patients suspected of leptospirosis were subjected to ICT, IgM ELISA, MAT and in-house PCR.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software version.
RESULTS: Among 783 samples tested, only 14 (1.7%) were positive by ICT, 341 (44%) were positive by IgM ELISA, 368 (47%) were positive by MAT and 393 (50.2%) were positive by in-house PCR.

Leptospiruria was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing for pathogenic leptospires in all five dogs. In two dogs, leptospiruria resolved after a change in therapy to enrofloxacin. In three dogs, doxycycline and/or enrofloxacin were ineffective at eliminating leptospiruria, which then resolved after therapy with clarithromycin.

Leptospirosis vaccines are claimed to afford a clinical protection restricted to the serogroups of which they are composed.
OBJECTIVES: Dogs exhibiting liver and kidney injury were suspected of having leptospirosis. The purpose of this study was to compare the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) results in naive and vaccinated dogs experiencing leptospirosis outcomes. Only MAT-positive animals were included in the study.
METHODS: Over five years, 3 512 dogs were suspected of having leptospirosis. For each case, biochemical parameter results were recorded. Leptospirosis involvement was investigated by MAT performed against 6 major serogroups (Icterohaemorrhagiae, Canicola, Australis, Autumnalis, Grippotyphosa and Sejroë). MAT-positive results confirmed leptospirosis cases in 147 naïve dogs and in 580 fully vaccinated dogs. Serological titres of agglutinating antibodies were related to the severity of liver and kidney failure.
RESULTS: The most prevalent outcome of leptospirosis in unvaccinated dogs was liver failure (57.8%) compared to 51.7% for kidney disease, but the most severe onset (90.8%) was found among the cases of acute kidney injury compared to the severe (42.3%) hepatitis cases. In dogs vaccinated by bivalent Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola bacterins, hepatitis decreased from 57.8 to 46.5% and acute kidney injury from 51.7 to 21.6%.

30418677,Comparative screening of recombinant antigen thermostability for improved leptospirosis vaccine design.,"Recombinant antigens exhibit targeted protectiveproperties and offer important opportunities in the development of therapeutic technologies. Biophysical and structural methods have become important tools for the rational design and engineering of improved antigen-based vaccines. Vaccines containing Leptospira immunoglobulin-like (Lig) protein-derived antigens are currently the most promising candidates for protective immunity against the globally prevalent bacterial pathogen, Leptospira interrogans; however, vaccine trials using these domains have produced inconsistent results. Here, we compare the thermostability of domains from the main immunogenic regions from major leptospiral antigens, LigA and LigB. By measuring temperature-dependent fluorescence decay of the hydrophobic core tryptophan, 17 individual Lig protein immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains were shown to display a broad range of unfolding temperatures. For a majority of the domains, stability issues begin to occur at physiologically relevant temperatures. A set of chimeric Ig-like domains was used to establish the ability of transplanted domain regions to enhance thermostability. Further insights into the determinants for domain stabilization were explored with nuclear magnetic resonance dynamics and mutational analysis. The current study has yielded a set of thermostable Ig-like domain scaffolds for use in engineering antigen-based vaccines and demonstrates the importance of incorporating thermostability screening as a design parameter.","['Ptak CP', 'Akif M', 'Hsieh CL', 'Devarajan A', 'He P', 'Xu Y', 'Oswald RE', 'Chang YF']",2019,116,2,Biotechnol Bioeng,"Ptak CP, et al.

Leptospirosis associated myocardial dysfunction is equivocal and the pattern of cardiac involvement may not differ from that of sepsis associated myocarditis.
METHODS: We prospectively compared cardiac involvement in 113 intensive care unit patients with severe leptospirosis to 31 patients with sepsis syndrome using a comprehensive assessment comprising of clinical presentation, electrocardiography, two-dimensional echocardiography (with global longitudinal strain calculation), and cardiac biomarker evaluation. Binomial logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in leptospirosis.
RESULTS: Compared to sepsis syndrome, leptospirosis patients were younger, had higher body mass index measurements and were more likely to be smokers. Electrocardiography abnormalities were common and similar in both groups. Myocardial systolic dysfunction was common in both groups (leptospirosis: 55.86% vs sepsis syndrome: 51.61%, 
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac involvement in leptospirosis appears to be similar to that of sepsis syndrome, with myocardial systolic dysfunction being common. As such, clinical vigilance pertaining to cardiac status is paramount in these high-risk patients.","['Mathew A', 'Shanks M', 'Punnoose E', 'Fischer L', 'Koshy G', 'Potluri R', 'Bainey KR']",2020,9,8,Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,"Mathew A, et al.

30394053,Leptospirosis in Poland in the years 2014-2017 – characteristics of infections and epidemiological surveillance data.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was the analysis of current Leptospira spp. infections in Poland on the basis of blood serum samples tests results and clinical data collected from clinicians in the Laboratory NIPH-NIH.
METHODS: Clinical materials from 48 patients with clinical symptoms suggesting Leptospira spp suspected of leptospirosis from the years 2014-2017 were included to the study. Blood serum samples collected from patients were tested in Laboratory of Rickettsiae, Chlamydiae and Spirochaetes (currently Laboratory of Vector-borne Diseases) of NIPH-NIH. Levels of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to Leptospira spp. antigens were detected with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: Specific antibodies to Leptospira spp. were detected in 18 patients (37.5%). IgM antibodies were found in 6 patients (12.5%) and IgG antibodies were identified in 7 patients (14.6%). Both classes of antibodies of were detected in 5 patients (10.4%). The most samples for study were sent to laboratory from Masovian (13 samples) and Kuyavian-Pomeranian (11 samples) Voivodeships. Not any samples from the Lower Silesia, Lublin, Łódź, Podlaskie and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeships were received. In these patients the most common symptoms of disease were: fever, hepatitis with jaundice and renal failure.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of diagnosed human leptospirosis in Poland is low in comparison to the number of cases in other countries, although the Leptospira spp. spirochetes occur in animals in the environment.","['Fiecek B', 'Lewandowska G', 'Rogulska U', 'Chmielewski T']",2018,72,3,Przegl Epidemiol,"Fiecek B, et al.

30390933,Analysis of the spatial distribution of scientific publications regarding vector-borne diseases related to climate variability in South America.,"Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other climate variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. Likewise, climate can be determinant in outbreaks incidence. A growing number of studies have provided evidence indicating the effects of climate variability on vector-borne diseases. However, oftentimes, the different diseases and regions are not uniformly represented, scarcity or lack of publications in some countries is common. The objectives of this work were to analyze the distribution and abundance of publications on vector-borne diseases associated with climate variability in South America, identify those works that conducted a geographic analysis and detect the countries where outbreaks occurred and the climate variables with which they were associated. A systematic review of the literature published on vector-borne diseases linked to climate variability in South America was conducted, identifying, evaluating and summarizing scientific papers. The distribution of the study areas and disease type in the publications were represented on maps. Dengue and leishmaniasis were the most studied and widely represented diseases in South America. The country with the largest number of published papers and presence of all disease types was Brazil. Outbreaks of disease were related to different climate variables. Most diseases from the publications under study occurred in equatorial and tropical climates. The disease represented by the largest number of different types of climates was dengue. The technique used in this work allowed us to determine the status of knowledge of the main diseases associated with climate variability in South America. This methodology could be improved in the future by incorporating other bibliographic sources as well as other diseases related to climate variability.","['López MS', 'Müller GV', 'Sione WF']",2018,26,,Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,"López MS, et al.

30388737,"Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Health Beliefs toward Leptospirosis among Urban and Rural Communities in Northeastern Malaysia.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution, especially in developing countries such as Malaysia. This study was designed to explore the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices (KABP) toward leptospirosis among the communities in northeastern Malaysia and to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with the KABP toward leptospirosis. A cross-sectional study using a stratified sampling method was conducted among 214 individuals in four locales in northeastern Malaysia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 214 respondents in northeastern Malaysia using a multi-stage stratified random sampling method. The study population was divided into two groups based on geographical locations: urban and rural. All data were entered and analyzed using the IBM Statistics for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0 software for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The continuous variables were presented using mean and standard deviation (SD), whereas the categorical variables were described using frequency and percentage. Multiple logistic regression was performed to determine the associated factors for good KABP toward leptospirosis among the respondents.
RESULTS: It was found that 52.8% of respondents had good knowledge, 84.6% had positive attitudes, 59.8% had positive beliefs, and 53.7% had satisfactory practices. There were no significant sociodemographic factors associated with knowledge and practice, except for educational status, which was significant in the attitude and belief domains. Those with higher education exhibited better attitudes (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.329; 95% Coefficient Interval (CI): 1.140, 9.723; 
CONCLUSIONS: Our current health program on preventing leptospirosis is good in creating awareness and a positive attitude among the communities, but is not sufficient in promoting satisfactory practice habits. In conclusion, more attention needs to be paid to promoting satisfactory practice habits among the communities, as they already possess good knowledge and positive attitudes and beliefs.","['A P', 'Bd A', 'Wm Z', 'S MN', 'S S', 'Tj TZ', 'Ra H', 'O M', 'I N', 'I Z', 'Aw Z']",2018,15,11,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"A P, et al.

Consequently, free-roaming cats can act as a reservoir for possible zoonotic infections. In this study, 140 cats were prospectively recruited over a 12-month period from a free-roaming cat spay and neuter clinic and a local animal shelter in the state of Iowa. The presence of antileptospiral antibodies was measured using a microscopic agglutination test against six leptospiral serovars (canicola, pomona, icterhemorrhagiae, bratislava, hardjo, and grippotyphosa). In addition, serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii and Dirofilaria immitis using an ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay, respectively. Serum samples from 12/139 cats (8.6%) were positive for the leptospiral serovars tested, with bratislava having the highest prevalence. Cats were more likely to be positive in the spring than in the fall or summer. Positive titers to T. gondii and D. immitis were present in 42/140 cats (30%) and 9/140 cats (6.4%), respectively. Cats >72 months of age were more likely to be seropositive to T. gondii than cats in younger age groups. Feline Leptospira spp. seroprevalence was higher in this Midwestern location than has previously been reported elsewhere in the United States.

Seroprevalence rates vary with geography, but many studies have confirmed a high exposure rate. The correlation between seropositivity and shedding status has not been made in horses, however. The aims of this study were to use semi-nested PCR on urine from apparently healthy horses to determine period prevalence of leptospiral shedding and to correlate these findings with MAT results to establish associations with client based survey data regarding horse management and environment. Serum and free-catch urine were collected from 204 healthy horses between May 2016-December 2017. Serum was used to determine GGT, creatinine concentrations, and six serovar MAT. Urine samples were submitted for PCR testing of leptospiral 23S rRNA. Client consent and survey data were collected for all subjects. Potential risk factors included drinking water source, exposure to livestock and dogs, geographical location, season, and precipitation. Two horses were positive on urine PCR for leptospirosis (shedding prevalence 1%), yet only one had a high reciprocal MAT titer of ≥ 800. Both horses were negative on urine PCR one month later without treatment. Approximately 77% of horses (157/204) were seroreactive (MAT reciprocal titer ≥ 100) with titers to serogroup Australis detected more frequently than others (47.5%; (97/204)). Apparently healthy horses infrequently shed Leptospira spp. in urine, yet seroreactivity in clinically normal horses is high (77%), confirming high exposure rates to Leptospira spp. in the Central Midwest.","['Trimble AC', 'Blevins CA', 'Beard LA', 'Deforno AR', 'Davis EG']",2018,13,10,PLoS One,"Trimble AC, et al.

30372412,"A 3-year retrospective analysis on the prevalence of antileptospiral antibodies among children in Chennai City, India.","PURPOSE: Leptospirosis is a re-emerging infectious disease that has been reported from all over the world, including South India. Several studies have documented the prevalence of Leptospira in the general population. However, the data on leptospirosis in children were limited. We evaluated the prevalence of antileptospiral antibodies and the distribution of Leptospira serovars in children and adolescents.
METHODOLOGY: In this retrospective study, details for a total of 5407 children who presented with fever and whose test results for antileptospiral antibodies available were recorded. A microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was performed to detect the presence of anti-leptospiral antibodies and a titre of more than 1 : 80 was considered positive. The antigen panel included the following six serovars: Icterohaemorrhagiae, Canicola, Autumnalis, Australis, Grippotyphosa and Patoc. Demographics such as age and gender were recorded.
RESULTS: An overall seropositivity rate of 30.8 % (95 % CI: 21.54-25.81) was observed. More male children (59 %) were infected than female children (41 %). Leptospirosis occurs throughout the year among children. Cases peak in the summer time and during the months of November and December. The most prevalent serovar in this study was L. Canicola followed by L. Australis and L. Autumnalis.
CONCLUSION: This seroprevalence study suggested that leptospirosis occurs among children throughout the year in Chennai, India. This makes it almost mandatory to include it in the differential diagnosis for febrile illnesses in children. Early detection and treatment, together with control measures, may significantly reduce the spread of this endemic pathogen in this city.","['Jacob SM', 'Geethalakshmi S', 'Karthikeyan S', 'Durairaj A', 'Gopal P', 'Ramamoorthy V', 'Arumugam G', 'Elumalai S']",2018,67,12,J Med Microbiol,"Jacob SM, et al.

This paper introduces the willingness-to-contribute (WTC) method for estimating the economic benefit of preventing leptospirosis. A cross-sectional study using the WTC method was applied to measure how much time respondents in Kelantan were willing to contribute toward preventing leptospirosis. Study respondents were wet market traders aged 18 years old and above who were fluent in the Malay language. The average WTC value was multiplied by the population of Kelantan to derive the monetary value of preventing leptospirosis. Two hundred and fifty respondents participated in the study. The mean time contribution was 6.68 hours (SD9.01) per month. The average WTC corresponded to a monthly cost savings of US$4.94 per person. Approximately between US$106.7 million to US$315 million per annum can be saved through the prevention of leptospirosis in Kelantan. Preventing leptospirosis is beneficial to Kelantan and would bring major economic savings.

As the incidence of leptospirosis increases after such flooding in Mumbai, community chemoprophylaxis to selected individuals was a consensus recommendation by experts.
METHODS: We surveyed a total of 1 499 293 houses in severely affected areas of Mumbai (where there was waterlogging or high incidence of leptospirosis in the past) as well as in all slum areas. A total of 6 714 210 people (>50% of the population) were screened. A total of 156 934 adults, 4465 children, 359 pregnant women and 4957 high-risk adults were given prophylaxis with doxycycline or azithromycin by paramedical staff (n = 9526) under the supervision of medical staff. Social media and newspaper advertisements were used to create public awareness.
RESULTS: Compared with previous floods, there were reduced number of cases of leptospirosis due to community chemoprophylaxis (432 confirmed cases in 2005 v. 128 [59 confirmed] in 2017).

30348108,Falsely positive anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies in a patient with hantavirus induced acute kidney injury - a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Hantavirus infection is an uncommon cause of acute renal failure with massive proteinuria. Serology tests to support a presumptive diagnosis usually take a few days. During the initial work-up, autoimmune causes including anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis need to be excluded, because these require urgent therapy. In this case the delay in serological testing caused a dilemma in treatment initiation.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with acute renal failure, erythrocyturia and massive proteinuria. Routine blood analysis showed leucocytosis (40,5 × 109/l) and a serum creatinine of 233 μmol/l. Infectious causes, e.g. leptospirosis or hantavirus infection, or an autoimmune disease, e.g., AAV or anti-GBM glomerulonephritis was the most feasible underlying diagnosis. Before hantavirus serology results were known, anti-GBM antibodies were positive. Treatment for anti-GBM glomerulonephritis was withheld, because of the absence of other signs and symptoms of the disease and slight improvement of renal function. The diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection was later on confirmed, by seroconversion of a follow-up serum sample. Without further intervention renal function recovered and anti-GBM antibodies disappeared.
CONCLUSION: Hantavirus infection may induce anti-GBM antibodies, falsely suggestive of anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. Anti-GBM antibodies are supposed to be 100% specific. No earlier reports of false positive anti-GBM titers were reported. Nevertheless, the anti-GBM antibodies in this case were seen as an innocent bystander effect. Considering the need of urgent initiation of plasmapheresis and administration of immunosuppressants it may lead to diagnostic dilemmas with crucial therapeutic consequences. Knowledge of this anomaly when diagnosing acute renal failure, is very important.","['Zijlstra HW', 'Mulder AHL', 'Geeraedts F', 'Visser F']",2018,19,1,BMC Nephrol,"Zijlstra HW, et al.

Hemorrhage is a typical pathological feature of leptospirosis. Binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to platelet glycoprotein-Ibα (GPIbα) is a crucial step in initiation of platelet aggregation. The products of L. interrogans vwa-I and vwa-II genes contain vWF-A domains, but their ability to induce hemorrhage has not been determined.
METHODS: Human (Hu)-platelet- and Hu-GPIbα-binding abilities of the recombinant proteins expressed by L. interrogans strain Lai vwa-I and vwa-II genes (rLep-vWA-I and rLep-vWA-II) were detected by flowcytometry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Hu-platelet aggregation and its signaling kinases and active components were detected by lumiaggregometry, Western analysis, spectrophotometry and confocal microscopy. Hu-GPIbα-binding sites in rLep-vWA-I and rLep-vWA-II were identified by SPR/ITC measurements.
FINDINGS: Both rLep-vWA-I and rLep-vWA-II were able to bind to Hu-platelets and inhibit rHu-vWF/ristocetin-induced Hu-platelet aggregation, but Hu-GPIbα-IgG, rLep-vWA-I-IgG and rLep-vWA-II-IgG blocked this binding or inhibition. SPR and ITC revealed a tight interaction between Hu-GPIbα and rLep-vWA-I/rLep-vWA-II with K

Afterward, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests were performed to identify the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), Neospora caninum parasite, and serovars of Leptospira species. In the PCR test, the samples with 380 bp, 340 bp, and 173 bp bands were considered as positive for serovars of Leptospira, Neospora caninum, and BHV-1, respectively. Moreover, a 290 bp band was regarded to be BVDV in the RT-PCR. According to the findings of the current study, 39 (30.47%) of the samples were infected with Neospora caninum, 26 (20.31%) with BVDV, 17 (13.28%) with BHV-1, and 18 (14.06%) with serovars of Leptospira. In addition, multiple-agent infections were also detected in the samples. As a conclusion, the microorganism Neospora caninum was identified as the most prevalent infectious cause of abortion in the eight agro-industrial and livestock complexes, in Qazvin province, Iran.","['Kaveh A', 'Merat E', 'Samani S', 'Danandeh S', 'Soltan Nezhad S']",2017,72,4,Arch Razi Inst,"Kaveh A, et al.

30310115,Spatiotemporal dynamics and risk factors for human Leptospirosis in Brazil.,"Leptospirosis is an emerging neglected tropical disease with a worldwide significant global health burden. Between 2000 and 2016, there were 63,302 cases of human leptospirosis and 6,064 deaths reported in Brazil. We modeled the spatiotemporal risk dynamics of human leptospirosis morbidity and lethality, and attributed an easily interpretable risk-based priority index (PI) for all Brazilian federative units to suggest improvements to the national surveillance system. We also developed a conceptual framework of causality and estimated the effects of environmental and socioeconomic determinants of morbidity and lethality. Spatiotemporal risk patterns of morbidity and lethality differed. For morbidity, the pattern was mainly spatial, whereas lethality was mainly explained by the spatiotemporal interaction. The hypothesized causal model explained a relevant fraction of the heterogeneity in the spatial and spatiotemporal interaction patterns. The increase in soil moisture, precipitation, poverty, and the decrease in the proportion of urban households, acted as risk factors. The increase in the proportion of households in which waste is directly collected and in temperature were preventive factors. The structured temporal trend was increasing for morbidity and decreasing for lethality. In terms of morbidity, it was clear that the prioritization should be focused in a couple of states, mainly Acre. In terms of lethality, the allocation of resources need not be as asymmetric, but there was nonetheless a prioritization order. The proposed approach can be used to characterize spatiotemporal dynamics of other diseases and to inform decision makers.","['Baquero OS', 'Machado G']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,Baquero OS and Machado G.

30307936,Predictive risk mapping of an environmentally-driven infectious disease using spatial Bayesian networks: A case study of leptospirosis in Fiji.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease responsible for over 1 million severe cases and 60,000 deaths annually. The wide range of animal hosts and complex environmental drivers of transmission make targeted interventions challenging, particularly when restricted to regression-based analyses which have limited ability to deal with complexity. In Fiji, important environmental and socio-demographic factors include living in rural areas, poverty, and livestock exposure. This study aims to examine drivers of transmission under different scenarios of environmental and livestock exposures.
METHODS: Spatial Bayesian networks (SBN) were used to analyse the influence of livestock and poverty on the risk of leptospirosis infection in urban compared to rural areas. The SBN models used a combination of spatially-explicit field data from previous work and publically available census information. Predictive risk maps were produced for overall risk, and for scenarios related to poverty, livestock, and urban/rural setting.
RESULTS: While high, rather than low, commercial dairy farm density similarly increased the risk of infection in both urban (12% to 18%) and rural areas (70% to 79%), the presence of pigs in a village had different impact in rural (43% to 84%) compared with urban areas (4% to 24%). Areas with high poverty rates were predicted to have 26.6% and 18.0% higher probability of above average seroprevalence in rural and urban areas, respectively. In urban areas, this represents >300% difference between areas of low and high poverty, compared to 43% difference in rural areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the use of SBN to provide valuable insights into the drivers of leptospirosis transmission under complex scenarios. By estimating the risk of leptospirosis infection under different scenarios, such as urban versus rural areas, these subgroups or areas can be targeted with more precise interventions that focus on the most relevant key drivers of infection.","['Mayfield HJ', 'Smith CS', 'Lowry JH', 'Watson CH', 'Baker MG', 'Kama M', 'Nilles EJ', 'Lau CL']",2018,12,10,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Mayfield HJ, et al.

30299510,Heparin-Binding Protein Release Is Strongly Induced by Leptospira Species and Is a Candidate for an Early Diagnostic Marker of Human Leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira, is one of the most widespread zoonoses worldwide. Efficient diagnostic methods for early diagnosis of leptospirosis are still lacking, and acute disease presents with nonspecific symptomatology and is often misdiagnosed. The leptospires pathogenic processes and virulence mechanisms remain virtually unknown. In severe infections, hemostatic impairment is frequently observed, and pathophysiological complications often develop when the host response is modulated by the pathogen. The neutrophil heparin-binding protein (HBP) is an inflammatory mediator and potent inducer of vascular leakage.
RESULTS: In this study, we found that leptospires and their secreted products induce the release of HBP from stimulated neutrophils through a controlled degranulation mechanism. We acknowledged 2 leptospiral proteins as able to induce HBP degranulation. These findings have clinical implications, as high levels of HBP were detected in serum from patients with leptospirosis, especially at the early phase of the disease.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we describe a new mechanism by which the leptospirosis pathophysiological complications may arise, such as vascular leakage and edema formation. We also propose HBP as a new early screening biomarker for human leptospirosis.","['Vieira ML', 'Persson S', 'Lopes-Ferreira M', 'Romero EC', 'Kirchgatter K', 'Nascimento ALTO', 'Herwald H']",2019,219,6,J Infect Dis,"Vieira ML, et al.

Leptospirosis is hard to identify in the tropical setting because of co-circulating diseases. This is not the case in the temperate setting, such as Europe, where the few historical differential diagnoses were malaria, typhoid, and viral hepatitis. Leptospirosis presumably caused community epidemics in Europe before 1900 and military epidemiologists carefully documented outbreaks in ""constrained settings."" Achille Kelsch (1841-1911) synthesized available military data and epidemiological perspectives to define ""epidemic jaundice"" as a nosological continuum, caused by an infectious agent found in muds and water. He viewed Weil's disease as being only one form of that now well-identified disease continuum. The causative pathogen and epidemiological determinants were identified years later. The role of soils and muds as intermediate reservoirs, as suggested by Kelsch, deserves further investigation.","['Tarantola A', 'Goarant C']",2018,99,6,Am J Trop Med Hyg,Tarantola A and Goarant C.

30297490,Uncommon manifestation of leptospirosis: a diagnostic challenge.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease commonly affecting the tropical countries. It may have protean clinical manifestations including hepatorenal dysfunction, myocarditis, pulmonary haemorrhage, meningitis, optic neuritis and rhabdomyolysis. Neurological manifestation of leptospirosis without the classical hepatorenal dysfunction is a rare entity. This complication of leptospirosis can present with diverse central and peripheral neurological presentations. The overlapping clinical manifestations with many common tropical pathogens often pose diagnostic dilemma and delay in definitive therapy may lead to adverse clinical consequences. We report a case of a 19-year-old man with no prior comorbidities presenting with high-grade fever and altered sensorium. He was diagnosed to be a probable case of leptospirosis, based on all available test results and by fulfilment of parameters under modified Faine's criteria.

30280711,Coinfections as an aetiology of acute undifferentiated febrile illness among adult patients in the sub-Himalayan region of north India.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In India, certain geographic regions witness simultaneous outbreaks of two or more diseases like scrub typhus, dengue fever, malaria, leptospirosis and chikungunya during monsoon and post-monsoon period, sharing common indication of acute febrile illness. The objective of the present study was to assess the prevalence of coinfections among patients with acute undifferentiated fevers (AUF) admitted in a tertiary care hospital in the northern hilly state of Himachal Pradesh, India.
METHODS: This was a hospital based open cohort study conducted over a period of two months (September and October) in 2016. All the patients above the age of 18 yr admitted in medical wards and fulfilling the definition of AUF were included. The patients diagnosed with dual infections were the subjects of the study. Standard guidelines were used for case definitions of scrub typhus, dengue, chikungunya, malaria and leptospirosis.
RESULTS: Dual infections were noted in 16 patients admitted with AUF. The most common coinfection was scrub typhus and dengue, reported in 10 patients. Scrub typhus and leptospirosis coinfection was observed in three patients. Dengue and chikungunya was observed in one patient. Scrub typhus, dengue and vivax malaria was detected in one patient. Scrub typhus and vivax malaria was detected in one patient. Out of the 10 cases positive for both scrub and dengue, four had no history of travel outside Himachal Pradesh. All three cases positive for both scrub and leptospirosis were indigenous without any history of travel outside Kangra, Himachal Pradesh. The outcome of all the patients was with full recovery.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The study established the presence of coinfections (mainly dengue fever and leptospirosis) as a cause of AUF in the study area, which is a nonendemic region. The role of easily available and widely performed serological tests in the aetiological diagnosis of AUF is significant. Studies are required to determine the normal titres in the local population before using the imported commercially available serological tests in the diagnosis of AUF.","['Raina S', 'Raina RK', 'Agarwala N', 'Raina SK', 'Sharma R']",2018,55,2,J Vector Borne Dis,"Raina S, et al.

Sph2, a member of the sphingomyelinase haemolysins, is an important virulence factor for leptospire. In this study, the function and mechanism of Sph2 in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis were investigated to further understand the pathogenesis of leptospire. Real-time PCR analysis of expression levels during cell invasion showed that sph2 gene expression was transiently induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human embryo liver cells (L02), and human epithelial lung cells (L132), with expression levels reaching a peak after 45 min of infection. Further functional analysis of recombinant Sph2 (rSph2) by LDH assays and confocal microscopy showed that rSph2 can be internalised by cells both by causing cell membrane damage and by a damage-independent clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. Subsequently, rSph2 is able to translocate to mitochondria, which led to an increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ","['Che R', 'Ding S', 'Zhang Q', 'Yang W', 'Yan J', 'Lin X']",2019,21,1,Cell Microbiol,"Che R, et al.

30260259,Genetic diversity of Leptospira interrogans circulating isolates and vaccine strains in China from 1954-2014.,"Leptospirosis is one of the most important but neglected, infectious tropical diseases worldwide. Leptospira interrogans is now recognized as a leading cause of the disease. Little is known of the genetic diversity and phylogenetic characteristics of L. interrogans within China. To better understand the transmission and genetic diversity of L. interrogans populations, we characterized 271 isolates and seven vaccine strains from China during 1954-2014 using multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). 110 different L. interrogans MLVA profiles (MTs) were identified, of which five were predominant, reflecting a high level of genetic diversity in L. interrogans population in China. Different from that of circulating isolates, seven vaccine strains have different MT, of which some are phylogenetically away from the circulating isolates. The results showed that Icterohaemorrhagiae, Hebdomadis, and Canicola ranked as the top three serogroups among L. interrogans strains tested. The cluster analysis demonstrate the clonal links between rodent and human isolates, suggesting the rodent species played a key role in the transmission of leptospirosis to humans, and contributed to the circulation of the pathogen in humans. Taken together, these findings should provide insight into a better knowledge of the epidemiology and molecular evolution of L. interrogans in China. Furthermore, the results should facilitate the selection of candidate vaccine strains in the future.","['Zhang C', 'Li Z', 'Xu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Li S', 'Zhang J', 'Cui S', 'Du Z', 'Xin X', 'Chang YF', 'Jiang X', 'Ye Q']",2019,15,2,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Zhang C, et al.

In particular, we consider a model for infectious diseases with free-living pathogens in the environment and a metapopulation model with a central patch. We give the detailed derivation of the target reproduction number under three public health interventions and provide the corresponding biological insights. Moreover, using the next-generation approach, we calculate the basic reproduction numbers associated with subsystems of our models and determine algebraic connections to the target reproduction number of the complete model. The analysis presented here illustrates that understanding the topological structure of the infection process and partitioning it into simple cycles is useful to design and evaluate the control strategies.","['Saldaña F', 'Barradas I']",2018,80,11,Bull Math Biol,Saldaña F and Barradas I.

We determined whether Leptospira spp. were present across a gradient of housing densities in the urban and suburban black bear population in and around Asheville, North Carolina using serologic and molecular surveys. We collected blood from captured black bears ( n=94) and kidneys and bladders from carcasses ( n=19).

Rodents are the most relevant reservoirs of Leptospira spp. because the bacteria establish and reproduce in its renal tissue and are excreted through the urine. Objective: To identify the presence of Leptospira spp. in renal tissue from rodents captured in Yucatán, México. Materials and methods: Synanthropic and wild rodents were captured in the rural municipality of Cenotillo, Yucatán, México. We collected one kidney from each rodent and extracted the total DNA. The identification of Leptospira spp. was done by detecting two fragments of the 16S rRNA gene using end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We sequenced and analyzed positive products using alignment tools. Results: A total of 92 rodents belonging to seven different species were captured. The PCR yielded a global positivity of 5.4% (5/92). The alignment analysis of the sequenced products demonstrated a 100% of coverage and identity with Leptospira interrogans. This is the first molecular evidence of Leptospira spp. circulation in Heteromys gaumeri captured in Yucatán, México. Conclusion: Our results evidenced that rodents of Yucatán are reservoirs of Leptospira spp. and participate in the infection cycle of leptospirosis in the region.","['Torres-Castro M', 'Cruz-Camargo B', 'Medina-Pinto R', 'Reyes-Hernández B', 'Moguel-Lehmer C', 'Medina R', 'Ortiz-Esquivel J', 'Arcila-Fuentes W', 'López-Ávila A', 'No-Pech H', 'Panti-May A', 'Rodríguez-Vivas I', 'Puerto FI']",2018,38,0,Biomedica,"Torres-Castro M, et al.

30183924,[Infectious diseases related to water in Peru].,"The growth of the world population has increased the demand for water. On the other hand, climate change shows us that the water sources that were previously safe are not anymore. There are inequalities between urban and rural areas, thus 96% of the urban world population uses drinking water sources compared to 84% of the rural population, while 82% of the urban population versus 51% of the rural population use sanitation facilities. In Peru, 80.4% of homes are supplied with water through a public network. In the urban area, this service covers 83.2%; while in the rural area 71.3% of homes have a toilet service connected to the public network. All the above conditions the presence of water-related infectious diseases, such as diarrhea, malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis A, and E, whose classification is shown in this article. In the world, diarrhea is the third cause of death among children under five years of age and more than 340,000 children under the age of five die from diarrheal diseases due to poor sanitation. One of the goals of the SDGs is related to universal access drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, which cannot be achieved without due attention to the inequalities in access observed between different groups, avoiding the consequences of these deficiencies both in our country and in the world.",['Sánchez CC'],2018,35,2,Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,Sánchez CC.

30173662,A scoping review on the field validation and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests for vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban areas.,"BACKGROUND: Health personnel face challenges in diagnosing vector-borne and other diseases of poverty in urban settings. There is a need to know what rapid diagnostic technologies are available, have been properly assessed, and are being implemented to improve control of these diseases in the urban context. This paper characterizes evidence on the field validation and implementation in urban areas of rapid diagnostics for vector-borne diseases and other diseases of poverty.
MAIN BODY: A scoping review was conducted. Peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched using terms describing the targeted infectious diseases, diagnostics evaluations, rapid tests, and urban setting. The review was limited to studies published between 2000 and 2016 in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were refined post hoc to identify relevant literature regardless of study design and geography. A total of 179 documents of the 7806 initially screened were included in the analysis. Malaria (n = 100) and tuberculosis (n = 47) accounted for the majority of studies that reported diagnostics performance, impact, and implementation outcomes. Fewer studies, assessing mainly performance, were identified for visceral leishmaniasis (n = 9), filariasis and leptospirosis (each n = 5), enteric fever and schistosomiasis (each n = 3), dengue and leprosy (each n = 2), and Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, and cholera (each n = 1). Reported sensitivity of rapid tests was variable depending on several factors. Overall, specificities were high (> 80%), except for schistosomiasis and cholera. Impact and implementation outcomes, mainly acceptability and cost, followed by adoption, feasibility, and sustainability of rapid tests are being evaluated in the field. Challenges to implementing rapid tests range from cultural to technical and administrative issues.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid diagnostic tests for vector-borne and other diseases of poverty are being used in the urban context with demonstrated impact on case detection. However, most evidence comes from malaria rapid diagnostics, with variable results. While rapid tests for tuberculosis and visceral leishmaniasis require further implementation studies, more evidence on performance of current tests or development of new alternatives is needed for dengue, Chagas disease, filariasis, leptospirosis, enteric fever, human African trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis and cholera.","['Osorio L', 'Garcia JA', 'Parra LG', 'Garcia V', 'Torres L', 'Degroote S', 'Ridde V']",2018,7,1,Infect Dis Poverty,"Osorio L, et al.

30169513,Fine-scale GPS tracking to quantify human movement patterns and exposure to leptospires in the urban slum environment.,"BACKGROUND: Human movement is likely an important risk factor for environmentally-transmitted pathogens. While epidemiologic studies have traditionally focused on household risk factors, individual movement data could provide critical additional information about risk of exposure to such pathogens. We conducted global positioning system (GPS) tracking of urban slum residents to quantify their fine-scale movement patterns and evaluate their exposures to environmental sources of leptospirosis transmission.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recruited participants from an ongoing cohort study in an urban slum in Brazil and tracked them for 24 hours at 30-second intervals. Among 172 subjects asked to participate in this cross-sectional study, 130 agreed to participate and 109 had good quality data and were included in analyses. The majority of recorded locations were near participant residences (87.7% within 50 meters of the house), regardless of age or gender. Similarly, exposure to environmental sources of leptospirosis transmission did not vary by age or gender. However, males, who have higher infection rates, visited a significantly larger area during the 24-hour period than did females (34,549m2 versus 22,733m2, p = 0.005). Four male participants had serologic evidence of Leptospira infection during the study period. These individuals had significantly larger activity spaces than uninfected males (61,310m2 vs 31,575m2, p = 0.006) and elevated exposure to rodent activity (p = 0.046) and trash deposits (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: GPS tracking was an effective tool for quantifying individual mobility in the complex urban slum environment and identifying risk exposures associated with that movement. This study suggests that in addition to source reduction, barrier interventions that reduce contact with transmission sources as slum residents move within their communities may be a useful prevention strategy for leptospirosis.","['Owers KA', 'Odetunde J', 'de Matos RB', 'Sacramento G', 'Carvalho M', 'Nery N', 'Costa F', 'Reis MG', 'Childs JE', 'Hagan JE', 'Diggle PJ', 'Ko AI']",2018,12,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Owers KA, et al.

30165070,Update on the status of leptospirosis in New Zealand.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that poses public health and ecological threats worldwide. In New Zealand (NZ), incidence of the disease is relatively high compared to other developed countries. The aim of this review was to describe the epidemiological status, ecological risk of leptospirosis and prevention in NZ. Disease notification data for leptospirosis in humans in NZ from 2010 to 2015 were collected from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research database. These data were supported by a literature review of epidemiological studies in human and animal populations. During this six-year period, exotic serovars of Leptospira interrogans sv Australis and Leptospira kirschneri sv Grippotyphosa were identified in patients who had travelled abroad to Samoa (Pacific Ocean) and Thailand, respectively. Most cases of leptospirosis were recorded in New Zealanders of European ethnicity, followed by Māori people. Males had a nine-fold increased risk compared to females mostly due to occupation. The risk of leptospirosis increased gradually with the age, with a peak in the 40 to 49-year-old age group, after which it decreased. Workers in meat-processing and farming industries appeared at highest-risk of occupational exposure compared with other risky occupations such as hunters, veterinarians, technicians, stock truck drivers and lake workers. Other cases were also attributed to outdoor exposures or travelling overseas. Highest disease notification rates occurred in the West Coast region of the South Island (average annual incidence 9.7 per 100,000 people), followed by Whanganui region (8.2 per 100,000) and Hawke's Bay region (8 per 100,000) in the North Island. Vaccines currently available for animals are specific for cattle, sheep, deer and dogs and do protect against all serovars present in NZ. The development and use of molecular diagnostics is crucial for specific identification of Leptospira isolates and informing deployment of efficient vaccines.","['El-Tras WF', 'Bruce M', 'Holt HR', 'Eltholth MM', 'Merien F']",2018,188,,Acta Trop,"El-Tras WF, et al.

This study aims to determine and characterize virulent Leptospira species among rodents and small mammals found in human settlements and recreational spots within the Hulu Langat and Gombak districts of Selangor, Malaysia; regions that frequently report probable human leptospirosis cases. Molecular analysis revealed an overall Leptospira detection rate of 14.3% among the 266 small mammals captured, and the human settlements were found to have the highest number of isolates (15.1%), followed by recreational sites (14.5%). The molecular characterization conducted based on the lipL32, secY genes and MLST revealed that the strains belonged to four different species, including; Leptospira interrogans (29; 76.3%; ST50, ST238, ST243), L. kirschneri (5; 13.15%; ST110), L. borgpetersenii (3; 8%; ST143) and L. weilii (1; 2.63%; ST242). The study revealed genotypes of circulating strains among small mammals in Malaysia, which include Leptospira locus ST110 L. kirschneri, ST 50 L. interrogans, ST143 L. borgpetersenii and ST242 L. weilii.

The data from the present study may imply that, in addition to rodents, other small mammals also serve as maintenance hosts for Leptospira. Hence, much remains unknown about Leptospira maintenance hosts, and there is need for further investigation to ascertain the prevailing serovars of pathogenic Leptospira in Malaysia.

30144314,Detection of intraocular Leptospira spp. by real-time polymerase chain reaction in horses with recurrent uveitis in Belgium.,"BACKGROUND: Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) has been associated with Leptospira spp. infection. No information exists concerning the prevalence of Leptospira-associated ERU in Belgium and about the sensitivity of detection of Leptospira in different ocular media.
OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of intraocular Leptospira spp. in ERU-affected and healthy eyes of horses examined at the Equine Clinic of the University of Liège by real-time PCR and to compare the results of the aqueous and vitreous humour of the same eye.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHODS: Sixty-six eyes from 59 client-owned horses with a diagnosis of equine recurrent uveitis (ERU-group) were studied from May 2015 to December 2017. Fifty healthy eyes from 28 euthanised horses for unrelated reasons examined during the same period were included in the control group. Intraocular fluids (aqueous and/or vitreous humours) from ERU-affected eyes were sampled and analysed by real-time PCR for Leptospira spp. Aqueous and vitreous humours from the control group were processed in the same way.
RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding age, sex, eye sampled (OS/OD), humours sampled (aqueous/vitreous humour) but not regarding breeds, with an over-representation of Warmbloods and Appaloosas in the ERU-group. The prevalence of Leptospira spp. was 30.3% (20/66 eyes) in the ERU-group. Leptospira spp. DNA was identified in 11 aqueous and 17 vitreous humours with eight horses testing positive in both humours, nine horses testing positive for vitreous humour alone and third horses for aqueous humour alone. The phi-correlation between aqueous and vitreous humour Leptospira-PCR results is 0.47 suggesting a low association. All the control eyes were negative.
MAIN LIMITATIONS: The diagnostic method selected for this study (lipL32 qPCR) did not allow identification of the serovars.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis is a potential cause of ERU in Belgium. Testing both intraocular media is advised whenever possible.

Most (83%) cases occurred within 6 weeks of the flood events, displaying a biphasic epidemic curve associated with the floods. Given the temporal proximity of cases to flooding events, most of the transmission appeared to occur during or immediately after the floods; therefore, prevention of exposure to contaminated environments is a priority in the immediate flood and post-flood period.

30138761,Antigenic potential of a recombinant polyvalent DNA vaccine against pathogenic leptospiral infection.,"Leptospirosis is a serious epidemic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease is endemic in most tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Currently, there is no effective polyvalent vaccine for prevention against most of the circulating serovars. Moreover, development of an efficient leptospiral vaccine capable of stimulating cross-protective immune responses against a wide range of serovars remains a daunting challenge. This, in part, is associated with the extensive diversity and variation of leptospiral serovars from region to region. In this study, a multi-epitope DNA vaccine encoding highly immunogenic epitopes from LipL32 and LipL41 was designed using in-silico approach. The DNA encoding antigenic epitopes was constructed from conserved pathogenic Leptospira genes (LipL32 and LipL41). Immunization of golden Syrian hamsters with the multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine resulted in the production of both agglutinating and neutralizing antibodies as evidence by MAT and in-vitro growth inhibition tests respectively. The antibodies produced reacted against eight different serovars and significantly reduced renal colonization following in vivo challenge. The vaccine was also able to significantly reduce renal colonization which is a very important factor responsible for persistence of leptospires among susceptible and reservoir animal hosts. In conclusion, the leptospiral multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine can serve as a potentially effective and safe vaccine against infection with different pathogenic leptospiral serovars.","['Garba B', 'Bahaman AR', 'Zakaria Z', 'Bejo SK', 'Mutalib AR', 'Bande F', 'Suleiman N']",2018,124,,Microb Pathog,"Garba B, et al.

30126560,Etiology and Outcomes of ARDS in a Resource Limited Urban Tropical Setting.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have been published in the western literature on the incidence, clinical course and outcome of patients with ARDS. However, there is limited data about ARDS in the tropics and moreover, the etiology and outcomes of ARDS in tropical countries are different from those of western nations. In tropical countries like India, resources are limited and costs of therapy play a major role in deciding treatment options. This prospective observational study was designed to analyze the clinical profile, outcomes and predictors of mortality of patients with ARDS in an urban tropical setting.
METHODS: 75 patients ≥13 years, admitted in the medical intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Kerala, India between March 2013 and February 2014, satisfying Berlin definition for ARDS were enrolled in the study. Lung protective ventilation strategy as laid by ARDS Network protocol was followed for every patient on mechanical ventilation. Due to scarcity of ventilators in our institution, invasive ventilation could not be provided for all ARDS patients. The criteria used for patient selection for non-invasive ventilation were hemodynamic stability, well compliant to the use of NIV mask and PaO2/FiO2 ratio >180 at the time of admission.
RESULTS: Out of the 75 patients, 51% were females and the mean age of the study population was 39.8 ± 3.3 years. Common aetiologies were leptospirosis (18.7%), bronchopneumonia (17.3%), scrub typhus and dengue (12% each). Lung injury score and sequential organ failure assessment score scores had statistically significant association with the severity of ARDS. Forty patients (53.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and 35 patients were managed with non-invasive ventilation at the time of admission. The mortality in our study was 45%. Altered sensorium (p-0.002), central cyanosis (p-0.024), elevated creatinine (p-0.036), acidosis (p < 0.001), hypotension (p < 0.001), multiorgan dysfunction (p-0.017), PEEP >12 cm H2O (p-0.036), days on ventilator <7 (p-0.014), PaO2/FiO2 Ratio <100 (p < 0.001), LIS>2.5 (p < 0.001) and SOFA score>11 (p < 0.001) were individual predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSION: Tropical infections form a major etiological component of ARDS in a developing country like India. More studies are required for determining criteria for using NIV in mild ARDS patients which would be helpful in resource limited countries. Timely administration of effective antimicrobial therapy in patients in the rural tropics may help to reduce mortality and financial burden due to ARDS.","['Kumar SS', 'Selvarajan Chettiar KP', 'Nambiar R']",2018,110,4,J Natl Med Assoc,"Kumar SS, et al.

This prospective, multicentre study was conducted in selected centres in the province of Kerala in India principally to analyse the aetiology of acute febrile illnesses in adult patients over the course of one year. Overall, 1324 patients were included in the study. The most common cause was dengue in 576 patients (43.5%). In 396 (29.9%), the exact aetiology could not be identified. Other causes, in order, were leptospirosis, enteric fever, malaria, respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection and typhus.

METHODS Between June 2009 and July 2010, 20 serum samples per flock or herd were collected from 162 sheep flocks, and 116 beef cattle and 99 deer herds from 238 farms, along with farm data by interview. Samples were tested for antibodies to serovars Hardjo and Pomona by microscopic agglutination testing, with a titre ≥48 being positive. Species-specific associations between herd-level seroprevalence (number of seropositive animals, for each serovar, divided by the number of animals tested) and herd-level risk factors were determined by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Vaccinated animals were excluded from seroprevalence estimates but included in multivariable analyses. RESULTS For sheep (n=3,339), animal-level seroprevalence was 43.6 (95% CI=41.9-45.3)% for serovar Hardjo and 14.1 (95% CI=12.9-15.3)% for serovar Pomona; for beef cattle(n=1,886), it was 45.6 (95% CI=43.3-47.9)% for Hardjo and 19.6 (95% CI=17.9-21.5)% for Pomona; and for deer (n=1,870), it was 26.3 (95% CI=24.3-28.4)% for Hardjo, 8.8 (95% CI=7.6-10.2)% for Pomona. In sheep flocks (n=161), flock-level prevalence for Hardjo varied from 77.9-91.3%, and for Pomona from 40.4-73.9%, when ≥1, ≥2 or ≥3 animals were seropositive. In beef herds (n=95), herd-level prevalence for Hardjo varied from 79.0-90.5%, and for Pomona from 42.1-68.4%. In deer herds (n=93), herd-level prevalence for Hardjo varied from 45.2-59.1%, and for Pomona from 22.6-48.4%. For sheep flocks, herd-level seroprevalence for Hardjo was associated with flock size (OR=1.56) and number of dogs (OR=0.75), and for Pomona, seroprevalence varied with region. For beef cattle, herd-level seroprevalence for Hardjo was associated with herd size (OR=1.4), presence of dams (OR=0.6) and vaccination (OR=2.9), and for Pomona, co-grazing with deer (OR=0.4), vaccination (OR=3.22), presence of dams (OR=0.2) and streams (OR=2.7). For deer herds, seroprevalence for Hardjo or Pomona was associated with herd size (OR=1.6 and 1.8) and varied with region, and for Pomona seroprevalence varied with season (summer vs. winter: OR=4.8). CONCLUSIONS Serovars Hardjo and Pomona were highly prevalent at herd and animal levels, with serovar Hardjo highest in all species. Larger herd size was the common risk factor for seroprevalence in all livestock species.","['Dreyfus A', 'Wilson P', 'Benschop J', 'Collins-Emerson J', 'Verdugo C', 'Heuer C']",2018,66,6,N Z Vet J,"Dreyfus A, et al.

30118246,Role of Toll-like receptor 2 in mediating the production of cytokines and human beta-defensins in oral mucosal epithelial cell response to Leptospiral infection.,"BACKGROUND: Pathogenic Leptospira spp. is the causative agent of leptospirosis. Oral mucosal cavity is one of portal entry for this bacterium. Oral mucosal epithelium provides a physical barrier and secretes cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in response to microbial infection. Human β-defensins (hBDs); hBD1, hBD2, and hBD3 are predominantly AMPs expressed in the oral cavity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been reported in hBD regulation. TLR2 recognizes leptospiral lipopolysaccharide, and plays a key role in the early control of leptospirosis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of TLR2 in mediating the production of cytokines and hBDs in oral mucosal epithelial cell response to leptospiral infection.
METHODS: Cultivated oral mucosal epithelial cells were prepared, characterized, and compared with oral mucosal tissues. The TLR1-10 and hBD mRNA expressions were examined. Pro-inflammatory cytokine and hBD1-3 expressions in response to leptospires were determined by quantitative (q) RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The cultivated oral epithelium expressed TLR2 and hBD1-3. The induction of IL-βIL-8, TNF-α, and hBD2 were increased in response to Leptospira via TLR2 recognition.
CONCLUSION: The characteristics of primary epithelial cells and tissue were similar in terms of TLR expression. All primary epithelial cells expressed TLR2 and hBD1-3. We used primary epithelial cells to study response to L. interrogans. Our results yielded the first evidence that human TLR2 regulates hBD2 expression in oral mucosa epithelial responded to L. interrogans. Expression of hBD2 may act to neutralize the virulence or prevent the invasion of L. interrogans at the portal of entry.","['Inthasin N', 'Wongprompitak P', 'Boonwong C', 'Ekpo P']",2019,37,4,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,"Inthasin N, et al.

30113852,Proteomic Analysis of Urine from California Sea Lions ( Zalophus californianus): A Resource for Urinary Biomarker Discovery.,"Urinary markers for the assessment of kidney diseases in wild animals are limited, in part, due to the lack of urinary proteome data, especially for marine mammals. One of the most prevalent kidney diseases in marine mammals is caused by Leptospira interrogans, which is the second most common etiology linked to stranding of California sea lions ( Zalophus californianus). Urine proteins from 11 sea lions with leptospirosis kidney disease and eight sea lions without leptospirosis or kidney disease were analyzed using shotgun proteomics. In total, 2694 protein groups were identified, and 316 were differentially abundant between groups. Major urine proteins in sea lions were similar to major urine proteins in dogs and humans except for the preponderance of resistin, lysozyme C, and PDZ domain containing 1, which appear to be over-represented. Previously reported urine protein markers of kidney injury in humans and animals were also identified. Notably, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, osteopontin, and epidermal fatty acid binding protein were elevated over 20-fold in the leptospirosis-infected sea lions. Consistent with leptospirosis infection in rodents, urinary proteins associated with the renin-angiotensin system were depressed, including neprilysin. This study represents a foundation from which to explore the clinical use of urinary protein markers in California sea lions.","['Neely BA', 'Prager KC', 'Bland AM', 'Fontaine C', 'Gulland FM', 'Janech MG']",2018,17,9,J Proteome Res,"Neely BA, et al.

30086725,"Evidence of human leptospirosis cases in a cohort of febrile patients in Bangui, Central African Republic: a retrospective study, 2012-2015.","BACKGROUND: In spite of a local favorable environment, leptospirosis has never been described in Central African Republic so far mainly because of the weakness of diagnostic tests and differential diagnostic strategy for febrile jaundice cases negative for yellow fever virus. Here we bring a complementary insight to conclusions of Gadia CLB et al. regarding the presence of leptospirosis in Central African Republic in YFV-negative febrile icteric patients.
METHODS: Our study included 497 individuals presenting with fever and jaundice but negative for yellow fever infection, retrospectively selected from the national surveillance biobank for yellow fever in Institut Pasteur de Bangui, Central African Republic. A combination of serological (ELISA, agglutination) and molecular biology techniques (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) was used to identify Leptospira or the patient's immune response to the bacteria. Statistical analyses were done using the non parametric Mann-Withney U test with a 5% statistical threshold.
RESULTS: ELISA test results showed 46 positive serum samples while 445 were negative and 6 remains equivocal. In addition, the reference microscopic agglutination test for leptospirosis diagnostic confirmed that 7 out of 32 samples tested were positive. Unfortunately, all 497 serum samples tested for leptospirosis were negative using the molecular techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike Gadia et al., we confirmed that leptospirosis is circulating in Central African Republic and therefore may be responsible for some of the unexplained cases of febrile jaundice in the country. Thus, leptospirosis needs to be investigated to improve identification of aetiological pathogens. Our study also suggests a need to improve sample transportation and storage conditions.","['Rubbo PA', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Golongba DM', 'Mbombo F', 'Girault D', 'Nakouné E', 'Lombart JP', 'Breurec S', 'Goarant C']",2018,18,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Rubbo PA, et al.

Bacteriophages in Leptospira are largely unexplored. To date, a genomic sequence is available for only one temperate leptophage called LE1. Here, we sequenced and analysed the first genomes of the lytic phages LE3 and LE4 that can infect the saprophyte Leptospira biflexa using the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen as receptor. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the 48-kb LE3 and LE4 genomes are similar and contain 62% genes whose function cannot be predicted. Mass spectrometry led to the identification of 21 and 23 phage proteins in LE3 and LE4, respectively. However we did not identify significant similarities with other phage genomes. A search for prophages close to LE4 in the Leptospira genomes allowed for the identification of a related plasmid in L. interrogans and a prophage-like region in the draft genome of a clinical isolate of L. mayottensis. Long-read whole genome sequencing of the L. mayottensis revealed that the genome contained a LE4 phage-like circular plasmid.

Epidemiological data are scarce and present major challenge because of the varied clinical presentations. Multilocus Sequence Typing has already proven to be a robust molecular typing method providing accurate results for strain characterization. We have adapted our MLST scheme by reducing the set of loci to facilitate Leptospira typing directly from human clinical samples. The application of this 3-locus scheme provides Leptospira species and allelic profiles of the samples retaining the power of discrimination of the whole scheme. Moreover, an approach to the serogroups was also achieved. Our results contribute to the epidemiological study of Leptospirosis, since the direct typing on clinical specimens could detect and update allelic variants and serogroups present in a region. The simplified scheme allowed at the same time to take advantage of limited genetic material available in clinical samples that may increase the sources of information for epidemiological monitoring.","['Varni V', 'Chiani Y', 'Nagel A', 'Ruybal P', 'Vanasco NB', 'Caimi K']",2018,112,4,Pathog Glob Health,"Varni V, et al.

30059000,Characterization of the clonal subpopulation Fiocruz L1-130 of Leptospira interrogans in rats and dogs from Brazil.,"PURPOSE: Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains have been described as causing disease in both humans and animals and as being present worldwide. Icterohaemorrhagiae and Copenhageni serovars are known to cause severe disease in their hosts, and zoonotic outbreaks have been described. The genetic similarity among the strains of these serovars is known. However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether major clonal subpopulation in humans, strain Fiocruz L1-130-like, can circulate among other hosts.
METHODOLOGY: We performed genetic characterization of Brazilian serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains of dog and rat origin by secY sequencing, variable-number tandem-repeat, multilocus sequence type and multi-spacer typing analysis.
RESULTS: The strains were found to be identical among themselves and to strain Fiocruz L1-130. We suggest that the major strain of L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae, Fiocruz L1-130, is widely distributed in Brazil in different hosts with substantial zoonotic potential.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the circulation of strain Fiocruz L1-130 is important for the implementation of appropriate control measures. Its circulation highlights the need to treat leptospirosis caused by L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae as a zoonosis that acts in the human-animal-environment interface, as per the One Health approach.","['Jaeger LH', 'Pestana CP', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Medeiros MA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2018,67,9,J Med Microbiol,"Jaeger LH, et al.

30040947,Dynamics of humoral response in naturally-infected cattle after vaccination against leptospirosis.,"Vaccination is one of the most important measures for the control of bovine leptospirosis. Despite the broad usage of vaccination against leptospirosis in cattle worldwide, the dynamics of the post-vaccine immune response remain controversial and many aspects are still unclear, particularly in naturally-infected animals. Thus, the objective of this study is to describe the dynamics of humoral response in naturally-infected cattle after vaccination against leptospirosis. A total of 162 cows were studied, consisting of 129 included in the experimental group (G1), and subdivided into two groups, vaccinated with two different brands of bacterins, as well as 33 in the control group (G2). Serology (MAT) was performed in all cows on D0 (vaccination), then 60 and 120 days post-vaccination. Vaccination significantly elicited the production of anti-leptospiral antibodies. Seroreactivity increased rapidly but was of short duration (up to D60). Significantly, that increase was notably higher in the vaccinated group than in the controlled. Both vaccines elicited a similar response with a higher rate of seroreactive animals, but predominately against different serogroups. In this context, our results reinforce that, although of limited duration, vaccination against leptospirosis significantly elicits a specific humoral response in naturally-infected animals. The two studied vaccines presented similar seroconversion levels, but predominantly to different serogroups, being one against Icterohaemorrhagiae and the other against Sejroe.","['Martins G', 'Oliveira CS', 'Lilenbaum W']",2018,187,,Acta Trop,"Martins G, et al.

Cases of leptospirosis from 2007 to 2014 were retrospectively identified with a systematic screening of serological and polymerase chain reaction results to classify them as confirmed, probable, or excluded cases. Medical files were reviewed to collect epidemiological data. Among the 72 included patients, 55 (76.4%) cases were confirmed and 17 (23.6%) were probable. The median age was 39 years (range: 16-82 years) and the M/F sex ratio 6.2. Sixty-two (86.1%) patients required hospitalization, including 12 (16.7%) in the intensive care unit. Three (4.2%) patients died. The monthly distribution of cases was correlated with rainfall (","['Le Turnier P', 'Mosnier E', 'Schaub R', 'Bourhy P', 'Jolivet A', 'Cropet C', 'Villemant N', 'Trombert-Paolantoni S', 'Berlioz-Arthaud A', 'Nacher M', 'Demar M', 'Picardeau M', 'Djossou F', 'Epelboin L']",2018,99,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Le Turnier P, et al.

There were gaps in the knowledge among urban and rural respondents in the two states, with the majority of subjects demonstrating a poor understanding of the disease. Construction of knowledge about leptospirosis relied mostly on the information provided by mass and social media; reading materials; word-of-mouth publicity; observations; experiences; and knowledge sharing among families, friends, and communities.

30011274,Study on causes of fever in primary healthcare center uncovers pathogens of public health concern in Madagascar.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing use of malaria diagnostic tests reveals a growing proportion of patients with fever but no malaria. Clinicians and health care workers in low-income countries have few tests to diagnose causes of fever other than malaria although several diseases share common symptoms. We propose here to assess etiologies of fever in Madagascar to ultimately improve management of febrile cases.
METHODOLOGY: Consenting febrile outpatients aged 6 months and older were recruited in 21 selected sentinel sites throughout Madagascar from April 2014 to September 2015. Standard clinical examinations were performed, and blood and upper respiratory specimens were taken for rapid diagnostic tests and molecular assays for 36 pathogens of interest for Madagascar in terms of public health, regardless of clinical status.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 682 febrile patients were enrolled. We detected at least one pathogen in 40.5% (276/682) of patients and 6.2% (42/682) with co-infections. Among all tested patients, 26.5% (181/682) had at least one viral infection, 17.0% (116/682) had malaria and 1.0% (7/682) presented a bacterial or a mycobacterial infection. None or very few of the highly prevalent infectious agents in Eastern Africa and Asia were detected in this study, such as zoonotic bacteria or arboviral infections.
CONCLUSIONS: These results raise questions about etiologies of fever in Malagasy communities. Nevertheless, we noted that viral infections and malaria still represent a significant proportion of causes of febrile illnesses. Interestingly our study allowed the detection of pathogens of public health interest such as Rift Valley Fever Virus but also the first case of laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis infection in Madagascar.","['Guillebaud J', 'Bernardson B', 'Randriambolamanantsoa TH', 'Randrianasolo L', 'Randriamampionona JL', 'Marino CA', 'Rasolofo V', 'Randrianarivelojosia M', 'Vigan-Womas I', 'Stivaktas V', 'Venter M', 'Piola P', 'Héraud JM']",2018,12,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Guillebaud J, et al.

30004813,Chaperonomics in leptospirosis.,"Knowledge of the function of molecular chaperones is required for a better understanding of cellular proteostasis. Nevertheless, such information is currently dispersed as most of previous studies investigated chaperones on a single-angle basis. Recently, a new subdiscipline of chaperonology, namely 'chaperonomics' (defined as 'systematic analysis of chaperone genes, transcripts, proteins, or their interaction networks using omics technologies'), has been emerging to better understand biological, physiological, and pathological roles of chaperones. Areas covered: This review provides broad overviews of bacterial chaperones, heat shock proteins (HSPs), and leptospirosis, and then focuses on recent progress of chaperonomics applied to define roles of HSPs in various pathogenic and saprophytic leptospiral species and serovars. Expert commentary: Comprehensive analysis of leptospiral chaperones/HSPs using a chaperonomics approach holds great promise for better understanding of functional roles of chaperones/HSPs in bacterial survival and disease pathogenesis. Moreover, this new approach may also lead to further development of chaperones/HSPs-based diagnostics and/or vaccine discovery for leptospirosis.","['Vinaiphat A', 'Thongboonkerd V']",2018,15,7,Expert Rev Proteomics,Vinaiphat A and Thongboonkerd V.

30003104,Clinical and Epidemiological Status of Leptospirosis in a Tropical Caribbean Area of Colombia.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyze the clinical and epidemiological status in 28 confirmed cases of human leptospirosis at the main public hospital of Cordoba.
METHODS: Between 2012 and 2013, we conducted an active surveillance at the main hospital of Cordoba to establish the etiologic diagnosis of the undifferentiated tropical febrile illness (UTFI) cases. UTFI is defined as a fever without an infection focus in the initial physical examination or in basic laboratory tests. Patients in acute phase were accompanied by prodromal symptoms, including myalgia, arthralgia, headache, asthenia, chills, icterus, dyspnea, abdominal pain, rash, and nausea. Samples were collected on admission and at discharge. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected for each patient. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was performed.
RESULTS: The 28 leptospirosis cases presented the following gender distribution: male (n=24) and female (n=4). The duration of hospitalization was 10.39 days. The main symptoms and clinical manifestations were fever, headache and nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, all of which occurred in up to 60% of patients. Of the 28 cases studied, 4 were fatal. The most frequent infecting serogroups were Ballum and Canicola.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is a common cause of undifferentiated tropical febrile illness in Colombia; it is important to establish ongoing and accurate surveillance for acute febrile illness to facilitate the detection of cases of leptospirosis.","['Tique V', 'Mattar S', 'Miranda J', 'Oviedo M', 'Noda A', 'Montes E', 'Rodriguez V']",2018,2018,,Biomed Res Int,"Tique V, et al.

Despite considerable advances, much is yet to be discovered about disease pathogenicity. The influence of epigenetic mechanisms, particularly RNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of host immune response has been described following a variety of bacterial infections. The current study examined the microtranscriptome of macrophages J774A.1 following an 8h infection with virulent, attenuated and saprophyte strains of Leptospira. Microarray analysis revealed that 29 miRNAs were misregulated following leptospiral infection compared to control macrophages in a strain and virulence-specific manner. Pathway analysis for targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs suggests that several processes involved in immune response could be regulated by miRNAs. Our data provides the first evidence that host miRNAs are regulated by Leptospira infection in macrophages. A number of the identified miRNA targets participate in key immune response processes. We suggest that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs may play a role in host response to infection in leptospirosis.","['Garcia LE', 'de Araújo Junior EC', 'Melo LM', 'Bragato JP', 'Peiró JR', 'Félix de Lima VM', 'Marinho M', 'Arnold DR', 'Lopes FL']",2018,12,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Garcia LE, et al.

29973159,Characterizing interactions of Leptospira interrogans with proximal renal tubule epithelial cells.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospira interrogans is a pathogenic, spirochetal bacterium that is responsible for leptospirosis, an emerging worldwide zoonosis. Leptospires colonize the renal proximal tubules and chronically infect the kidney. Live bacteria are excreted into urine, contaminating the environment. While it is well known that leptospires can persist in the kidneys without signs of disease for several months, the interactions of leptospires with the proximal renal epithelial tubule cells that allow the chronic renal colonization have not been elucidated yet. In the present study, we compared the interactions between a virulent, low passage (LP) strain and a cultured-attenuated, high passage (HP) strain with renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) to elucidate the strategies used by Leptospira to colonize the kidney.
RESULTS: Kinetics analysis of kidney colonization in a mouse model of chronic infection performed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence, showed that the LP strain reached the kidney by 3 days post infection (pi) and attached to the basal membrane side of the renal epithelial cells. At 10 days pi, some leptospires were attached to the luminal side of the tubular epithelia and the number of colonizing leptospires gradually increased. On the other hand, the HP strain was cleared during hematogenous dissemination and did not colonize the kidney. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of LP-infected kidneys at 25 days pi showed aggregated leptospires and membrane vesicles attached to the epithelial brush border. Leptospiral kidney colonization altered the organization of the RPTEC brush border. An in vitro model of infection using TCMK-1 cells, showed that leptospiral infection induced a host stress response, which is delayed in LP-infected cells.
CONCLUSIONS: After hematogenous dissemination, leptospires create protective and replicative niches in the base membrane and luminal sides of the RPTECs. During the long-term colonization, leptospires attached to the RPTEC brush borders and membrane vesicles might be involved in the formation of a biofilm-like structure in vivo. Our results also suggested that the virulent strain is able to manipulate host cell stress responses to promote renal colonization.","['Yamaguchi T', 'Higa N', 'Okura N', 'Matsumoto A', 'Hermawan I', 'Yamashiro T', 'Suzuki T', 'Toma C']",2018,18,1,BMC Microbiol,"Yamaguchi T, et al.

In the period from January to July 2015, 18 (17%) out of 106 cows presented abortion, six (5.7%) stillbirth, and 12 (11.3%) repeated estrus, totaling 24 animals with reproductive problems. The diagnosis of leptospirosis was based on serology (microscopic agglutination test-MAT), bacteriological culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibiotic therapy, vaccination protocols, and changes in management practices were suggested as control measures. Of all animals on the farm (n = 280), 136 (48.6%) were seropositive for at least one serovar of Leptospira sp. No pure leptospiral culture was obtained. Eight of the animals with reproductive problems yielded positive PCR results (vaginal fluid of seven animals and urine and vaginal fluid of one animal). Genetic sequencing of a vaginal fluid/urine PCR-positive sample revealed Leptospira borgpetersenii. One year after the adoption of control measures, no reproductive problems were observed. Thus, leptospirosis probably caused the reproductive failures in the herd, and the control and prevention measures implemented were efficient in controlling the disease.","['Pimenta CLRM', 'da Costa DF', 'Silva MLCR', 'Pereira HD', 'Júnior JPA', 'Malossi CD', 'Ullmann LS', 'Alves CJ', 'de Azevedo SS']",2019,51,1,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Pimenta CLRM, et al.

29946901,Correlation Between Physicochemical Properties of Soil and Presence of Leptospira.,"Leptospirosis is an important global public health problem. Favourable environmental factors are influencing the survival of leptospires in soil, which is an important link in the transmission cycle. The present study was designed to understand the correlation between various soil nutrients and presence of Leptospira in soil samples of different regions of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The study revealed a significant positive relationship between presence of Leptospira and concentration of iron, manganese and copper in soil. Presence of iron, manganese and copper in the soil may influence the survival and transmission of leptospirosis.","['Lall C', 'Vinod Kumar K', 'Raj RV', 'Vedhagiri K', 'Sunish IP', 'Vijayachari P']",2018,15,3,Ecohealth,"Lall C, et al.

29938244,"Knowledge, attitude and practice about leptospirosis prevention among town service workers in northeastern Malaysia: a cross sectional study.","INTRODUCTION: Many efforts have been done to reduce leptospirosis infections in Malaysia especially among high risk groups including town service workers. Town service workers are more likely to be exposed to the leptospiral infection resulting from their occupational activities.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted in northeastern Malaysia involving 321 town service workers who were subjected to answer an interviewer-guided validated questionnaire which consists of sociodemographic, knowledge, attitude and practice information. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS Version 20.
RESULTS: All of the respondents were Malay with mean (SD) age of 40.6 (10.28) years old. The mean (SD) duration of employment was 12.1 (9.62) years. Fifty four respondents (16.8%) had never heard of leptospirosis. Among the respondents, 215 (67.0%) of them had poor knowledge on leptospirosis. Meanwhile, 167 (52.0%) and only 128 (39.9%) of them had satisfactory attitude and practice respectively. It was found that knowledge on risk factors for leptospirosis was lacking. There were high risk attitudes such as drinking habit and protective equipment used during working with the favourable answers ranged from 67.3% to 89.1%. The weakest area identified in their practice was also on the use of protective equipment.
CONCLUSIONS: The workers' level of knowledge and practice were relatively poor despite an overall good practice on leptospirosis. This finding might expose them to an increased risk of contracting leptospirosis. Identified weak areas in their knowledge, attitude and practice will assist the policy makers to develop a focused and well-directed intervention program on leptospirosis infection.","['Azfar ZM', 'Nazri SM', 'Rusli AM', 'Maizurah O', 'Zahiruddin WM', 'Azwany YN', 'Nabilah I', 'Asma HS', 'Aziah BD']",2018,59,1,J Prev Med Hyg,"Azfar ZM, et al.

29934034,Factors associated with severity and mortality in patients with confirmed leptospirosis at a regional hospital in northern Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory factors associated with disease severity and mortality from confirmed leptospirosis patients in Taiwan are not well known. This retrospective study examined patients with suspected leptospirosis admitted to En-Chu-Kong Hospital, a regional teaching hospital in northern Taiwan.
METHODS: From January 2002 to July 2014, 733 suspected cases were reported to the National Reference Laboratory, 57 of which were identified as laboratory and clinical confirmed. We analyzed the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory factors associated with disease severity and mortality in 57 cases.
RESULTS: The mean age was 59.1 ± 18.2 years, 74% were male, and 49% had occupational contact with soil. The major complications were pulmonary involvement (54%), shock (44%), ventilator support (32%), jaundice (32%), hemorrhage (30%), acute kidney injury (30%), meningitis (11%) and myocarditis (2%). Leptospira santarosai serova Shermani was present in 42 (74%) patients and 37 (58%) patients had severe leptospirosis. Sixteen (28%) patients had concomitant infections, including nine patients with bloodstream infection. The only independent predictor for severe leptospirosis was shock (OR 14.8, 95% CI 2.97-73.59). Eleven patients died (19%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (6 patients) was present in 55% of the fatal cases. The factors independently related to mortality were prior steroid use (OR 20.2, 95% CI 1.9-217.5) and hemorrhage (OR 71.2, 95% CI 4.9 - >999.9).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that shock is a predictor of severe leptospirosis, and prior steroid use and hemorrhage are predictors of death from leptospirosis.","['Wang HK', 'Lee MH', 'Chen YC', 'Hsueh PR', 'Chang SC']",2020,53,2,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Wang HK, et al.

29913535,Thrombocytopenia and Platelet Dysfunction in Acute Tropical Infectious Diseases.,"Thrombocytopenia is a well-known manifestation of acute tropical infectious diseases. The role of platelets in infections has received much attention recently because of their emerging activities in modulation of inflammatory responses, host defense, and vascular integrity. However, while many studies have addressed thrombocytopenia in tropical infections, abnormalities in platelet function have been largely overlooked. This is an important research gap, as platelet dysfunction may contribute to the bleeding tendency that characterizes some tropical infections. The development of novel platelet function assays that can be used in thrombocytopenic conditions (e.g., flow cytometry assays) has contributed to important new insights in recent years. In this review, the importance of platelets in tropical infections is discussed with special emphasis on the underlying mechanisms and consequences of thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction in these infections. Special attention is paid to malaria, a disease characterized by microvascular obstruction in which bleeding is rare, and to infections in which bleeding is common, such as dengue, other viral hemorrhagic fevers, and the bacterial infection leptospirosis. Given the importance of platelet function abnormalities in these infections, the development of affordable assays for monitoring of platelet function in low-resource countries, as well as pharmacologic interventions to prevent or reverse platelet function abnormalities, might improve clinical care and the prognosis of these infections.","['Hapsari Putri I', 'Tunjungputri RN', 'De Groot PG', 'van der Ven AJ', 'de Mast Q']",2018,44,7,Semin Thromb Hemost,"Hapsari Putri I, et al.

IN CAPTIVE MAMMALS IN THE STATES OF PARá AND RIO GRANDE DO NORTE, BRAZIL.","  Brazil has a large variety of wild animal species, but limited data are available on the occurrence of Brucella abortus and Leptospira spp. antibodies in these animals. Sera from 141 captive mammals belonging to 11 different species from the Northern and Northeastern regions of Brazil were screened. Antibodies against B. abortus and Leptospira spp. (24 live serovars) were investigated using the Rose Bengal plate and microscopic agglutination tests, respectively. Associations between the age, gender, and place of captivity were analyzed using the Pearson chi-square or the Fisher exact test. None of the animals were antibody positive for B. abortus. Among the animals tested, 11 (7.8%) were seropositive for Leptospira spp. These included one red brocket deer ( Mazama americana), two tufted capuchin ( Sapajus apella), seven agoutis ( Dasyprocta aguti), and one lowland paca ( Cuniculus paca). No association was observed between sex, age, and the occurrence of Leptospira spp. antibodies ( P > 0.05). However, an association was observed according to the place of captivity ( P = 0.046). From these 11 positive animals, six (54.5%) reacted to the serovars from the Icterohaemorraghiae serogroup, which is mainly responsible for the clinical cases of human leptospirosis in Brazil.

29890332,Susceptibility among breeds of sheep experimentally infected with Leptospira interrogans Pomona serogroup.,"Leptospirosis is a disease that negatively affects the productive and reproductive indices of ruminants. Sheep are considered highly resistant to infection, although susceptibility may vary among breeds. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the susceptibility between sheep breeds to the experimental infection by leptospires of the Pomona serogroup. Pomona serogroup, Kennewicki serovar strain (1 × 107 bacteria) was inoculated via the conjunctival route in 12 sheep divided into two groups, one comprising Santa Inês ewes and the other comprising crossbred sheep. In each group, five ewes were challenged with the bacterial strain and one was used as control. All sheep were monitored for 60 days, during which blood samples were collected for serological diagnosis and urine and vaginal fluid samples for molecular and microbiological analyses. Finally, as ewes were submitted to euthanasia and necropsy, some tissues of interest were collected for microbiological, molecular, and histopathological diagnoses. The groups were compared regarding the number of positive reactions according to diagnostic tests. All sheep in each group presented antibodies to Leptospira in all serological analyses, except animals of the control group. However the Santa Inês sheep presented higher concentration and duration of the titers, and their positive reactions were detected earlier than those in crossbred sheep. The antibody titers in group A (median 200, geometric mean 317.48) were significantly different from the group B (median 800, geometric mean 918.96) at D60 post-infection (P = 0,032). The Santa Inês sheep presented a higher number of positive reactions than did the crossbred sheep in the molecular diagnostic tests. According to the molecular diagnosis, the Santa Inês sheep presented more reactions (urine and vaginal fluid) compared to crossbred ewes, but there was no predominance in the detection of leptospiral DNA when comparing urine and vaginal fluid results, nor even between the number of positive kidneys and uterus. The Santa Inês sheep presented a higher number of positive bacteriological cultures. No sheep in either group presented alterations in anatomopathological and histopathological findings. Pure-bred sheep may be more susceptible than crossbred sheep to infection by Leptospira sp. Our findings emphasize the importance of the genital tract as a site of extraurinary infection and indicate the possibility of venereal transmission in the species.","['Figueiredo da Costa D', 'Cristiny Rodrigues Silva ML', 'Martins G', 'Medeiros Dantas AF', 'Almeida de Melo M', 'Santos de Azevedo S', 'Lilenbaum W', 'Alves CJ']",2018,122,,Microb Pathog,"Figueiredo da Costa D, et al.

29879104,Assessment of animal hosts of pathogenic Leptospira in northern Tanzania.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that affects more than one million people worldwide each year. Human infection is acquired through direct or indirect contact with the urine of an infected animal. A wide range of animals including rodents and livestock may shed Leptospira bacteria and act as a source of infection for people. In the Kilimanjaro Region of northern Tanzania, leptospirosis is an important cause of acute febrile illness, yet relatively little is known about animal hosts of Leptospira infection in this area. The roles of rodents and ruminant livestock in the epidemiology of leptospirosis were evaluated through two linked studies. A cross-sectional study of peri-domestic rodents performed in two districts with a high reported incidence of human leptospirosis found no evidence of Leptospira infection among rodent species trapped in and around randomly selected households. In contrast, pathogenic Leptospira infection was detected in 7.08% cattle (n = 452 [5.1-9.8%]), 1.20% goats (n = 167 [0.3-4.3%]) and 1.12% sheep (n = 89 [0.1-60.0%]) sampled in local slaughterhouses. Four Leptospira genotypes were detected in livestock. Two distinct clades of L. borgpetersenii were identified in cattle as well as a clade of novel secY sequences that showed only 95% identity to known Leptospira sequences. Identical L. kirschneri sequences were obtained from qPCR-positive kidney samples from cattle, sheep and goats. These results indicate that ruminant livestock are important hosts of Leptospira in northern Tanzania. Infected livestock may act as a source of Leptospira infection for people. Additional work is needed to understand the role of livestock in the maintenance and transmission of Leptospira infection in this region and to examine linkages between human and livestock infections.","['Allan KJ', 'Halliday JEB', 'Moseley M', 'Carter RW', 'Ahmed A', 'Goris MGA', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Keyyu J', 'Kibona T', 'Maro VP', 'Maze MJ', 'Mmbaga BT', 'Tarimo R', 'Crump JA', 'Cleaveland S']",2018,12,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Allan KJ, et al.

Previous studies have high seroprevalences of up to 55% in general population and 65% in agricultural labourers. The study subjects (1,181 in total, 781 rural and 400 urban) were interviewed and tested for antibodies against Leptospira. Multivariate models were developed to determine the risk factors in the rural and the urban population. The overall seroprevalence was 10.9%, with rural (12.9%) being higher than the urban subjects (7.0%). The commonest infecting serogroup was Icterohaemorrhagiae (53.5%), followed by Grippotyphosa (13.2%). Compared to the earlier observation, seroprevalence was lower and an apparent shift in the infecting serogroup was found. This shift was in concordance with the changing trend in animal population. Significant difference in risk factors, both in rural and urban areas, was also observed. Similar trends in seroprevalence are being observed around the world. Therefore, time to time prevalence studies are needed for the development of effective control measure.","['Vimal Raj R', 'Vinod Kumar K', 'Lall C', 'Vedhagiri K', 'Sugunan AP', 'Sunish IP', 'Sharma S', 'Vijayachari P']",2018,65,6,Zoonoses Public Health,"Vimal Raj R, et al.

29866175,Epidemiological shift and geographical heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis in China.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis morbidity and mortality rates in China have decreased since the 2000s. Further analyses of the spatiotemporal and demographic changes occurring in the last decade and its implication on estimates of disease burden are required to inform intervention strategies. In this study, we quantified the epidemiological shift and geographical heterogeneity in the burden of leptospirosis during 2005-2015 in China.
METHODS: We used reported leptospirosis case data from 1st January 2005 to 31st of December 2015 that routinely collected by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) to analyze the epidemiological trend and estimate the burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) over space, time, and demographical groups.
RESULTS: A total of 7763 cases were reported during 2005-2015. Of which, 2403 (31%) cases were the laboratory-confirmed case. Since 2005, the notified incidence rate was gradually decreased (P < 0.05) and it was relatively stable during 2011-2015 (P > 0.05). During 2005-2015, we estimated a total of 10 313 DALYs were lost due to leptospirosis comprising a total of 1804 years-lived with disability (YLDs) and 8509 years-life lost (YLLs). Males had the highest burden of disease (7149 DALYs) compared to females (3164 DALYs). The highest burden estimate was attributed to younger individuals aged 10-19 years who lived in southern provinces of China. During 2005-2015, this age group contributed to approximately 3078 DALYs corresponding to 30% of the total DALYs lost in China. Yet, our analysis indicated a declining trend in burden estimates (P < 0.001) since 2005 and remained relatively low during 2011-2015. Low burden estimates have been identified in the endemic regions where infections principally distributed. Most of the changes in DALY estimates were driven by changes in YLLs.
CONCLUSIONS: In the last 11-years, the burden estimates of leptospirosis have shown a declining trend across the country; however, leptospirosis should not be neglected as it remains an important zoonotic disease and potentially affecting the young and productive population in economically less-developed provinces in southern of China. In addition, while in the last five years the incidence has been reported at very low-level, this might not reflect the true incidence of leptospirosis. Strengthened surveillance in the endemic regions is, hence, substantially required to capture the actual prevalence to better control leptospirosis in China.","['Dhewantara PW', 'Mamun AA', 'Zhang WY', 'Yin WW', 'Ding F', 'Guo D', 'Hu W', 'Costa F', 'Ko AI', 'Soares Magalhães RJ']",2018,7,1,Infect Dis Poverty,"Dhewantara PW, et al.

29862254,Leptospirosis in Coastal South India: A Facility Based Study.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a major neglected public health problem and is highly underreported in India. The spectrum of clinical features ranges from subclinical infection to multiorgan failure. The burden of leptospirosis is more in developing countries.
OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics, clinical feature, and outcome of leptospirosis patients.
METHODS: This record based retrospective study was conducted in hospitals affiliated to Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore. The registries of the leptospirosis patients during the period of four years between January 2011 and December 2014 were reviewed and the information on demographic and clinical profile of the leptospirosis patients was recorded in the data capture sheet. The information obtained was analyzed using SPSS version 11.5.
RESULTS: The study included 202 leptospirosis victims. The mean age of the study population was 40.48 (±14.8) years. Majority of the patients presented with fever (92.1%) at the time of admission. Acute renal failure was found to be the most common complication (79.2%). Case fatality rate was found to be 3.5%.
CONCLUSION: High proportion of cases indirectly reflects the endemic nature of the disease in the study setting. The clinical presentation of the leptospirosis is highly protean and may vary from a mild illness to life-threatening complications as evident from the current study.","['Holla R', 'Darshan B', 'Pandey L', 'Unnikrishnan B', 'Kumar N', 'Thapar R', 'Mithra P', 'Kulkarni V']",2018,2018,,Biomed Res Int,"Holla R, et al.

29855753,De novo RNA-seq and functional annotation of Ornithonyssus bacoti.,"Ornithonyssus bacoti (Hirst) (Acari: Macronyssidae) is a vector and reservoir of pathogens causing serious infectious diseases, such as epidemic hemorrhagic fever, endemic typhus, tularemia, and leptospirosis. Its genome and transcriptome data are lacking in public databases. In this study, total RNA was extracted from live O. bacoti to conduct RNA-seq, functional annotation, coding domain sequence (CDS) prediction and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) detection. The results showed that 65.8 million clean reads were generated and assembled into 72,185 unigenes, of which 49.4% were annotated by seven functional databases. 23,121 unigenes were annotated and assigned to 457 species by non-redundant protein sequence database. The BLAST top-two hit species were Metaseiulus occidentalis and Ixodes scapularis. The procedure detected 12,426 SSRs, of which tri- and di-nucleotides were the most abundant types and the representative motifs were AAT/ATT and AC/GT. 26,936 CDS were predicted with a mean length of 711 bp. 87 unigenes of 30 functional genes, which are usually involved in stress responses, drug resistance, movement, metabolism and allergy, were further identified by bioinformatics methods. The unigenes putatively encoding cytochrome P450 proteins were further analyzed phylogenetically. In conclusion, this study completed the RNA-seq and functional annotation of O. bacoti successfully, which provides reliable molecular data for its future studies of gene function and molecular markers.","['Niu D', 'Wang R', 'Zhao Y', 'Yang R', 'Hu L']",2018,75,2,Exp Appl Acarol,"Niu D, et al.

29855374,Seroprevalence of 12 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Poland.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospira spp. infect humans and a wide range of domestic and wild animals, but certain species such as small rodents and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) play a particular role as reservoirs and transmission of leptospirosis as they easily adapt to many habitats including human environments. To investigate the significance of red foxes in the epidemiology of leptospirosis in Poland, a seroprevalence survey was conducted. During the 2014-2015 hunting season, blood samples of 2134 red foxes originating from the central-eastern part of Poland were collected. Serum samples were tested by a microscopic agglutination test for the presence of specific antibodies to Leptospira serovars Icterohaemorrhagiae, Grippotyphosa, Sejroe, Tarassovi, Pomona, Canicola, Hardjo, Ballum, Australis, Bataviae, Saxkoebing and Poi.
RESULTS: Antibodies to at least one serovar were detected in 561 sera (26.3%). The highest seroprevalence was found in the Subcarpathia (41.6%) and Warmia-Masuria (40.3%) provinces. Antibodies were mainly directed against serovars Poi (12.4%), Saxkoebing (11.3%), and Sejroe (6.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of red foxes to certain Leptospira serovars seems to be common in central and eastern Poland. In addition, the high prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira spp. in foxes may indicate a potential risk of infection for humans and other species coming into contact with these animals.","['Żmudzki J', 'Arent Z', 'Jabłoński A', 'Nowak A', 'Zębek S', 'Stolarek A', 'Bocian Ł', 'Brzana A', 'Pejsak Z']",2018,60,1,Acta Vet Scand,"Żmudzki J, et al.

29850303,Two Atypical Cases of Hantavirus Infections from Sri Lanka.,"There are two categories of hantaviruses resulting in two distinct illnesses. The Old World (Asia and Europe) viruses give rise to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and the New World (Americas) viruses cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Hantavirus infections have very similar clinical pictures and epidemiology to leptospirosis. Here, we present two cases of hantavirus infections from Sri Lanka (in South Asia) initially misdiagnosed as leptospirosis and later further investigated and diagnosed as hantavirus infections with serological confirmation of the diagnosis. They had clinical pictures of a combination of both HFRS and HPS as well as the involvement of the central nervous system. Hantavirus infections are rarely diagnosed in South Asia. Reports on such atypical clinical pictures of hantavirus infections are extremely rare. Having arrived at the correct diagnosis late/retrospectively, both these patients recovered notwithstanding being seriously ill, indicating adequate supportive therapy can save lives in such cases. The emergence of the hantavirus, an infection seriously affecting multiple organ systems with a high case fatality rate that is spread by aerosol and other routes, could become a serious public health issue in Sri Lanka.","['Ehelepola NDB', 'Basnayake BMLS', 'Sathkumara SMBY', 'Kaluphana KLR']",2018,2018,,Case Rep Infect Dis,"Ehelepola NDB, et al.

29848097,Diagnostic lipid changes in patients with visceral leishmaniasis.,"BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has been associated with the increase in triglyceride (TG) levels and the decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether there is a diagnostic cut-off point in these lipid profile changes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 100 patients with febrile infections. Analytically, 22 patients with VL, 18 patients with leptospirosis, 20 patients with Brucella melitensis, and 40 age- and sex-matched patients with fever and proven bacteremia (endocarditis and pyelonephritis). The lipid parameters were assessed for their diagnostic accuracy using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic statistics.
RESULTS: It was observed that coexistence of HDL-C < 15 mg/dL and ΤG > 180 mg/dL had 100% sensitivity and 67.5% specificity for the confirmation of VL. The corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 59.4% and 100%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Coexistence of high TGs and low HDL-C values may suggest VL infection in a febrile patient.","['Tsimihodimos V', 'Kei A', 'Apostolou F', 'Elisaf M']",2018,46,4,Hosp Pract (1995),"Tsimihodimos V, et al.

29846473,Pathology and pathogenesis of human leptospirosis: a commented review.,"Leptospirosis is an acute bacterial septicemic febrile disease caused by pathogenic leptospires, which affect humans and animals in all parts of the world. Transmission can occur by direct contact with infected animals or, more commonly, through indirect contact with water or soil contaminated with urine from infected animals. Leptospires enter the body by penetrating mucous membranes or skin abrasions and disseminate through the hematogenic route. In humans, leptospirosis may cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. Most cases have a biphasic clinical presentation, which begins with the septicemic phase followed by immune manifestations. The severe forms of the disease may be life threatening with multisystem damage including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, vascular damage, pulmonary hemorrhage and muscle lesions. In this review, we present and discuss the pathogenesis of the human disease and the mechanisms of cell membrane injuries, which occur mainly due to the presence of leptospires and/or their antigen/s in the host tissues.","['De Brito T', 'Silva AMGD', 'Abreu PAE']",2018,60,,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"De Brito T, et al.

29796283,A case of decompression illness not responding to hyperbaric oxygen.,"BACKGROUND: The case reinforces the importance of stepping back and looking at every possibility along with multiple co-existing pathologies. It takes into account the thought process of multiple systems and a multidisciplinary team approach. Learning points to take are that decompression illness can present atypically, but one must exclude other causes.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 42-year-old male from the West Midlands, UK, who attended the emergency department post-scuba diving with confusion, light-headedness, left arm weakness, and bilateral paraesthesia of the hands. Post-diving, he displayed typical symptoms of decompression illness. He attended the hyperbaric decompression chamber before attending the emergency department but to no resolve. A computed tomography of the head showed no signs of intracranial pathology. He had another session in the hyperbaric oxygen chamber but to no success. Upon admission, his blood showed polycythaemia. His saturation had dropped to 91% on room air, and a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram revealed no obvious cause. A magnetic resonance imaging of his head revealed some deep periventricular ischaemic changes, old and new, however no signs of gas embolism or poor flow. A bubble echo confirmed a patent foramen ovale. A leptospirosis and a vasculitis screen were both negative. Symptoms had slowly improved but he was left with a left arm motor weakness, and the team was left puzzled as to what could have caused his signs and symptoms. Through a diagnosis of exclusion, decompression sickness was the conclusive diagnosis. The patient made a full recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Decompression illness results as a sudden decrease in pressures during underwater ascent; it is caused by nitrogen bubbles forming in tissue. Additionally, a patent foramen ovale allows arterial gas emboli to cause further harm. Type 2 decompression sickness is the more severe form and includes neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular symptoms.","['Naqvi A', 'Clarence D']",2018,6,,J Intensive Care,Naqvi A and Clarence D.

29789961,Illnesses Associated with Freshwater Recreation During International Travel.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: International travel, adventure travel, and eco-tourism are increasing over the past few decades. This review aims to summarize the spectrum of infections associated with recreational freshwater activities and international travel.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recreational water activities can be associated with a wide range of infections. Acute febrile illnesses due to leptospirosis and schistosomiasis are not uncommon in travelers following extensive freshwater exposure. Aeromonas and other water-associated pathogens are important to consider in a traveler presenting with a skin and soft tissue infection. Recreational water activities are often associated with diarrheal illnesses, especially in children, and the range of enteric pathogens includes bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Shigella species and the protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia duodenalis. Infections due to free-living amebas though rare can lead to fulminant central nervous system infections. A diverse range of infections may be associated with freshwater exposure, and it is important that these entities are considered in a returning traveler presenting with an acute illness.","['Bourque DL', 'Vinetz JM']",2018,20,7,Curr Infect Dis Rep,Bourque DL and Vinetz JM.

29777636,VNTR analysis demonstrates new patterns and high genetic diversity of Leptospira sp. of animal origin in Brazil.,"UNLABELLED: Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis with a broad host range, including humans and domestic and wild animals. The taxonomic classification of Leptospira species is complex. More recently, several molecular tools have been employed in the attempt to group the different strains of leptospires. The objective of this study was the genetic characterization of Brazilian Leptospira sp. isolates obtained from wild and domestic animals. The genotyping of the strains was performed by the variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) technique, using the Leptospira interrogans/Leptospira kirschneri and Leptospira santarosai protocols. A total of 27 novel strains were characterized and 22 novel VNTR patterns were described. This study suggests a high genetic diversity among the strains obtained from different wild and domestic animals, and reinforces the need for a broad approach aligned to the One Health concept for leptospirosis.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Animal leptospirosis is an important cause of reproductive failure in livestock and economic losses to producing countries. This study describes several novel variable-number tandem repeats patterns and points out the high genetic diversity of Brazilian strains. Understanding the circulation of strains between animals is essential for the control of leptospirosis in livestock.","['Jaeger LH', 'Loureiro AP', 'Lilenbaum W']",2018,67,2,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Jaeger LH, et al.

The primary reservoir of pathogenic leptospires within urban slum environments is the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus). Motivated by the annual outbreaks of human leptospirosis in slum urban settings, the within population infection dynamics of the Norway rat were investigated in Pau da Lima, an community in Salvador, Brazil. A mechanistic model of the dynamics of leptospire infection was informed by extensive field and laboratory data was developed and explored analytically. To identify the intraspecific transmission route of most importance, a global sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number to its components was performed. In addition, different methods of rodent control were investigated by calculating target reproduction numbers. Our results suggest environmental transmission plays an important role in the maintenance of infection in the rodent population. To control numbers of wild Norway rats, combinations of controls are recommended but environmental control should also be investigated to reduce prevalence of infection in rats.","['Minter A', 'Diggle PJ', 'Costa F', 'Childs J', 'Ko AI', 'Begon M']",2018,25,,Epidemics,"Minter A, et al.

Five hundred fifty-eight dog blood samples were submitted to the Microscopic Serum Agglutination (MSA) test. We applied semi-structured questionnaires to dog owners and obtained the area of residence for projection in geographical maps. Serum prevalence was 13.8%, in which the most common serovar was icterohaemorrhagiae, with 49.2%. Dogs with street access, failure to collect food bowl and low income of owners were risk factors. There was a higher number of seropositive dogs in the rainy season, with 87.1%, which is a probable risk factor for the occurrence of cases. The distribution of seropositive dogs was widely spread in the city, with predominance of cases in anthropized areas. These risk factors favor the occurrence of anti-Leptospira antibodies in dogs that are agent maintenance sources in the city and reinforce the need for epidemiological and environmental surveillance to prevent leptospirosis.","['Silva ERDFS', 'Castro V', 'Mineiro ALBB', 'Prianti MDG', 'Martins GHC', 'Santana MDV', 'Brito LM', 'Silva SMMS']",2018,23,5,Cien Saude Colet,"Silva ERDFS, et al.

29768127,An Evaluation of Removal Trapping to Control Rodents Inside Homes in a Plague-Endemic Region of Rural Northwestern Uganda.,"Rodents pose a significant threat to human health, particularly in rural subsistence farming communities in Africa, where rodents threaten food security and serve as reservoirs of human pathogens, including the agents of plague, leptospirosis, murine typhus, rat-bite fever, Lassa fever, salmonellosis, and campylobacteriosis. Our study focused on the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda, where a majority of residents live in Uganda government-defined poverty, rely on subsistence farming for a living, and frequently experience incursions of rodents into their homes. In this study, we show that rodent removal was achieved in a median of 6 days of intensive lethal trapping with multiple trap types (range: 0-16 days). However, rodent abundance in 68.9% of homesteads returned to pretreatment levels within a median of 8 weeks (range 1-24 weeks), and at least a single rodent was captured in all homesteads by a median of 2 weeks (range 1-16 weeks) after removal efforts were terminated. Results were similar between homesteads that practiced rodent control whether or not their neighbors implemented similar strategies. Overall, intensive lethal trapping inside homes appears to be effective at reducing rodent abundance, but control was short lived after trapping ceased.","['Eisen RJ', 'Atiku LA', 'Boegler KA', 'Mpanga JT', 'Enscore RE', 'MacMillan K', 'Gage KL']",2018,18,9,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Eisen RJ, et al.

Furthermore, we present a detailed clinical case series of all travellers with leptospirosis who presented at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in the same period.
METHOD: We extracted data from the records of the Dutch Leptospirosis Reference Center (NRL) of all cases of leptospirosis in travellers in the Netherlands from 2009 to 2016. Patients who presented at the AMC were identified and clinical data were extracted from the hospital records.
RESULTS: 224 cases of travel-related leptospirosis were included. An increase of cases was observed from 2014 onwards. The majority of cases were male (78.1%), and had travelled to South-East Asia (62.1%). Of 41 AMC cases, 53.7% were hospitalised, but most patients had a relatively mild disease course, with no fatalities. A longer delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation existed in hospitalised compared to non-hospitalised patients, suggesting a benefit of early recognition and treatment.

Despite the fact that the immunity conferred is restricted to serovars with closely related lipopolysaccharide antigen, certain vaccines have remained useful, especially in endemic regions, for the protection of high-risk individuals. Other conventional vaccines such as the live-attenuated vaccine and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) vaccine have not gained popularity due to the reactive response that follows their administration and the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. With the recent breakthrough and availability of complete genome sequences of Leptospira, development of novel vaccine including recombinant protein vaccine using reverse vaccinology approaches has yielded encouraging results. However, factors hindering the development of effective leptospiral vaccines include variation in serovar distribution from region to region, establishment of renal carrier status following vaccination and determination of the dose and endpoint titres acceptable as definitive indicators of protective immunity.

29734328,"Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding leptospirosis among residents of riverside settlements of Santa Fe, Argentina.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a global and re-emerging zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira spirochetes that are shed into the environment by infected animals. Humans can get infected via contact with animal hosts or contaminated environment. In Argentina, the highest annual incidences were reported in the province of Santa Fe, where epidemic outbreaks occurred during flooding events. This study examined the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding leptospirosis among residents of riverside slum settlements from Santa Fe after a major flood.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to 113 residents of 3 riverside settlements from Santa Fe. The influence of knowledge and attitudes regarding leptospirosis on the likelihood that an individual will use preventive practices were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models. The majority of respondents (83.2%) had previously heard about leptospirosis; however specific knowledge about leptospirosis was limited. The results of the modeling efforts, show that the likelihood of using preventive practices was associated with having greater knowledge score, but not with more positive attitudes. We also found that females were more likely to use safer practices than males.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though the majority of respondents had heard about leptospirosis, a high percentage of them had limited knowledge regarding the severity of the disease and its prevalence in the region. Our results suggest that public health interventions in these riverside communities should focus on educating the public on the multiple dimensions of leptospirosis in order to attain greater adherence to preventive practices instead of intending to change the perceptions or attitudes towards the disease, which did not have a significant influence. The key challenge lies in identifying effective strategies to reach the high risk group for leptospirosis here that is male fishermen, who spend most of the time in precarious campsites on the river islands.","['Ricardo T', 'Bergero LC', 'Bulgarella EP', 'Previtali MA']",2018,12,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Ricardo T, et al.

From each herd, a questionnaire was applied and sera from 20 cows were randomly tested for leptospirosis (totaling 500 cows). Chi-square was performed to estimate the association of seroreactivity with reproductive disorders. A total of 32% of the herds were positive, all of them against serogroup Sejroe. Estrus repetition was the most important reported reproductive problem and it was strongly associated to seroreactivity against leptospirosis. Besides, specific vaccination against leptospirosis was an important protection factor against that disorder. In conclusion, control programs including, but not limited to, vaccines must be implemented on those herds in order to reduce reproductive losses, particularly estrus repetition.","['Libonati HA', 'Santos GB', 'Souza GN', 'Brandão FZ', 'Lilenbaum W']",2018,50,7,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Libonati HA, et al.

29720698,Exploring Leptospiral proteomes to identify potential candidates for vaccine design against Leptospirosis using an immunoinformatics approach.,"Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonotic disease, estimated to cause severe infection in more than one million people each year, particularly in developing countries of tropical areas. Several factors such as variable and nonspecific clinical manifestation, existence of large number of serovars and asymptomatic hosts spreading infection, poor sanitation and lack of an effective vaccine make prophylaxis difficult. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to halt its spread all over the world. In this study, an immunoinformatics approach was employed to identify the most vital and effective immunogenic protein from the proteome of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130 that may be suitable to stimulate a significant immune response aiding in the development of peptide vaccine against leptospirosis. Both B-cell and T-cell (Helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)) epitopes were predicted for the conserved and most immunogenic outer membrane lipoprotein. Further, the binding interaction of CTL epitopes with Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) was evaluated using docking techniques. A Molecular Dynamics Simulation study was also performed to evaluate the stability of the resulting epitope-MHC-I complexes. Overall, this study provides novel vaccine candidates and may prompt further development of vaccines against leptospirosis.","['Lata KS', 'Kumar S', 'Vaghasia V', 'Sharma P', 'Bhairappanvar SB', 'Soni S', 'Das J']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,"Lata KS, et al.

Of 1,759 canids, 1,043 cervids, 23 small Indian mongooses ( Herpestes auropunctatus), 1,704 raccoons ( Procyon lotor), and five striped skunks ( Mephitis mephitis), 27.0, 44.4, 30.4, 40.8, and 60%, respectively, were antibody positive for any of the six serovars. The most commonly detected serovars across all species were Bratislava and Grippotyphosa. Our results indicate that Leptospira titers are very common in a wide variety of wildlife species. These species may act as important reservoirs in the epidemiological cycle of the pathogen.

29709286,Use of geographically weighted logistic regression to quantify spatial variation in the environmental and sociodemographic drivers of leptospirosis in Fiji: a modelling study.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a globally important zoonotic disease, with complex exposure pathways that depend on interactions between human beings, animals, and the environment. Major drivers of outbreaks include flooding, urbanisation, poverty, and agricultural intensification. The intensity of these drivers and their relative importance vary between geographical areas; however, non-spatial regression methods are incapable of capturing the spatial variations. This study aimed to explore the use of geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) to provide insights into the ecoepidemiology of human leptospirosis in Fiji.
METHODS: We obtained field data from a cross-sectional community survey done in 2013 in the three main islands of Fiji. A blood sample obtained from each participant (aged 1-90 years) was tested for anti-Leptospira antibodies and household locations were recorded using GPS receivers. We used GWLR to quantify the spatial variation in the relative importance of five environmental and sociodemographic covariates (cattle density, distance to river, poverty rate, residential setting [urban or rural], and maximum rainfall in the wettest month) on leptospirosis transmission in Fiji. We developed two models, one using GWLR and one with standard logistic regression; for each model, the dependent variable was the presence or absence of anti-Leptospira antibodies. GWLR results were compared with results obtained with standard logistic regression, and used to produce a predictive risk map and maps showing the spatial variation in odds ratios (OR) for each covariate.
FINDINGS: The dataset contained location information for 2046 participants from 1922 households representing 81 communities. The Aikaike information criterion value of the GWLR model was 1935·2 compared with 1254·2 for the standard logistic regression model, indicating that the GWLR model was more efficient. Both models produced similar OR for the covariates, but GWLR also detected spatial variation in the effect of each covariate. Maximum rainfall had the least variation across space (median OR 1·30, IQR 1·27-1·35), and distance to river varied the most (1·45, 1·35-2·05). The predictive risk map indicated that the highest risk was in the interior of Viti Levu, and the agricultural region and southern end of Vanua Levu.
INTERPRETATION: GWLR provided a valuable method for modelling spatial heterogeneity of covariates for leptospirosis infection and their relative importance over space. Results of GWLR could be used to inform more place-specific interventions, particularly for diseases with strong environmental or sociodemographic drivers of transmission.

Severe leptospirosis may require medical interventions in the form of dialysis and/or mechanical ventilation and often leads to mortality. An exaggerated host immune response-in particular, a ""cytokine storm""-that causes endothelial and organ damage is associated with the disease severity and mortality.
METHODS: Microscopic agglutination test (MAT)-positive and MAT-negative human serum samples (n=30) from patients with leptospirosis were obtained from the Public Health Laboratory, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia and control serum samples (n=10) were obtained from healthy student volunteers. We estimated the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α in serum samples by a Luminex assay.
RESULTS: The levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL1-β were significantly higher in 13% of the patients with leptospirosis compared to the healthy controls, while the levels of IL-10 and TNF-α were not elevated in either group.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that elevated levels of IL-6, IL- 8, and IL1-β may be associated with leptospirosis disease severity, which requires patient follow-up for confirmation.","['Mohd Iskandar BJ', 'William T', 'Daisy Vanitha J']",2018,73,2,Med J Malaysia,"Mohd Iskandar BJ, et al.

The Caspian Sea is home for the endangered Caspian seal (Pusa caspica). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, CDV caused a series of mortality events involving at least several thousand Caspian seals. To assess current infection status in Caspian seals, we surveyed for antibodies to three pathogens with potential to cause mortality in marine mammals. During 2015-2017, we tested serum samples from 36, apparently healthy, Caspian seals, accidentally caught in fishing nets in the Caspian Sea off Northern Iran, for antibodies to CDV, L. interrogans, and T. gondii, by virus neutralization, microscopic agglutination, and modified agglutination, respectively. Twelve (33%), 6 (17%), and 30 (83%) samples were positive for CDV, L. interrogans and T. gondii antibodies, respectively. The highest titers of CDV, L. interrogans, and T. gondii antibodies were 16, 400, and 50, respectively. Frequencies of antibody to these pathogens were higher in seals >1 year old compared to seals <1 year old. Two serovars of L. interrogans (Pomona and Canicola) were detected. Our results suggest a need for additional studies to clarify the impact of these pathogens on Caspian seal population decline and the improvement of management programs, including systematic screening to detect and protect the remaining population from disease outbreaks.","['Namroodi S', 'Shirazi AS', 'Khaleghi SR', 'N Mills J', 'Kheirabady V']",2018,13,4,PLoS One,"Namroodi S, et al.

29691454,Heterologous DNA prime-protein boost immunization with RecA and FliD offers cross-clade protection against leptospiral infection.,"The emergence of >300 serovars of Leptospira confounded the use of generalized bacterin, the whole cell lysate, as vaccines to control leptospirosis. Because of substantial genetic and geographic heterogeneity among circulating serovars, one vaccine strain per serovar cannot be efficacious against all the serovars. We have performed heterologous DNA prime-protein boost vaccination challenge studies in hamsters using in vivo expressed, leptospiral recombinase A (RecA) and flagellar hook associated protein (FliD). We prepared the monovalent recombinant protein, plasmid DNA, and DNA prime protein boost adjuvant vaccines. The whole cell bacterin served as a control. Our data show that (i) RecA and FliD have multiple immunogenic B and T-cell epitopes with highly conserved domains among most prevalent pathogenic Leptospira spp., (ii) humoral and cell mediated immune responses were induced remarkably, (iii) provides significant protection against homologous (Autumnalis strain N2) and cross-clade heterologous (Canicola strain PAI-1) challenge infection for the heterologous prime-protein boost (∼91-100%) and, the DNA vaccine (∼75-83%). Recombinant protein vaccine shows only partial protection (∼58-66%), (iv) RecA prime-protein boost vaccine shows sterilizing immunity, with heterologous protection. This RecA/FliD prime-protein boost strategy holds potential for vaccination against animal leptospirosis and for a better control of zoonotic transmission.","['Raja V', 'Sobana S', 'Mercy CSA', 'Cotto B', 'Bora DP', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,"Raja V, et al.

29685217,Isolation and characterization of pathogenic leptospires associated with cattle.,"Pathogenic leptospires colonize the renal tubules of reservoir hosts of infection, including cattle, and are excreted via urine. In order to identify circulating serovars of pathogenic leptospires in beef cattle, and their associated rates of urinary excretion, a cross sectional study was performed. Fifty urine samples were collected one day each month over 12 consecutive months (N = 600), directly from the bladder of beef cattle at a single slaughter facility and assessed for the presence of leptospires by culture and the fluorescent antibody test (FAT). Where possible, a matched serum sample was also collected for the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Forty-three urine samples were either culture positive or FAT positive, indicating that 7.2% of sampled beef cattle were actively excreting leptospires in urine. Twenty-three urine samples were culture positive. Sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA and secY indicated that all isolates were Leptospira borgpetersenii. Typing by serology indicated that all isolates were serogroup Sejroe. An overall seroprevalence of 20% (MAT ≥ 1:25) was determined; positive bovine sera was most reactive to serogroup Sejroe (serovar Hardjo) (8.1%), and serogroup Australis (serovar Bratislava) (6.7%). There was poor correlation between seroprevalence and excretion of leptospires since 18/43 (41.9%) cattle, which were positive by culture or FAT, were seronegative. The virulence of two selected isolates of L. borgpetersenii was confirmed by experimental infection in small animal models of infection. Results confirm that L. borgpetesenii continues to circulate in beef cattle and that multiple diagnostic assays are required to detect active shedding. These findings also highlight beef cattle as a reservoir host for the potential zoonotic transmission of leptospires.","['Nally JE', 'Hornsby RL', 'Alt DP', 'Bayles D', 'Wilson-Welder JH', 'Palmquist DE', 'Bauer NE']",2018,218,,Vet Microbiol,"Nally JE, et al.

The sub-MIC levels of both tetracycline and doxycycline were able to induce biofilm in some of the leptospiral strains. This is the first report demonstrating the effect of sub-MIC level of antibiotics in inducing biofilm formation in Leptospira. The induction of biofilm may solely be a response to the amount of threshold stress enforced by low levels of antibiotics. The mechanism of biofilm induction by subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations needs to be explored further.

29672510,Rodent-borne diseases and their public health importance in Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Rodents are reservoirs and hosts for several zoonotic diseases such as plague, leptospirosis, and leishmaniasis. Rapid development of industry and agriculture, as well as climate change throughout the globe, has led to change or increase in occurrence of rodent-borne diseases. Considering the distribution of rodents throughout Iran, the aim of this review is to assess the risk of rodent-borne diseases in Iran.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran databases up to September 2016 to obtain articles reporting occurrence of rodent-borne diseases in Iran and extract information from them. Out of 70 known rodent-borne diseases, 34 were reported in Iran: 17 (50%) parasitic diseases, 13 (38%) bacterial diseases, and 4 (12%) viral diseases. Twenty-one out of 34 diseases were reported from both humans and rodents. Among the diseases reported in the rodents of Iran, plague, leishmaniasis, and hymenolepiasis were the most frequent. The most infected rodents were Rattus norvegicus (16 diseases), Mus musculus (14 diseases), Rattus rattus (13 diseases), Meriones persicus (7 diseases), Apodemus spp. (5 diseases), Tatera indica (4 diseases), Meriones libycus (3 diseases), Rhombomys opimus (3 diseases), Cricetulus migratorius (3 diseases), and Nesokia indica (2 diseases).

29667646,Leptospirosis and Workplace Environmental Risk Factors among Cattle Farmers in Northeastern Malaysia.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis and its occurrence has been reported to be rising globally. The environment plays an important role in the survival of Leptospira and determines the risk of infection. Those who were exposed to and had contact with contaminated environment through their occupational, recreational and other activities can be infected with the organism.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among cattle farmers, prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira, and the workplace environmental risk factors for leptospirosis among cattle farmers in northeastern Malaysia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 120 cattle farmers was conducted. The participants answered an interviewer-guided questionnaire that consisted of sociodemographic and workplace environment characteristics questionnaire, before having their blood sample taken for microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Seropositivity was determined using a cut-off titer of ≥1:100. 248 environmental samples were also collected from the cattle farms for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of leptospiral antibodies was 72.5% (95% CI 63.5% to 80.1%) and the prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira in the cattle farms environment was 12.1% (95% CI 8.4% to 17.0%). The independent factors associated with seropositivity of leptospirosis among cattle farmers were positive pathogenic Leptospira in the environment (Adj OR 5.90, 95% CI 1.34 to 26.01) and presence of garbage dumping in the farm (Adj OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 5.65).
CONCLUSION: Preventing leptospirosis incidence among cattle farmers necessitates changes in work environment. Identifying modifiable factors may also contribute to the reduction of infection.","['Daud AB', 'Mohd Fuzi NMH', 'Wan Mohammad WMZ', 'Amran F', 'Ismail N', 'Arshad MM', 'Kamarudin S']",2018,9,2,Int J Occup Environ Med,"Daud AB, et al.

Several trials have assessed vaccine efficacy in livestock but there have been no attempts to evaluate these trials jointly. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate vaccine efficacy to prevent urinary shedding of Leptospira serovar Hardjo (Hardjo) in cattle. Three databases were used to search for relevant papers published from 1980 to 2015 evaluating commercial vaccines to prevent urinary shedding of leptospires after artificial conjunctival or natural challenge. A total of 1237 articles were initially identified. Eight articles containing information from nine trials that assessed vaccine efficacy to prevent Hardjo urinary shedding, as per bacteriological culture, were included in the meta-analysis. Fixed effects Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and a Bayesian random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the efficacy of vaccination to prevent Hardjo shedding in urine. Vaccine efficacy against Hardjo challenge was 88.7% (95% CI 81.0%-93.2%) in the MH meta-analysis and 89.9% (95% probability interval 80.6%-94.9%) in the Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. There was no evidence of heterogeneity of study results (p = 0.17).

To study the expression profiles of low-dose Nor-treated leptospires, we chose LipL71/LipL21 as reference genes determined by the geNorm applet in this experiment. The results showed that low-dose Nor up-regulated the expression of FlaB and inhibited the expression of 16S rRNA, LipL32, LipL41, Loa22, KdpA, and KdpB compared with the untreated leptospires. These results indicated that low-dose Nor could regulate leptospiral gene expression. Using RT-PCR, the gene expression of IL-1β and TNF-α in J774A.1 cells was detected. Nor-treated leptospires induced higher expression levels of both IL-1β and TNF-α. However, when analyzed by ELISA, the release of mature IL-1β was reduced compared with that observed in cells induced with no Nor-treated leptospires, although the TNF-α protein level showed no significant change. Our study indicated that the gene expression of leptospires could be modulated by low-dose Nor, which induced less IL-1β release in J774A.1 cells.","['Cao Y', 'Xie X', 'Zhang W', 'Wu D', 'Tu C']",2018,119,,Microb Pathog,"Cao Y, et al.

Humans usually acquire the infection through water contaminated with animal urine that comes into direct contact with cutaneous lesions, eyes or mucous membranes.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the spatiotemporal variability in the occurrence of HL cases in Colombia between 2007 and 2016, and its relation with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle and the consequent anomalies in rainfall in spatiotemporal clusters.
METHODS: An ecological study of the HL cases, aggregated by municipality, and reported between 2007 and 2016, is presented.
FINDINGS: During the period of study, 9928 cases of HL were reported, and 58.9% of the municipalities reported at least one case of leptospirosis. Six spatiotemporal clusters were identified-five were in the Andean region and one was in the Caribbean region. The assessment of the ENSO cycle and rainfall anomalies suggests the importance of La Niña episodes, and excess rainfall periods in the occurrence of cases of HL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the importance of the ENSO cycle, rainfall periods and periods with excess rainfall in the occurrence of cases and outbreaks of HL in Colombia, and suggest the importance of the topography of valleys and flood zones as zones in which the risk of infection is elevated.","['Gutiérrez JD', 'Martínez-Vega RA']",2018,112,3,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Gutiérrez JD and Martínez-Vega RA.

29625787,Tropical diseases in the ICU: A syndromic approach to diagnosis and treatment.,"Tropical infections form 20-30% of ICU admissions in tropical countries. Diarrheal diseases, malaria, dengue, typhoid, rickettsial diseases and leptospirosis are common causes of critical illness. Overlapping clinical features makes initial diagnosis challenging. A systematic approach involving (1) history of specific continent or country of travel, (2) exposure to specific environments (forests or farms, water sports, consumption of exotic foods), (3) incubation period, and (4) pattern of organ involvement and subtle differences in manifestations help in differential diagnosis and choice of initial empiric therapy. Fever, rash, hypotension, thrombocytopenia and mild derangement of liver function tests is seen in a majority of patients. Organ failure may lead to shock, respiratory distress, renal failure, hepatitis, coma, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias or hemorrhage. Diagnosis in some conditions is made by peripheral blood smear examination, antigen detection or detection of microbial nucleic acid by PCR. Tests that detect specific IgM antibody become positive only in the second week of illness. Initial therapy is often empiric; a combination of intravenous artesunate, ceftriaxone and either doxycycline or azithromycin would cover a majority of the treatable syndromes. Additional antiviral or antiprotozoal medications are required for some specific syndromes. Involving a physician specializing in tropical or travel medicine is helpful.","['Karnad DR', 'Richards GA', 'Silva GS', 'Amin P', 'Council of the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine']",2018,46,,J Crit Care,"Karnad DR, et al.

29625765,LemA and Erp Y-like recombinant proteins from Leptospira interrogans protect hamsters from challenge using AddaVax™ as adjuvant.,"BACKGROUND: Recombinant subunit vaccines have been extensively evaluated as promising alternatives against leptospirosis. Here, we evaluated two proteins in formulations containing the adjuvant AddaVax™ as vaccine candidates for prevention and control of leptospirosis.
METHODS: Recombinant proteins rErp Y-like and rLemA were characterized by ELISA to assess their ability to bind extracellular matrix (ECM) components and fibrinogen. Groups of eight hamsters were immunized intramuscularly with rErp Y-like or rLemA mixed with a squalene-based adjuvant (AddaVax), and then vaccine efficacy was determined in terms of protection against a lethal challenge. The humoral immune response was determined by ELISA, and the evidence of sub-lethal infection was evaluated by histopathology and kidney culture.
RESULTS: rLemA protein binds laminin, fibrinogen, and collagen type IV, while rErp Y-like interacts with fibrinogen. Significant protection was achieved for rLemA and rErp Y-like vaccines, which showed 87.5% and 62.5% survivals, respectively. On day 28, the humoral immune response was significantly greater in the vaccine groups as compared to that in the control group, and the response was predominantly based on IgG2/3. The surviving animals showed negative results in culture isolation but presented with tissue lesions in the lungs and kidneys.
CONCLUSION: Cumulatively, our findings suggest that LemA and Erp Y-like proteins act as adhesins and are able to protect against mortality, but not against tissue lesions. Moreover, AddaVax is a novel adjuvant with potential for improving the immunogenicity of leptospiral vaccines.","['Oliveira TL', 'Schuch RA', 'Inda GR', 'Roloff BC', 'Neto ACPS', 'Amaral M', 'Dellagostin OA', 'Hartwig DD']",2018,36,19,Vaccine,"Oliveira TL, et al.

29624576,Quantification of pathogenic Leptospira in the soils of a Brazilian urban slum.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease that causes considerable morbidity and mortality globally, primarily in residents of urban slums. While contact with contaminated water plays a critical role in the transmission of leptospirosis, little is known about the distribution and abundance of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in soil and the potential contribution of this source to human infection.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected soil samples (n = 70) from three sites within an urban slum community endemic for leptospirosis in Salvador, Brazil. Using qPCR of Leptospira genes lipl32 and 16S rRNA, we quantified the pathogenic Leptospira load in each soil sample. lipl32 qPCR detected pathogenic Leptospira in 22 (31%) of 70 samples, though the median concentration among positive samples was low (median = 6 GEq/g; range: 4-4.31×102 GEq/g). We also observed heterogeneity in the distribution of pathogenic Leptospira at the fine spatial scale. However, when using 16S rRNA qPCR, we detected a higher proportion of Leptospira-positive samples (86%) and higher bacterial concentrations (median: 4.16×102 GEq/g; range: 4-2.58×104 GEq/g). Sequencing of the qPCR amplicons and qPCR analysis with all type Leptospira species revealed that the 16S rRNA qPCR detected not only pathogenic Leptospira but also intermediate species, although both methods excluded saprophytic Leptospira. No significant associations were identified between the presence of pathogenic Leptospira DNA and environmental characteristics (vegetation, rat activity, distance to an open sewer or a house, or soil clay content), though samples with higher soil moisture content showed higher prevalences.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to successfully quantify the burden of pathogenic Leptospira in soil from an endemic region. Our results support the hypothesis that soil may be an under-recognized environmental reservoir contributing to transmission of pathogenic Leptospira in urban slums. Consequently, the role of soil should be considered when planning interventions aimed to reduce the burden of leptospirosis in these communities.","['Schneider AG', 'Casanovas-Massana A', 'Hacker KP', 'Wunder EA', 'Begon M', 'Reis MG', 'Childs JE', 'Costa F', 'Lindow JC', 'Ko AI']",2018,12,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Schneider AG, et al.

29615623,Biogeography of Leptospira in wild animal communities inhabiting the insular ecosystem of the western Indian Ocean islands and neighboring Africa.,"Understanding the processes driving parasite assemblages is particularly important in the context of zoonotic infectious diseases. Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic bacterial infection caused by pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira. Despite a wide range of animal hosts, information is still lacking on the factors shaping Leptospira diversity in wild animal communities, especially in regions, such as tropical insular ecosystems, with high host species richness and complex biogeographical patterns. Using a large dataset (34 mammal species) and a multilocus approach at a regional scale, we analyzed the role of both host species diversity and geography in Leptospira genetic diversity in terrestrial small mammals (rodents, tenrecs, and shrews) and bats from 10 different islands/countries in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) and neighboring Africa. At least four Leptospira spp. (L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii, L. kirschneri, and L. mayottensis) and several yet-unidentified genetic clades contributed to a remarkable regional Leptospira diversity, which was generally related to the local occurrence of the host species rather than the geography. In addition, the genetic structure patterns varied between Leptospira spp., suggesting different evolutionary histories in the region, which might reflect both in situ diversification of native mammals (for L. borgpetersenii) and the more recent introduction of non-native host species (for L. interrogans). Our data also suggested that host shifts occurred between bats and rodents, but further investigations are needed to determine how host ecology may influence these events.","['Dietrich M', 'Gomard Y', 'Lagadec E', 'Ramasindrazana B', 'Le Minter G', 'Guernier V', 'Benlali A', 'Rocamora G', 'Markotter W', 'Goodman SM', 'Dellagi K', 'Tortosa P']",2018,7,1,Emerg Microbes Infect,"Dietrich M, et al.

29609182,"Effects of natural infection by L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo type Hardjo-bovis, L. interrogans serovar Pomona and leptospiral vaccination on sheep reproduction.","Most New Zealand sheep flocks are seropositive to Leptospira serovars Hardjo and/or Pomona, yet vaccination is rare. This study evaluated the impact of exposure to these serovars and of vaccination, on primiparous one- (P1) and two-year-old (P2) sheep reproduction outcomes. The study was designed as a split-flock vaccination trial, with a third of the animals vaccinated starting at one month of age. Reproduction outcomes were the proportion of bred P1 (7 months old) and as P2 (19 months old) scanned pregnant, the proportion of pregnant ewes rearing a lamb to tail docking and the proportion of docked lambs that were weaned. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare reproductive performance between vaccinated and control sheep, and within the control group, between seropositive and seronegative sheep. Odds ratios (OR) were also calculated to assess the relationship between vaccination and loss to follow-up. There was no difference in pregnancy and docking rates between vaccinated and control sheep, or between seropositive and seronegative sheep. P1 with a Hardjo titre ≥1536 were significantly less likely (OR = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.19-0.93) to keep a lamb between docking and weaning than P1 with both Hardjo and Pomona titres <1536, for an observed difference in weaning rate of up to 22.6% points on one farm. A reduction of weaning rates in 2-tooths seropositive for Pomona alone and both Hardjo and Pomona was observed but this was non-significant, possibly because of a lack of power. No difference in weaning rate was observed between vaccinated and control P1 or P2. On one farm vaccinated P1 were less likely to be lost to follow-up (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.95) between breeding and weaning. Comparing reproductive performance of vaccinated and control sheep revealed no significant difference. However, comparing exposed and non-exposed ewes revealed a possible adverse effect of Leptospira on weaning rates. This suggests that a full vaccination program may result in an improvement of reproductive outcomes, possibly by providing herd immunity.","['Vallée E', 'Heuer C', 'Collins-Emerson JM', 'Benschop J', 'Ridler AL', 'Wilson PR']",2018,114,,Theriogenology,"Vallée E, et al.

31829989,The role of gender in the prevalence of human leptospirosis in Albania.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal disease with global importance, which continues to have a major impact on public health in developing countries. The prevalence of the disease is much higher in males. The objectives of this study were: to give some data and to share our experience with human leptospirosis in Albania; to describe the prevalence regarding to the role of gender in the prevalence of human leptospirosis; to make a gender specific analysis of the clinical manifestations in patients diagnosed and treated for leptospirosis in our service and to make a review of literature related to this hypothesis.
METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the epidemiologic data, risk factors and differences in clinical presentation between males and females' patients with leptospirosis. These data are analysed from hospitalized patients. Diagnosis of leptospirosis was established based on clinical presentation, epidemiological data and subsequently confirmed serologically by Anti-Leptospira IgM antibodies through ELISA test.
RESULTS: Between 2005-2016, 233 cases of confirmed leptospirosis were analysed. Males were 208 (89.27%) and 25 of patients (10.72%) were females in ratio 9:1 p < 0.001. The highest prevalence was observed in the 45-64 age groups. Overall mortality was found to be 8.58%, 19 were males and one female p < 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a much higher prevalence of leptospirosis in middle aged men. Mortality rate seems to be similar in males and females. While the difference in prevalence may be related to exposure to risk factors, further investigation is necessary to study gender-based genetic and immunological predisposition.","['Puca E', 'Pipero P', 'Harxhi A', 'Abazaj E', 'Gega A', 'Puca E', 'Akshija I']",2018,12,3,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Puca E, et al.

As a zoonosis, leptospirosis control requires interventions in sectors beyond the usual control of health-in Fiji, the dairy and sugar industries, and water and sanitation and rodent control in communities. This paper presents the findings of qualitative research to inform policy around governance for a One Health multisectoral approach to leptospirosis control.
METHODS: Key informants from relevant government agencies and industry organizations were interviewed in late 2014, and the interviews analyzed and triangulated with documentary analysis.
FINDINGS: The analysis identified 5 themes: perceptions of the impact of leptospirosis, governance processes, models for collaboration, leptospirosis control, and preferred leadership for leptospirosis management. Data were limited, with poor communication between ministries, and limited awareness of leptospirosis outside outbreaks. Collaboration during outbreaks was positive but not sustained in endemic periods. Mechanism for enhanced collaboration was developed for endemic and outbreak situations.
CONCLUSION: The findings informed a One Health governance approach to leptospirosis, framed within a National Strategic Plan, with a specific National Action Plan for Leptospirosis. The process provides a research based One Health template for application to other zoonotic diseases.","['McPherson A', 'Hill PS', 'Kama M', 'Reid S']",2018,,,Int J Health Plann Manage,"McPherson A, et al.

Since 2015 a multidisciplinary group has been established in Sacco Hospital for the management of the patients affected by Lyme disease (LD). A retrospective evaluation (2015-2017) was performed for LD in non-endemic areas.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all 1000 samples for 800 patients screened for LD antibodies at the Sacco Hospital in 3 years (2015-2017). Clinical and epidemiological data were collected and compared with the serological results.
RESULTS: Among the 800 patients screened, 134 of them were diagnosed with borreliosis during 2015 (37 cases), 2016 (31 cases) and 2017 (66 cases). Localized LD was diagnosed 100 out of 134 cases (69%): in most of them (N.=63) erythema migrans has been documented; in 37 out of 100 it was not possible to detect it. In only three cases, patients complained of different clinical symptoms such as headache, arm and facial pain respectively. 23 out of 134 cases (16%) showed a persistence of serological positivity and symptoms with osteomuscular involvement and fatigue, despite the therapy (late LD). In that same study 11 out of 134 patients (7%) received a diagnosis of neuroborreliosis.

31093055,[Detection of Leptospire spp. in animals and in environmental samples from peridomestic areas in NicaraguaDetecção de Leptospira spp. em animais e em amostras ambientais de áreas peridomiciliares na Nicarágua].,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in pets and in humans in peridomestic settings in Nicaragua between 2014 and 2016.
METHODS: The samples were taken in areas where cases were confirmed in humans using non-probabilistic sampling in 10 of the country's 17 departments. This included 112 urine samples from pets, 129 water samples, and 69 soil samples in order to isolate leptospires in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium. Furthermore, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was applied to 263 samples of animal serum, and 88 isolates were analyzed using PCR.
RESULTS: In 32.6% (101/310) of the samples, spirochetes were isolated: 23.2% (26/112) in the pet urine, 47.3% (61/129) in water samples, and 20.3% (14/69) in soil samples. Isolation analysis showed significant differences (p<0.05) between departments for the different types of samples, and isolation was more frequent in water than in soil (OR = 3.49; CI95%: 1.56-7.80). In total, 14.1% (37/263) of the animals were reactors in the microscopic agglutination test. The most frequent serogroup was

29581051,"Febrile illness in Asia: gaps in epidemiology, diagnosis and management for informing health policy.","BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence is becoming available on the aetiology and management of fevers in Asia; the importance of these fevers has increased with the decline in the incidence of malaria.
AIMS: To conduct a narrative review of the epidemiology and management of fevers in South and South-East Asia and to highlight gaps in our knowledge that impair evidence-based health policy decisions.
SOURCES: A narrative review of papers published since 2012 on developments in fever epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment in South and South-East Asia. The papers that the authors felt were pivotal, from their personal perspectives, are discussed.
CONTENT: We identified 100 studies. Among the 30 studies (30%)-including both children and adults-that investigated three or more pathogens, the most frequently reported fever aetiology was dengue (reported by 15, 50%), followed by leptospirosis (eight, 27%), scrub typhus (seven, 23%) and Salmonella serovar Typhi (six, 20%). Among four studies investigating three or more pathogens in children, dengue and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent, followed by non-typhoidal Salmonella spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella serovar Typhi, and Orientia tsutsugamushi. Increased awareness is needed that rickettsial pathogens are common but do not respond to cephalosporins, and that alternative therapies, such as tetracyclines, are required.
IMPLICATIONS: Many key gaps remain, and consensus guidelines for study design are needed to aid comparative understanding of the epidemiology of fevers. More investment in developing accurate and affordable diagnostic tests for rural Asia and independent evaluation of those already on the market are needed. Treatment algorithms, including simple biomarker assays, appropriate for empirical therapy of fevers in different areas of rural Asia should be a major aim of fever research. Enhanced antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and openly accessible databases of geography-specific AMR data would inform policy on empirical and specific therapy. More investment in innovative strategies facilitating infectious disease surveillance in remote rural communities would be an important component of poverty reduction and improving public health.","['Shrestha P', 'Roberts T', 'Homsana A', 'Myat TO', 'Crump JA', 'Lubell Y', 'Newton PN']",2018,24,8,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Shrestha P, et al.

29575146,Evaluation of inhibitors for development of a selective medium for isolation of Leptospira spp. from clinical samples.,"UNLABELLED: This study was conducted to develop a selective medium for the detection of Leptospira spp. in clinical samples. Serovars of Leptospira spp., environmental bacteria and the fungus from contaminated cultures of patients with suspected leptospirosis were inoculated into EMJH medium containing amphotericin B, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), furazolidone and neomycin used singly or combined. Medium with 5-FU at the concentration of 200 μg ml
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases in the world. Since certain serovars are often associated with the symptoms and severity of the disease, the isolation and identification of the leptospires usually permits the prediction of sources of infection. Attempts to isolate Leptospira spp. from clinical specimens are often frustrated by overgrowth of the slow-growing bacteria by more rapidly growing contaminants. In this study, we evaluated selective agents to develop a new selective medium to isolate leptospires. The results demonstrated that the association of drugs in concentrations that allowed the growth of leptospires is to be more effective in inhibiting bacterial contaminants.","['Pinhata JMW', 'Blanco RM', 'Romero EC']",2018,66,6,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Pinhata JMW, et al.

29570957,Sensitive Leptospira DNA detection using tapered optical fiber sensor.,"This paper presents the development of tapered optical fiber sensor to detect a specific Leptospira bacteria DNA. The bacteria causes Leptospirosis, a deadly disease but with common early flu-like symptoms. Optical single mode fiber (SMF) of 125 μm diameter is tapered to produce 12 μm waist diameter and 15 cm length. The novel DNA-based optical fiber sensor is functionalized by incubating the tapered region with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde. Probe DNA is immobilized onto the tapered region and subsequently hybridized by its complementary DNA (cDNA). The transmission spectra of the DNA-based optical fiber sensor are measured in the 1500 to 1600 nm wavelength range. It is discovered that the shift of the wavelength in the SMF sensor is linearly proportional with the increase in the cDNA concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 nM. The sensitivity of the sensor toward DNA is measured to be 1.2862 nm/nM and able to detect as low as 0.1 fM. The sensor indicates high specificity when only minimal shift is detected for non-cDNA testing. The developed sensor is able to distinguish between actual DNA of Leptospira serovars (Canicola and Copenhageni) against Clostridium difficile (control sample) at very low (femtomolar) target concentrations.","['Zainuddin NH', 'Chee HY', 'Ahmad MZ', 'Mahdi MA', 'Abu Bakar MH', 'Yaacob MH']",2018,11,8,J Biophotonics,"Zainuddin NH, et al.

Even if there have been reports documenting the prevalence of scrub typhus in different parts of India, it is still an unknown entity, and clinicians usually do not consider it as differential diagnosis. The present study was performed to document the prevalence of scrub typhus among febrile patients in western part of Uttar Pradesh and to assess the clinical profile of infected patients on the one hand and knowledge, attitude, and practices among clinicians on the other.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 357 adult patients with fever of more than 5-day duration were recruited. All patients underwent complete physical examination, and detailed clinical history was elicited as per predesigned pro forma. After primary screening to rule out malaria, enteric fever, and leptospirosis infection, secondary screening for scrub typhus was done by rapid screen test and IgM ELISA.
RESULTS: Scrub typhus infection was positive in 91 (25.5%) cases. The most common symptoms among the patients were fever (100%), pain in abdomen (79.1%), pedal edema 56 (61.5%), rash 44 (48.3%), headache 44 (48.3%), vomiting 42 (46.1%), constipation 33 (36.2%), cough 28 (30.7%), and lymphadenopathy 20 (21.9%).

29554124,Thai-Lepto-on-admission probability (THAI-LEPTO) score as an early tool for initial diagnosis of leptospirosis: Result from Thai-Lepto AKI study group.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is one of the most important zoonosis in the tropics. Currently, specific laboratory diagnostic test for leptospirosis such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or direct culture cannot be applied at the primary care setting especially in the resource- limited countries. Therefore, clinical presentation and laboratory examination are still the primary diagnostic tools for leptospirosis.
OBJECTIVES: To detect clinical factors for predicting leptospirosis in suspected cases, and to create a clinical prediction score (THAI-LEPTO) that is practical and easy to use in general practice while awaiting laboratory results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective multicenter study with a development and a validation cohort of patients presenting with clinical suspicion of leptospirosis as per the WHO clinical criteria. The development cohort was conducted at 11 centers in 8 provinces around Thailand. The validation cohort was conducted at 4 centers in 1 province from the Northeastern part of Thailand. Leptospirosis confirmed cases were defined if any one of the tests were positive: microscopic agglutination test, direct culture, or PCR technique. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of leptospirosis. The clinical prediction score was derived from the regression coefficients (original) or from the odds ratio values (simplified). We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic ability of our score and to find the optimal cutoff values of the score. We used a validation cohort to evaluate the accuracy of our methods.
RESULTS: In the development cohort, we enrolled 221 leptospirosis suspected cases and analyzed 211. Among those, 105 (50%) were leptospirosis confirmed cases. In logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, day of fever, and one clinical factor at a time, leptospirosis group had more hypotension OR = 2.76 (95% CI 1.07-7.10), jaundice OR = 3.40 (95%CI 1.48-8.44), muscle pain OR = 2.12 (95%CI 1.06-4.26), acute kidney injury (AKI) OR = 2.90 (95%CI 1.31-6.15), low hemoglobin OR = 3.48 (95%CI 1.72-7.04), and hypokalemia with hyponatremia OR = 3.56 (95%CI 1.17-10.84) than non-leptospirosis group. The abovementioned factors along with neutrophilia and pulmonary opacity were used in the development of the score. The simplified score with 7 variables was the summation of the odds ratio values as follows: hypotension 3, jaundice 2, muscle pain 2, AKI 1.5, low hemoglobin 3, hypokalemia with hyponatremia 3, and neutrophilia 1. The score showed the highest discriminatory power with area under the curve (AUC) 0.82 (95%CI 0.67-0.97) on fever day 3-4. In the validation cohort we enrolled 96 leptospirosis suspected cases and analyzed 92. Of those, 69 (75%) were leptospirosis confirmed cases. The performance of the simplified score with 7 variables at a cutoff of 4 was AUC 0.78 (95%CI 0.68-0.89); sensitivity 73.5; specificity 73.7; positive predictive value 87.8; negative predictive value 58.3.
CONCLUSIONS: THAI-LEPTO score is a newly developed diagnostic tool for early presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis in patients presenting with severe clinical suspicion of the disease. The score can easily be applied at the point of care while awaiting confirmatory laboratory results. Each predictor used has been supported by evidence of clinical and pathophysiological correlation.","['Sukmark T', 'Lumlertgul N', 'Peerapornratana S', 'Khositrangsikun K', 'Tungsanga K', 'Sitprija V', 'Srisawat N', 'Thai-Lepto AKI study group']",2018,12,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Sukmark T, et al.

29549699,Hamster IFN-γ+CD4+ and IL-4+CD4+ T cell responses against leptospires are significantly higher than those of mice.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by the Leptospira interrogans. The hamster is considered a susceptible host while the mouse is resistant. The knowledge of hamster T cell immunity is limited compared to the mouse. The reason why the hamster and the mouse give different responses to leptospires remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the differential responses of CD4+ T cells between hamsters and mice using Leptospira interrogans as an infectious model.
METHODS: The CD4+ T-cell reactivity and their intracellular cytokine responses after infection with live L.interrogans serovar Autumnalis or leptospiral antigens, or injection with recombinant LipL32 protein (rLipL32) were elucidated. For secondary immune responses, mononuclear cells were re-stimulated with leptospiral crude antigens (LAg) or rLipL32. Intracellular cytokines and CD4+ T cells were determined using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the percentages of hamster and mouse CD4+ and CD25+CD4+ T cell responses to live bacteria. Mouse CD4+ (24.50±1.98%) and CD25+CD4+ T cells (3.83±0.88) responded significantly higher than those of hamster (15.07±2.82% and 2.00±0.37%) when infected and re-stimulated with LAg. The numbers of IFN-γ and IL-4 producing cells in hamsters at 1.76±0.10% and 0.82±0.25% for IFN-γ+CD4+ and IL-4+CD4+ T cells were significantly higher than those in resistant mice at 0.10±0.02% and 0.23±0.03% for IFN-γ+CD4+ and IL-4+CD4+ T cells.
CONCLUSION: Hamsters responded significantly higher in secondary stimulation especially in the levels of the IFN-γ+ and IL-4+CD4+ T cells.

29529330,Overview of laboratory methods to diagnose Leptospirosis and to identify and to type leptospires.,"Leptospirosis is a virulent zoonosis with a global distribution. Pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira are responsible for this disease, and the primary animal reservoirs are rodentvvvs. Direct and indirect contact with infected urine constitutes the main route of transmission. Renal failure and advanced abortions are frequently observed in animals affected by leptospirosis, causing serious problems for farms. In humans, there is a high rate of mortality (10 percent), and farmers and persons in contact with water are frequently exposed. However, vaccines and strict prevention measures confer protection against leptospirosis. Serological tests facilitate the detection and identification of leptospire strains. Such tests are based on specific surface antigen recognition and are used for clinical analyses. To determine which serovars circulate in the environment, leptospires must be typed. Molecular methods, such as restriction enzyme-based techniques and the sequencing of specific regions, permit serovar identification. Unfortunately, although there are numerous techniques, they are not very efficient, and thus, new methods must be developed. With the advent of genomic sequencing, a substantial amount of information regarding leptospire genomes is now available, facilitating the selection of regions to discriminate between strains. Typing is important for both epidemiologic purposes and clinical analyses.","['Marquez A', 'Djelouadji Z', 'Lattard V', 'Kodjo A']",2017,20,4,Int Microbiol,"Marquez A, et al.

29526720,Leptospirosis in Spanish travelers returning from Chiang Mai: A case series.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis worldwide, nevertheless is often poor recognized in non tropical settings. In Thailand is becoming an emerging disease and Chiang Mai could become a popular spot to acquire the disease amongst travelers.
METHODS: We describe three cases of imported leptospirosis undifferentiated fever after travelling to Thailand during the summer of 2015 diagnosed at two Spanish hospitals.
RESULTS: Our three patients probably acquired leptospirosis while swimming in freshwater around Chiang Mai, a Thailand's northern region with moderate incidence of leptopirosis. Travelers had normal white blood cell counts and low platelets, suggesting leptospirosis after ruling out other imported diseases such as malaria, dengue or typhoid.
CONCLUSION: As recent findings point out, low platelets and normal white blood cell counts are clinical features that could help the clinician to suspect Leptospirosis infection. It should be always considered as a cause of fever, particularly if travelers come from a tropical country and have had contact with water or flooding, especially during rainy season.","['Rodriguez-Valero N', 'Moriñigo HM', 'Martínez MJ', 'Peiró A', 'Oliveira I', 'Bodro M', 'Gómez-Junyent J', 'Gascon J', 'Muñoz J']",2018,23,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Rodriguez-Valero N, et al.

29525230,Seroprevalence of Leptospirosis in Working Dogs.,"Working dogs are canine animals that have been trained to assist human beings in carrying out various tasks. They help in guarding property, performing rescues, assisting the visually impaired or physically handicapped, searching for drugs, explosives, and others. Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases in the world and a commonly occurring disease of the tropics and subtropics. In Malaysia, all working dogs are normally vaccinated with serovars, Pomona, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Canicola, and Grippotyphosa based on protocols recommended from other countries. The duration of immunity in vaccinated dogs for Leptospira can last up to 13 months; however, there is no full crossprotection between the different serovars. Five representative canine units from different government agencies in Malaysia (n = 96 dogs) were recruited in this study. For detection, the microscopic agglutination test was performed by incubating the serum from dogs with various serovars of leptospires, namely, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Canicola, Pomona, Grippotyphosa, Australis, Bataviae, Javanica, Tarassovi, Hebdomadis, Lai, and Pyrogenes. The plasma obtained was used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, for the detection of 16S rRNA, and lipL 32 genes of Leptospira. Out of the 96 dogs sampled, only 3 dogs were positive toward serovars, Australis, Bataviae, and Javanica, based on the cutoff point at 1:80. The seroprevalence of canine leptospirosis in this population was 3.1% (n = 3/96). However, all 96 blood samples of working dogs tested negative for both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Leptospira genes. The results revealed that, by vaccination alone, working dogs were not fully protected against leptospirosis and could pose a risk to dog handlers. A preventative and control protocol for leptospirosis is warranted, and its implementation should be monitored and improved accordingly from time to time, in order to maintain a healthy condition in both working dogs and their handlers.","['Lau SF', 'Wong JY', 'Khor KH', 'Roslan MA', 'Abdul Rahman MS', 'Bejo SK', 'Radzi R', 'Bahaman AR']",2017,32,4,Top Companion Anim Med,"Lau SF, et al.

Currently, serological assays suffer from inconsistent performance and are less useful for early diagnosis of leptospirosis. As an alternative, qPCR is more sensitive, specific and able to detect the presence of leptospiral DNA during the acute phase of the infection. Meanwhile, most molecular assays do not detect the non-pathogenic group of Leptospira, even though these groups may also infect humans, although less frequently and less severely.
METHODS: A set of primers and probe targeting rrs genes of 22 Leptospira spp. were designed and evaluated on 31 Leptospira isolates, 41 other organisms and 65 clinical samples from suspected patients.
RESULTS: The developed assay was able to detect as low as 20 fg Leptospira DNA per reaction (equivalent to approximately 4 copies) and showed high specificity against the tested leptospiral strains. No cross amplification was observed with the other organisms. During the evaluation of the confirmed clinical specimens, the developed assay was able to correctly identify all positive samples (n = 10/10). One amplification was observed in a negative sample (n = 1/55). The sequencing of the PCR product of the discordant sample revealed that the sequences were similar to those of L. interrogans and L. kirschneri.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the developed Taqman qPCR assay is sensitive, specific and has potential to be applied in a larger subsequent study.","['Mohd Ali MR', 'Mohd Safee AW', 'Ismail NH', 'Abu Sapian R', 'Mat Hussin H', 'Ismail N', 'Yean Yean C']",2018,38,,Mol Cell Probes,"Mohd Ali MR, et al.

29518223,Building prognostic models for adverse outcomes in a prospective cohort of hospitalised patients with acute leptospirosis infection in the Philippines.,"Leptospirosis is endemic to the Philippines. Ten per cent of cases will develop severe or fatal disease. Predicting progression to severity is difficult. Risk factors have been suggested, but few attempts have been made to create predictive models to guide clinical decisions. We present two models to predict the risk of mortality and progression to severe disease. Data was used from a prospective cohort study conducted between 2011 and 2013 in San Lazaro Hospital, Manila. Predictive factors were identified from a literature review. A strategy utilizing backwards stepwise-elimination and multivariate fractional polynomials identified key predictive factors. A total of 203 patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall mortality rate was 6.84%. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that neutrophil counts [OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.15-1.67] and platelet counts [OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-0.99] were predictive for risk of mortality. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that male sex (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.22-12.57) and number of days between symptom onset and antibiotic use (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08-1.53) were predictive for risk of progression to severe disease. The multivariable prognostic models for the risks of mortality and progression to severe disease developed could be useful in guiding clinical management by the early identification of patients at risk of adverse outcomes.","['Lee N', 'Kitashoji E', 'Koizumi N', 'Lacuesta TLV', 'Ribo MR', 'Dimaano EM', 'Saito N', 'Suzuki M', 'Ariyoshi K', 'Parry CM']",2017,111,12,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Lee N, et al.

29514334,"A Study on the Leptospirosis Outbreak Among US Marine Trainees in Okinawa, Japan.","INTRODUCTION: The US Marines operate the Jungle Warfare Training Center (JWTC) in Northern Okinawa, where leptospirosis is endemic. The JWTC endurance course involves prolonged fresh and stagnant water exposures in a simulated jungle warfare environment. Since a leptospirosis outbreak in 1987, JWTC has required prophylactic use of doxycycline at 200 mg weekly during exposure to the endurance course. This policy is based on a 1982 study in a similar environment in Panama. In August and September of 2014, an outbreak of leptospirosis occurred among 81 Marines training at JWTC. We analyzed data from the largest reported outbreak of leptospirosis among US military members.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and thirty nine US Marines who completed the endurance course were interviewed by trained personnel regarding their exposures and use of prophylactic medication utilizing a standardized questionnaire. All available personnel who went through the course during the outbreak period were interviewed regardless of whether or not they became ill. The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch's case definition was used to identify cases.
RESULTS: Eighty-one cases in 239 personnel were identified (attack rate = 33.9%). Exposures linked to being a case were swallowing water in the stagnant pond (attack rate ratio [ARR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-3.7), cuts on the body (ARR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.01-2.11), and insect bites (ARR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.2-3.4). Exposures not linked to being a case were taking doxycycline before the exposure (ARR = 3.2, 95% CI = 0.5-22.2), taking doxycycline after the exposure (ARR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.6-1.3), and swallowing water in the natural stream (ARR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.9-1.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Attack rate data indicate that whether or not personnel took pre- or post-exposure doxycycline made no difference statistically. Increased internal exposure (via swallowing water or through broken skin) increased risk of symptomatic disease. This new study combined with a growing body of literature should prompt researchers to re-examine recommendations for those with significant water exposure in areas with high leptospirosis levels.","['Dierks J', 'Servies T', 'Do T']",2018,183,3-4,Mil Med,"Dierks J, et al.

29494314,Molecular Epidemiological Survey of Leptospira Infection of Wild Rodents in the Urban Settlement of Cambodia.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis remains a major public health threat in Cambodia. In this study, we aimed at facilitating the development of preventive strategies against leptospirosis in Cambodia by conducting molecular epidemiological surveys of Leptospira infection among wild rodents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-three wild rodents were captured in the capital Phnom Penh and surrounding areas, and their kidneys and bladders were collected for analysis. Identification of wild rodent species was determined by using the cytochrome c oxidase I gene. TaqMan PCR of the flagellin B gene (flaB) was performed to detect Leptospira, and species of the isolates were identified by flaB sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: The species and respective number of rodents collected were as follows: Rattus norvegicus, 80 (49.1%); Rattus argentiventer, 53 (32.5%); Rattus exulans, 6 (3.7%); Rattus indica, 15 (9.2%); Maxomys surifer, 3 (1.8%); and Rattus sp., 6 (3.7%). Leptospira was detected in 20 out of the 163 rodents (12.3%) and was categorized as either Leptospira interrogans or Leptospira noguchii. R. norvegicus had the highest prevalence of Leptospira (17.5%), and R. argentiventer and Rattus sp. showed infection rates of 9.4% and 16.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, wild rodents living in urban areas of Cambodia were found to be important reservoirs of highly virulent Leptospira. The flaB sequence results of our study provided information regarding the prevalence of Leptospira species, which was dependent on the rodent species. This study is the first study on leptospirosis in wild rodents in the urban areas of Cambodia, where there is limited information on leptospirosis.","['Kudo Y', 'Vansith K', 'Rin E', 'Uchida K', 'Kodama S', 'Fukui T', 'Masuda S', 'Masuzawa T']",2018,18,3,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Kudo Y, et al.

33601801,Obtaining and characterization of a recombinant LipL32 protein for detection of leptospirosis.,Leptospirosis is a disease which affects domestic and wild animals as well as humans. A highly conserved outer membrane lipoprotein LipL32 is considered to be an important antigen for detection of leptospirosis. In this study the recombinant protein LipL32 was extracted and characterized by immunochemical methods. The recombinant protein LipL32 was produced in Escherichia coli. We have optimized a LipL32 gene for expression in Rosetta (DE3) strain. 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate was used to solubilize the protein and expressed into inclusion bodies. Immunochemical studies demonstrated a high reactivity of the recombinant LipL32 with antibodies elicited during infection of pathogenic Leptospira serovars. This study tested the diagnostic performance of the recombinant LipL32 in an in-house ELISA. The indirect ELISA was developed and its specificity was compared to that of a traditional microagglutination test (MAT).,"['Zhylkibayev A', 'Akishev Z', 'Khassenov B', 'Sarina N', 'Ramankulov Y', 'Mukanov K', 'Eskendirova S']",2018,35,1,Trop Biomed,"Zhylkibayev A, et al.

Leptospirosis has recently emerged as one of the most important diseases of public health concern. Here, we aimed to obtain a baseline data on the level of Leptospira exposure among the 107 Orang Asli volunteers using a recombinant antigen-based ELISA, previously shown to have sensitivity of ~90.0% in comparison to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Among the Orang Asli volunteers in this study, 60.7% had IgM against Leptospira and 57.9% were antiLeptospira IgG positive. Of these seropositive individuals, 29.9% had both anti-Leptospira IgM and IgG antibodies. Age was found to be a significant predictor for exposure to Leptospira (P < 0.05) with the younger Orang Asli population more likely to be tested positive for antiLeptospira IgM. The finding of high Leptospira exposure among the Orang Asli volunteers could be due to their socio-economic practices and dependency on the forest for their livelihood. The rapid and sensitive recombinant antigen-based ELISA used in the study, could possibly complement MAT for the epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis, especially among the underserved populations.","['Loong SK', 'Khor CS', 'Chen HW', 'Chao CC', 'Ling ISC', 'Abdul Rahim NF', 'Hassan HS', 'Nellis S', 'Ching WM', 'AbuBakar S']",2018,35,1,Trop Biomed,"Loong SK, et al.

31825912,"Seroepidemiology of leptospirosis in Guilan province, northern Iran: comparison between MAT and IgM-ELISA techniques.","INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease which is endemic in Guilan province, Iran. Besides economic losses in the dairy industry, leptospirosis is also considered an important public health problem. This study aimed to evaluate two serological techniques, MAT and IgM-ELISA for detection of leptospiral antibodies.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 185 samples were collected from individuals in Guilan province suspected of having leptospirosis from April 2016 to December 2016. Sera from participants were analyzed for Leptospira IgM antibodies using an available ELISA test and the MAT method. The specificity and sensitivity of the tests were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: Of the 185 serum samples examined 114 (61.6%) and 94 (50.8%) samples were determined to be positive by MAT and IgM-ELISA, respectively. The results also showed that 17.5% of the sera that reacted positive in MAT were negative by IgM-ELISA, and 20.2% of IgM-ELISA positive sera were negative by MAT. We also showed that the MAT had specificity and sensitivity of 100%, when compared to leptospirosis-positive and negative serum samples. The specificity and sensitivity of IgM-ELISA was calculated as 78.8% and 82.4% respectively when compared with MAT. Bivariate analysis showed high correlation between the season, community of residence, possible reasons of pollution and leptospirosis (P < 0.1).
CONCLUSION: Rural areas of Guilan, especially rice farming areas, are endemic for leptospirosis. Rice farmers have a high risk of infection with leptospirosis; infection is associated with direct exposure to rodent urine, gender (male) and season (spring).","['Araghian A', 'Elmi A', 'Farahbakhsh M', 'Hosseini S', 'Faezi S']",2018,12,2,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Araghian A, et al.

29486240,Under-diagnosis of rickettsial disease in clinical practice: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Rickettsial diseases present as acute febrile illnesses, sometimes with inoculation eschars.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies published between 1997 and 2017 to assess the underestimation of non-eschar rickettsial disease (NERD) relative to eschar rickettsial disease (ERD), as a cause of acute fever in patients with rickettsial diseases that commonly present with eschar(s): scrub typhus (ST), Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), and African tick-bite fever. We compared ERD/NERD ratios according to study design: 'complete approach' studies, with testing performed in all patients with 'unspecified febrile illness'; versus 'clinical judgement' studies, with testing performed if patients presented with specific symptoms.
RESULTS: In 'complete approach' studies, ERD/NERD ratios were significantly lower, suggesting a considerable under-diagnosis of NERD in 'clinical judgement' studies. Based on these results, we estimate that the diagnosis of rickettsial disease was missed in 66.5% of patients with ST, and in 57.9% of patients with MSF.
CONCLUSIONS: Study design influences the reported eschar rates in ST and MSF significantly. NERD is likely to be a vastly underdiagnosed entity, and clinicians should consider and test for the disease more often.

Several leptospiral proteins that are upregulated during infection have been described, but their utility as a diagnostic marker is still unclear. In this study, we undertook a lipidomics approach to determine if there are any differences in the serum lipid profiles of horses naturally infected with pathogenic Leptospira spp. and horses vaccinated against a commercially available bacterin. Utilizing a high-resolution mass spectrometry serum lipidomics analytical platform, we demonstrate that cyclic phosphatidic acids, diacylglycerols, and hydroperoxide oxidation products of choline plasmalogens are elevated in the serum of naturally infected as well as vaccinated horses. Other lipids of interest were triacylglycerols that were only elevated in the serum of infected horses and sphingomyelins that were increased only in the serum of vaccinated horses.

We previously validated the point-of-care Dual Path Platform (DPP) for leptospirosis with sera in the laboratory. This prospective study compares the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of the DPP using finger stick blood (FSB) against the serum DPP, venous whole blood (VWB) DPP, IgM-ELISA, and clinical impression. We sequentially enrolled 98 patients hospitalized for acute febrile illnesses, of which we confirmed 32 by leptospirosis reference tests. Among syndromes consistent with classic leptospirosis, the FSB DPP showed similar sensitivity and specificity (Se 93% and Sp 80%), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV 74% and NPV 95%), to VWB DPP (Se 96%, Sp 75%, PPV 68%, and NPV 97%), serum DPP (Se 85%, Sp 87%, PPV 79%, and NPV 91%) and IgM-ELISA (Se 81%, Sp 100%, PPV 100%, and NPV 90%). The FSB DPP provided a favorable likelihood ratio profile (positive LR 4.73, negative LR 0.09) in comparison to other assays and clinical impression alone. Additionally, we identified four of five leptospirosis-associated meningitis patients by whole blood DPP, none of which clinicians suspected. This demonstrates potential for the DPP in routine detection of this less common syndrome. The FSB DPP demonstrated similar discrimination for severe human leptospirosis compared with serum assays, and it is a simpler option for diagnosing leptospirosis. Its performance in other epidemiological settings and geographic regions, and for detecting atypical presentations, demands further evaluation.","['Nabity SA', 'Hagan JE', 'Araújo G', 'Damião AO', 'Cruz JS', 'Nery N', 'Wunder EA', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI', 'Ribeiro GS']",2018,12,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Nabity SA, et al.

29457993,Leptospira seroprevalence in animals in the Caribbean region: A systematic review.,"This systematic review summarises the data published on the Leptospira seroprevalence, serovar diversity and distribution among animal species in the Caribbean region. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, and checklist, relevant articles were identified and data were extracted and recorded. The review provided Leptospira seroprevalence data from 16 Caribbean islands (Barbados, Trinidad, Grenada, Puerto Rico, Saint Croix, St. Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica, Antigua, Carriacou, Dominica, Guadalupe, Martinique, Monserrat, St. Lucia, St. Maarten, and St. Vincent) in a variety of animal species. Reviewing the literature highlighted the limited amount of data available from limited number of islands. Many of the studies conducted have recorded seroprevalences based on variable and small samples sizes. Besides, serovar panels used for MAT were not consistent between studies. The review indicates that the Leptospira exposure in a given geographic location may change with time and climatic and environmental conditions, and highlights the need to conduct continual surveillance in tropical countries where the climate supports the survival of Leptospira in the environment. Specific attention must be given to standardization of MAT panels and protocols and providing training across laboratories involved in testing. Further, animal and environment testing to isolate and identify circulating Leptospira spp. in a geographic region must actively be pursued. This knowledge is important to implement geographically specific control programs, as risk factors of Leptospira transmission is favoured by various factors such as change in climatic conditions, urbanization, encroachment of wildlife inhabitation, import/export of animals, increase in adventure travel, and water related recreational activities.","['Pratt N', 'Rajeev S']",2018,182,,Acta Trop,Pratt N and Rajeev S.

29457991,Protection of sheep by vaccination against experimental challenge with Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo and L. interrogans serovar Pomona.,"AIMS: To evaluate a multivalent leptospiral and clostridial vaccine for prevention of renal colonisation and urinary shedding in sheep, following experimental challenge with New Zealand strains of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo type Hardjobovis and L. interrogans serovar Pomona.
METHODS: Two separate but similarly designed studies were conducted. In both studies, Romney-cross lambs, aged 9-11 weeks, were randomly allocated to a vaccinated group and a control group. Vaccinated lambs each received two 1.5-mL S/C doses of a multivalent leptospiral and clostridial vaccine, 4 weeks apart, and animals in the control groups received the same dose of saline. Groups of 12 vaccinated and 12 control lambs were randomly selected in each study for challenge with serovars Hardjo or Pomona. Challenge was initiated 16 weeks following the second vaccination with three daily doses of live leptospires by intranasal and conjunctival routes. Following challenge, urine samples were collected weekly for 6 weeks, for dark field microscopy and leptospiral culture; 6 weeks after challenge the lambs were slaughtered and kidneys collected for leptospiral culture.
RESULTS: In lambs challenged with serovar Hardjo, 8/12 unvaccinated lambs had ≥1 urine or kidney sample that was positive for leptospires following culture, compared with 0/12 lambs in the vaccinated group (p=0.001). In lambs challenged with serovar Pomona, 9/12 unvaccinated lambs had ≥1 urine or kidney sample that was positive following culture, compared with 0/12 lambs in the vaccinated group (p<0.001). Prevention of renal colonisation and urinary shedding, expressed as the prevented fraction, was 100 (95% CI=61.7-100)% and 100 (95% CI=68.3-100)% against challenge with serovars Hardjo and Pomona, respectively, at 4 months after vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Use of a multivalent leptospiral and clostridial vaccine demonstrated protection against challenge from New Zealand strains of serovars of Hardjo and Pomona 4 months after vaccination in lambs first vaccinated at 9-11 weeks of age. Further studies are required to assess the duration of immunity against challenge in sheep.","['Clough WJ', 'Little PR', 'Hodge A', 'Chapman VC', 'Holz DK']",2018,66,3,N Z Vet J,"Clough WJ, et al.

29437551,"Parallel Survey of Two Widespread Renal Syndrome-Causing Zoonoses: Leptospira spp. and Hantavirus in Urban Environment, Hungary.","Rodents are important reservoir hosts for several zoonotic pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Among others, leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases worldwide and has the similar clinical manifestation with hantavirus infection in humans. Despite the fact that both pathogens have great epidemiological significance in Europe, no epizootiological data exist for urbanized areas so far. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the occurrence and prevalence of Leptospira spp. and hantaviruses in small wild rodents living in close proximity to humans. Altogether, 338 small rodents representing five different species (Apodemus agrarius, A. flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus) were captured in the city of Pécs (Hungary) and screened for pathogens by different types of PCR methods (TaqMan-based real-time PCR/PCR, RT-PCR/PCR). A total of 18.3% of the rodents were positive for Leptospira kirschneri, L. interrogans, and L. borgpetersenii. Nucleic acid of Tula hantavirus and human pathogen Dobrava-Belgrade orthohantavirus were detected in 8% of tested specimens. Furthermore, dual infections with both Leptospira spp. and hantaviruses were shown in 2.6% of animals, suggesting that the same rodent host can be infected with several pathogens at the same time, therefore, representing a serious threat to public health. Overall, this study provides important surveillance data on the prevalence of Leptospira spp. and hantaviruses from rodents in urbanized environment for the first time in Hungary and emphasizes the importance of further ecoepidemiological investigations.","['Kurucz K', 'Madai M', 'Bali D', 'Hederics D', 'Horváth G', 'Kemenesi G', 'Jakab F']",2018,18,4,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Kurucz K, et al.

Although there is a large diversity of clinical signs and symptoms, a severe inflammatory response is common to all leptospirosis patients. The mechanism of IL-1β secretion during Leptospira infection has been previously studied in mouse macrophages. However, the outcome of Leptospira infection is very different in human and murine macrophages, and the mechanisms responsible for IL-1β secretion in human macrophages had not been investigated. This study therefore examines the effects of Leptospira interrogans infection on inflammasome activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression in human macrophages. Increased mRNA and protein expression of NLRP3 was observed by real time RT-PCR and flow cytometry at 1 h after co-cultivation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) determination showed that IL-1β and IL-18 are released in the culture supernatants at 1 h after cultivation.

Rodents were captured in places with natural grassland, implanted forest, with and without raising cattle and in sites prone and not prone to flooding. The DNA was amplified from cultured isolates by PCR and Leptospira spp. strains were genotyped using Multiple - Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA). We isolated Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni from Oligoryzomys nigripes, Leptospira borgpetersenii from Scapteromys aquaticus and Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae from Akodon azarae. The zoonotic Leptospira isolated and genotyped from O. nigripes and S. aquaticus are the first reports from these species. The geographic range of these rodent species include, in addition to Argentina, the countries of Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil, suggesting that these rodents might be involved in the transmission of spirochetes in other regions. Human and animal health care professionals should be alert to the potential occurrence of leptospirosis in areas where these rodent species are present.","['Colombo VC', 'Gamietea I', 'Loffler SG', 'Brihuega BF', 'Beldomenico PM']",2018,215,,Vet Microbiol,"Colombo VC, et al.

The disease appears as a seasonal infection mostly affecting people in rural areas involved in farming. We investigated the prevalence of this infection among suspected patients in Gilan Province by an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA), and two PCR protocols, a nested-PCR and a real-time PCR (qPCR), targeting rrs and lipL32 genes, respectively. We also identified the common Leptospira species by sequencing a partial sequence of rrs gene. Out of the 128 sera examined by IFA, 25.78% were positive with the antibody titers ≥1/80. The antibody titer in 39.06% of sera ranged from 1/10 to 1/140, and 35. 16% showed no antibodies, all considered negative. Nested PCR and qPCR detected Leptospira DNA in 20.31% and 18.75% of the sera, respectively. The two PCR assays had 98.43% agreement (K = 0.93) and showed an inverse correlation with the IFA titers. Also, three pathogenic Leptospira species, L. kirschneri (n = 10), L. introgans (n = 8), and L. borgpetersenii (n = 2) were identified from the clinical specimens in the study area.

A cross survey study was conducted to estimate seroprevalence of human leptospirosis in climatically distinct regions of Pakistan and to identify the risk factors associated with the disease. Blood samples from 360 humans were collected through convenient sampling, 120 from each of three study areas. Serological testing was performed using ELISA kit as per manufacturer's recommendations. The results showed an overall prevalence of 40.83% (95% CI; 35.71-46.11). Statistical analysis showed significant (P < .05) differences in leptospiral seroprevalence in three different geographic locations, with highest in humid sub-tropical climatic region (50.83%; 95% CI; 41.55-60.07), followed by semi-arid region (44.16%; 95% CI; 35.11-53.52) and lowest in hot and dry region (27.50%; 95% CI; 19.75-36.40). After multivariate analysis age, gender, exposure to flooding water, source of water usage, disinfection schedule of surroundings and history of cut and wound were found significantly associated with the seropositivity of Leptospira.

This may lead to increase in morbidity or even mortality in undiagnosed/untreated cases. There are many aetiological agents which lead to acute febrile illness. Among these aetiological agents, important is bacterial or viral aetiology.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is: (i) To know the aetiological agents responsible for acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) by serological test or by bacterial culture and (ii) To know the clinical profile of AUFI.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 270 patients were enroled in the study with a history of AUFI admitted in medicine and paediatric department from January 2015 to November 2016 of tertiary care hospital of central India. Blood sample was collected for blood culture, clot culture and serological tests for immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) and ICT-positive results were confirmed by respective enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All negative serum samples by immunochromatography were retested for disease-specific ELISA as scrub typhus, dengue and leptospirosis.

29388363,Zoonotic pathogens from feral swine that pose a significant threat to public health.,"The natural fecundity of suids, great ability to adapt to new habitats and desire for local hunting opportunities leading to translocation of feral pigs to regions where they are not yet established have all been instrumental in the home range expansion of feral swine. Feral swine populations in the United States continue to expand, wreaking havoc on agricultural lands, further compromising threatened and endangered species, and posing a microbiological threat to humans, domestic livestock and companion animals. This manuscript thoroughly reviews zoonotic diseases of concern including brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, leptospirosis, enteric pathogens, both Salmonella spp. and shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and hepatitis E. These pathogens are not a comprehensive list of microbes that are capable of infecting both humans and feral swine, but rather have been selected as they are known to infect US feral swine, direct transmission between wild suids and humans has previously been documented, or they have been shown to be readily transmitted during processing or consumption of feral swine pork. Humans that interact directly or indirectly with feral swine are at much higher risk for the development of a number of zoonotic pathogens. Numerous case reports document transmission events from feral swine and wild boar to humans, and the resulting diseases may be mild and self-limiting, chronic or fatal. Individuals that interact with feral swine should take preventative measures to minimize the risk of disease transmission and all meat should be thoroughly cooked. Additionally, public health campaigns to increase knowledge of the risks associated with feral swine are imperative.","['Brown VR', 'Bowen RA', 'Bosco-Lauth AM']",2018,65,3,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Brown VR, et al.

31628830,Protective immunity of recombinant LipL21 and I-LipL21 against Leptospira interrogans serovar Autumnalis N2 infection.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete of genus Leptospira with widespread distribution in tropical, subtropical and temperate zones. Leptospirosis is often confused with other febrile illnesses including jaundice, dengue, and malaria. Generally, the disease is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Though leptospirosis is curable with antibiotic treatment, the laboratory diagnosis of the disease is specialized and open to interpretation with multiple kits available to detect the different serological markers of Leptospira. Moreover, when leptospirosis is misdiagnosed, the disease can lead to multi-organ failure and may have fatal effects. There is a need for strategies to develop vaccines and prevent leptospirosis. In the present study, the immunogenic potential of leptospiral recombinant protein LipL21 (rLipL21) and its truncated form I-LipL21 (rI-LipL21) was evaluated.
METHODOLOGY: The recombinant proteins were established in cyclophosphamide treated BALB/c mice model infected with L. interrogans serovar Autumnalis strain N2.
RESULTS: The vaccination study showed 66% and 83% survivability among mice immunized with rLipL21 and rI-LipL21 respectively and post-challenge with leptospiral strain N2 compared to control groups that showed 100% lethality. Additionally, a significant increase in antibody levels and cytokine levels (TNF-a, IFN-γ and IL-10) was observed evidencing a marked stimulation of both humoral and cell-mediated immune response in mice immunized with rLipL21/rI-LipL21 compared to whole cell leptospiral lysate (WCL).
CONCLUSIONS: This study evidenced protective immunization against leptospirosis with rLipL21 and rI-LipL21 recombinant proteins and are potential candidates for the development of leptospiral vaccine.","['Kumari A', 'Premlatha MM', 'Raja V', 'Akino Mercy CS', 'Sumathi K', 'Shariff M', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2018,12,1,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Kumari A, et al.

29377078,Impact of climate change on dermatological conditions related to flooding: update from the International Society of Dermatology Climate Change Committee.,"Climate change contributes to the increase in severity and frequency of flooding, which is the most frequent and deadly disaster worldwide. Flood-related damage can be very severe and include health effects. Among those health impacts, dermatological diseases are one of the most frequently encountered. Both infectious and noninfectious dermatological conditions are increasing after flooding. We searched PubMed using the search term climate change OR global warming OR rainfall OR flooding OR skin. Articles published in the English-language literature were included. We also searched the International Society of Dermatology website library on climate change for additional articles. There is an increased risk of trauma during the course of a natural disaster. The majority of post-tsunami wound infections were polymicrobial, but gram-negative bacteria were the leading causes. Infectious diseases with dermatological manifestations, such as impetigo, leptospirosis, measles, dengue fever, tinea corporis, malaria, and leishmaniasis, are important causes of morbidity among flood-afflicted individuals. Insect bites and stings, and parasite infestations such as scabies and cutaneous larva migrans are also frequently observed. Inflammatory conditions including irritant contact dermatitis are among the leading dermatological conditions. Dermatological conditions such as alopecia areata, vitiligo, psoriasis, and urticaria can be induced or exacerbated by psychological conditions post disaster. Prevention is essential in the management of skin diseases because of flooding. Avoiding exposure to contaminated environments, wearing protective devices, rapid provision of clean water and sanitation facilities, prompt vector controls, and education about disease risk and prevention are important.","['Dayrit JF', 'Bintanjoyo L', 'Andersen LK', 'Davis MDP']",2018,57,8,Int J Dermatol,"Dayrit JF, et al.

29340460,First serologic evidence of human hantavirus infection in Alagoas State in Northeastern Brazil.,"INTRODUCTION: Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is rare in Northeastern Brazil.
METHODS: Prospective surveillance was conducted over a two-year period in Alagoas State, Northeastern Brazil. The prevalence of anti-hantavirus N-antigen IgM and IgG in human serum samples was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing.
RESULTS: High avidity IgG was found in nine of 476 serum samples tested (from 102 patients with clinical manifestations compatible with HCPS, 124 patients with leptospirosis, and 250 healthy rural workers).
CONCLUSIONS: Serologic evidence of past hantavirus infection in residents of Alagoas State indicates that hantaviruses are present in northeastern Brazil, even in areas silent for HCPS.","['Santos-Júnior JAD', 'Santos FMD', 'Barros PA', 'Medeiros NPT', 'Sabino-Santos Júnior G', 'Lima MC', 'Figueiredo LTM', 'Borges AA']",2017,50,6,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,"Santos-Júnior JAD, et al.

29340454,"Human leptospirosis in the Federal District, Brazil, 2011-2015: eco-epidemiological characterization.","INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that affects more than 5,000 people per year in Brazil. The Federal District (FD) lacks epidemiological studies of human leptospirosis and presents concerning rates of this disease, especially considering its lethality.
METHODS: Seventy-nine autochthonous human cases of leptospirosis between 2011 and 2015 were analyzed, with the probable infection location serving as a basis for the collection and analysis of the environmental and epidemiological variables.
RESULTS: The incidence of the disease ranged from 0.68-13.39 per 100,000 inhabitants in 21 of the 31 administrative regions that compose the FD. The local profile of human leptospirosis was predominantly associated with urban areas during the rainy season, population access to the sewage network, the treated water network, and the public garbage collection service. The vast majority of cases had a strong association with synanthropic rodents at the infection sites.
CONCLUSIONS: In order to prevent and control potentially lethal human leptospirosis infection, the eco-epidemiological characterization of this disease is a valuable tool for public policies of prevention, control, and surveillance. In addition to population awareness, the systematized control of synanthropic rodents could be the main health action to reduce the incidence of this disease in the FD.","['Santos IOC', 'Landi MFA', 'Cruz LM', 'Bofill MIR', 'Santos DED', 'Lima EMM', 'Castro MB']",2017,50,6,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,"Santos IOC, et al.

29332210,Pathogen-specific leptospiral proteins in urine of patients with febrile illness aids in differential diagnosis of leptospirosis from dengue.,"Leptospirosis and dengue are two commonly seen infectious diseases of the tropics. Differential diagnosis of leptospirosis from dengue fever is often difficult due to overlapping clinical symptoms and lack of economically viable and easy-to-perform laboratory tests. The gold standard for diagnosis is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). In this study, the diagnostic potential of screening for pathogen-specific leptospiral antigens in urine samples is presented as a non-invasive method of disease diagnosis. In a study group of 40 patients, the serum was tested for anti-leptospiral antibodies by MAT and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Urine of these patients was screened for leptospiral antigens by ELISA using specific antibodies against LipL32, LipL41, Fla1, HbpA and sphingomyelinase. Group I patients (n = 23) were classified as leptospirosis-positive based on MAT and high titres of circulating IgM-specific anti-leptospiral antibodies. All of these patients excreted all five leptospiral antigens in the urine. The 17 MAT-negative cases included six patients with pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO; Group II) and 11 confirmed dengue patients (Group III). The latter tested negative for both serum anti-leptospiral antibodies and urinary leptospiral antigens. A salient outcome of this study was highlighting the usefulness of screening for urinary leptospiral antigens in disease diagnosis, as their presence confirmed leptospiral aetiology in two PUO patients. Immunoblots of urinary antigens identified well-defined bands corresponding to LipL32, HbpA and sphingomyelinase; the significance of the 42- and 58-kDa sphingomyelinase bands is discussed.","['Chaurasia R', 'Thresiamma KC', 'Eapen CK', 'Zachariah BJ', 'Paul R', 'Sritharan M']",2018,37,3,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Chaurasia R, et al.

29322764,Rapid Veterinary Diagnosis of Bovine Reproductive Infectious Diseases from Semen Using Paper-Origami DNA Microfluidics.,"The health and well-being of cattle is an important issue in maintaining and increasing global agricultural output. In dairy production within low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a significant biosensing challenge in detecting sexually transmitted infection (STI) pathogens during animal husbandry, due in part to difficulties associated with the limited infrastructure for veterinary medicine. Here we demonstrate low-cost, multiplexed, and sample-to-answer paper-origami tests for the detection of three bovine infectious reproductive diseases in semen samples, collected at a test site in rural India. Pathogen DNA from one viral pathogen, bovine herpes virus-1 (BoHV-1), and two bacteria (Brucella and Leptospira) was extracted, amplified (using loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP), and detected fluorescently, enabling <1 pg (∼ from 115 to 274 copies per reaction) of target genomic DNA to be measured. Data was collected as a fluorescence signal either visually, using a low-cost hand-held torch, or digitally with a mobile-phone camera. Limits of detection and sensitivities of the paper-origami device for the three pathogens were also evaluated using pathogen-inoculated semen samples and were as few as 50 Leptospira organisms, 50 CFU Brucella, and 1 TCID","['Yang Z', 'Xu G', 'Reboud J', 'Ali SA', 'Kaur G', 'McGiven J', 'Boby N', 'Gupta PK', 'Chaudhuri P', 'Cooper JM']",2018,3,2,ACS Sens,"Yang Z, et al.

29318786,"Detection of pathogenic Leptospira species associated with phyllostomid bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) from Veracruz, Mexico.","The genus Leptospira encompass 22 species of spirochaetes, with ten pathogenic species that have been recorded in more than 160 mammals worldwide. In the last two decades, the numbers of records of these agents associated with bats have increased exponentially, particularly in America. Although order Chiroptera represents the second most diverse order of mammals in Mexico, and leptospirosis represents a human and veterinary problem in the country, few studies have been conducted to identify potential wildlife reservoirs. The aim of this study was to detect the presence and diversity of Leptospira sp. in communities of bats in an endemic state of leptospirosis in Mexico. During January to September 2016, 81 bats of ten species from three localities of Veracruz, Mexico, were collected with mist nets. Kidney samples were obtained from all specimens. For the detection of Leptospira sp., we amplified several genes using specific primers. Amplicons of the expected size were submitted to sequencing, and sequences recovered were compared with those of reference deposited in GenBank using the BLAST tool. To identify their phylogenetic position, we realized a reconstruction using maximum-likelihood (ML) method. Twenty-five samples from three bat species (Artibeus lituratus, Choeroniscus godmani and Desmodus rotundus) showed the presence of Leptospira DNA. Sequences recovered were close to Leptospira noguchii, Leptospira weilii and Leptospira interrogans. Our results include the first record of Leptospira in bats from Mexico and exhibit a high diversity of these pathogens circulating in the state. Due to the finding of a large number of positive wild animals, it is necessary to implement a surveillance system in populations of the positive bats as well as in related species, in order to understand their role as carriers of this bacterial genus.","['Ballados-González GG', 'Sánchez-Montes S', 'Romero-Salas D', 'Colunga Salas P', 'Gutiérrez-Molina R', 'León-Paniagua L', 'Becker I', 'Méndez-Ojeda ML', 'Barrientos-Salcedo C', 'Serna-Lagunes R', 'Cruz-Romero A']",2018,65,3,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Ballados-González GG, et al.

CASE: A 50-year-old male sushi chef who had never traveled outside Japan presented with a 2-day history of fever and muscle pain. On admission, the patient had thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, and jaundice. His condition continued to deteriorate, with decreasing platelet count, worsening renal function, hyperbilirubinemia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. On day 5 after onset of symptoms, he required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopy showed diffuse endobronchial bleeding. His respiratory status worsened rapidly with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 70, necessitating venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) and treatment with an inotrope, renal replacement therapy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics including benzylpenicillin. Anticoagulation was maintained at the minimum level. His condition improved, and he was weaned off ECMO on day 15 and discharged on day 19 after onset of symptoms. The leptospirosis diagnosis was confirmed by leptospiral DNA detection in urine samples by polymerase chain reaction and the results of paired serum antibody titer testing.
CONCLUSIONS: V-V ECMO may prevent mortality in patients with leptospirosis-induced SPHS that does not respond to conventional therapy.","['Umei N', 'Ichiba S']",2017,2017,,Case Rep Crit Care,Umei N and Ichiba S.

Here, we isolated 12 novel species of the genus Leptospira from tropical soils, significantly increasing the number of known species to 35 and finding evidence of highly unexplored biodiversity in the genus. Extended comparative phylogenomics and pan-genome analyses at the genus level by incorporating 26 novel genomes, revealed that, the traditional leptospiral 'pathogens' cluster, as defined by their phylogenetic position, can be split in two groups with distinct virulence potential and accessory gene patterns. These genomic distinctions are strongly linked to the ability to cause or not severe infections in animal models and humans. Our results not only provide new insights into virulence evolution in the members of the genus Leptospira, but also lay the foundations for refining the classification of the pathogenic species.","['Thibeaux R', 'Iraola G', 'Ferrés I', 'Bierque E', 'Girault D', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Picardeau M', 'Goarant C']",2018,4,1,Microb Genom,"Thibeaux R, et al.

The objectives of this study were to determine the herd and within herd prevalence of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV), Bovine Herpes Virus 1 (BHV-1), Leptospirosis and Neosporosis in a large scale study of commercial beef herds on the island of Ireland, and to examine herd level factors associated with exposure to these pathogens in these herds.
RESULTS: The average number of cows tested per herd was 35.5 (median 30). Herd level seroprevalence to Bovine Herpesvirus-1(BHV-1), Bovine Viral-Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV), Leptospirosis and Neosporosis was 90%, 100%, 91% and 67%, respectively, while the mean within herd prevalence for the these pathogens was 40%, 77.7%, 65.7% and 5.7%, respectively. The study confirms that the level of seroconversion for the four pathogens of interest increases with herd size. There was also evidence that exposure to one pathogen may increase the risk of exposure to another pathogen.
CONCLUSIONS: Herd level seroprevalences were in excess of 90% for BVDV, BHV-1 and Leptosporosis. Larger herds were subject to increased exposure to disease pathogens. This study suggests that exposure to several pathogens may be associated with the further exposure to other pathogens.","['Barrett D', 'Parr M', 'Fagan J', 'Johnson A', 'Tratalos J', 'Lively F', 'Diskin M', 'Kenny D']",2018,14,1,BMC Vet Res,"Barrett D, et al.

Treatment of severe leptospirosis with therapeutic plasma exchange in a pediatric patient. Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 566-570. Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Although it is mostly a tropical disease, some case reports have been published from temperate regions of the world. The disease presents with a wide spectrum; from asymptomatic self limited disease to a fatal illness characterized by multi-organ involvement. An 8-year-old girl presented with a 5-day history of fever, myalgia, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea. She developed anuria, hypotension and became unconscious one day after admission and was referred to our pediatric intensive care unit for further evaluation and treatment. Initial physical examination revealed fever, jaundice, diffuse petecchiae on whole body, hepatomegaly and severe hypotension. Laboratory investigations showed elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, elevated creatinine and creatine kinase levels and trombocytopenia. The diagnosis of Leptospirosis was detected by rapid IgM test and confirmed by microscopic agglutination test later. She was treated with mechanical ventilation, wide spectrum antibiotics, positive inotropic agents and penicillin G plus two days of continuous renal replacement therapy and five sessions of therapeutic plasma exchange performed daily. She recovered completely and was transferred to the pediatric ward on the 14th day of hospitalization.

Tn-Seq combines random transposon mutagenesis with the power of high-throughput sequencing technology. Animals are challenged with a pool of transposon mutants (input pool), followed by harvesting of blood and tissues a few days later to identify and quantify the number of mutants in each organ (output pools). The output pools are compared to the input pool to evaluate the in vivo fitness of each mutant. This approach enables screening of a large pool of mutants in a limited number of animals. With minor modifications, this protocol can be performed with any animal model of leptospirosis, reservoir host models such as rats and acute infection models such as hamsters, as well as in vitro studies.

29284246,Changes in leptospirosis etiology in animals and humans.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is endemic in Ternopil region. In Ukraine, the disease is registered in almost all regions, including the Ternopil region. The aim of the research is to study the regularities of epidemic and epizootic processes of leptospirosis, and the circulation of its pathogens among different sources (small mammals, animals) and humans.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Etiologic spectrum of leptospirosis registered in Ternopil region in 1972-2016 among small mammals, farm animals and sick people was studied.
RESULTS: Due to the analysis of pathogens circulation among different sources (small mammals, animals), as well as the annual morbidity in humans, it was proved that new leptospira serovars are endemic and brought into the regions mostly by farm animals. Farm animals introduce the infection to humans through the environment, sometimes within 3-5-years. The spread was observed of pathogen serovars, which are new in certain areas, among all types of mouse-like small mammals and rats. It was established that livestock and small mammals are parallel reservoirs.
CONCLUSIONS: In the regions with endemic species, the structural modification in the etiology of leptospirosis in humans is caused by additional reservoirs among animals, as well as the circulation of other pathogen serovars that were absent in the main natural reservoir, i.e. mouse-like small mammals and rats. The constant monitoring of the population, contamination and carrier state of mouse-like small mammals, rats and farm animals, is required In order to predict the future epidemiological situation on leptospirosis among the population and to improve leptospirosis diagnosis.","['Vasylieva N', 'Andreychyn M', 'Kravchuk Y', 'Chervinska О', 'Iosyk I']",2017,24,4,Ann Agric Environ Med,"Vasylieva N, et al.

29267587,Characterization of Leptospira isolates from humans and the environment in Uruguay.,"Laboratory diagnosis of human leptospirosis usually relies on indirect methods exploring specific immune response. Isolation and identification of the involved strains are cumbersome, but can provide biological resources for pathogenic studies and relevant information for guiding prevention and control measures. The aim of the research we are hereby reporting was the characterization of Leptospira isolates obtained from humans and the environment in Uruguay. Blood cultures were performed from early samples of 302 Uruguayan patients, mainly rural workers, and from 36 water samples taken from their living or working environments. Eight human isolates and seven environmental isolates were obtained and analyzed by end point Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Multilocus Variable Number of Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) and other molecular methods. Human isolates corresponded to several serogroups and serovars of Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira kirschneri species, probably reflecting the infection with similar involved Leptospira species and serovars of an extended animal reservoir in rural settings of the country, mostly dedicated to meat and dairy production. Culture-positive patients were older than usually affected workers, and presented signs and symptoms of severe illness. A high organic and circulating bacterial burden may explain an easier positive result from these workers' samples. Environmental isolates were mainly identified as Leptospira biflexa strains, with a single L. meyeri isolate of uncertain significance.","['Meny P', 'Menéndez C', 'Quintero J', 'Hernández E', 'Ríos C', 'Balassiano IT', 'Trindade CNDR', 'Vital-Brazil JM', 'Ramos TMV', 'Ashfield N', 'Feble C', 'Avila E', 'Schelotto F', 'Varela G']",2017,59,,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"Meny P, et al.

Infectious diseases were the primary cause of death (56%) for otters we examined. Sarcocystosis was the leading infectious cause of death (54%) and was observed throughout the study period. Some infectious diseases, such as morbilliviral encephalitis and leptospirosis, were documented for a limited number of years and then not detected again despite continued testing for these pathogens in necropsied animals. Trauma was the second most common cause of death (14%) during the study period.

This article summarizes the most important findings with special attention to Brazil and diseases of present public health importance in the country such as Chikungunya, dengue fever, yellow fever, Zika, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, leptospirosis, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. An extensive literature review revealed a relationship between infectious diseases outbreaks and climate change events (El Niño, La Niña, heatwaves, droughts, floods, increased temperature, higher rainfall, and others) or environmental changes (habitat fragmentation, deforestation, urbanization, bushmeat consumption, and others). To avoid or control outbreaks, integrated surveillance systems and effective outreach programs are essential. Due to strong global and local influence on emergence of infectious diseases, a more holistic approach is necessary to mitigate or control them in low-income nations.","['Nava A', 'Shimabukuro JS', 'Chmura AA', 'Luz SLB']",2017,58,3,ILAR J,"Nava A, et al.

Of the 890 cases reported to the Disease Notification Information System (SINAN), 11.7% were confirmed as SF, 2.9% as dengue, 1.6% as leptospirosis, and 0.7% as tick bite allergy, with the remainder being diagnosed as other categories (10.5%) or unspecified (72.7%). This study confirms the existence of obstacles in the diagnostic classification of suspected cases of SF by clinical signs and symptoms. Unlike man-capybara contact (1.7% of cases), man-tick contact (71.2%) represents an important risk indicator for SF. The analysis of decision trees highlights some clinical symptoms related to SF patient death or cure, such as: respiratory distress, convulsion, shock, petechiae, coma, icterus, and diarrhea. Moreover, cartographic techniques document patient transit between RJ and bordering states and within RJ itself. This work recommends some changes to SINAN that would provide a greater understanding of the dynamics of SF and serve as a model for other endemic areas in Brazil.","['Lopez DM', 'de Mello FL', 'Giordano Dias CM', 'Almeida P', 'Araújo M', 'Magalhães MA', 'Gazeta GS', 'Brasil RP']",2017,5,,Front Public Health,"Lopez DM, et al.

29236931,Comparative genomics of pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovar Canicola isolated from swine and human in Brazil.,"Leptospira interrogans serovar Canicola is one of the most important pathogenic serovars for the maintenance of urban leptospirosis. Even though it is considered highly adapted to dogs, serovar Canicola infection has already been described in other animals and even a few human cases. Here, we present the genomic characterisation of two Brazilian L. interrogans serovar Canicola strains isolated from slaughtered sows (L0-3 and L0-4) and their comparison with human strain Fiocruz LV133. It was observed that the porcine serovar Canicola strains present the genetic machinery to cause human infection and, therefore, represent a higher risk to public health. Both human and porcine serovar Canicola isolates also presented sequences with high identity to the Chinese serovar Canicola published plasmids pGui1 and pGui2. The plasmids identification in the Brazilian and Chinese serovar Canicola strains suggest that extra-chromosomal elements are one more feature of this serovar that was previously unnoticed.","['Moreno LZ', 'Miraglia F', 'Kremer FS', 'Eslabao MR', 'Dellagostin OA', 'Lilenbaum W', 'Freitas JC', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Heinemann MB', 'Moreno AM']",2018,113,2,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,"Moreno LZ, et al.

29236923,Whole-genome sequencing of Leptospira interrogans from southern Brazil: genetic features of a highly virulent strain.,"BACKGROUND Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonotic disease. It is caused by infection with pathogenic Leptospira species, of which over 300 serovars have been described. The accurate identification of the causative Leptospira spp. is required to ascertain the pathogenic status of the local isolates. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to obtain the complete genome sequence of a virulent Leptospira interrogans strain isolated from southern Brazil and to describe its genetic features. METHODS The whole genome was sequenced by next-generation sequencing (Ion Torrent). The genome was assembled, scaffolded, annotated, and manually reviewed. Mutations were identified based on a variant calling analysis using the genome of L. interrogans strain Fiocruz L1-130 as a reference. FINDINGS The entire genome had an average GC content of 35%. The variant calling analysis identified 119 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from which 30 led to a missense mutation. The structural analyses identified potential evidence of genomic inversions, translocations, and deletions in both the chromosomes. MAIN CONCLUSIONS The genome properties provide comprehensive information about the local isolates of Leptospira spp., and thereby, could facilitate the identification of new targets for the development of diagnostic kits and vaccines.","['Jorge S', 'Kremer FS', 'Oliveira NR', 'Navarro GOSV', 'Guimarães AM', 'Sanchez CD', 'Woloski RDDS', 'Ridieri KF', 'Campos VF', 'Pinto LDS', 'Dellagostin OA']",2018,113,2,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,"Jorge S, et al.

Thirty-five samples from dogs with suspected clinical leptospirosis and 116 samples from apparently healthy dogs were tested for presence of leptospiral DNA using the TaqMan-based assay. The results were compared with those from a well-established conventional PCR targeting the 16S RNA encoding gene associated with nucleotide sequencing analysis. The overall agreement between the assays was 94.8% (confidence interval [CI] 95% 88-100%). The newly developed assay presented 91.6% (CI 95% 71.5-98.5%) relative sensitivity (22[+] lipl32 PCR/24[+] 16S RNA and sequencing), 100% (CI 95% 96.3-100%) relative specificity and 98.7% accuracy (CI 95% 94.8-100%). The lipl32 assay was able to detect and quantify at least 10 genome equivalents/reaction. DNA extracted from 17 pathogenic Leptospira spp., 8 intermediate/saprophytic strains and 21 different pathogenic microorganisms were also tested using the lipl32 assay, resulting in amplification exclusively for pathogenic leptospiral strains. The results also demonstrated high intra and inter-assay reproducibility (coefficient of variation 1.50 and 1.12, respectively), thereby qualifying the newly developed assay as a highly sensitive, specific and reliable diagnostic tool for leptospiral infection in dogs using urine specimens.","['Miotto BA', 'da Hora AS', 'Taniwaki SA', 'Brandão PE', 'Heinemann MB', 'Hagiwara MK']",2018,49,3,Braz J Microbiol,"Miotto BA, et al.

29229654,Protocol for developing a Database of Zoonotic disease Research in India (DoZooRI).,"INTRODUCTION: Zoonotic and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) represent a public health threat that has been acknowledged only recently although they have been on the rise for the past several decades. On an average, every year since the Second World War, one pathogen has emerged or re-emerged on a global scale. Low/middle-income countries such as India bear a significant burden of zoonotic and EIDs. We propose that the creation of a database of published, peer-reviewed research will open up avenues for evidence-based policymaking for targeted prevention and control of zoonoses.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A large-scale systematic mapping of the published peer-reviewed research conducted in India will be undertaken. All published research will be included in the database, without any prejudice for quality screening, to broaden the scope of included studies. Structured search strategies will be developed for priority zoonotic diseases (leptospirosis, rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, cysticercosis, salmonellosis, bovine tuberculosis, Japanese encephalitis and rickettsial infections), and multiple databases will be searched for studies conducted in India. The database will be managed and hosted on a cloud-based platform called Rayyan. Individual studies will be tagged based on key preidentified parameters (disease, study design, study type, location, randomisation status and interventions, host involvement and others, as applicable).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The database will incorporate already published studies, obviating the need for additional ethical clearances. The database will be made available online, and in collaboration with multisectoral teams, domains of enquiries will be identified and subsequent research questions will be raised. The database will be queried for these and resulting evidence will be analysed and published in peer-reviewed journals.","['Chatterjee P', 'Bhaumik S', 'Chauhan AS', 'Kakkar M']",2017,7,12,BMJ Open,"Chatterjee P, et al.

29220718,Spatial and temporal dynamics of pathogenic Leptospira in surface waters from the urban slum environment.,"Leptospirosis has emerged as an important urban health problem as slum settlements have expanded worldwide. Yet the dynamics of the environmentally transmitted Leptospira pathogen has not been well characterized in these settings. We used a stratified dense sampling scheme to study the dynamics of Leptospira abundance in surface waters from a Brazilian urban slum community. We collected surface water samples during the dry, intermediate and rainy seasons within a seven-month period and quantified pathogenic Leptospira by quantitative PCR (qPCR). We used logistic and linear mixed models to identify factors that explained variation for the presence and concentration of Leptospira DNA. Among 335 sewage and 250 standing water samples, Leptospira DNA were detected in 36% and 34%, respectively. Among the 236 samples with positive results geometric mean Leptospira concentrations were 152 GEq/mL. The probability of finding Leptospira DNA was higher in sewage samples collected during the rainy season when increased leptospirosis incidence occurred, than during the dry season (47.2% vs 12.5%, respectively, p = 0.0002). There was a marked spatial and temporal heterogeneity in Leptospira DNA distribution, for which type of water, elevation, and time of day that samples were collected, in addition to season, were significant predictors. Together, these findings indicate that Leptospira are ubiquitous in the slum environment and that the water-related risk to which inhabitants are exposed is low. Seasonal increases in Leptospira presence may explain the timing of leptospirosis outbreaks. Effective prevention will need to consider the spatial and temporal dynamics of pathogenic Leptospira in surface waters to reduce the burden of the disease.","['Casanovas-Massana A', 'Costa F', 'Riediger IN', 'Cunha M', 'de Oliveira D', 'Mota DC', 'Sousa E', 'Querino VA', 'Nery N', 'Reis MG', 'Wunder EA', 'Diggle PJ', 'Ko AI']",2018,130,,Water Res,"Casanovas-Massana A, et al.

29217379,Major epidemiological factors associated with leptospirosis in Malaysia.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by a diverse pathogenic leptospira species and serovars. The disease is transmitted directly following contact with infected urine and other body fluids or indirectly after contact with water or soil contaminated with infected urine.
OBJECTIVES: While a wide range of domestic and wild animals are known to be reservoirs of the disease, occupation, international travel and recreation are beginning to assume a center stage in the transmission of the disease. The objective of this study is to review available literatures to determine the extent to which these aforementioned risk factors aid the transmission, increase incidence and outbreak of leptospirosis in Malaysia.
STUDY DESIGN: The review was conducted based on prevalence, incidence, and outbreak cases of leptospirosis among human and susceptible animals predisposed to several of the risk factors identified in Malaysia.
METHODS: Literature searchers and reviews were conducted based on articles published in citation index journals, Malaysian ministry of health reports, periodicals as well as reliable newspapers articles and online media platforms. In each case, the newspapers and online media reports were supported by press briefings by officials of the ministry of health and other agencies responsible.
RESULTS: The disease is endemic in Malaysia, and this was attributed to the large number of reservoir animals, suitable humid and moist environment for proliferation as well as abundant forest resources. Over 30 different serovars have been detected in Malaysia in different domestic and wild animal species. This, in addition to the frequency of flooding which has increased in recent years, and has helped increase the risk of human exposure. Occupation, recreation, flooding and rodent population were all identified as an important source and cause of the disease within the study population.
CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for the government and other stakeholders to intensify efforts to control the spread of the disease, especially as it greatly affect human health and the tourism industry which is an important component of the Malaysian economy. The risk of infection can be minimized by creating awareness on the source and mode of transmission of the disease, including the use of protective clothing and avoiding swimming in contaminated waters. Moreover, improved diagnostics can also help reduce the suffering and mortalities that follow infection after exposure to infection source.","['Garba B', 'Bahaman AR', 'Bejo SK', 'Zakaria Z', 'Mutalib AR', 'Bande F']",2018,178,,Acta Trop,"Garba B, et al.

Since serology techniques cannot detect chronic carriers, the molecular analysis of clinical samples is an alternative to detect these animals on livestock. The aim of the present study was to perform a retrospective study in order to detect leptospiral uterine carriers in slaughtered cows. Tissue samples were collected from 50 post-pubertal, nonpregnant cows. These samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin-embedded and stored. PCR targeting lipL32 gene and molecular characterization by secY sequence was performed. Leptospiral DNA was identified in 18% (9/50) examined blocks. Two sequences were characterized as L. interrogans. These findings suggest that the presence of infectious leptospires in uterus is associated with the physiopathogenesis of the reproductive failure.","['Cabral Pires B', 'Berzin Grapiglia J', 'Moreira L', 'Jaeger LH', 'Carvalho-Costa FA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2018,114,,Microb Pathog,"Cabral Pires B, et al.

29197499,Leptospira reservoirs among wildlife in Brazil: Beyond rodents.,"Leptospirosis is a disease of great importance in tropical regions. Infection occurs mainly through contact with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals, especially that of rodents. Despite the diversity and abundance of wild fauna in Brazil, little is known about the role of other wild species in the epidemiology of leptospirosis. This study aimed to investigate new reservoirs of Leptospira among wildlife in Brazil, using serological and molecular diagnoses in a large-sized sample. Biological samples were collected from 309 free-ranging mammals, belonging to 16 species. The majority of the animals included were opossums (Didelphis albiventris) and coatis (Nasua nasua). Blood and urine samples were subjected to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and real-time PCR, respectively. Genetic characterization of genomospecies was performed using PCR amplicons. Statistical analysis was applied to test associations between positive diagnoses and age, sex, season and type of environment. The prevalence of infection found via MAT and PCR was 11% and 5.5%, respectively. If these tests are taken to be complementary, the overall prevalence was 16%. The most common serogroups were Djasiman and Australis, while L. santarosai was the prevalent genomospecies. Significant differences in prevalence between animal species were observed. Greater risk of infection was detected among adult opossums than among young ones. The influence of each serogroup and genomospecies was tested for the same variables, and this revealed higher risk of infection by L. santarosai among male opossums than among females. The present study highlights the exposure and carrier status of several wild species in Brazil and it indicates that coatis and other carnivores are priorities for further investigations.","['Fornazari F', 'Langoni H', 'Marson PM', 'Nóbrega DB', 'Teixeira CR']",2018,178,,Acta Trop,"Fornazari F, et al.

29197401,Neglected zoonotic agents in cattle abortion: tackling the difficult to grow bacteria.,"BACKGROUND: Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydia abortus and Leptospira spp. are difficult to grow bacteria that play a role in bovine abortion, but their diagnosis is hampered by their obligate intracellular lifestyle (C. burnetii, C. abortus) or their lability (Leptospira spp.). Their importance is based on the contagious spread in food-producing animals, but also as zoonotic agents. In Switzerland, first-line routine bacteriological diagnostics in cattle abortions is regulated by national law and includes only basic screening by staining for C. burnetii due to the high costs associated with extended spectrum analysis. The aim of this study was to assess the true occurrence of these zoonotic pathogens in 249 cases of bovine abortion in Switzerland by serology (ELISA for anti-C. burnetii and C. abortus antibodies and microscopic agglutination test for anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies), molecular methods (real-time PCR and sequencing of PCR products of Chlamydiales-positive cases), Stamp's modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen (mod-ZN) stain and, upon availability of material, by histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
RESULTS: After seroanalysis the prevalence was 15.9% for C. burnetii, 38.5% for C. abortus and 21.4% for Leptospira spp. By real-time PCR 12.1% and 16.9% of the cases were positive for C. burnetii and Chlamydiales, respectively, but only 2.4% were positive for C. burnetii or Chlamydiales by mod-ZN stain. Sequencing of PCR products of Chlamydiales-positive cases revealed C. abortus in 10% of cases and the presence of a mix of Chlamydiales-related bacteria in 5.2% of cases. Pathogenic Leptospira spp. were detected in 5.6% of cases. Inflammatory lesions were present histologically in all available samples which were real-time PCR-positive for Chlamydiales and Leptospira spp. One of 12 real-time PCR-positive cases for C. burnetii was devoid of histological lesions. None of the pathogens could be detected by IHC.
CONCLUSION: Molecular detection by real-time PCR complemented by histopathological analysis is recommended to improve definitive diagnosis of bovine abortion cases and determine a more accurate prevalence of these zoonotic pathogens.","['Vidal S', 'Kegler K', 'Greub G', 'Aeby S', 'Borel N', 'Dagleish MP', 'Posthaus H', 'Perreten V', 'Rodriguez-Campos S']",2017,13,1,BMC Vet Res,"Vidal S, et al.

29187150,"Identification of pathogens for differential diagnosis of fever with jaundice in the Central African Republic: a retrospective assessment, 2008-2010.","BACKGROUND: Febrile jaundice results clinically in generalized yellow coloration of the teguments and mucous membranes due to excess plasma bilirubin, accompanied by fever. Two types are found: conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin jaundice. Jaundice is a sign in several diseases due to viruses (viral hepatitis and arbovirus), parasites (malaria) and bacteria (leptospirosis). In the Central African Republic (CAR), only yellow fever is included on the list of diseases for surveillance. The aim of this study was to identify the other pathogens that can cause febrile jaundice, for better management of patients.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, 198 sera negative for yellow fever IgM were randomly selected from 2177 samples collected during yellow fever surveillance. Laboratory analyses targeted four groups of pathogens: hepatitis B, C, delta and E viruses; dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, West Nile and Rift Valley arboviruses; malaria parasites; and bacteria (leptospirosis).
RESULTS: Overall, 30.9% sera were positive for hepatitis B, 20.2% for hepatitis E, 12.3% for hepatitis C and 8.2% for malaria. The majority of positive sera (40.4%) were from people aged 16-30 years. Co-infection with at least two of these pathogens was also found.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a systematic investigation should be undertaken of infectious agents that cause febrile jaundice in the CAR.","['Gadia CLB', 'Manirakiza A', 'Tekpa G', 'Konamna X', 'Vickos U', 'Nakoune E']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Gadia CLB, et al.

29186412,Genomic characterization and comparative analysis of Leptospira interrogans serogroup Australis isolated from swine.,"The Leptospira interrogans serogroup Australis is traditionally described as pathogenic for swine although animals usually present low serologic response and mild clinical signs. The first isolation of a Leptospira interrogans serogroup Australis strain from swine, in Brazil, was recently described. Herein we present the genomic characterization of this strain (SU5) and further comparison with the Leptospira serovars reference genomes available in the GenBank database. The SU5 strain was characterized with sequence types previously described in a serogroup Australis isolated from human and presented a new ST98 that is thus far exclusively of the Brazilian porcine L. interrogans serogroup Australis. Even though the SU5 strain presented higher similarity with the American porcine serogroup Australis strain PigK151, as expected, it also presented sequences blocks in both chromosomes which are absent in the genomes of the studied Leptospira serovars. These regions are flanked by insertion sequences and transposases genes, suggesting the existence of inter- and intra-serogroup genomic variability due to mobile elements transferring. This genomic plasticity has already been demonstrated for pathogenic Leptospira species; nevertheless, there is still a limited understanding of the relationship between genome organization and content and the divergence of Leptospira serogroups and serovars that needs to be further elucidated.","['Moreno LZ', 'Kremer FS', 'Jaeger LH', 'Loureiro AP', 'Miraglia F', 'Eslabao MR', 'Dellagostin OA', 'Lilenbaum W', 'Moreno AM']",2017,75,9,Pathog Dis,"Moreno LZ, et al.

29183820,MHC class II DRB diversity predicts antigen recognition and is associated with disease severity in California sea lions naturally infected with Leptospira interrogans.,"We examined the associations between California sea lion MHC class II DRB (Zaca-DRB) configuration and diversity, and leptospirosis. As Zaca-DRB gene sequences are involved with antigen presentation of bacteria and other extracellular pathogens, we predicted that they would play a role in determining responses to these pathogenic spirochaetes. Specifically, we investigated whether Zaca-DRB diversity (number of genes) and configuration (presence of specific genes) explained differences in disease severity, and whether higher levels of Zaca-DRB diversity predicted the number of specific Leptospira interrogans serovars that a sea lion's serum would react against. We found that serum from diseased sea lions with more Zaca-DRB loci reacted against a wider array of serovars. Specific Zaca-DRB loci were linked to reactions with particular serovars. Interestingly, sea lions with clinical manifestation of leptospirosis that had higher numbers of Zaca-DRB loci were less likely to recover from disease than those with lower diversity, and those that harboured Zaca-DRB.C or -G were 4.5 to 5.3 times more likely to die from leptospirosis, regardless of the infective serovars. We propose that for leptospirosis, a disadvantage of having a wider range of antigen presentation might be increased disease severity due to immunopathology. Ours is the first study to examine the importance of Zaca-DRB diversity for antigen detection and disease severity following natural exposure to infective leptospires.","['Acevedo-Whitehouse K', 'Gulland FMD', 'Bowen L']",2018,57,,Infect Genet Evol,"Acevedo-Whitehouse K, et al.

29173242,Evidence of multiple intraspecific transmission routes for Leptospira acquisition in Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus).,"Infectious diseases frequently have multiple potential routes of intraspecific transmission of pathogens within wildlife and other populations. For pathogens causing zoonotic diseases, knowing whether these transmission routes occur in the wild and their relative importance, is critical for understanding maintenance, improving control measures and ultimately preventing human disease. The Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) is the primary reservoir of leptospirosis in the urban slums of Salvador, Brazil. There is biological evidence for potentially three different transmission routes of leptospire infection occurring in the rodent population. Using newly obtained prevalence data from rodents trapped at an urban slum field site, we present changes in cumulative risk of infection in relation to age-dependent transmission routes to infer which intra-specific transmission routes occur in the wild. We found that a significant proportion of animals leave the nest with infection and that the risk of infection increases throughout the lifetime of Norway rats. We did not observe a significant effect of sexual maturity on the risk of infection. In conclusion, our results suggest that vertical and environmental transmission of leptospirosis both occur in wild populations of Norway rats.","['Minter A', 'Diggle PJ', 'Costa F', 'Childs J', 'Ko AI', 'Begon M']",2017,145,16,Epidemiol Infect,"Minter A, et al.

29158922,Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Secondary to Leptospirosis.,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure, is associated with a mortality of 30-50% and is precipitated by both direct and indirect pulmonary insults. Treatment is largely supportive, consisting of lung protective ventilation and thereby necessitating Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. The most common precipitant is community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, but other putative pathogens include viruses and fungi. On rare occasions, ARDS can be secondary to tropical disease. Accordingly, a history should include travel to endemic regions. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease most common in the tropics and typically associated with mild pulmonary complications. We describe a case of a 25-year-old male with undiagnosed leptospirosis, presenting with fever and severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, returning from a Costa Rican holiday. There was no other organ failure. He was intubated and received lung protective ventilation. His condition improved after ampicillin and penicillin G were added empirically. This case illustrates the rare complication of ARDS from leptospirosis, the importance of taking a travel history, and the need for empiric therapy because of diagnostic delay.","['Fernando SM', 'Cardinal P', 'Brindley PG']",2017,2017,,Case Rep Crit Care,"Fernando SM, et al.

Several types of human leptospirosis vaccines have been developed, including inactivated whole-cell, outer-envelope, and recombinant vaccines. Of these, only a multivalent inactivated leptospirosis vaccine is available in China, which was added to the Chinese Expanded Program on Immunization in 2007. However, this vaccine elicits serogroup-specific immunity, and serogroup epidemiology should continue to be monitored to enhance vaccine coverage and distribution. On the other hand, the efficiency of the inactivated vaccine should be further improved by optimizing the formulation, and by expanding the target population. More importantly, additional investments should be made to develop universal recombinant vaccines.","['Xu Y', 'Ye Q']",2018,14,4,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Xu Y and Ye Q.

29131400,Evaluation of 3 Serological Tests for Early Detection Of Leptospira-specific Antibodies in Experimentally Infected Dogs.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis in dogs is a disease of global importance. Early detection and appropriate therapeutic intervention are necessary to resolve infection and prevent zoonotic transmission. However, its diagnosis is hindered by nonspecific clinical signs and lack of rapid diagnostic tests of early infection. Recently, 2 rapid point-of-care tests (WITNESS Lepto [WITNESS Lepto, Zoetis LLC, Kalamazoo, MI, USA] and SNAP Lepto [SNAP Lepto, IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA]) for detection of Leptospira-specific antibodies in canine sera were developed.
HYPOTHESIS: Immunoglobulin M-based WITNESS Lepto containing multiple detection antigens can detect Leptospira-specific antibodies to common leptospiral serovars earlier in the course of infection as compared to microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and SNAP Lepto.
ANIMALS: Four groups of 8 6- to 8-month-old male Beagle dogs were used.
METHODS: Thirty-two healthy seronegative dogs were inoculated experimentally with serovars Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae, and Pomona (8 dogs/serovar). Acute-phase sera were collected at regular intervals and monitored for Leptospira-specific antibodies by WITNESS Lepto, MAT, and SNAP Lepto.
RESULTS: Seroconversion was detected in all dogs by day 10 by WITNESS Lepto and in 30 of 32 dogs by day 14 by MAT. The SNAP Lepto test detected seroconversion in 3 dogs during the 2 weeks postchallenge.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunoglobulin M-based WITNESS Lepto detected immune responses specific to multiple leptospiral serovars early in the course of infection and identified seroconversion in all animals earlier than did the gold standard MAT. The SNAP Lepto test displayed considerably lower and inconsistent performance during the study period. At the point-of-care, WITNESS Lepto should be the test of choice for rapid and reliable screening of acutely ill dogs suspected to have leptospirosis.","['Lizer J', 'Velineni S', 'Weber A', 'Krecic M', 'Meeus P']",2018,32,1,J Vet Intern Med,"Lizer J, et al.

This work aimed to investigate the potency of five leptospirosis vaccines sold commercially in Brazil, challenging the animals with one autochthonous strain of Leptospira, Canicola serovar, denoted LO4, isolated from swine. The standard protocol was followed, and renal carriers of Leptospira were identified among the surviving animals by culture and PCR. Of the five vaccines tested, only two proved effective. None of the surviving animals was positive by culture; however, one animal was positive by PCR. Three of the five vaccines sold commercially in Brazil for the immunization of swine or bovines failed the test of the efficacy to protect the vaccinated animals following challenge with an autochthonous Leptospira strain, Canicola serovar. The two vaccines provided protection against the renal carrier state in the surviving animals. The criteria used to produce leptospirosis bacterins sold commercially in Brazil must be reviewed.

29108931,Binding of human plasminogen by the lipoprotein LipL46 of Leptospira interrogans.,"Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira. Bacteria disseminate via the bloodstream and colonize the renal tubules of reservoir hosts. Leptospiral surface-exposed proteins are important targets, because due to their location they can elicit immune response and mediate adhesion and invasion processes. LipL46 has been previously reported to be located at the leptospiral outer membrane and recognized by antibodies present in serum of infected hamsters. In this study, we have confirmed the cellular location of this protein by immunofluorescence and FACS. We have cloned and expressed the recombinant protein LipL46 in its soluble form. LipL46 was recognized by confirmed leptospirosis human serum, suggesting its expression during infection. Binding screening of LipL46 with extracellular matrix (ECM) and plasma components showed that this protein interacts with plasminogen. The binding is dose-dependent on protein concentration, but saturation was not reached with the range of protein concentration used. Kringle domains of plasminogen and lysine residues of the recombinant protein are involved in the binding because the lysine analog, amino caproic acid (ACA) almost totally inhibited the reaction. The interaction of LipL46 with plasminogen generates plasmin in the presence of plasminogen activator uPA. Because plasmin generated at the leptospiral surface can degrade ECM molecules and decrease opsonophagocytosis, we tentatively infer that Lip46 has a role in helping the invasion process of pathogenic Leptospira.","['Santos JV', 'Pereira PRM', 'Fernandes LGV', 'Siqueira GH', 'de Souza GO', 'Souza Filho A', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Heinemann MB', 'Chapola EGB', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2018,37,,Mol Cell Probes,"Santos JV, et al.

29107384,Binding of human complement C1 sterase inhibitor to Leptospira spp.,"Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis of global importance caused by bacteria Leptospira spp. Pathogenic Leptospira is resistant to Complement System killing while non-pathogenic Leptospira is rapidly killed by exposure to normal human serum (NHS). Pathogenic Leptospira interact with Complement Regulators such as Factor H, C4b binding protein and Vitronectin avoiding Complement activation and killing by Alternative and Classical Pathways. One important regulator is C1-inhibitor (C1INH) that interacts with C1s or MASPs controlling the cleavage of C4 and C2 molecules, thereby inhibiting the activation of the Classical and Lectin Pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that attenuated, saprophytic and pathogenic Leptospira interact with C1INH that maintain its regulatory capacity of interaction with C1s preventing the activation of Complement system. Although the interaction with C1INH is not crucial for pathogenic Leptospira survival, it seems to be important for the survival of attenuated and saprophytic Leptospira in normal human serum.","['Breda LCD', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'de Moraes Vasconcelos D', 'Isaac L']",2018,223,2,Immunobiology,"Breda LCD, et al.

29094440,Prospective evaluation of abdominal ultrasonographic findings in 35 dogs with leptospirosis.,"Despite the emergence of new serovars, a detailed and current abdominal ultrasonographic description of dogs with leptospirosis is lacking. The purpose of this prospective, observational, single cohort study was to illustrate abdominal ultrasonographic findings in 35 dogs with confirmed leptospirosis. At least one ultrasonographic abnormality was seen in all of the dogs. Ultrasound renal abnormalities were found in all the dogs and included increased renal cortical echogenicity (100%), increased medullary echogenicity (86%), reduced corticomedullary definition (80%), cortical thickening (74%), renomegaly (60%), pelvic dilation (31%), and medullary band (14%). Hepatic changes were identified in 83% of the dogs, with diffuse hypoechoic parenchyma (71%) and hepatomegaly (60%). Biliary gallbladder abnormalities were found in 60% of the dogs, with biliary sludge (46%), wall thickening (29%), mucocele (26%), and hyperechoic wall (20%). The other most frequently observed abdominal abnormalities were perirenal (60%) and peritoneal (46%) effusions, small intestinal wall thickening (49%), and lymphadenopathy (38%). Two dogs (6%) presented with a small intestinal intussusception. No association was found between serogroups and the presence of ultrasonographic findings. This study is the first to prospectively and exhaustively describe abdominal ultrasonographic findings in dogs with leptospirosis. Our results should prompt clinicians to systematically perform abdominal ultrasounds on dogs with suspected leptospirosis even in the absence of abnormal physical signs. The presence of a gallbladder mucocele could be a warning sign of leptospirosis in dogs.","['Sonet J', 'Barthélemy A', 'Goy-Thollot I', 'Pouzot-Nevoret C']",2018,59,1,Vet Radiol Ultrasound,"Sonet J, et al.

Isolation of Leptospira from all the 17 environmental samples was successful. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, a diverse group of Leptospira species was recovered from waterfall samples including 2 pathogenic species (Leptospira alstonii [5/17, 29%] and Leptospira kmetyi [1/17, 6%]); 1 intermediate species (Leptospira wolffii [9/17, 53%]); and 2 non-pathogenic species (Leptospira meyeri [1/17, 6%] and Leptospira idonii [1/17, 6%]). The high prevalence of pathogenic and intermediate Leptospira indicates that a waterfall may serve as a natural reservoir of possible pathogens of leptospirosis.","['Chaiwattanarungruengpaisan S', 'Suwanpakdee S', 'Sangkachai N', 'Chamsai T', 'Taruyanon K', 'Thongdee M']",2018,71,1,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Chaiwattanarungruengpaisan S, et al.

29092789,A comparison of two molecular methods for diagnosing leptospirosis from three different sample types in patients presenting with fever in Laos.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare two molecular assays (rrs quantitative PCR (qPCR) versus a combined 16SrRNA and LipL32 qPCR) on different sample types for diagnosing leptospirosis in febrile patients presenting to Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos.
METHODS: Serum, buffy coat and urine samples were collected on admission, and follow-up serum ∼10 days later. Leptospira spp. culture and microscopic agglutination tests (MAT) were performed as reference standards. Bayesian latent class modelling was performed to estimate sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test.
RESULTS: In all, 787 patients were included in the analysis: 4/787 (0.5%) were Leptospira culture positive, 30/787 (3.8%) were MAT positive, 76/787 (9.7%) were rrs qPCR positive and 20/787 (2.5%) were 16SrRNA/LipL32 qPCR positive for pathogenic Leptospira spp. in at least one sample. Estimated sensitivity and specificity (with 95% CI) of 16SrRNA/LipL32 qPCR on serum (53.9% (33.3%-81.8%); 99.6% (99.2%-100%)), buffy coat (58.8% (34.4%-90.9%); 99.9% (99.6%-100%)) and urine samples (45.0% (27.0%-66.7%); 99.6% (99.3%-100%)) were comparable with those of rrs qPCR, except specificity of 16SrRNA/LipL32 qPCR on urine samples was significantly higher (99.6% (99.3%-100%) vs. 92.5% (92.3%-92.8%), p <0.001). Sensitivities of MAT (16% (95% CI 6.3%-29.4%)) and culture (25% (95% CI 13.3%-44.4%)) were low. Mean positive Cq values showed that buffy coat samples were more frequently inhibitory to qPCR than either serum or urine (p <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum and urine are better samples for qPCR than buffy coat, and 16SrRNA/LipL32 qPCR performs better than rrs qPCR on urine. Quantitative PCR on admission is a reliable rapid diagnostic tool, performing better than MAT or culture, with significant implications for clinical and epidemiological investigations of this global neglected disease.","['Woods K', 'Nic-Fhogartaigh C', 'Arnold C', 'Boutthasavong L', 'Phuklia W', 'Lim C', 'Chanthongthip A', 'Tulsiani SM', 'Craig SB', 'Burns MA', 'Weier SL', 'Davong V', 'Sihalath S', 'Limmathurotsakul D', 'Dance DAB', 'Shetty N', 'Zambon M', 'Newton PN', 'Dittrich S']",2018,24,9,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Woods K, et al.

29066380,Immune response of a commercial vaccine against Leptospira interrogans: Antibodies and cytokine levels.,"Good vaccines should confer protection against specific pathogens in experimental and field conditions. However, some commercial vaccines are not capable to confer protection to animals, being inefficient in a bovine vaccine program. In this sense, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibody levels involved in the immune response in vaccinated cows against leptospirosis, as well as acute phase protein and the immunological markers in a vaccine program in beef cattle. Twenty non-lactating cows, negative for leptospirosis and without vaccination against this disease were evaluated during five months. The herd was divided into two groups named as A (the control group) and B (the vaccinated group). Ten cows from the group B received an initial dose (5 mL) of vaccine on day 0 and one booster dose (5 mL) on day 29. In order to evaluate humoral response (MAT - titration 1:25), cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)), and C-reactive protein levels (an acute phase protein), blood samples were evaluated on days 0, 29, 40, 83 and 144 after vaccination. In none of the evaluated periods it was observed specific antibodies to any of the six serovars presents in the vaccine, as well as no difference between groups regarding cytokine and C-reactive protein levels. Therefore, the vaccine used did not stimulate the immune response of cattle, inferring the absence of protection against infections by L. interrogans.","['Fávero JF', 'Fritzen A', 'Lovato LT', 'Martins P', 'Baldissera MD', 'Stefani LM', 'Da Silva AS']",2018,114,,Microb Pathog,"Fávero JF, et al.

29065186,Environmental risk of leptospirosis infections in the Netherlands: Spatial modelling of environmental risk factors of leptospirosis in the Netherlands.,"Leptospirosis is a globally emerging zoonotic disease, associated with various climatic, biotic and abiotic factors. Mapping and quantifying geographical variations in the occurrence of leptospirosis and the surrounding environment offer innovative methods to study disease transmission and to identify associations between the disease and the environment. This study aims to investigate geographic variations in leptospirosis incidence in the Netherlands and to identify associations with environmental factors driving the emergence of the disease. Individual case data derived over the period 1995-2012 in the Netherlands were geocoded and aggregated by municipality. Environmental covariate data were extracted for each municipality and stored in a spatial database. Spatial clusters were identified using kernel density estimations and quantified using local autocorrelation statistics. Associations between the incidence of leptospirosis and the local environment were determined using Simultaneous Autoregressive Models (SAR) explicitly modelling spatial dependence of the model residuals. Leptospirosis incidence rates were found to be spatially clustered, showing a marked spatial pattern. Fitting a spatial autoregressive model significantly improved model fit and revealed significant association between leptospirosis and the coverage of arable land, built up area, grassland and sabulous clay soils. The incidence of leptospirosis in the Netherlands could effectively be modelled using a combination of soil and land-use variables accounting for spatial dependence of incidence rates per municipality. The resulting spatially explicit risk predictions provide an important source of information which will benefit clinical awareness on potential leptospirosis infections in endemic areas.","['Rood EJJ', 'Goris MGA', 'Pijnacker R', 'Bakker MI', 'Hartskeerl RA']",2017,12,10,PLoS One,"Rood EJJ, et al.

29058382,Risk factors of Leptospira infection in Mediterranean periurban micromammals.,"Urbanization of natural areas can change abiotic factors, providing artificial sources of humidity in summer and decreasing variation of temperatures in winter. Our study aimed at document risk factors of infection in mammal reservoirs of pathogenic Leptospira in the human/wildlife interface of a large metropolitan area. We hypothesize that survival of Leptospira and thus their prevalence in animal reservoirs should be higher in residential areas than in natural habitats, especially after the hot, dry Mediterranean summers. We established the prevalence of Leptospira spp. and identified the serovars in 353 urine samples from micromammals (chiefly the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, n = 266) using direct immunofluorescence and PCR. Animals were captured in spring and autumn, 2011-2012, in two natural parks and two adjacent residential areas in periurban Barcelona (NE Spain). Overall observed prevalence of infection was 11%, ranking between 8% and 13% in the better represented host species. We observed marked differences between seasons; the probability of finding a micromammal infected in spring was three times greater than in autumn (almost four times for wood mouse). Prevalence was not related with type of habitat, micromammal relative abundance or sex of the animal. Three Leptospira species were confirmed: Leptospira interrogans (47% of cases), Leptospira borgpetersenii (41%) and Leptospira kirschneri (12%). The serovars most commonly detected were those typically hosted by rodents, and serovars Ballum and Icterohemorrhagiae were the only ones found in autumn. People living in periurban Barcelona and those visiting the natural areas of the metropolitan area face hazard of infection with rodent-borne Leptospira, especially during spring.","['Millán J', 'Cevidanes A', 'Chirife AD', 'Candela MG', 'León-Vizcaíno L']",2018,65,1,Zoonoses Public Health,"Millán J, et al.

29038956,Interaction of Leptospira with the Innate Immune System.,"Innate immunity encompasses immediate host responses that detect and respond to microbes. Besides recognition by the complement system (see the chapter by A. Barbosa, this volume), innate immunity concerns cellular responses. These are triggered through recognition of conserved microbial components (called MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading, through secretion of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and immune mediators, to cellular recruitment and phagocytosis. Leptospira spp. are successful zoonotic pathogenic bacteria that obviously overcome the immune system of their hosts. The first part of this chapter summarizes what is known about leptospires recognition and interaction with phagocytes and other innate immune cells, and the second part describes specific interactions of leptospiral MAMPs with PRRs from the TLR and NLR families. On the one hand, pathogenic leptospires appear to escape macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis. On the other hand, studies about PRR sensing of leptospires remain very limited, but suggest that pathogenic leptospires escape some of the PRRs in a host-specific manner, due to peculiar cell wall specificities or post-translational modifications that may impair their recognition. Further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanisms and consequences of leptospiral escape on phagocytic functions and hopefully give clues to potential therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring the defective activation of PRRs by pathogenic Leptospira spp.",['Werts C'],2018,415,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Werts C.

Lysine methylation in rickettsial OmpB is correlated with rickettsial virulence, and N- and O-methylations are also observed in virulence-relevant OMPs from several pathogenic bacteria that cause typhus, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, and anaplasmosis. We summarize recent findings on the structure of methylated OmpB, biochemical characterization, and crystal structures of OmpB methyltransferases. Native rickettsial OmpB purified from highly virulent strains contains multiple clusters of trimethyllysine, in contrast with mostly monomethyllysine, and no trimethyllysine is found in an avirulent strain. Crystal structure of the methyltransferases reveals mechanistic insights for catalysis, and a working model is discussed for this unusual post-translational modification.","['Yang DCH', 'Abeykoon AH', 'Choi BE', 'Ching WM', 'Chock PB']",2017,42,12,Trends Biochem Sci,"Yang DCH, et al.

29024616,"Investigation of infectious reproductive pathogens of large ruminants: Are neosporosis, brucellosis, leptospirosis and BVDV of relevance in Lao PDR?","N. caninum, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, Brucella abortus and Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo are globally significant reproductive pathogens that cause abortion and reproductive loss in large ruminants. Prevalence information is lacking in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) despite the poor reproductive performance of cattle and buffalo. Serological examination of frozen cattle (n=90) and buffalo (n=61) sera by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays provided the first reported screening of some of these pathogens in Laos. Seroprevalence differed amongst these large ruminant species, with N. caninum, BVDV and L. interrogans serovar Hardjo antibodies found in 68.9% (95% CI±11.6), 4.9% (95% CI±5.4) and 3.3% (95% CI±4.5) of buffalo sera, respectively, and in 7.8% (95% CI±5.5), 10.0% (95% CI±6.2) and 22.2% (95% CI±8.6) of cattle sera, respectively. Buffalo sera had a significantly higher seroprevalence of N. caninum compared to cattle (p<0.001) and cattle sera had a significantly higher seroprevalence of L. interrogans serovar Hardjo compared to buffalo (p=0.003). Variability was also observed across provinces for N. caninum in buffalo (p=0.007) and for L. interrogans serovar Hardjo in cattle (p=0.071), suggesting provincial risk factors conducive to pathogen transmission. BVDV and N. caninum seropositivity were negatively associated in buffalo (p=0.018) and cattle (p=0.003). In buffalo, L. interrogans serovar Hardjo and BVDV seropositivity were associated (p=0.035, p=0.039). The identification of antibodies against three major abortifacient pathogens in Laos prompts further research to determine if infection is associated with low reproductive efficiency and the risk factors for infection.

The borreliae from Amblyomma variegatum could not be identified due to very low quantities of present DNA reflected by high cycle threshold values in real-time-PCR. It is uncertain whether these low numbers of Borrelia spp. are sufficient for transmission of infection from ticks to humans. In order to determine whether spirochaete infections are relevant in humans, blood samples of 1009 patients from the highlands of Madagascar with fever of unknown origin were screened for Borrelia spp. - and in addition for Leptospira spp. - by real-time PCR. No target DNA was detected, indicating a limited relevance of these pathogens for humans in the highlands of Madagascar.","['Hagen RM', 'Frickmann H', 'Ehlers J', 'Krüger A', 'Margos G', 'Hizo-Teufel C', 'Fingerle V', 'Rakotozandrindrainy R', 'Kalckreuth VV', 'Im J', 'Pak GD', 'Jeon HJ', 'Rakotondrainiarivelo JP', 'Heriniaina JN', 'Razafindrabe T', 'Konings F', 'May J', 'Hogan B', 'Ganzhorn J', 'Panzner U', 'Schwarz NG', 'Dekker D', 'Marks F', 'Poppert S']",2018,177,,Acta Trop,"Hagen RM, et al.

28978319,Acute undifferentiated fever in India: a multicentre study of aetiology and diagnostic accuracy.,"BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of malaria, bacteraemia, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, chikungunya and dengue among hospitalized patients with acute undifferentiated fever in India, and to describe the performance of standard diagnostic methods.
METHODS: During April 2011-November 2012, 1564 patients aged ≥5 years with febrile illness for 2-14 days were consecutively included in an observational study at seven community hospitals in six states in India. Malaria microscopy, blood culture, Dengue rapid NS1 antigen and IgM Combo test, Leptospira IgM ELISA, Scrub typhus IgM ELISA and Chikungunya IgM ELISA were routinely performed at the hospitals. Second line testing, Dengue IgM capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA), Scrub typhus immunofluorescence (IFA), Leptospira Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), malaria PCR and malaria immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic test (RDT) Parahit Total™ were performed at the coordinating centre. Convalescence samples were not available. Case definitions were as follows: Leptospirosis: Positive ELISA and positive MAT. Scrub typhus: Positive ELISA and positive IFA. Dengue: Positive RDT and/or positive MAC-ELISA. Chikungunya: Positive ELISA. Bacteraemia: Growth in blood culture excluding those defined as contaminants. Malaria: Positive genus-specific PCR.
RESULTS: Malaria was diagnosed in 17% (268/1564) and among these 54% had P. falciparum. Dengue was diagnosed in 16% (244/1564). Bacteraemia was found in 8% (124/1564), and among these Salmonella typhi or S. paratyphi constituted 35%. Scrub typhus was diagnosed in 10%, leptospirosis in 7% and chikungunya in 6%. Fulfilling more than one case definition was common, most frequent in chikungunya where 26% (25/98) also had positive dengue test.
CONCLUSIONS: Malaria and dengue were the most common causes of fever in this study. A high overlap between case definitions probably reflects high prevalence of prior infections, cross reactivity and subclinical infections, rather than high prevalence of coinfections. Low accuracy of routine diagnostic tests should be taken into consideration when approaching the patient with acute undifferentiated fever in India.","['Mørch K', 'Manoharan A', 'Chandy S', 'Chacko N', 'Alvarez-Uria G', 'Patil S', 'Henry A', 'Nesaraj J', 'Kuriakose C', 'Singh A', 'Kurian S', 'Gill Haanshuus C', 'Langeland N', 'Blomberg B', 'Vasanthan Antony G', 'Mathai D']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Mørch K, et al.

28963011,The role of Lsa23 to mediate the interaction of Leptospira interrogans with the terminal complement components pathway.,"Leptospirosis is a severe worldwide zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. It has been demonstrated that pathogenic leptospires are resistant to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum while saprophytic strains are susceptible. Pathogenic strains have the ability to bind soluble complement regulators and these activities are thought to contribute to bacterial immune evasion. One strategy used by some pathogens to evade the complement cascade, which is not well explored, is to block the terminal pathway. We have, thus, examined whether leptospires are able to interact with components of the terminal complement pathway. ELISA screening using anti-leptospires serum has shown that the pathogenic, virulent strain L. interrogans L1-130 can bind to immobilized human C8 (1 μg). However, virulent and saprophyte L. biflexa strains showed the ability to interact with C8 and C9, when these components were employed at physiological concentration (50 μg/mL), but the virulent strain seemed more competent. Lsa23, a putative leptospiral adhesin only present in pathogenic strains, interacts with C8 and C9 in a dose-dependent mode, suggesting that this protein could mediate the binding of virulent Leptospira with these components. To our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the binding of Leptospira to C8 and C9 terminal complement components, suggesting that the inhibition of this pathway is part of the strategy used by leptospires to evade the innate immunity.","['Siqueira GH', 'de Souza GO', 'Heinemann MB', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2017,112,,Microb Pathog,"Siqueira GH, et al.

Leptospirosis may manifest as a mild flu-like illness or in a severe febrile form (meningitis, pulmonary haemorrhage, hepato-renal syndrome, or myocarditis). Presented are the laboratory diagnostic methods for leptospiroses with their advantages and disadvantages. In practice, serological diagnosis by the microscopic agglutination test, which is also a confirmatory test, and, less often, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are used.

LipL32 is an abundant lipoprotein from the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) group, highly conserved among pathogenic and intermediate Leptospira species. Several studies used LipL32 as a specific gene to identify the presence of leptospires. This research was aimed to study the characteristics of LipL32 protein gene code, to fill the knowledge gap concerning the most appropriate gene that can be used as antigen to detect the Leptospira. Here, we investigated the features of LipL32 in fourteen Leptospira pathogenic strains based on comparative analyses of their primary, secondary structures and 3D modeling using a bioinformatics approach. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of LipL32 in different strains were studied, shedding light on the identity of signal peptides, as well as on the secondary and tertiary structure of the LipL32 protein, supported by 3D modelling assays. The results showed that the LipL32 gene was present in all the fourteen pathogenic Leptospira strains used in this study, with limited diversity in terms of sequence conservation, hydrophobic group, hydrophilic group and number of turns (random coil). Overall, these results add basic knowledge to the characteristics of LipL32 protein, contributing to the identification of potential antigen candidates in future research, in order to ensure prompt and reliable detection of pathogenic Leptospira species.","['Kumaran SK', 'Bakar MFA', 'Mohd-Padil H', 'Mat-Sharani S', 'Sakinah S', 'Poorani K', 'Alsaeedy H', 'Peli A', 'Wei TS', 'Ling MP', 'Hamat RA', 'Neela VK', 'Higuchi A', 'Alarfaj AA', 'Rajan M', 'Benelli G', 'Arulselvan P', 'Kumar SS']",2017,176,,Acta Trop,"Kumaran SK, et al. 3D modelling of the pathogenic Leptospira protein LipL32: A bioinformatics approach. 3D modelling of the pathogenic Leptospira protein LipL32: A bioinformatics approach. 2017; 176:433-439. doi: 10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.09.011",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28941729/

The cases are discussed in the context of diagnostics, risk factors, persistence of symptoms and outbreak mitigation measures.
METHOD: Clinical and laboratory records from the human cases were reviewed and serological and molecular investigations were conducted into the Leptospira status of cattle and pigs on the farm.
RESULTS: Cases presented early in their illness and all three were confirmed within seven days of onset of symptoms by urine PCR and within 18 days by convalescent MAT (two Hardjo, one Pomona). Cattle and pigs had serological evidence of recent infection with Hardjo/Pomona and Pomona/Copenhageni respectively. Pigs were slaughtered and cattle were vaccinated. Post-exposure prophylaxis was given to staff in-contact with the milking herd until the herd had antibiotic treatment at drying-off (approximately four months after the initial case).
CONCLUSION: The utility of PCR testing for Leptospira DNA as both an early and rapid test for leptospirosis was demonstrated. Two of three cases reported persistence of symptoms at least six months after the acute episode and one of these remains unable to work. Risk mitigation measures such as post-exposure prophylaxis, animal vaccination, heightened clinical suspicion of leptospirosis and recognition of context specific risk factors (eg, effluent spreading) demonstrate the value of medical and veterinary experts working together.","['Benschop J', 'Collins-Emerson J', 'Maskill A', ""O'Connor P"", 'Tunbridge M', 'Yupiana Y', 'Weston J']",2017,130,1462,N Z Med J,"Benschop J, et al.

28926845,Leptospirosis Renal Disease: Emerging Culprit of Chronic Kidney Disease Unknown Etiology.,"Leptospirosis is the most prevalent zoonosis affecting more than 1 million populations worldwide. Interestingly, leptospirosis endemic regions coincide with chronic kidney disease (CKD) hotspots largely due to flooding and agricultural overlaps. Acute leptospirosis induces multiple organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and may predispose to CKD and end-stage renal disease, if not treated timely. Asymptomatic infection may carry the bacteria in the kidney and CKD progresses insidiously. Histologic finding of leptospirosis renal disease includes tubulointerstitial nephritis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. Proximal tubule dysfunction and hypokalemia are observed in adult male workers with leptospirosis, a characteristic similarity to CKD unknown etiology (CKDu). CKDu is a form of CKD that is not attributable to traditional risk factors clustering in agricultural communities affecting young male farmers. Kidney pathology shows a chronic tubulointerstitial disease. CKDu is being reported as an endemic nephropathy across the globe. Recent surveys suggest that asymptomatic leptospira renal colonization is an overlooked risk for renal fibrosis and CKDu. Population with anti-leptospira seropositivity is associated with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate in endemic regions and carrier may progress to CKD. Leptospirosis has been considered as a risk factor for CKDu in Sri Lanka and in Mesoamerican area. Sugarcane workers in Nicaragua showed increased anti-leptospira seropositivity and higher urinary biomarkers for kidney injury. Emerging evidence with signs of infection were reported in these endemic population, indicating that leptospira exposure could play a role in CKDu as a cause of primary kidney disease or a susceptible factor when secondary injury such as heat stress or dehydration aggravates kidney disease. Therefore, leptospirosis as an emerging culprit of CKDu deserves further in-depth investigation.",['Yang CW'],2018,138,2,Nephron,Yang CW.

28923024,Sero-epidemiology study of leptospirosis in febrile patients from Terai region of Nepal.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic strains of bacteria belonging to genus Leptospira whose symptoms can range from mild clinical manifestations to a severe life threatening illness. This disease may be under-recognized in resource poor settings like Nepal where many clinical laboratories lack appropriate equipment, technology and personnel for proper diagnosis.
METHODS: We used IgM ELISA to estimate the sero-prevalence of leptospirosis in a group of febrile patients in a western region of Nepal. We also tested for possible co-infection with two other common febrile diseases endemic to Nepal including dengue and typhoid fever.
RESULTS: Among samples from 144 febrile patients, 30 (21%) were positive for leptospiral IgM. In univariate analysis, leptospirosis was significantly associated with being of working age (p = 0.019), farming (p = 0.045) and water and animal contact (p = 0.0001). Widal and dengue serological study showed that the majority of leptospirosis infections did not have an alternative diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: As indicated by the study, regular surveillance of animal reservoirs in collaboration with veterinary department and inclusion of leptospirosis as a differential diagnosis of febrile illness is thus recommended based on the current findings.","['Regmi L', 'Pandey K', 'Malla M', 'Khanal S', 'Pandey BD']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Regmi L, et al.

METHODOLOGY: Based on parallel, population-based studies in two leptospirosis-endemic regions in Brazil, a real-time PCR assay which detects lipL32, a gene specifically present in pathogenic Leptospira, was assessed for the diagnostic effectiveness and accuracy. Patients identified by active hospital-based surveillance in Salvador and Curitiba during large urban leptospirosis epidemics were tested. Real-time PCR reactions were performed with DNA-extracted samples obtained from 127 confirmed and 23 unconfirmed cases suspected of leptospirosis, 122 patients with an acute febrile illness other than leptospirosis, and 60 healthy blood donors.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The PCR assay had a limit of detection of 280 Leptospira genomic equivalents/mL. Sensitivity for confirmed cases was 61% for whole blood and 29% for serum samples. Sensitivity was higher (86%) for samples collected within the first 6 days after onset of illness compared to those collected after 7 days (34%). The real-time PCR assay was able to detect leptospiral DNA in blood from 56% of serological non-confirmed cases. The overall specificity of the assay was 99%.

In Mozambique, the disease is largely ignored and its epidemiology is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of leptospirosis in febrile patients.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed between July 2012 and September 2015 among febrile patients. A total of 373 paired serum samples were drawn from febrile patients; 208 were from Caia District Hospital (rural setting) in Sofala Province and 165 were from Polana Caniço General Hospital (suburban setting) in Maputo City. Samples were initially screened using an in-house ELISA for IgM and IgG antibodies. Double positive samples were confirmed using a microagglutination test (MAT).
RESULTS: Of the 373 febrile patients, five (1.3%) had acute leptospirosis (MAT ≥400) and 38 (10.2%) had a presumptive infection (IgM-positive/MAT <400). While most of the patients with a presumptive infection lived in the rural setting (84.2%, 32/38), the majority of patients with acute infections (60%, 3/5) and with negative results (60.3%, 199/330) lived in the suburban setting (p=0.000).

Four out of the five patients (80%) with acute leptospirosis were treated with antimalarial drugs although malaria results were negative. The prevailing serogroup, according to MAT results, was Australis (40%; 4/10), followed by Icterohaemorrhagiae (30%, 3/10).

Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park.","['Desvars-Larrive A', 'Pascal M', 'Gasqui P', 'Cosson JF', 'Benoît E', 'Lattard V', 'Crespin L', 'Lorvelec O', 'Pisanu B', 'Teynié A', 'Vayssier-Taussat M', 'Bonnet S', 'Marianneau P', 'Lacôte S', 'Bourhy P', 'Berny P', 'Pavio N', 'Le Poder S', 'Gilot-Fromont E', 'Jourdain E', 'Hammed A', 'Fourel I', 'Chikh F', ""Vourc'h G""]",2017,12,9,PLoS One,"Desvars-Larrive A, et al.

The vaccines that are currently available for leptospirosis are composed of whole-cell preparations and suffer from limitations such as low efficacy, multiple side-effects, poor immunological memory and lack of cross-protection against different serovars of Leptospira spp. In light of the global prevalence of this disease, the development of a more effective vaccine against leptospirosis is of paramount importance. Genetic immunization is a promising alternative to conventional vaccine development. In the last 25years, several novel strategies have been developed for increasing the efficacy of DNA vaccines. Examples of such strategies include the introduction of novel plasmid vectors, adjuvants, alternate delivery routes, and prime-boost regimens. Herein we discuss the latest and most promising advances that have been made in developing DNA vaccines against leptospirosis. We also deliberate over the future directions that must be undertaken in order to improve results in this field.","['Silveira MM', 'Oliveira TL', 'Schuch RA', 'McBride AJA', 'Dellagostin OA', 'Hartwig DD']",2017,35,42,Vaccine,"Silveira MM, et al.

28879600,Infections and the kidney: a tale from the tropics.,"Tropical infections are caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses and parasitic organisms across varying geographical regions and are more often reported in adults than in children. Most of the infections are acute, presenting as a febrile illness with involvement of multiple organ systems, including the kidney. The gamut of renal manifestations extends from asymptomatic urinary abnormalities to acute kidney injury and-albeit rarely-chronic kidney disease. Tropical infections can involve the glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular compartments of the kidney. Leptospirosis, malaria, dengue, rickettsial fever and schistosomiasis are the most prevalent tropical infections which affect the kidneys of children living in the tropics. In this review we discuss renal involvement in these most prevalent tropical infections.","['Kamath N', 'Iyengar A']",2018,33,8,Pediatr Nephrol,Kamath N and Iyengar A.

28873022,"Seroprevalence of Leptospirosis, Brucellosis, and Q Fever in a Wild Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) Population Kept in a Fenced Reserve in Absence of Contact with Livestock.","Wildlife health is of interest for public and animal health because wild animals have been identified as important sentinels for the surveillance for zoonotic pathogens. This work investigated Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, and Leptospira spp. infection seroprevalence in a free-ranging red deer population. The study was conducted in a fenced reserve with controlled hunting activity in central Spain with animals that did not have any contact with livestock. Sampling was performed at two time points before and 5 years after the implementation of new management measures, including a reduction in the red deer population in the reserve. In addition, the presence of Leptospira DNA was tested in placental and fetal samples from seropositive pregnant animals. Antibodies against Brucella and Coxiella were not detected in any sample. The seroprevalence of Leptospira was 9.4% (13/137) in the first sampling for serovars Canicola and Panama. Five years later, the prevalence rose to 38.5% (97/252) with Pomona, the only serovar detected. Animals older than 2 years (50%; 70/140) were more likely to be Pomona seropositive than animals ≤2 years old (25.2%; 27/107; p < 0.001). Leptospira DNA was not detected in any sample tested. In conclusion, wild red deer in this area without contact with livestock seem not to play an important role in Brucella spp. and C. burnetii maintenance. The high seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. serogroup Pomona could indicate a risk for people with narrow contact with these animals, but the carrier status was not assessed. Consequently, it is unknown if red deer would represent a risk for human infection. Considering that wild boar could be the source of infection to red deer, the role of wild boar in the spread of leptospirosis and the risk for human infection should be investigated.","['San-Miguel Ayanz JM', 'Garcia-Peña FJ', 'García-Lunar P', 'Ortega-Mora LM', 'Ruano MJ', 'Álvarez-García G', 'Collantes-Fernández E']",2017,17,10,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"San-Miguel Ayanz JM, et al.

METHOD: A total of 140 urine samples were collected from trapped rats. These samples were cultured in EMJH enriched media and 18 of these samples (12.9%) were found to be positive when observed under x40 by dark field microscope. Genomic DNA was extracted from all the 18 native isolates for PCR.
RESULT: All the 18 isolates generated the expected 786 base pair band when the set of primers known to amplify LipL32 gene were utilized. These results showed that the primers were suitable to be used for the identification of pathogenic leptospira from the 18 rat samples.
CONCLUSION: The sequencing of the PCR products and BLAST analysis performed on each representative isolates confirmed the pathogenic status of all these native isolates as the LipL32 gene was detected in all the Leptospira isolates. This indicates that the rats are carriers of the pathogenic leptospira in the study area, and therefore are of public health importance.","['Latifah I', 'Abdul Halim A', 'Rahmat MS', 'Nadia MF', 'Ubil ZE', 'Asmah H', 'Shafariatul Akmar I', 'Picardeau M', 'Siti Haslina O', 'Nasir MA']",2017,39,2,Malays J Pathol,"Latifah I, et al.

33592917,Review on severity markers in leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the pathogenic strains of Leptospira. Outbreaks of leptospirosis have been reported following water sports events and floods particularly in men. The symptoms range from mild acute febrile illness to severe form with multi organ failure. Severe leptospirosis increases the likelihood of mortality and may require medical interventions in the form of dialysis and/or mechanical ventilation. It is important to predict severe leptospirosis to optimize medical care since non-severe patients reported to progress to severe form during the immune phase of the illness. The exaggerated host immune response causing endothelial and organ damages was shown to be associated with disease severity and mortality. This review presents the association of immune and endothelial activation markers, biochemical and genetic markers with disease severity in leptospirosis.","['Jumat MI', 'John DV']",2017,34,3,Trop Biomed,Jumat MI and John DV.

28857412,Epidemiological and clinical features of leptospirosis in a highly endemic area over three time periods.,"OBJECTIVES: To present the features of human leptospirosis over three time periods (1970-1975; 2000-2005; 2010-2015), to compare the collected data and to determine whether the incidence, seasonal and spatial distribution, prevalence of presumptive infective serogroups and clinical features have changed over the last 50 years.
METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical data obtained from patients hospitalised and treated in a well-known endemic focus of leptospirosis, Koprivnica-Križevci County in Croatia, were analysed.
RESULTS: We observed a steady decline in the overall incidence of leptospirosis and a change in the patient age distribution, with the age ratio changing in favour of middle-aged and older patients. Although leptospirosis was most frequently diagnosed in August in all time periods, the number of cases increased in autumn. The most prevalent serogroup during the first and the second time period was Icterohaemorrhagiae, while in the third time period, the serogroup Australis prevailed. We also noted an increase in the number of severe clinical manifestations.
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective research demonstrates a continuous decline in the incidence of human leptospirosis in Croatia. The pattern of disease has changed from predominantly mild clinical forms observed in children to more severe clinical forms observed in middle-aged to older patients, especially those working in agriculture. Additional epidemiological changes included an increase in the number of cases during the autumn months and changes in prevailing serogroups. Statistical analysis revealed a significant relationship between the severity of the clinical picture, patient age and presumed sources of infection.","['Mišić-Majerus L', 'Habuš J', 'Štritof Z', 'Bujić N', 'Mađarić V', 'Kolaric-Sviben G', 'Vince S', 'Peršić Z', 'Turk N']",2017,22,11,Trop Med Int Health,"Mišić-Majerus L, et al.

28846678,Human leptospirosis in Seychelles: A prospective study confirms the heavy burden of the disease but suggests that rats are not the main reservoir.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira for which rats are considered as the main reservoir. Disease incidence is higher in tropical countries, especially in insular ecosystems. Our objectives were to determine the current burden of leptospirosis in Seychelles, a country ranking first worldwide according to historical data, to establish epidemiological links between animal reservoirs and human disease, and to identify drivers of transmission.
METHODS: A total of 223 patients with acute febrile symptoms of unknown origin were enrolled in a 12-months prospective study and tested for leptospirosis through real-time PCR, IgM ELISA and MAT. In addition, 739 rats trapped throughout the main island were investigated for Leptospira renal carriage. All molecularly confirmed positive samples were further genotyped.
RESULTS: A total of 51 patients fulfilled the biological criteria of acute leptospirosis, corresponding to an annual incidence of 54.6 (95% CI 40.7-71.8) per 100,000 inhabitants. Leptospira carriage in Rattus spp. was overall low (7.7%) but dramatically higher in Rattus norvegicus (52.9%) than in Rattus rattus (4.4%). Leptospira interrogans was the only detected species in both humans and rats, and was represented by three distinct Sequence Types (STs). Two were novel STs identified in two thirds of acute human cases while noteworthily absent from rats.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that human leptospirosis still represents a heavy disease burden in Seychelles. Genotype data suggests that rats are actually not the main reservoir for human disease. We highlight a rather limited efficacy of preventive measures so far implemented in Seychelles. This could result from ineffective control measures of excreting animal populations, possibly due to a misidentification of the main contaminating reservoir(s). Altogether, presented data stimulate the exploration of alternative reservoir animal hosts.","['Biscornet L', 'Dellagi K', 'Pagès F', 'Bibi J', 'de Comarmond J', 'Mélade J', 'Govinden G', 'Tirant M', 'Gomard Y', 'Guernier V', 'Lagadec E', 'Mélanie J', 'Rocamora G', 'Le Minter G', 'Jaubert J', 'Mavingui P', 'Tortosa P']",2017,11,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Biscornet L, et al.

28841659,Pre-treatment with Lactobacillus plantarum prevents severe pathogenesis in mice infected with Leptospira interrogans and may be associated with recruitment of myeloid cells.,"Recent estimates on global morbidity and mortality caused by Leptospirosis point to one million cases and almost 60,000 deaths a year worldwide, especially in resource poor countries. We analyzed how a commensal probiotic immunomodulator, Lactobacillus plantarum, affects Leptospira interrogans pathogenesis in a murine model of sub-lethal leptospirosis. We found that repeated oral pre-treatment of mice with live L. plantarum restored body weight to normal levels in mice infected with L. interrogans. Pre-treatment did not prevent L. interrogans access to the kidney but it affected the inflammatory response and it reduced histopathological signs of disease. Analysis of the immune cell profiles in lymphoid tissues of mice pre-treated with L. plantarum showed increased numbers of B cells as well as naïve and memory CD4+ helper T cell populations in uninfected mice that shifted towards increased numbers of effector CD4+ helper T in infected mice. CD8+ cytotoxic T cell profiles in pre-treated uninfected and infected mice mirrored the switch observed for CD4+ except that CD8+ memory T cells were not affected. In addition, pre-treatment led to increased populations of monocytes in lymphoid tissues of uninfected mice and to increased populations of macrophages in the same tissues of infected mice. Immunohistochemistry of kidney sections of pre-treated infected mice showed an enrichment of neutrophils and macrophages and a reduction of total leucocytes and T cells. Our results suggest that complex myeloid and T cell responses orchestrate the deployment of monocytes and other cells from lymphoid tissue and the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the kidney, and that, the presence of these cells in the target organ may be associated with reductions in pathogenesis observed in infected mice treated with L. plantarum.","['Potula HH', 'Richer L', 'Werts C', 'Gomes-Solecki M']",2017,11,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Potula HH, et al.

28830472,A process for developing multisectoral strategies for zoonoses: the case of leptospirosis in Fiji.,"BACKGROUND: Zoonotic diseases such as leptospirosis occur as a result of the often complex interactions that exist at the human-animal-environment interface. The most obvious consequence of this complexity is the need for the health sector to partner with institutions in other sectors of society such as agriculture, labour and local government. This multisectoral engagement is complicated by the different agendas and cultures of the various institutions and their ability to ""see"" their role and ant benefits in a collaborative response.
METHODS: The research used a realist review methodology combined with systems thinking frameworks to determine the optimal strategy and governance for the prevention and control of leptospirosis in Fiji. The process included facilitated workshops with multiple stakeholders to determine the needs, issues and potential interventions that was guided by a synthesis of locally available data and information on the impact of leptospirosis. This process was informed by interviews with bureaucrats from different government ministries.
RESULTS: Stakeholders concurred that leptospirosis generally only received wide-spread attention in outbreaks, when there is media coverage of deaths or a large number of hospitalisations. In general, all ministries expressed support for a multisectoral strategy but saw the Ministry of Health and Medical Services as the lead agency with overall responsibility. The final consultation workshop yielded a clearly articulated goal to reduce the case fatality rate attributable to leptospirosis by 50% by 2020 and 4 overarching strategies: 1) improved clinical management of leptospirosis, 2) improved surveillance for leptospirosis, 3) enhanced communication to minimise risk and improve health seeking behaviours, and 4) strengthening coordination and governance structures.
CONCLUSION: Human mortality and morbidity remained the primary drive for government action, defining leptospirosis as a human health problem. The process of deliberative consultation, and the engagement of multidisciplinary partners has provided a platform for collaborative policy development, and a consensus for a National Action Plan from which further negotiated collaboration will be possible.","['Reid SA', 'Rodney A', 'Kama M', 'Hill PS']",2017,17,1,BMC Public Health,"Reid SA, et al.

28823908,"Leptospirosis: Molecular trial path and immunopathogenesis correlated with dengue, malaria and mimetic hemorrhagic infections.","Immuno-pathogenesis of leptospirosis can be recounted well by following its trail path from entry to exit, while inducing disastrous damages in various tissues of the host. Dysregulated, inappropriate and excessive immune responses are unanimously blamed in fatal leptospirosis. The inherent abilities of the pathogen and inabilities of the host were debated targeting the severity of the disease. Hemorrhagic manifestation through various mechanisms leading to a fatal end is observed when this disease is unattended. The similar vascular destructions and hemorrhage manifestations are noted in infections with different microbes in endemic areas. The simultaneous infection in a host with more than one pathogen or parasite is referred as the coinfection. Notably, common endemic infections such as leptospirosis, dengue, chikungunya, and malaria, harbor favorable environments to flourish in similar climates, which is aggregated with stagnated water and aggravated with the poor personal and environmental hygiene of the inhabitants. These factors aid the spread of pathogens and parasites to humans and potential vectors, eventually leading to outbreaks of public health relevance. Malaria, dengue and chikungunya need mosquitoes as vectors, in contrast with leptospirosis, which directly invades human, although the environmental bacterial load is maintained through other mammals, such as rodents. The more complicating issue is that infections by different pathogens exhibiting similar symptoms but require different treatment management. The current review explores different pathogens expressing specific surface proteins and their ability to bind with array of host proteins with or without immune response to enter into the host tissues and their ability to evade the host immune responses to invade and their affinity to certain tissues leading to the common squeal of hemorrhage. Furthermore, at the host level, the increased susceptibility and inability of the host to arrest the pathogens' and parasites' spread in different tissues, various cytokines accumulated to eradicate the microorganisms and their cellular interactions, the antibody dependent defense and the susceptibility of individual organs bringing the manifestation of the diseases were explored. Lastly, we provided a discussion on the immune trail path of pathogenesis from entry to exit to narrate the similarities and dissimilarities among various hemorrhagic fevers mentioned above, in order to outline future possibilities of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of coinfections, with special reference to endemic areas.","['Priya SP', 'Sakinah S', 'Sharmilah K', 'Hamat RA', 'Sekawi Z', 'Higuchi A', 'Ling MP', 'Nordin SA', 'Benelli G', 'Kumar SS']",2017,176,,Acta Trop,"Priya SP, et al.

28805883,A novel objective chute score interacts with monensin to affect growth of receiving cattle.,"Growth in cattle may be related to animal temperament via alterations in intake or feed conversion. However, temperament is ill-defined, and different temperament measures may relate differently to production traits or interact with dietary factors in their effects. To examine relationships between diet, temperament, growth, and health, 160 crossbred steers (262 ± 22 kg) were used in a 56-d RCBD experiment with a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial treatment structure with 5 pens/treatment. Steers were pen fed a corn silage-based diet with or without monensin (41.9 g/t DM), ad libitum. Temperament treatments (assigned on d -7) were exit velocity (EV; slow vs. fast) and objective chute score (OCS; low vs. high), a novel temperament measure, representing the CV of weights collected at 5 measures/s for 10 s while an animal's head was restrained in a chute. Both were measured on d -7, 0, 14, 28, 55, and 56. Subjective chute scores (SCS; visual estimates of animal activity obtained simultaneously with OCS measures) were measured on d -7 and d 56. Jugular blood samples from d 28 were analyzed for antibody response to leptospirosis vaccine and NEFA concentrations. No monensin × OCS × EV interactions were detected ( ≥ 0.11). There was a positive correlation between SCS and OCS ( < 0.01; = 0.57). Changes in OCS and EV across the duration of the study differed among treatments (treatment × day, < 0.10) and indicated that initial measures may be better proxies of growth than average measures. There were no interactions between EV and OCS ( ≥ 0.15) for any response variable and no interactions among treatments ( ≥ 0.31), nor main effects of temperament factors ( ≥ 0.12) for DMI (%BW). Monensin decreased DMI ( < 0.01) similarly across all levels of EV and OCS. Gains and G:F responses to monensin depended on OCS ( < 0.10) but not EV ( ≥ 0.80). Gain was reduced ( < 0.10) by monensin with low, but not high, OCS, and G:F was increased ( < 0.10) by monensin on high, but not low, OCS. Gain during the second 4 wk was lesser ( = 0.04) in fast, compared with slow, EV animals. Results provide novel indications that certain temperament measures can interact with dietary manipulation to influence animal performance.","['Bruno KA', 'Vanzant ES', 'Altman AW', 'Kudupoje M', 'Vanzant KA', 'McLeod KR']",2017,95,8,J Anim Sci,"Bruno KA, et al.

28804053,Leptospirosis on captive wild animals in Latin America.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide bacterial infection, being more prevalent in tropical regions. Human beings, domestic animals and wildlife species are susceptible to a wide variety of serovars. Zoos have a great importance in keeping endangered species, increasing populations and accumulating knowledge on these species. Although some studies describe the occurrence of leptospirosis in captivity animals, a systematic review regarding the infection in these animals in tropical areas has never been conducted. Thus, the objective of this study was to systematically gather and analyze data regarding leptospirosis among captive wild animals in Latin America. A total of 141 species were studied, 93 genus, 44 families and 15 orders from three classes. Median seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 52% and predominant serogroups were Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae for mammalian, and Sejroe for reptiles. One important outcome is that, when kept on zoos, wildlife is more frequently infected by incidental strains instead of adapted strains. Preventive measures should consider periodic serosurvey of all animal species in captivity, as well as the use of commercial vaccines to reduce leptospiral infection and its hazards.","['Vieira AS', 'Lilenbaum W']",2017,115,,Res Vet Sci,Vieira AS and Lilenbaum W.

In addition, two human cases that occurred in May and October of 2009 in the city were also reported. A 67-year-old woman recovered after antibiotic treatment, whereas a 71-year-old woman did not survive. The weather during both of those times was notable for a violent cloudburst that caused street flooding. For the past several years, the incidence of leptospirosis has remained steady at 9 human cases every 10 years across the entire island of Sicily, with a population of almost 5 million inhabitants. The high prevalence of leptospirosis in rodents and the simultaneous presence of known risk factors, such as a mild/wet climate, street flooding and garbage accumulation, could explain the two cases of leptospirosis within the same city in the same year. This occurrence should raise awareness of this under-estimated zoonosis among public health authorities, especially given the potential fatality among elderly and immune-compromised individuals in urban settings in developed countries.","['Vitale M', 'Agnello S', 'Chetta M', 'Amato B', 'Vitale G', 'Bella CD', 'Vicari D', 'Presti VDML']",2018,11,2,J Infect Public Health,"Vitale M, et al.

28799306,Scrub Typhus - The Most Common Cause of Febrile Jaundice in a Tertiary Care Hospital of Himalayan State.,"BACKGROUND: Most common cause of jaundice in south east Asia is of infective etiology. Combination of fever with jaundice can cause diagnostic problem as this duo is present in many infective diseases. Timely diagnosis by simple laboratory investigations can save a lot of time and prevent morbidity and mortality. Our main aim was to determine the most common etiology of infectious jaundice in a tertiary care hospital of Himalayan state and to study their clinical profile.
METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective observational study done in one year. All the patients more than 18 years of age presenting with jaundice with bilirubin >1.5mg/dl were taken. The clinical profile was observed and investigations for etiology were done.
RESULTS: Total number of patients studied were 170. Maximum number of patients were 50 (39.4%) in age group less than 30 years and females outnumbered males with 1.8:1 ratio (64.7% v/s 35.3%). Fever was the most common presenting complaint in 127 (74.7%) patients and most common etiology was scrub typhus with 103 patients (60.6%) followed by hepatitis E in 36 patients (21.2%) and leptospirosis in 9 patients (5.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus is the commonest cause of febrile jaundice in Himachal Pradesh. The general physicians should be sensitized for the early diagnosis to reduce mortality.","['Mokta J', 'Yadav R', 'Mokta K', 'Panda P', 'Ranjan A']",2017,65,8,J Assoc Physicians India,"Mokta J, et al.

28794687,Prevalence and risk factors associated with lymphatic filariasis in American Samoa after mass drug administration.,"BACKGROUND: In 2000, American Samoa had 16.5% prevalence of lymphatic filariasis (LF) antigenemia. Annual mass drug administration (MDA) was conducted using single-dose albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine from 2000 to 2006. This study presents the results of a 2007 population-based PacELF C-survey in all ages and compares the adult filarial antigenemia results of this survey to those of a subsequent 2010 survey in adults with the aim of improving understanding of LF transmission after MDA.
RESULTS: The 2007 C-survey used simple random sampling of households from a geolocated list. In 2007, the overall LF antigen prevalence by immunochromatographic card test (ICT) for all ages was 2.29% (95% CI 1.66-3.07). Microfilaremia prevalence was 0.27% (95% CI 0.09-0.62). Increasing age (OR 1.04 per year, 95% CI 1.02-1.05) was significantly associated with ICT positivity on multivariate analysis, while having ever taking MDA was protective (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.96). The 2010 survey used a similar spatial sampling design. The overall adult filarial antigenemia prevalence remained relatively stable between the surveys at 3.32% (95% CI 2.44-4.51) by ICT in 2007 and 3.23 (95% CI 2.21-4.69) by Og4C3 antigen in 2010. However, there were changes in village-level prevalence. Eight village/village groupings had antigen-positive individuals identified in 2007 but not in 2010, while three villages/village groupings that had no antigen-positive individuals identified in 2007 had positive individuals identified in 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: After 7 years of MDA, with four rounds achieving effective coverage, a representative household survey in 2007 showed a decline in prevalence from 16.5 to 2.3% in all ages. However, lack of further decline in adult prevalence by 2010 and fluctuation at the village level showed that overall antigenemia prevalence at a broader scale may not provide an accurate reflection of ongoing transmission at the village level.","['Coutts SP', 'King JD', ""Pa'au M"", 'Fuimaono S', 'Roth J', 'King MR', 'Lammie PJ', 'Lau CL', 'Graves PM']",2017,45,,Trop Med Health,"Coutts SP, et al.

28750011,Leptospira interrogans causes quantitative and morphological disturbances in adherens junctions and other biological groups of proteins in human endothelial cells.,"Pathogenic Leptospira transmits from animals to humans, causing the zoonotic life-threatening infection called leptospirosis. This infection is reported worldwide with higher risk in tropical regions. Symptoms of leptospirosis range from mild illness to severe illness such as liver damage, kidney failure, respiratory distress, meningitis, and fatal hemorrhagic disease. Invasive species of Leptospira rapidly disseminate to multiple tissues where this bacterium damages host endothelial cells, increasing vascular permeability. Despite the burden in humans and animals, the pathogenic mechanisms of Leptospira infection remain to be elucidated. The pathogenic leptospires adhere to endothelial cells and permeabilize endothelial barriers in vivo and in vitro. In this study, human endothelial cells were infected with the pathogenic L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni or the saprophyte L. biflexa serovar Patoc to investigate morphological changes and other distinctive phenotypes of host cell proteins by fluorescence microscopy. Among those analyzed, 17 proteins from five biological classes demonstrated distinctive phenotypes in morphology and/or signal intensity upon infection with Leptospira. The affected biological groups include: 1) extracellular matrix, 2) intercellular adhesion molecules and cell surface receptors, 3) intracellular proteins, 4) cell-cell junction proteins, and 5) a cytoskeletal protein. Infection with the pathogenic strain most profoundly disturbed the biological structures of adherens junctions (VE-cadherin and catenins) and actin filaments. Our data illuminate morphological disruptions and reduced signals of cell-cell junction proteins and filamentous actin in L. interrogans-infected endothelial cells. In addition, Leptospira infection, regardless of pathogenic status, influenced other host proteins belonging to multiple biological classes. Our data suggest that this zoonotic agent may damage endothelial cells via multiple cascades or pathways including endothelial barrier damage and inflammation, potentially leading to vascular hyperpermeability and severe illness in vivo. This work provides new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of Leptospira infection.","['Sato H', 'Coburn J']",2017,11,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,Sato H and Coburn J.

28743546,Human and animal leptospirosis in Southern Brazil: A five-year retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis attributed to multiple reservoirs. Climatic conditions influence the transmission of pathogenic leptospires, which require warm and humid conditions for survival. The influence of seasonality in human and animal leptospirosis in the subtropical region of Brazil remains poorly understood.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to describe the patterns of human and animal exposure to leptospirosis and their association with precipitation events in Southern Brazil. Rainfall data were obtained from satellite images. Serum samples were tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT); samples with titer ≥ 100 were defined as seroreactive. Linear regression and Pearson's correlation were performed to assess whether there is a relationship between these variables.
RESULTS: We found that precipitation events were not significantly associated with the exposure to leptospirosis in humans or animal species, except for dogs. The interspecies analysis revealed an association between canine and human exposure to leptospirosis. Leptospira kirschneri serovar Butembo (serogroup Autumnalis) presented the highest seroreactivity in humans.
CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights in human and animal leptospirosis in Southern Brazil. These insights will be essential to design intervention measures directed to reduce disease dissemination.","['Jorge S', 'Schuch RA', 'de Oliveira NR', 'da Cunha CEP', 'Gomes CK', 'Oliveira TL', 'Rizzi C', 'Qadan AF', 'Pacce VD', 'Coelho Recuero AL', 'Soares Brod C', 'Dellagostin OA']",2017,18,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Jorge S, et al.

A large spectrum of asymptomatic animal hosts can carry the infection and contribute to the burden of human disease. Environmental sources of human contamination also point to the importance of a hydrotelluric reservoir. Leptospirosis can be caused by as many as 15 different pathogenic or intermediate Leptospira species. However, classification of these bacteria remains complicated through the use of both serological and genetic classification systems that show poor correlation. With the advent of molecular techniques, DNA-based barcoding offers a conceptual framework that can be used for leptospirosis surveillance as well as source tracking.

28704385,Immunoprotective properties of recombinant LigA and LigB in a hamster model of acute leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis and is considered a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, there is no widely available vaccine against leptospirosis for use in humans. A purified, recombinant subunit vaccine that includes the last six immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains of the leptospiral protein LigA (LigA7'-13) protects against lethal infection but not renal colonization after challenge by Leptospira interrogans. In this study, we examined whether the addition of the first seven Ig-like domains of LigB (LigB0-7) to LigA7'-13, can enhance immune protection and confer sterilizing immunity in the Golden Syrian hamster model of acute leptospirosis. Hamsters were subcutaneously immunized with soluble, recombinant LigA7'-13, LigB0-7, or a combination of LigA7'-13 and LigB0-7 in Freund's adjuvant. Immunization with Lig proteins generated a strong humoral immune response with high titers of IgG that recognized homologous protein, and cross-reacted with the heterologous protein as assessed by ELISA. LigA7'-13 alone, or in combination with LigB0-7, protected all hamsters from intraperitoneal challenge with a lethal dose of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130. However, bacteria were recovered from the kidneys of all animals. Of eight animals immunized with LigB0-7, only three survived Leptospira challenge, one of which lacked renal colonization and had antibodies to native LigB by immunoblot. In addition, sera from two of the three LigB0-7 immunized survivors cross-reacted with LigA11-13, a region of LigA that is sufficient for protection. In summary, we confirmed that LigA7'-13 protects hamsters from death but not infection, and immunization with LigB0-7, either alone or in combination with LigA7'-13, did not confer sterilizing immunity.","['Evangelista KV', 'Lourdault K', 'Matsunaga J', 'Haake DA']",2017,12,7,PLoS One,"Evangelista KV, et al.

28700741,Mononuclear-macrophages but not neutrophils act as major infiltrating anti-leptospiral phagocytes during leptospirosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the major infiltrating phagocytes during leptospirosis and examine the killing mechanism used by the host to eliminate Leptospira interrogans.
METHODS: Major infiltrating phagocytes in Leptospira-infected C3H/HeJ mice were detected by immunohistochemistry. Chemokines and vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules (VECAMs) of Leptospira-infected mice and leptospirosis patients were detected by microarray and immunohistochemistry. Leptospira-phagocytosing and -killing abilities of human or mouse macrophages and neutrophils, and the roles of intracellular ROS, NO and [Ca2+]i in Leptospira-killing process were evaluated by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorimetry.
RESULTS: Peripheral blood mononuclear-macrophages rather than neutrophils were the main infiltrating phagocytes in the lungs, liver and kidneys of infected mice. Levels of macrophage- but not neutrophil-specific chemokines and VECAMs were significantly increased in the samples from infected mice and patients. All macrophages tested had a higher ability than neutrophils to phagocytose and kill leptospires. Higher ROS and NO levels and [Ca2+]i in the macrophages were involved in killing leptospires. Human macrophages displayed more phagolysosome formation and a stronger leptospire-killing ability to than mouse macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: Mononuclear-macrophages but not neutrophils represent the main infiltrating and anti-leptospiral phagocytes during leptospirosis.

28700685,Characterization of the molecular chaperone ClpB from the pathogenic spirochaete Leptospira interrogans.,"Leptospira interrogans is a spirochaete responsible for leptospirosis in mammals. The molecular mechanisms of the Leptospira virulence remain mostly unknown. Recently, it has been demonstrated that an AAA+ chaperone ClpB (a member of the Hsp100 family) from L. interrogans (ClpBLi) is not only essential for survival of Leptospira under the thermal and oxidative stresses, but also during infection of a host. The aim of this study was to provide further insight into the role of ClpB in the pathogenic spirochaetes and explore its biochemical properties. We found that a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, ATPγS, but not AMP-PNP induces the formation of ClpBLi hexamers and stabilizes the associated form of the chaperone. ADP also induces structural changes in ClpBLi and promotes its self-assembly, but does not produce full association into the hexamers. We also demonstrated that ClpBLi exhibits a weak ATPase activity that is stimulated by κ-casein and poly-lysine, and may mediate protein disaggregation independently from the DnaK chaperone system. Unexpectedly, the presence of E. coli DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE did not significantly affect the disaggregation activity of ClpBLi and ClpBLi did not substitute for the ClpBEc function in the clpB-null E. coli strain. This result underscores the species-specificity of the ClpB cooperation with the co-chaperones and is most likely due to a loss of interactions between the ClpBLi middle domain and the E. coli DnaK. We also found that ClpBLi interacts more efficiently with the aggregated G6PDH in the presence of ATPγS rather than ATP. Our results indicate that ClpB's importance during infection might be due to its role as a molecular chaperone involved in reactivation of protein aggregates.","['Krajewska J', 'Modrak-Wójcik A', 'Arent ZJ', 'Więckowski D', 'Zolkiewski M', 'Bzowska A', 'Kędzierska-Mieszkowska S']",2017,12,7,PLoS One,"Krajewska J, et al.

Studies of the prevalence of these NTD-causing zoonotic pathogens, in house mice and black rats from tropical residential areas are scarce. Three hundred and two house mice and 161 black rats were trapped in 2013 from two urban neighbourhoods and a rural village in Yucatan, Mexico, and subsequently tested for Trypanosoma cruzi, Hymenolepis diminuta and Leptospira interrogans. Using the polymerase chain reaction we detected T. cruzi DNA in the hearts of 4·9% (8/165) and 6·2% (7/113) of house mice and black rats, respectively. We applied the sedimentation technique to detect eggs of H. diminuta in 0·5% (1/182) and 14·2% (15/106) of house mice and black rats, respectively. Through the immunofluorescent imprint method, L. interrogans was identified in 0·9% (1/106) of rat kidney impressions. Our results suggest that the black rat could be an important reservoir for T. cruzi and H. diminuta in the studied sites.

28686648,Increased levels of soluble forms of E-selectin and ICAM-1 adhesion molecules during human leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a multisystemic zoonotic disease with infiltration of visceral organs by Leptospira. The capacity of the vascular endothelium to grant immune cell recruitment and activation in target organs during the disease course remains poorly characterized. We ascertained the levels of expression of several soluble cell adhesion molecules (CAM) notably expressed by endothelial cells in human leptospirosis. We prospectively enrolled 20 hospitalized patients and compared them to 10 healthy controls. Disease severity was defined by one or more organ failures, or death. Plasmatic concentrations of soluble CAM were assessed by multiplex bead assay at the time of patient presentation (M0) and 1 month after hospital discharge. The levels of soluble E-selectin (sCD62E) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1, sCD53) were significantly increased in patients compared to controls (p<0.0001) and at 1 month (p<0.0001) with median values at 978 ng/ml (interquartile ranges 787-1164; sCD62E) and 1021 ng/ml (690-1428; sCD53). At M0, Soluble P-selectin level (sCD62P) was found to be decreased with levels at 60 ng/ml (0-631) versus 711 ng/ml (343-1113) for healthy controls (p<0.05). Levels of sICAM-3 (sCD50), sVCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule, sCD106) and sPECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, sCD31) were not different from healthy subjects at M0. This study shows that two adhesion molecules, shed as soluble forms, are elevated during the acute phase of leptospirosis: E-selectin and s-ICAM1. These molecules may interfere with the process of immune cell recruitment to clear Leptospira at tissue levels.","['Raffray L', 'Giry C', 'Thirapathi Y', 'Reboux AH', 'Jaffar-Bandjee MC', 'Gasque P']",2017,12,7,PLoS One,"Raffray L, et al.

28681816,"Clinical and laboratory profile of dengue viral infections in and around Mangalore, India.","BACKGROUND: Dengue (DEN) is being recognised as the world's major emerging tropical disease. Clinically, DEN may resemble other infections such as malaria, leptospirosis, and typhoid, and thus, laboratory investigations are required for definitive diagnosis. Secondary DEN infection, caused most often by dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 2 and 3, is known to present with severe disease manifestations. This study was undertaken to examine the clinical and laboratory profile of DEN viral infections and to determine the circulating serotypes in and around Mangalore, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 285 clinically suspected cases of DEN in and around Mangalore between September 2013 and January 2014 were processed for detection of DEN IgM and IgG antibodies and nonstructural 1 (NS1) antigen using commercial ELISA kits. Detection of DEN viral RNA and serotyping was done by multiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The clinical and haematological profiles of the patients were analysed.
RESULTS: Serum samples from 83 (29%) patients were positive for DEN NS1 antigen and/or IgM antibodies. 33 (45%) out of 73 serum samples processed by multiplex real-time RT-PCR were positive for DEN viral RNA. DEN-1, -2 and -3 were the serotypes identified in this study. Fever was the most common presenting symptom followed by myalgia/arthralgia. Majority of the patients had thrombocytopaenia.
CONCLUSION: Early detection of DEN can be achieved effectively using NS1 ELISA and IgM capture ELISA. Circulating DENV serotypes should be closely monitored for prevention of fatal outcomes in secondary infections.","['Damodar T', 'Dias M', 'Mani R', 'Shilpa KA', 'Anand AM', 'Ravi V', 'Tiewsoh J']",2017,35,2,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Damodar T, et al.

Association between the frequency of specimens positive for Leptospira spp. and sex, age, bat species or family, season of collection, geographic localization and feeding habits was evaluated. The results showed that 39.13% of analyzed bats were found positive for Leptospira spp. Nine bat species had at least one positive result. There was no association among the evaluated variables and frequency of pathogenic Leptospira spp. Although the limitations due to lack of Leptospira spp. isolation, leptospiral carriage was demonstrated in bats of different species from southern Brazil, which reinforces the need for surveillance of infectious agents in wild animals.","['Mayer FQ', 'Dos Reis EM', 'Bezerra AVA', 'Cerva C', 'Rosa J', 'Cibulski SP', 'Lima FES', 'Pacheco SM', 'Rodrigues RO']",2017,52,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Mayer FQ, et al.

30183862,[The role of rodents in the transmission of Leptospira spp. in swine farms].,"Different species of rodents are potential transmitters of multiple zoonotic agents such as Leptospira spp., a spirochete that causes leptospirosis. This is an infectious disease that has a negative impact on pig production because it generates large productive, reproductive and economic losses. In swine farms, the most common rodent species are house mice (Mus musculus), brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and black rats (Rattus rattus), which act as maintenance hosts for different serovars of Leptospira, contaminating the environment, food and water through urine, and putting human and animal health at risk. For this reason, the objective of this article is to describe the role of rodents in the transmission of Leptospira in swine farms. For this purpose, a bibliographic search was carried out in different databases such as Science Direct, Scopus, Redalyc, PubMed and SciELO. The results of the literature review show that there are few studies that report the importance of rodents in the transmission of Leptospira in swine farms. The onset of the disease depends to a large extent on the presence, contact and control of rodents in farms, although environmental factors, agent survival and hygiene, among others, must also be considered.","['Ospina-Pinto C', 'Rincón-Pardo M', 'Soler-Tovar D', 'Hernández-Rodríguez P']",2017,19,4,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota),"Ospina-Pinto C, et al.

28665952,Intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to pathogen infection in wild small mammals in intensive milk cattle and swine production systems.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the ecological processes that are involved in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens by small mammals may aid adequate and effective management measures. Few attempts have been made to analyze the ecological aspects that influence pathogen infection in small mammals in livestock production systems. We describe the infection of small mammals with Leptospira spp., Brucella spp., Trichinella spp. and Cysticercus fasciolaris and assess the related intrinsic and extrinsic factors in livestock production systems in central Argentina at the small mammal community, population and individual levels.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ten pig farms and eight dairy farms were studied by removal trapping of small mammals from 2008 to 2011. Each farm was sampled seasonally over the course of one year with cage and Sherman live traps. The 505 small mammals captured (14,359 trap-nights) included three introduced murine rodents, four native rodents and two opossums. Leptospira spp., anti-Brucella spp. antibodies and Trichinella spp. were found in the three murine rodents and both opossums. Rattus norvegicus was also infected with C. fasciolaris; Akodon azarae and Oligoryzomys flavescens with Leptospira spp.; anti-Brucella spp. antibodies were found in A. azarae. Two or more pathogens occurred simultaneously on 89% of the farms, and each pathogen was found on at least 50% of the farms. Pathogen infections increased with host abundance. Infection by Leptospira spp. also increased with precipitation and during warm seasons. The occurrence of anti-Brucella spp. antibodies was higher on dairy farms and during the winter and summer. The host abundances limit values, from which farms are expected to be free of the studied pathogens, are reported.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Murine rodents maintain pathogens within farms, whereas other native species are likely dispersing pathogens among farms. Hence, we recommend preventing and controlling murines in farm dwellings and isolating farms from their surroundings to avoid contact with other wild mammals.","['Lovera R', 'Fernández MS', 'Jacob J', 'Lucero N', 'Morici G', 'Brihuega B', 'Farace MI', 'Caracostantogolo J', 'Cavia R']",2017,11,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lovera R, et al.

The sample size was 325 reproductive age cows, 11 canine samples, and 20 humans. The samples were subjected to MAT analysis with 11 serogroups of Leptospira interrogans sensu lato. Once the MAT results were received, urine samples were collected from 78 cows, along with 39 water samples, for bacteriological cultures and PCR for the 16S rRNA gene in L. interrogans sensu lato. Positive PCR samples were sequenced to determine the possible genome species. The leptospirosis seroprevalence was 74.5% in the cattle, 70.0% in the dogs, and 45.5% in the humans. Although isolation was not achieved, L. interrogans sensu lato was detected by PCR in three urine samples and in a sample of wastewater. The sequencing confirmed the circulation of pathogenic species. The high prevalence of antibodies for L. interrogans sensu lato and the molecular evidence led to the inference that the rural areas of Ciénaga de Oro are endemic and that cattle can act as renal carriers and contaminate water sources, which increases the risk of contracting leptospirosis.","['Ensuncho-Hoyos C', 'Rodríguez-Rodríguez V', 'Pérez-Doria A', 'Vergara O', 'Calderón-Rangel A']",2017,49,7,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Ensuncho-Hoyos C, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospectively collected data was prospectively studied for clinical and laboratory data of leptospirosis patients proven by raised IgM titres by ELISA on day 2 (counted from day of admission of patient to hospital) of unexplained fever. The changes in complete blood counts from admission upto the discharge of the patient were studied. SPSS version 13 (SPSS Inc. Chicago) was used for data analysis. The collected data was analysed using frequency, percentage, mean, median, standard deviation and Mann-Whitney test. A p-value less than 0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS: Mean haemoglobin concentration showed a progressive decline (<12.5 gm/dl) from day 1 to day 7 in both mild and severe disease. Platelet counts were significantly low (p=0.002), (<1,50,000 cells/mm

Our experimental design was composed by two randomized groups: Infected Group (IG) (n = 12) and control group (CG) (n = 6). Ninety-six hours after the inoculation, the presence of immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) and complement C3 levels, related to erythrocytes and platelets, was assessed. Platelet's microparticles marked by CD61, reticulocytes and reticulated platelets were also quantified. Additionally, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, partially activated thromboplastin time and sera levels of IgG and IgM were assessed. Our results showed that levels of platelet decreased in IG (P < 0.001); as well as, there was presence of IgG and C3 associated with erythrocyte surface in the infected animals (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). Levels of prothrombin time and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time were increased, while fibrinogen level was decreased (P < 0.01) in IG. CD61 microparticles were higher (P < 0.05) in IG due to platelet activation. Thus, it was established a positive correlation (P < 0.01) between platelets count and fibrinogen (Figure 3, R = 0.84, P < 0.001).

28644889,Evaluation of different serological assays for early diagnosis of leptospirosis in Martinique (French West Indies).,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a potentially life-threatening but curable zoonosis whose prognosis depends on accurate and timely diagnosis. Because of its non-specific clinical presentation, laboratory testing is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Here, we aimed to assess the performance of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (ELISA Serion and ELISA-Hb Pasteur) and one immunodot (GenBio) using quantitative PCR (qPCR) as gold standard, instead of the traditional microscopic agglutination test, for the diagnosis of acute leptospirosis in an endemic area.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Between January 2011 and December 2012, a total of 122 patients were diagnosed with leptospirosis, as confirmed by qPCR at the University Hospital of Martinique. Among them, 103 had at least one serum sample available for analysis. Performance of each serological assay was evaluated according to days' post onset of symptoms (DPO) and local species diversity (which included L. santarosai, L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, L. borgpetersenii, L. noguchii, and L. kmetyi). Several thresholds were tested to optimize accuracy. When considering the manufacturer's threshold, the sensitivity of ELISA Serion, ELISA-Hb Pasteur and GenBio immunodot was 75%, 67% and 64%, while specificity was 92%, 98% and 100%, respectively. Moreover, the threshold optimization allowed a significant improvement in specificity for the ELISA Serion from 92% to 99% (p<0.05). During the first 5 DPO, sensitivities were 35%, 30% and 42% for ELISA Serion, ELISA-Hb Pasteur and GenBio immunodot, respectively. However, between 6─10 DPO, these sensitivities dramatically increased to reach 86%, 76% and 67%, respectively. Performances of the three assays were not affected by the species studied.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: All these serological assays showed the potential for diagnosing leptospirosis after (but not before) 6 days' post onset of symptoms. In a high prevalence setting, where highest specificities are needed, threshold optimizing should be performed for this purpose.","['Courdurie C', 'Le Govic Y', 'Bourhy P', 'Alexer D', 'Pailla K', 'Theodose R', 'Cesaire R', 'Rosine J', 'Hochedez P', 'Olive C']",2017,11,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Courdurie C, et al.

28619055,Molecular typing of Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo isolates from leptospirosis outbreaks in Brazilian livestock.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira spp. This zoonotic disease is distributed globally and affects domestic animals, including cattle. Leptospira interrogans serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo and Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo remain important species associated with this reproductive disease in livestock production. Previous studies on Brazilian livestock have reported that L. interrogans serovar Hardjo is the most prevalent leptospiral agent in this country and is related to clinical signs of leptospirosis, which lead to economic losses in production. Here, we described the isolation of three clinical strains (Norma, Lagoa and Bolivia) obtained from leptospirosis outbreaks that occurred in Minas Gerais state in 1994 and 2008.
RESULTS: Serological and molecular typing using housekeeping (secY and 16SrRNA) and rfb locus (ORF22 and ORF36) genes were applied for the identification and comparative analysis of Leptospira spp. Our results identified the three isolates as L. interrogans serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo and confirmed the occurrence of this bacterial strain in Brazilian livestock. Genetic analysis using ORF22 and ORF36 grouped the Leptospira into serogroup Sejroe and subtype Hardjoprajitno. Genetic approaches were also applied to compare distinct serovars of L. interrogans strains by verifying the copy numbers of the IS1500 and IS1533 insertion sequences (ISs). The IS1500 copy number varied among the analyzed L. interrogans strains.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that L. interrogans serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo subtype Hardjoprajitno causes bovine leptospirosis in Brazilian production. The molecular results suggested that rfb locus (ORF22 and ORF36) could improve epidemiological studies by allowing the identification of Leptospira spp. at the serogroup level. Additionally, the IS1500 and IS1533 IS copy number analysis suggested distinct genomic features among closely related leptospiral strains.","['Cosate MRV', 'Sakamoto T', 'de Oliveira Mendes TA', 'Moreira ÉC', 'Regis da Silva CG', 'Brasil BSAF', 'Oliveira CSF', 'de Azevedo VA', 'Ortega JM', 'Leite RC', 'Haddad JP']",2017,13,1,BMC Vet Res,"Cosate MRV, et al.

28606191,No Calm After the Storm: A Systematic Review of Human Health Following Flood and Storm Disasters.,"UNLABELLED: Introduction How the burden of disease varies during different phases after floods and after storms is essential in order to guide a medical response, but it has not been well-described. The objective of this review was to elucidate the health problems following flood and storm disasters.
METHODS: A literature search of the databases Medline (US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, Maryland USA); Cinahl (EBSCO Information Services; Ipswich, Massachusetts USA); Global Health (EBSCO Information Services; Ipswich, Massachusetts USA); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters; New York, New York USA); Embase (Elsevier; Amsterdam, Netherlands); and PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, Maryland USA) was conducted in June 2015 for English-language research articles on morbidity or mortality and flood or storm disasters. Articles on mental health, interventions, and rescue or health care workers were excluded. Data were extracted from articles that met the eligibility criteria and analyzed by narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: The review included 113 studies. Poisonings, wounds, gastrointestinal infections, and skin or soft tissue infections all increased after storms. Gastrointestinal infections were more frequent after floods. Leptospirosis and diabetes-related complications increased after both. The majority of changes occurred within four weeks of floods or storms.
CONCLUSION: Health changes differently after floods and after storms. There is a lack of data on the health effects of floods alone, long-term changes in health, and the strength of the association between disasters and health problems. This review highlights areas of consideration for medical response and the need for high-quality, systematic research in this area. Saulnier DD , Brolin Ribacke K , von Schreeb J .

28604791,Challenges in developing methods for quantifying the effects of weather and climate on water-associated diseases: A systematic review.,"Infectious diseases attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation and hygiene (e.g. Cholera, Leptospirosis, Giardiasis) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in low-income countries. Climate and weather factors are known to affect the transmission and distribution of infectious diseases and statistical and mathematical modelling are continuously developing to investigate the impact of weather and climate on water-associated diseases. There have been little critical analyses of the methodological approaches. Our objective is to review and summarize statistical and modelling methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, in order to identify limitations and knowledge gaps in developing of new methods. We conducted a systematic review of English-language papers published from 2000 to 2015. Search terms included concepts related to water-associated diseases, weather and climate, statistical, epidemiological and modelling methods. We found 102 full text papers that met our criteria and were included in the analysis. The most commonly used methods were grouped in two clusters: process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). In general, PBM methods were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of the pathogen under study was relatively well known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae); TS-SE tended to be used when the specific environmental mechanisms were unclear (e.g. Campylobacter). Important data and methodological challenges emerged, with implications for surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The most common limitations comprised: non-inclusion of key factors (e.g. biological mechanism, demographic heterogeneity, human behavior), reporting bias, poor data quality, and collinearity in exposures. Furthermore, the methods often did not distinguish among the multiple sources of time-lags (e.g. patient physiology, reporting bias, healthcare access) between environmental drivers/exposures and disease detection. Key areas of future research include: disentangling the complex effects of weather/climate on each exposure-health outcome pathway (e.g. person-to-person vs environment-to-person), and linking weather data to individual cases longitudinally.","['Lo Iacono G', 'Armstrong B', 'Fleming LE', 'Elson R', 'Kovats S', 'Vardoulakis S', 'Nichols GL']",2017,11,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lo Iacono G, et al.

A variety of diagnostic methods with varying specificities and sensitivities were employed. In Costa Rica, prevention methods such as protective clothing, decreased contact with animals, and prophylaxis of close contacts continue to be the most important factors in reducing transmission of leptospirosis.

28600123,Multifunctional and Redundant Roles of Leptospira interrogans Proteins in Bacterial-Adhesion and fibrin clotting inhibition.,"Pathogenic Leptopira is the etiological agent of leptospirosis, the most widespread zoonotic infection in the world. The disease represents a major public health problem, especially in tropical countries. The present work focused on two hypothetical proteins of unknown function, encoded by the genes LIC13059 and LIC10879, and predicted to be surface-exposed proteins. The genes were cloned and the proteins expressed using E. coli as a host system. We report that the recombinant proteins interacted with extracellular matrix (ECM) laminin, in a dose-dependent fashion and are novel potential adhesins. The recombinant proteins were called Lsa25.6 (rLIC13059) and Lsa16 (rLIC10879), for Leptospiral surface adhesins, followed by the respective molecular masses. The proteins attached to plasminogen (PLG), generating plasmin, in the presence of PLG-activator uPA. Both proteins bind to fibrinogen (Fg), but only Lsa25.6 inhibited fibrin clotting by thrombin-catalyzed reaction. Moreover, Lsa16 interacts with the mammalian cell receptor E-cadherin, and could contribute to bacterial attachment to epithelial cells. The proteins were recognized by confirmed leptospirosis serum samples, suggesting that they are expressed during infection. The corresponding leptospiral proteins are surface exposed based on proteinase K accessibility assay, being LIC10879 most probably exposed in its dimer form. The data of this study extend the spectrum of surface-exposed proteins of L. interrogans and indicate a possible role of the originally annotated hypothetical proteins in infection processes.","['Pereira PRM', 'Fernandes LGV', 'de Souza GO', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Heinemann MB', 'Romero EC', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2017,307,6,Int J Med Microbiol,"Pereira PRM, et al.

28592316,The influence of climatic factors on the development of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and leptospirosis during the peak season in Korea: an ecologic study.,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and leptospirosis are seasonal rodent-borne infections in the Republic of Korea (Korea). The occurrences of HFRS and leptospirosis are influenced by climatic variability. However, few studies have examined the effects of local climatic variables on the development of these infections. The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of climatic factors on the occurrence of HFRS and leptospirosis in Korea.
METHODS: Daily records on human cases of HFRS and leptospirosis between January 2001 to December 2009 were analyzed. The associations of climatic factors with these cases in high incidence provinces were estimated using the time-series method and multivariate generalized linear Poisson models with a maximal lag of 12 weeks.
RESULTS: From 2001 to 2009, a total of 2912 HFRS and 889 leptospirosis cases were reported, with overall incidences of 0.67 and 0.21 cases per 100,000, respectively, in the study areas. The increase in minimum temperature (1 °C) at a lag of 11 weeks was associated with 17.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.1, 20.6%] and 22.7% (95% CI: 16.5, 29.3%) increases in HFRS and leptospirosis cases, respectively. A 1-h increase in the daily sunshine was related to a 27.5% (95% CI: 18.2, 37.6%) increase in HFRS at a lag of 0 week. A 1% increase in daily minimum relative humidity and a 1 mm increase in daily rainfall were associated with 4.0% (95% CI:1.8, 6.1) and 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2, 2.8%) increases in weekly leptospirosis cases at 11 and 6 weeks later, respectively.

28587195,The Use of Chemoprophylaxis after Floods to Reduce the Occurrence and Impact of Leptospirosis Outbreaks.,"Record-breaking and devastating rainfall events have occurred in the past decade. Rain and floods are considered the main risk factors for leptospirosis and several outbreaks have been reported following extreme weather events. In such situations, one possible intervention to prevent leptospirosis cases in high-risk groups is the use of chemoprophylaxis. However, not enough evidence of its effect is available. The objectives of this study were to review the literature on the current practices of chemoprophylaxis for leptospirosis and to explore, using a mathematical model, how various chemoprophylaxis scenarios may affect the progression of a leptospirosis outbreak. Twenty-six peer-reviewed publications were selected (10 quantitative studies, two systematic reviews and 14 articles of other types). Oral doxycycline was the most used antibiotic for chemoprophylaxis of leptospirosis. Post-exposure prophylaxis was assessed in four studies following a natural disaster. Although evidence of the effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis is inconsistent, the direction of association supported a protective effect for morbidity and mortality. The theoretical model showed how the assumed benefit of chemoprophylaxis was influenced by the time and rate of administration. Future models should consider the heterogeneity of affected communities, improved estimates of the effect of chemoprophylaxis on leptospirosis infection and disease, as well as potential detrimental impacts. Additional research is critical to provide clear evidence-based recommendations for leptospirosis control during an outbreak. The results of this study suggest that chemoprophylaxis may provide some protection in reducing the number of leptospirosis cases after a high-risk exposure; however, the effective benefit may depend on a variety of factors such as the timing and coverage of prophylaxis. The information summarized can be used to support decision-making during a high-risk event.","['Schneider MC', 'Velasco-Hernandez J', 'Min KD', 'Leonel DG', 'Baca-Carrasco D', 'Gompper ME', 'Hartskeerl R', 'Munoz-Zanzi C']",2017,14,6,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Schneider MC, et al.

28584176,One Health contributions towards more effective and equitable approaches to health in low- and middle-income countries.,"Emerging zoonoses with pandemic potential are a stated priority for the global health security agenda, but endemic zoonoses also have a major societal impact in low-resource settings. Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive 'One Health' interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases. We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges. One Health interventions thus have the potential to align the ongoing needs of disadvantaged communities with the concerns of the broader global community, providing a pragmatic and equitable approach to meeting the global goals for sustainable development and supporting the global health security agenda.This article is part of the themed issue 'One Health for a changing world: zoonoses, ecosystems and human well-being'.","['Cleaveland S', 'Sharp J', 'Abela-Ridder B', 'Allan KJ', 'Buza J', 'Crump JA', 'Davis A', 'Del Rio Vilas VJ', 'de Glanville WA', 'Kazwala RR', 'Kibona T', 'Lankester FJ', 'Lugelo A', 'Mmbaga BT', 'Rubach MP', 'Swai ES', 'Waldman L', 'Haydon DT', 'Hampson K', 'Halliday JEB']",2017,372,1725,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Cleaveland S, et al.

28575082,The role of reactive oxygen intermediates in the intracellular fate of Leptospira interrogans in the macrophages of different hosts.,"BACKGROUND: Pathogenic species of Leptospira cause leptospirosis, a global zoonotic disease. Our previous work showed that leptospires survive and replicate in human macrophages but are killed in murine macrophages. However, the mechanism responsible for the different intracellular fates of leptospires within the macrophages of different hosts remains unclear.
RESULTS: The present study demonstrates that infection with Leptospira interrogans caused significant up-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide in J774A.1 cells but did so to a lesser extent in THP-1 cells. The up-regulation of ROS and superoxide was significantly inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. The damaged leptospires and remnants of leptospires within membrane-bound vacuoles were significantly inhibited by apocynin in J774A.1 cells but were less inhibited in THP-1 cells. In addition, apocynin significantly prevented damage to leptospires and the co-localization of L. interrogans with lysosomes in J774A.1 cells but did so to a lesser extent in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, the relative fluorescence intensity levels of intracellular leptospires and the viability of the intracellular leptospires increased in apocynin pretreated J774A.1 and THP-1 cells after 2 h of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study, based on our previous findings, further demonstrated that ROS contributed substantially to the bactericidal ability of mouse macrophages to kill intracellular leptospires. However, ROS did not contribute as much in human macrophages, which partially explains the different intracellular fates of L. interrogans in human and mouse macrophages.","['Li S', 'Li P', 'Zhang L', 'Hu W', 'Wang M', 'Liu Y', 'Tang G', 'Wang D', 'Zhou B', 'Yan J']",2017,12,6,PLoS One,"Li S, et al.

28545521,"Clinical, serological and echocardiographic examination of healthy field dogs before and after vaccination with a commercial tetravalent leptospirosis vaccine.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a re-emerging bacterial zoonosis caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Severe disease has been reported in dogs in Europe despite vaccination with bivalent Leptospira vaccines. Recently, a tetravalent canine Leptospira vaccine (Nobivac® L4) was licenced in Europe. The goal of this study was to investigate clinical signs, microscopic agglutination test (MAT) titres, haematology, blood biochemistry, cardiac (c) Troponin I levels and echocardiography before and after vaccination with this tetravalent vaccine. Forty-eight healthy dogs were prospectively enrolled and vaccinated twice, 3-4 weeks apart (T0 and T1). Before vaccination (T0) and 16-31 days after the second vaccination (T2), MAT (n = 48), haematology (n = 48), blood biochemistry (n = 36) and cTroponin I measurements (n = 29) were performed, and MAT was repeated 347-413 days after the second vaccination (T3, n = 44). Echocardiography was performed before the first and second vaccination (T0 and T1, n = 24).
RESULTS: Mild and transient clinical signs within 5 days following the first and second vaccination occurred in 23% and 10% of the dogs, respectively. Before the first vaccination (T0), all dogs showed negative MAT titres for the tested serovars except for Canicola (50% with titres 100-400).

Median to high titres (≥ 400) were most common to the serovar Canicola (92%) and less common to the serovars Australis (41%), Grippotyphosa (21%), Bratislava (12%), Autumnalis (4%), Pyrogenes (4%) and Pomona (2%). At T3, positive MAT titres (titre range: 100-400) were found in 2-18% of the dogs to serovars of the vaccine serogroups and in 2-18% of the dogs to the non-vaccine serovars Pomona, Autumnalis, Pyrogenes and Ballum. Haematology, blood biochemistry, cTroponin I levels and echocardiography results did not change significantly following vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical signs following vaccination with Nobivac® L4 were transient and mild in all cases.

28536483,Development and evaluation of an immunochromatographic assay to detect serum anti-leptospiral lipopolysaccharide IgM in acute leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a common life-threatening disease worldwide. However, its diagnosis is frequently ineffective because the gold standard bacterial culture and microscopic agglutination test (MAT) are usually positive 1-2 weeks after the disease onset. We thus developed an immunochromatographic assay (LEPkit) to detect serum anti-leptospiral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) IgM for rapid diagnosis of acute leptospirosis. Using referenced sera of 77 leptospirosis and 91 non-leptospirosis cases, LEPkit yielded 97.4% sensitivity, 94.5% specificity, 93.8 positive predictive value (PPV), 97.7% negative predictive value (NPV), and 95.8% accuracy. The stability of this kit stored for up to 18 months and its reproducibility were confirmed. Testing in 74 new cases using samples at admission-phase and subsequent paired samples (total n = 135), overall sensitivity was 98.5%, whereas that of culture and single MAT (≥1:400) was 15.6% and 35.6%, respectively. When only the samples at admission-phase were used (n = 74), the sensitivity remained at 98.7%, whereas that of culture and single MAT (≥1:400) was 28.4% and 13.5%, respectively. In summary, our LEPkit was far more effective than any conventional methods for the diagnosis of acute leptospirosis, especially within the first few days after the disease onset. The ease of use, stability and reproducibility further enhance its feasibility for clinical use on-site.","['Doungchawee G', 'Sutdan D', 'Niwatayakul K', 'Inwisai T', 'Sitthipunya A', 'Boonsathorn N', 'Sakulterdkiat T', 'Sirawaraporn W', 'Thongboonkerd V']",2017,7,1,Sci Rep,"Doungchawee G, et al.

While human leptospirosis remains rare in Switzerland, the incidence of canine leptospirosis is unusually high compared to other European countries. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to determine the exposure of asymtomatic dogs to pathogenic Leptospira in Switzerland, to characterise risk factors associated with seropositivity and to determine the prevalence of urinary shedding. Sampling was stratified to cover the whole of Switzerland. Sera were tested by microscopic agglutination test for antibodies against a panel of 12 serovars. Urine was tested for pathogenic Leptospira using a LipL32 real-time PCR. Of 377 sera, 55.7% (95%CI 51.2-60.7) showed a reciprocal MAT titre of ≥1:40 and 24.9% (95%CI 20.7-29.4) of ≥1:100 to at least one serovar. Seropositivity (MAT ≥1:100) was most common to serovars Australis (14.9%; 95% CI 11.4-18.6) and Bratislava (8.8%; 95%CI 6.1-11.7), followed by Copenhageni (6.1%; 95%CI 3.7-8.5), Canicola (5%; 95%CI 2.9-7.4), Grippotyphosa (4.5%; 95%CI 2.7-6.9), Pomona (4%; 95%CI 2.1-6.1), Autumnalis (2.7%; 95%CI 1.3-4.2) and Icterohaemorrhagiae (1.6%; 95%CI 0.5-2.9). In unvaccinated dogs (n=84) the prevalence of a MAT titre ≥100 was 17.9% (95%CI 10.7-26.2), with a similar distribution of reactive serovars. Variables associated with seropositivity (≥1:40) to any serovar included age (OR 1.29/year; 95%CI: 1.1-1.5) and bioregion with higher risks in the regions Northern Alps (OR 14.5; 95%CI 2.2-292.7), Central Plateau (OR 12.3; 95%CI 2.0-244.1) and Jura (OR 11.2; 95%CI 1.7-226.7) compared to Southern Central Alps. Dogs living with horses were significantly more likely to have antibodies to serovar Bratislava (OR 4.68;95%CI 1.2-17.2). Hunting was a significant risk factor for seropositivtiy to serovar Grippotyphosa (OR 8.03; 95%CI 1.6-30.8). Urine qPCR positivity was uncommon (1/408 dogs; 0.2%; 95% CI0-0.7).

The case is followed by a brief review of the JHR which is rarely observed with treatment of leptospirosis. A healthy 28-year-old female who recently returned from the Caribbean presented to the emergency department with flu-like symptoms. The patient appeared jaundiced with conjunctival suffusion and was ultimately treated with the appropriate antibiotics for leptospirosis in the ED. She decompensated subsequently, requiring supplemental oxygen, central and arterial line placement, and vasopressor support with norepinephrine. Although rarely encountered and not well reported throughout the literature, initiation of antibiotics can cause a JHR reaction given that Leptospira interrogans is a spirochete. This JHR may be self-limited and of short duration, or it can be prolonged and severe, requiring invasive therapies such as central line placement for vasopressor support and intubation. It is suggested that patients started on antibiotics for leptospirosis/Weil's disease should be monitored in the emergency department for a short duration prior to discharge or transfer to a regular medical floor for observation given the possibility for decompensation.","['Connor-Schuler R', 'Khan A', 'Goyal N', 'Zimny E']",2017,35,8,Am J Emerg Med,"Connor-Schuler R, et al.

28527249,"[Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients infected with Leptospira spp. treated at four hospitals in Medellín, Colombia, 2008-2013].","INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis remains a significant health problem in tropical regions including Latin America, where its presentation is 100 times higher than that observed in other regions of the world. Mortality reaches 10% in severe cases. Its diagnosis is challenging because clinical manifestations during the initial phase are non-specific and because of limited availability of diagnostic tests.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics and the outcomes in hospitalized patients with leptospirosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included patients treated at four institutions in Medellín between January, 2009, and December, 2013, with a compatible clinical picture and a positive IgM for Leptospira spp.
RESULTS: We included 119 patients, 80% male, and 58% of rural origin. The mean duration of symptoms was 9.6 days (SD=9.6). Eighty nine per cent of patients had fever; 62%, jaundice; 74%, myalgia; 46%, diarrhea; 41%, hepatomegaly; 13%, splenomegaly, and 13%, conjunctival injection. Fifty four per cent of patients had impaired renal function; 32%, pulmonary compromise, and 13%, liver failure. Sixteen per cent required admission to the ICU; 12%, mechanical ventilation, and 11%, vasopressor therapy.Weil's syndrome occurred in 38.6% and 5% died. The average hospital stay was 11 days (SD=9.6).
CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the clinical manifestations and complications of leptospirosis were similar to those reported in the literature.

28513759,[Diagnosis of leptospirosis in dogs].,"Rapid confirmation of the diagnosis leptospirosis is important in order to apply appropriate treatment; in addition, infected dogs are a zoonotic risk. Culture and isolation of living leptospires from blood, urine, or tissues is considered the reference standard of diagnosis. However, sensitivity are low, and leptospires require weeks to months to grow. Therefore, diagnosis of leptospirosis is most commonly based on antibody testing or the detection of Leptospira spp. DNA by PCR. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is currently still the recommended confirmatory test for canine leptospirosis, despite its numerous limitations (e. g., negative results in early infection, positive results due to vaccine-associated antibodies). ELISA can differentiate between IgG and IgM antibodies and thus, discriminate current infections from previous vaccination or exposure. Point-of-care tests and in-house-PCR tests have recently been developed for use in private practice allowing easy and immediate diagnosis. However, only few data on sensitivity and specificity of these tests exist so far. A reliable diagnosis can only be established in case of a positive PCR result or a fourfold titre increase in MAT.","['Bergmann M', 'Llewellyn JR', 'Hartmann K']",2017,45,3,Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere,"Bergmann M, et al.

Some survivors are known to progress to chronic kidney disease due to sustained tubulointerstitial inflammation. We present a case of severe leptospirosis with acute renal failure. Although antibiotic therapy resolved the infection, moderate renal dysfunction remained. A renal biopsy demonstrated marked inflammatory infiltration in the tubules and interstitium. Many of the inflammatory cells were CD68-positive monocytes/macrophages, predominantly M1 phenotype. An intermediate dose of oral corticosteroids normalized the patient's serum creatinine levels.

28487178,Comparison between generalized linear modelling and additive Bayesian network; identification of factors associated with the incidence of antibodies against Leptospira interrogans sv Pomona in meat workers in New Zealand.,"BACKGROUND: Additive Bayesian Network (ABN) is a graphical model which extends Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) to multiple dependent variables. The present study compares results from GLM with those from ABN analysis used to identify factors associated with Leptospira interrogans sv Pomona (Pomona) infection by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of these two methodologies, to corroborate inferences informing health and safety measures at abattoirs in New Zealand (NZ).
METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: In a cohort study in four sheep slaughtering abattoirs in NZ, sera were collected twice a year from 384 meat workers and tested by Microscopic Agglutination with a 91% sensitivity and 94% specificity for Pomona. The study primarily addressed the effect of work position, personal protective equipment (PPE) and non-work related exposures such as hunting on a new infection with Pomona. Significantly associated with Pomona were ""Work position"" and two ""Abattoirs"" (GLM), and ""Work position"" (ABN). The odds of Pomona infection (OR, [95% CI]) was highest at stunning and hide removal (ABN 41.0, [6.9-1044.2]; GLM 57.0, [6.9-473.3]), followed by removal of intestines, bladder, and kidneys (ABN 30.7, [4.9-788.4]; GLM 33.8, [4.2-271.1]). Wearing a facemask, glasses or gloves (PPE) did not result as a protective factor in GLM or ABN.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The odds of Pomona infection was highest at stunning and hide removal. PPE did not show any indication of being protective in GLM or ABN. In ABN all relationships between variables are modelled; hence it has an advantage over GLM due to its capacity to capture the natural complexity of data more effectively.","['Pittavino M', 'Dreyfus A', 'Heuer C', 'Benschop J', 'Wilson P', 'Collins-Emerson J', 'Torgerson PR', 'Furrer R']",2017,173,,Acta Trop,"Pittavino M, et al.

28484991,Lipid testing in infectious diseases: possible role in diagnosis and prognosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute infections lead to significant alterations in metabolic regulation including lipids and lipoproteins, which play a central role in the host immune response. In this regard, several studies have investigated the role of lipid levels as a marker of infection severity and prognosis.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: We review here the role of lipids in immune response and the potential mechanisms underneath. Moreover, we summarize studies on lipid and lipoprotein alterations in acute bacterial, viral and parasitic infections as well as their diagnostic and prognostic significance. Chronic infections (HIV, HBV, HCV) are also considered.
RESULTS: All lipid parameters have been found to be significantly dearranged during acute infection. Common lipid alterations in this setting include a decrease of total cholesterol levels and an increase in the concentration of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, mainly very low-density lipoproteins. Also, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein-B levels decrease. These lipid alterations may have prognostic and diagnostic role in certain infections.
CONCLUSION: Lipid testing may be of help to assess response to treatment in septic patients and those with various acute infections (such as pneumonia, leptospirosis and others). Diagnostically, new onset of altered lipid levels should prompt the clinician to test for underlying infection (such as leishmaniasis).","['Filippas-Ntekouan S', 'Liberopoulos E', 'Elisaf M']",2017,45,5,Infection,"Filippas-Ntekouan S, et al.

28482843,Sero-prevalence of specific Leptospira serovars in fattening pigs from 5 provinces in Vietnam.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease with a worldwide distribution. In Vietnam, leptospirosis is considered endemic. In pigs, leptospirosis can result in reproductive problems (such as abortion and infertility) which lead to economic loss. In addition, transmission to people presents a public health risk. In Vietnam, few national studies have been conducted on sero-prevalence of leptospirosis in pigs. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the sero-prevalence and incidence of presumptive infective leptospira serovars in fattening pigs from 5 provinces in Vietnam.
RESULTS: Blood samples from fattening pigs were randomly collected at slaughterhouses. We collected 1959 sera samples from 5 provinces (Son La, Hanoi, Nghe An, Dak Lak and An Giang) between January and early June 2016. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used to identify the serogroups/serovars. Overall, the sero-prevalence was 8.17% (95% CI: 6.99-9.47) and serovar Tarassovi Mitis (2.19%) had the highest prevalence followed by Australis (1.94%), Javanica (1.68%) and Autumnalis (1.17%) using a cutoff (≥ 1:100). The sero-prevalence among female pigs (5.28%, 95% CI: 3.94-6.93) was slightly higher than among male pigs (4.88%, 95% CI: 3.51-6.58), but this difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis in pigs may be a useful indicator of the human/animal burden in Vietnam and a risk assessment tool. The presence of some of the identified serovars suggests that wildlife may play an important role in the transmission of leptospirosis to domesticated pigs in Vietnam. Therefore, strengthened monitoring and surveillance systems are needed to better understand the epidemiology of the disease and prevent or reduce infection in humans and animals.","['Lee HS', 'Khong NV', 'Xuan HN', 'Nghia VB', 'Nguyen-Viet H', 'Grace D']",2017,13,1,BMC Vet Res,"Lee HS, et al.

28478544,[Leptospirosis in French Guiana and the Guiana shield: Current knowledge in 2016].,"Leptospirosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Whether the distribution is worldwide, the hot and humid climate of the tropics is particularly conducive to its expansion. In most French overseas departments and territories, leptospirosis is considered as a public health problem. In French Guiana, a French department located in the northeastern part of the Amazon rainforest, it is supposed to be rare. The objective of this review was to make an inventory of the knowledge on human and animal leptospirosis in French Guiana and neighboring countries. A comprehensive search was conducted through the indexed and informal medical literature in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. Thus, respectively ten and four publications were identified on human and animal leptospirosis in French Guiana, published between 1940 and 1995 in the form of case reports or case series. The publications concerning this disease in the other countries of the Guiana Shield, eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and Brazilian state of Amapá, also scarce or nonexistent. However recent data from the French National Centre of leptospirosis showed a recent and sudden increase in the number of cases in the department, probably partly due to the development of diagnostic tools such as Elisa IgM serology. It is likely that leptospirosis is a neglected disease in the region, due to the lack of diagnostic tools readily available, the lack of knowledge of the local clinicians on this disease and the existence of many other pathogens with similar clinical presentation such as malaria, arboviruses and Q fever and Amazonian toxoplasmosis. The establishment of more large-scale studies on animal and human leptospirosis is necessary and urgent to know the true burden of this disease in our region.","['Epelboin L', 'Bourhy P', 'Le Turnier P', 'Schaub R', 'Mosnier E', 'Berlioz-Arthaud A', 'Reynaud Y', 'Nacher M', 'De Thoisy B', 'Carles G', 'Richard-Hansen C', 'Demar M', 'Picardeau M', 'Djossou F']",2017,110,3,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,"Epelboin L, et al.

28475453,Presence of Antibodies to Leptospira spp. in Black-tailed Prairie Dogs ( Cynomys ludovicianus ) and Beavers ( Castor canadensis ) in Northwestern Mexico.,"Leptospires are widespread spirochete bacteria that infect mammals, including rodents and humans. We investigated the presence of Leptospira antibodies in two species of rodents from San Pedro River Basin (SPRB) in northwestern Mexico as part of the black-tailed prairie dog ( Cynomys ludovicianus ) monitoring plan and the North American beaver ( Castor canadensis ) reintroduction program. We sampled a total of 26 black-tailed prairie dogs and three beavers during October-November 2015. We detected antibodies against Leptospira spp. by microagglutination test in 12 (46%) prairie dogs and in two (67%) beavers. The antibody titers for seropositive rodents varied from 1:100 to 1:200, but none of the animals showed clinical signs of disease. We found seven Leptospira spp. serogroups (Autumnalis, Australis, Bataviae, Canicola, Celledoni, Grippotyphosa, and Sejroe) circulating in rodent species in SPRB. We did not find any differences between sex and age concerning Leptospira-positive rodents. Our findings suggest the presence of endemic cycles and potential risks of Leptospira infection in both species from SPRB. Although the impact of this infection on threatened species remains unclear, human activities and environmental stress might facilitate the emergence or reemergence of leptospirosis disease as has been reported elsewhere.","['López-Pérez AM', 'Carreón-Arroyo G', 'Atilano D', 'Vigueras-Galván AL', 'Valdez C', 'Toyos D', 'Mendizabal D', 'López-Islas J', 'Suzán G']",2017,53,4,J Wildl Dis,"López-Pérez AM, et al.

28472618,Plurality of Leptospira strains on slaughtered animals suggest a broader concept of adaptability of leptospires to cattle.,"Leptospirosis in bovines is in majority determined by the host-adapted serovars, mainly Hardjo (types Hardjoprajitno and Hardjobovis), that belong to the serogroup Sejroe. Members of other serogroups as Pomona and Tarassovi have been eventually reported, mainly when outbreaks occurs. Nevertheless, the real role of other strains (non-Hardjo) on determining disease or being transmitted by cattle free of apparent clinical signs of acute infection remains to be elucidated. In that context, the aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that strains of serovars/serogroups other than Hardjo may also be maintained and shed by cattle free of clinical signs. Samples of urine and/or vaginal fluid were collected from 697 bovines from a slaughterhouse located close to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Culturing yielded 19 isolates what represents the largest number ever obtained in Brazil on similar studies. These strains were serogrouped and genetically characterized. Fifteen of those were described in other papers and four are first described on the present study. Isolates belong to three different species (Leptospira santarosai, L. alstonii and L. interrogans) and five serogroups (Sarmin, Tarassovi, Shermani, Grippotyphosa and Sejroe). The majority (84.2%) of the isolates belongs to the species L. santarosai, the most prevalent species on cattle in the studied region. Non-Hardjo (non-Sejroe) strains represent 57.9% of the isolates, what indicates an unexpected high diversity of serogroups obtained from these cattle. This suggest that non-Hardjo (non-Sejroe) strains may also be maintained and shed by cattle and that finding must be considered in the epidemiology and control of the disease.","['Pinto PS', 'Pestana C', 'Medeiros MA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2017,172,,Acta Trop,"Pinto PS, et al.

28468604,"Simultaneous detection of chikungunya virus, dengue virus and human pathogenic Leptospira genomes using a multiplex TaqMan® assay.","BACKGROUND: In 2005-2006 a major epidemics of Chikungunya disease occurred in South-West Indian Ocean islands. In Reunion Island, the magnitude of Chikungunya infection related symptoms was high and with over 38% of serological prevalence in the population. This epidemics illustrated the potential threat of emerging arboviral diseases for inhabitants of Reunion Island and elsewhere since vectors are worldwide distributed. A sentinel surveillance network was set-up to detect emerging pathogens associated with fever over 38 °C and in the absence of known etiologic causes. Leptospirosis is caused by a pathogenic spirochete of the Leptospira genus and is an endemic and recurrent seasonal disease of great concern in Reunion Island. To accurately diagnose potentially infected patients and to advise Health authorities on the presence of emerging pathogens, a rapid diagnostic test was needed that could differentiate between these 3 pathogens.
METHODS: A one-step multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed that can simultaneously detect RNA of Chikungunya and Dengue viruses and leptospiral DNA with good performance for a routine diagnostic use.
RESULTS: Simplex protocols already published were used with key modifications to implement a triplex assay which was set-up with a small reaction volume to improve cost efficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach has enabled greater diagnostic capacity in our laboratory. We established a multiplex approach validated and valuable for cost savings, and with the concurrent detection of 3 pathogens of public health concern.","['Giry C', 'Roquebert B', 'Li-Pat-Yuen G', 'Gasque P', 'Jaffar-Bandjee MC']",2017,17,1,BMC Microbiol,"Giry C, et al.

28466955,[Epidemiology and prevention of leptospirosis in dogs].,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with increasing prevalence in dogs and humans. The various Leptospira serovars display different pathogenicity. Even healthy infected dogs can shed leptospires with their urine and thus, represent a risk for humans and other animals. Vaccination is the most important measure for prevention; it not only prevents disease in dogs, but also reduces shedding of leptospires in urine. For comprehensive protection through vaccination, tetravalent vaccines containing serovars of the serogroups relevant in the corresponding region should be used. The spread of the pathogen can be reduced by a wide application of these vaccines. A detailed owner education about the zoonotic potential of the infection and appropriate hygiene measures when handling the infected dog and its urine are essential.","['Bergmann M', 'Llewellyn JR', 'Hartmann K']",2017,45,3,Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere,"Bergmann M, et al.

28460612,Hepatic Capillariasis- Drug Targets.,"Zoonotic infections are increasingly becoming public health menaces and are usually transmitted to humans due to unsuitable environmental conditions. One of them is hepatic capillariasis, caused by the parasite Capillaria hepatica, primarily a disease of rodents, with hepatic manifestations in humans. Although its prevalence is very low, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality, with cases reported from all over the world. The main infective form for humans is the embryonated egg of the parasite, which hatches in the intestine and ultimately colonize the liver. The larvae mature and reproduce, and eventually form embryonated eggs, which cause chronic focal inflammation and septal hepatic fibrosis. Clinical presentation mainly consists of fever, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and eosinophilia. Spurious infection with unembryonated eggs cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnostic modalities include liver biopsy, ultrasonography, CT scan, immunological tests like ELISA and IIFT. The infection can be treated mainly with a combination of benzimidazoles like thiabendazole, mebendazole and albendazole; with corticosteroids. The study emphasizes the need for hepatic capillariasis to be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of suspected hepatitis, leptospirosis, abdominal lymphadenopathy or other hepatic or parasitic infections prevalent in the region concerned; and meticulously assess the cases to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, thus reducing the distress faced by patients.","['Dubey A', 'Bagchi A', 'Sharma D', 'Dey A', 'Nandy K', 'Sharma R']",2018,18,1,Infect Disord Drug Targets,"Dubey A, et al.

28446740,"[Biological risk among agriculture and construction workers in Molise Region, Central Italy].","BACKGROUND: Biological risk is a significant issue in workplaces due to continuous modification of work organization and condition.
OBJECTIVES: In this pilot study, perception and knowledge of biological risk, as well as adoption of prevention measures were evaluated among construction and agriculture workers.
METHODS: A structured questionnaire was administered to workers to collect socio-demographic and employment information, in addition to data on risk perception and knowledge, and adoption of preventive measures, including those related to work activities.
RESULTS: Fifty-three workers aged 45.3±9.8 years participated in the study, 81% were male, and 70% were construction workers. Approximately 80% of participants declared that infectious diseases are neither frequent nor health-threatening in their occupational activity. The majority of workers considered some diseases, such as hepatitis A and B, leptospirosis and listeriosis, as posing a low risk to their health. Forty-seven % claimed to be unexposed to biohazards at their workplace, and 72% were not worried about them. Ninety-six % of the workers knew about vaccination for tetanus, but only 74% and 36% knew about the availability of vaccination for Hepatitis A and B, respectively. During lifetime, 94% of the workers received at least one vaccination. All workers had undergone tetanus vaccination, but only few received vaccine for influenza, hepatitis B and tuberculosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study in occupational settings revealed a poor perception of biological risk and a limited awareness of the severity of infectious diseases. Major knowledge gaps existed about the available preventive measures. It is essential to promote safety culture at the workplace also with regard to biological hazards. This requires improving information and education, conducting appropriate studies, and prompting health and safety professional actors to focus on occupational infectious disease problems.","['Tamburro M', 'Anzelmo V', 'Bianco P', 'Sammarco ML', 'Salierno F', 'Ripabelli G']",2017,108,2,Med Lav,"Tamburro M, et al.

28437186,Leptospira Species in Feral Cats and Black Rats from Western Australia and Christmas Island.,"Leptospirosis is a neglected, re-emerging bacterial disease with both zoonotic and conservation implications. Rats and livestock are considered the usual sources of human infection, but all mammalian species are capable of carrying Leptospira spp. and transmitting pathogenic leptospires in their urine, and uncertainty remains about the ecology and transmission dynamics of Leptospira in different regions. In light of a recent case of human leptospirosis on tropical Christmas Island, this study aimed to investigate the role of introduced animals (feral cats and black rats) as carriers of pathogenic Leptospira spp. on Christmas Island and to compare this with two different climatic regions of Western Australia (one island and one mainland). Kidney samples were collected from black rats (n = 68) and feral cats (n = 59) from Christmas Island, as well as feral cats from Dirk Hartog Island (n = 23) and southwest Western Australia (n = 59). Molecular (PCR) screening detected pathogenic leptospires in 42.4% (95% confidence interval 29.6-55.9) of cats and 2.9% (0.4-10.2) of rats from Christmas Island. Sequencing of cat- and rat-positive samples from Christmas Island showed 100% similarity for Leptospira interrogans. Pathogenic leptospires were not detected in cats from Dirk Hartog Island or southwest Western Australia. These findings were consistent with previous reports of higher Leptospira spp. prevalence in tropical regions compared with arid and temperate regions. Despite the abundance of black rats on Christmas Island, feral cats appear to be the more important reservoir species for the persistence of pathogenic L. interrogans on the island. This research highlights the importance of disease surveillance and feral animal management to effectively control potential disease transmission.","['Dybing NA', 'Jacobson C', 'Irwin P', 'Algar D', 'Adams PJ']",2017,17,5,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Dybing NA, et al.

In 2005, three nonhuman primates at a drive-through zoo in Oregon, US, acquired tularemia from an unknown source. Due to an abundance of California ground squirrels ( Spermophilus beecheyi ) on zoo grounds, we instituted serosurveillance of this species from July through September 2008 to determine the prevalence of antibodies against pathogens considered to be potentially transmissible to collection animals. Serologic testing was performed for Francisella tularensis ; Leptospira interrogans serovars Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Hardjo, Icterohemorrhagiae, and Pomona; Toxoplasma gondii ; and Yersinia pestis . All squirrels were seronegative for Yersinia pestis (0%; 0/45) and Toxoplasma gondii (0%; 0/20); there was a prevalence of 2% (1/45) for Francisella tularensis antibodies and 57% (24/42) were positive for various Leptospira serovars. Although it remains unclear whether ground squirrels present a significant risk for transmission of disease to zoo animals, vaccination of high-risk zoo animals against leptospirosis warrants consideration.

28414662,Weil's Disease from a Local New Orleans Bar.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection that typically presents with fever, myalgias, nausea, and vomiting after contact with contaminated waters or infected animals (typically rodents); and their excrements. Conditions favorable to the transmission of leptospirosis are common in LA and, without treatment, leptospirosis can lead to both liver and renal failure, meningitis, pulmonary hemorrhage and ultimately death.
CASE: A 56 year old woman with no past medical history presented to the Emergency Department with weakness, myalgias, jaundice and decreased urine output for one week. On arrival, she appeared septic with a heart rate of 130 and fever. Her exam was significant for significant jaundice and diffuse abdominal pain. Laboratory studies were notable for WBC 14, hemoglobin of 12 and platelet count of 63. Creatinine was 8.5mg/dL with a blood-urea nitrogen of 96mg/dl. Total bilirubin was 19.4mg/dL and direct bilirubin was 13.7mg/dL. AST/ALT were 69/38 U/L, respectively and the alkaline phosphate was 160U/L. The patient was admitted to the hospital medicine wards for sepsis and multi-organ failure. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics but her clinical condition continued to worsen with progressive decline in her hemoglobin and thrombocytopenia and worsening liver failure. She quickly became anuric necessitating dialysis and developed respiratory distress with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis. Additional history was obtained from her employer that she works at a local New Orleans bar and had been cleaning out rats from the kitchen. Leptospirosis antibody was sent, which returned as positive. Her antibiotics were de-escalated to IV Ceftriaxone. She made a slow recovery over the next two-week period.
DISCUSSION: Since 1987, there has been an average of 3 cases of Leptospirosis diagnosed per year, most of which have been from southeast LA. This case illustrates the importance of considering the diagnosis of Leptospirosis and Weil's Disease in patients in the southeast region of LA who present with multi-organ failure. In addition, our patient's occupational exposure was key to her diagnosis which emphasizes the importance of a detailed history in clinical decision making and patient outcomes.","['Kahn HP', 'Bateman L']",2017,169,2,J La State Med Soc,Kahn HP and Bateman L.

The incidence of leptospirosis in dogs in the USA appears to be increasing. This study used 14 years of canine leptospirosis testing data across 3109 counties in the USA to analyze environmental and socio-economic correlates with rates of infection and to produce a map of locations of increased risk for canine leptospirosis. Boosted regression trees were used to identify the probability of a dog testing positive for leptospirosis based on microscopic agglutination test (MAT) results, and environmental and socio-economic data. The Midwest, East and Southwest were more likely to yield positive tests for leptospirosis, although specific counties in Appalachia had some of the highest predicted probabilities. Location (suburban areas or areas with deciduous forest) and climate (precipitation and temperature) were predictors for positive MAT results for leptospirosis, although the precise direction and strength of the effects was difficult to interpret. Wide geographic variation in predicted risk was identified. This risk mapping approach may provide opportunities for improved diagnosis, control and prevention of leptospirosis in dogs.","['White AM', 'Zambrana-Torrelio C', 'Allen T', 'Rostal MK', 'Wright AK', 'Ball EC', 'Daszak P', 'Karesh WB']",2017,222,,Vet J,"White AM, et al.

In this context, this paper discusses the main challenges and perspectives for the control of bovine leptospirosis, particularly under tropical conditions. In order to reduce the effects of the disease in cattle, it has been proposed that the control should integrate the trinomial antibiotic therapy (mainly streptomycin); vaccination (whole-cell bacterins); and environmental management. This last element should be carefully considered in tropics. Despite the enormous economic impact of the disease, mainly on its chronic and silent reproductive presentation, research on control programs is not proportional.

28377329,Presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis before seroconversion: a review of 338 cases in Wallis and Futuna 2008 to 2015.,"Leptospirosis is a common condition in Wallis and Futuna, and the definitive diagnosis needs to be established urgently at the first patient consultation, which is usually one to two days after the onset of clinical signs. As a diagnostic aid, a composite index was established based on data from 338 patients seen by the Wallis and Futuna admissions services between 2008 and 2015. The data taken into account include: age and sex of the patient, their home island, the consultation period and the results of leukocytes, platelets, CRP, creatinine and GGT tests combined with 2 major clinical signs, headache and conjunctival suffusion. Then 5 threshold limits were defined for this index, which indicates from very low risk to almost certain biologically confirmed leptospirosis. Other febrile diseases responsible for thrombocytopenia are not found in Wallis and Futuna, which probably explains the good statistical qualities of this index with a value of area under the curve equal to 0.821.","['Massenet D', 'Couteaux C', 'Goarant C']",2017,75,2,Ann Biol Clin (Paris),"Massenet D, et al.

28368857,Serovar prevalence of Leptospira in semirural India and the development of an IgM-based indirect ELISA.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a major public health problem in India. However, it has been underreported and under-diagnosed due to a lack of awareness of the disease, a functional surveillance system, and appropriate laboratory diagnostic facilities.
METHODOLOGY: This multicenter study aimed to understand the Leptospira serovars causing leptospirosis in seven secondary-level hospitals in six states in India. Since early and accurate diagnosis of leptospirosis is one of the challenges faced by clinicians in India due to the poor specificity and sensitivity of commercially available diagnostic systems, an in-house indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed. Genomic DNA from L. interrogans serovar Canicola was used for polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, and expression of the lipL32 gene in E. coli to amplify, clone, and express the lipL32 gene.
RESULTS: Australis was the common serovar seen at all the study centers. Serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae was seen in samples from Tamil Nadu and Assam. In-house ELISA was standardized using the purified recombinant LipL32 polypeptide and was used to evaluate serum. Subsequently, acute serum samples from leptospirosis patients (n = 60) were screened. Compared to the gold standard, the microscopic agglutination test, sensitivity and specificity of the in-house ELISA was 95% and 90%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding Leptospira serovars circulating in leptospirosis-endemic areas will help to formulate better vaccines. LipL32-based ELISA may serve as a valuable tool for early diagnosis of leptospirosis.","['Chandy S', 'Kirubanandhan L', 'Hemavathy P', 'Khadeeja AM', 'Kurian SJ', 'Venkataraman K', 'Mørch K', 'Mathai D', 'Manoharan A']",2017,11,3,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Chandy S, et al.

This study verified the main Leptospira spp. serovars detected by MAT from serum of patients with suspicion of leptospirosis from 2008 to 2012 in Minas Gerais State.
METHODS: The laboratory received sera from 4654 patients. All serum were screened by IgM-ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample reactive or indeterminate were tested against twenty-four serovars of Leptospira by MAT.
RESULTS: In this study, 597 patients were classified as reactive on MAT. Only 301 patients were confirmed by laboratory test. It was not possible confirmation by laboratory diagnosis of 296 patients. Among the samples classified as reactive on MAT, 273 patients exhibited titers bigger than 800 for one or more serovars; seroconversion was detected in 28 cases. Percentage of 85.1% of the samples reactive on MAT corresponded to males, 39.4% corresponded to patients aged between 20 and 39 years old. The most common serovars found were Icterohaemorrhagiae, Andamana, Patoc, Tarassovi, Copenhageni, Hardjo and Australis. Concerning the samples that exhibited titers bigger than 800, serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae was also the most common, followed by Copenhageni, Andamana, Patoc, Tarassovi, Grippotyphosa and Canicola. In this study, 40% of the cases occurred to the metropolitan area, state capital and 34 neighboring towns.

28351605,Infections associated with adventure travel: A systematic review.,"AIM: To review infections associated with adventure travel.
METHODS: The PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases were searched combining the words infection with the following keywords: rafting, whitewater, surfing, (surfer* or windsurf*), (caves or caving or spelunking), (triathlon or trekking) or (hiking or adventure race), bicycling, backpacking, (mountain climb* or bouldering), horseback riding, orienteering, trekking, and skiing.
RESULTS: Adventure travel is becoming much more common among travelers and it is associated with a subset of infectious diseases including: leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, viral hemorrhagic fevers, rickettsial diseases and endemic mycosis. Caving and whitewater rafting places individuals at particular risk of leptospirosis, schistosomiasis and endemic mycosis, while adventure races also place individuals at high risk of a variety of infections including campylobacter, norovirus and leptospirosis.
CONCLUSION: Travel practitioners need to be aware of the risks associated with adventure travel and should educate individuals about the risks associated with various activities. Doxycycline prophylaxis should be considered for travelers who are susceptible to leptospirosis due to participation in high-risk sports such as whitewater rafting, caving or adventure races.","['Gundacker ND', 'Rolfe RJ', 'Rodriguez JM']",2017,16,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Gundacker ND, et al.

However, the number of arbovirus infections is usually much higher. The initial clinical presentation can be highly confusing; therefore, laboratory confirmation is key to an accurate diagnosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old man presented to a peripheral health centre with an acute febrile illness. Dengue was initially suspected, but the patient deteriorated to a shock syndrome. Leptospirosis as well as a co-infection with Zika virus were both confirmed in the laboratory, the latter being clinically masked in this dual infection.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of not only considering the differential diagnosis of acute febrile syndromes, but also to consider the possibility of dual infections in the context of global spread of arboviruses. The specific context of travellers returning from endemic areas and pregnant women is also highlighted and discussed.","['Biron A', 'Cazorla C', 'Amar J', 'Pfannstiel A', 'Dupont-Rouzeyrol M', 'Goarant C']",2016,3,3,JMM Case Rep,"Biron A, et al.

Although protective against lethal infection, particularly in animals, bacterin-induced immunity is considered short term, serovar restricted, and the vaccine can cause serious side effects. The urgent need for a new vaccine has motivated several research groups to evaluate the protective immune response induced by recombinant vaccines. Significant protection has been reported with several promising outer membrane proteins, including LipL32 and the leptospiral immunoglobulin-like proteins.

28333986,Building the road to a regional zoonoses strategy: A survey of zoonoses programmes in the Americas.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, global public health security has been threatened by zoonotic disease emergence as exemplified by outbreaks of H5N1 and H1N1 influenza, SARS, and most recently Ebola and Zika. Additionally, endemic zoonoses, such as rabies, burden countries year after year, placing demands on limited finances and personnel. To survey the baseline status of the emerging and endemic zoonoses programmes of the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) countries, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) conducted a survey of priority emerging and endemic zoonoses, countries´ prioritization criteria and methodologies, and suggestions to strengthen countries capacities and regional approaches to zoonoses control.
METHODS: A fillable online questionnaire was sent to the zoonoses programme managers of the Ministries of Health (MOH) and Ministries of Agriculture (MAg) of 33 LAC countries from January to April of 2015. The questionnaire comprised 36 single, multiple choice and open-ended questions to inform the objectives of the survey. A descriptive exploratory analysis was completed.
RESULTS: Fifty-four ministries (26 MOH, 25 MAg, and 3 combined responses) in 31 LAC countries responded to the survey. Within the ministries, 22 (85%) MOH, 5 (20%) MAg, and 2 (67%) combined entities indicated they had specialized zoonoses units. For endemic zoonoses, 32 of 54 ministries responded that they conduct formal prioritization exercises, most of them annually (69%). The three priority endemic zoonoses for the MOHs were leptospirosis, rabies, and brucellosis while the three priorities for the MAgs were brucellosis, rabies, and tuberculosis. Diagnosis for rabies and leptospirosis were cited as the capacities most in need of development. The most needed cross-cutting capacity was coordination between stakeholders. For emerging zoonoses, 28 ministries performed formal prioritization exercises. The top prioritization criteria were probability of introduction into the country and impact. The three priority emerging zoonoses for the MOHs were Ebola viral disease, avian influenza, and Chikungunya while for the MAgs were avian influenza, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and West Nile virus disease. Surveillance for avian influenza and Ebola, and diagnosis for BSE were quoted as the capacities most needed. For all zoonoses, the majority of respondents (69%) ranked their relationship with the other Ministry as productive or very productive, and 31% minimally productive. Many countries requested a formal regional network, better regional communication and collaboration, and integrated surveillance.
CONCLUSIONS: The survey is the first comprehensive effort to date to inform the status of zoonoses programmes in LAC. The information collected here will be used to develop a regional strategy for zoonoses (both endemic and emerging), increase efforts, advocacy, and promote prompt identification and management of EIDs and improvement of endemic programmes.","['Maxwell MJ', 'Freire de Carvalho MH', 'Hoet AE', 'Vigilato MA', 'Pompei JC', 'Cosivi O', 'Del Rio Vilas VJ']",2017,12,3,PLoS One,"Maxwell MJ, et al.

28332927,Leptospira spp. in Small Mammals from Areas with Low and High Human Hantavirus Incidences in South-West Germany.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is caused by Leptospira spp. and is considered the most widespread zoonotic disease worldwide. It mimics nephropathia epidemica in humans, a disease mainly caused by Puumala hantavirus (PUUV). Small mammals are reservoirs for Leptospira spp. and PUUV. Seewis virus (SWSV) is a shrew-borne hantavirus with unknown pathogenicity. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence for Leptospira spp. and the frequency of Leptospira-hantavirus co-infections in small mammals collected at locations with high and low incidences in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2012 and 2013, 736 small mammals belonging to seven species (Apodemus flavicollis, Microtus agrestis, Microtus arvalis, Myodes glareolus, Sorex araneus, S. coronatus, and S. minutus) were collected at four high incidence sites (H1-H4) and four low (L1-L4) incidence sites for PUUV infection in humans. Kidney-derived DNA samples were tested for Leptospira spp. by real-time PCR targeting the lipl 32 gene and further analyzed by duplex PCR targeting the flaB and the secY genes. For the detection of Seewis virus, lung-derived DNA was tested via RT-PCR targeting the nucleocapsid gene.
RESULTS: Altogether, 42 of the 736 small mammals including 27 of 660 bank voles and 11 of 66 shrews, were positive for Leptospira spp., while Sorex spp. (14.7%) showed significantly higher prevalences compared to bank voles (4.1%). Detected Leptospira spp. were pathogenic species other than L. kirschneri. Significantly more Leptospira-positive bank voles were found at H sites than at L sites. Altogether 22.2% of positive bank voles were infected with PUUV. Double infection of PUUV and Leptospira spp. occurrence in bank voles is 1.86 times (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 0.72-4.73) more likely than infections with each pathogen separately.
DISCUSSION: Leptospira- positive bank voles are focally positively associated with PUUV infection in bank voles and with human hantavirus cases. It should be considered that shrews may serve as Leptospira spp. reservoirs.","['Obiegala A', 'Albrecht C', 'Dafalla M', 'Drewes S', 'Oltersdorf C', 'Turni H', 'Imholt C', 'Jacob J', 'Wagner-Wiening C', 'Ulrich RG', 'Pfeffer M']",2017,17,5,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Obiegala A, et al.

28330498,"Identification of cattle, buffaloes and rodents as reservoir animals of Leptospira in the District of Gampaha, Sri Lanka.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important emerging infectious disease in Sri Lanka. Rats are the most important reservoir of Leptospira but domestic and wild mammals may also act as important maintenance or accidental hosts. In Sri Lanka, knowledge of reservoir animals of leptospires is poor. The objective of this study was to identify potential reservoir animals of Leptospira in the District of Gampaha, Sri Lanka.
FINDINGS: Blood and kidney samples were collected from 38 rodents and mid-stream urine samples were randomly collected from 45 cattle and five buffaloes in the District of Gampaha. Kidney and urine samples were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum samples were tested by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Of the 38 rodent kidney samples, 11% (4/38) were positive by real-time PCR. The prevalence of leptospiral carriage was 11% (3/26) and 8% (1/12) in female and male rodents, respectively. Three rodent serum samples were positive by MAT. Of the 50 cattle/buffalo urine samples tested, 10% (5/50) were positive by real-time PCR. The prevalence of leptospiral carriage was 9% (4/45) and 20% (1/5) in cattle and buffaloes, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Results of PCR and MAT showed that Leptospira were present in a significant proportion of the rodents and farm animals tested in this study and suggest that these (semi-) domestic animals form an infection reservoir for Leptospira. Therefore, there is a potential zoonotic risk to public health, most notably to farmers in this area.","['Denipitiya DT', 'Chandrasekharan NV', 'Abeyewickreme W', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Hapugoda MD']",2017,10,1,BMC Res Notes,"Denipitiya DT, et al.

28321895,The role of Leptospira spp. in horses affected with recurrent uveitis in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a common cause of ocular pain and blindness in horses. Leptospira spp. have been commonly implicated in the pathophysiology of ERU in mainland Europe and the USA. No recent studies have been carried out in the UK, but Leptospira is reported not to be a major factor in the aetiology of ERU in the UK.
OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence of Leptospira-associated ERU in the UK and to identify the serovars involved in these cases; to compare serum vs. aqueous humour antibody levels in cases and controls in order to confirm the diagnosis of Leptospira-associated ERU, and to assess the usefulness of serology alone as a confirmatory test for Leptospira-associated ERU in the UK.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study.
METHODS: Eyes enucleated for clinical reasons in ERU-affected horses were collected. Blood and aqueous humour were obtained to determine antibody levels against a variety of Leptospira serovars and C-values (aqueous humour value/serum value) were calculated. In addition, eyes, blood and aqueous humour were obtained from control cases for comparison. Histopathology was performed in all eyes to confirm uveitis in each case. Differences in seroprevalences between ERU and control cases and between Leptospira- and non-Leptospira-associated ERU cases were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 30 ERU and 43 control eyes were analysed. Of the ERU eyes, only two had a C-value of >4 (prevalence of Leptospira-associated uveitis: 6.7%). Serovars hardjo and javanica were detected. There was no difference in seroprevalence between horses with uveitis and control cases (65.5% and 41.9%, respectively; P = 0.11) or between Leptospira- and non-Leptospira-associated uveitis cases (100% and 63.0%, respectively; P = 0.52).
MAIN LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by low case numbers. Eyes were presented at different stages of disease. The only test used to detect Leptospira was the microscopic agglutination test.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospira-associated ERU is uncommon in the UK. Serology alone may not help to definitively diagnose Leptospira-associated uveitis in this country.","['Malalana F', 'Blundell RJ', 'Pinchbeck GL', 'Mcgowan CM']",2017,49,6,Equine Vet J,"Malalana F, et al.

From 2009 to 2012 we observed high pup mortality (up to 67%) in colonies close to the Galapagos capital, Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, where contact with humans, domestic animals, and rats is frequent. Gross postmortem findings from 54 pups included hemorrhagic lesions in liver and congestion in lungs; histopathology suggested a possible association with infectious diseases. Evidence of Leptospira infection was found in five out of seven samples collected in 2010. Canine distemper viral (CDV) RNA was detected in tissues from six sea lions (in 2011-12), four of which were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The absence of CDV antibodies in 109 juvenile animals tested in 2014 at urban and remote colonies could indicate that the CDV infection observed in 2011 was likely confined to a few animals.

METHOD: From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2010, patients with leptospirosis (ICD-9 code 100) who did not have a history of depression (ICD-9-CM codes 296.2, 296.3, 300.4, and 311) before the index date were enrolled (leptospirosis cohort). For each patient with leptospirosis, 1 control without a history of leptospirosis and depression was randomly selected (nonleptospirosis cohort). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the risk of depression according to sex, age, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: In the leptospirosis and nonleptospirosis cohorts, we observed 34 patients with depression, with the incidence rate of 2.87 per 1,000 person-years, and 25 patients with depression, with the incidence rate of 1.93 per 1,000 person-years, respectively, yielding a crude hazard ratio (HR) of 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.77) and an adjusted HR (aHR) of 1.58 (95% CI, 1.34-1.88). Compared with the nonleptospirosis cohort, the leptospirosis cohort had a risk of depression stratified by sex, age, and comorbidity that was higher in female patients (aHR = 2.08; 95% CI, 1.54-2.80), patients younger than 49 years old (aHR = 3.19; 95% CI, 2.39-4.27), and patients without comorbidity (aHR = 2.14; 95% CI, 1.68-2.71). The risk of depression was higher in women than in men (aHR = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.61-2.25) and in patients with comorbidities, namely hyperlipidemia (aHR = 1.80; 95% CI, 1.40-2.31), coronary artery disease (aHR = 2.47; 95% CI, 1.96-3.12), stroke (aHR = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.39-2.24), and septicemia (aHR = 2.06; 95% CI, 1.64-2.58).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with leptospirosis have a 1.58-fold higher risk of depression than that in the general population. Physicians should be alert to the emotional condition and depression symptoms of people who had been suffering from leptospirosis.","['Chiu CH', 'Wang YC', 'Lin CL', 'Lee FY', 'Kao CH']",2017,78,4,J Clin Psychiatry,"Chiu CH, et al.

Although it plays an essential role in translational motility and pathogenicity, no structures of FcpA homologues are currently available in the PDB. Its three-dimensional structure will unveil the novel motility mechanisms that render pathogenic Leptospira particularly efficient at invading and disseminating within their hosts, causing leptospirosis in humans and animals. FcpA from L. interrogans was purified and crystallized, but despite laborious attempts no useful X ray diffraction data could be obtained. This challenge was solved by expressing a close orthologue from the related saprophytic species L. biflexa. Three different crystal forms were obtained: a primitive and a centred monoclinic form, as well as a hexagonal variant. All forms diffracted X-rays to suitable resolutions for crystallographic analyses, with the hexagonal type typically reaching the highest limits of 2.0 Å and better. A variation of the quick-soaking procedure resulted in an iodide derivative that was instrumental for single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods.","['San Martin F', 'Mechaly AE', 'Larrieux N', 'Wunder EA', 'Ko AI', 'Picardeau M', 'Trajtenberg F', 'Buschiazzo A']",2017,73,Pt 3,Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun,"San Martin F, et al.

28256121,Thermo-Magnetoresponsive Dual Function Nanoparticles: An Approach for Magnetic Entrapable-Releasable Chitosan.,"Magnetic polymeric nanoparticles can be used for selective binding in a magnetic field. However, as the magnetic nanoparticles (MAG) are stabilized with polymers, the separation of the MAG from the polymer chains after use is difficult. This work proposes a combination of a thermoresponsive polymer with MAG allows for the as-desired simple removal of MAG from the polymer chains. For this, chitosan (CS) was conjugated with thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and antibody (Ab) together with the physisorbed MAG as a thermo-magneto dual functional material. The key synthesis steps are (i) radical polymerization of NIPAM in the presence of mercaptoacetic acid so that the PNIPAM obtained contains terminal carboxylic acid groups (PNIPAM-COOH), (ii) the CS-N-hydroxysuccinamide water-based system that allows conjugation of CS with PNIPAM-COOH in water at room temperature, and (iii) the weak interaction between MAG and the CS chain. As a model application, CS is conjugated with the antirecombinant Leptospirosis Ab (rLipL32) to allow the selective binding and collection of the target antigen under the dual functions. This is the first demonstration of a simple but effective solution for MAG exclusion from the target molecules and will be practical for diverse applications, such as diagnosis, sensors, filtration, etc.","['Pitakchatwong C', 'Chirachanchai S']",2017,9,12,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,Pitakchatwong C and Chirachanchai S.

28254582,A cross-sectional epidemiological study of domestic animals related to human leptospirosis cases in Nicaragua.,"Leptospirosis is one of the most extended zoonosis worldwide and humans become infected most commonly through contact with the urine of carrier animals, either directly or via contaminated water or soil. The aim in this study was to analyse the epidemiological behaviour of Leptospira spp., from domestic animals around the sites of human leptospirosis cases in Nicaragua, from 2007 through 2013. We report the results of a cross-sectional epidemiological study with a non-probability sampling of blood (n=3050) and urine (n=299) from Domestic Animals (DA) around the sites of human leptospirosis cases in Nicaragua. We analysed data obtained through Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), in-vitro culture, real time PCR and sequencing of lfb1 locus. Frequencies of 30.31% (95% CI: 28.66-31.95) and 15.38% (95% CI: 11.12-19.64) were obtained from serological test and from in-vitro culture, respectively. Although similar frequencies from serology test (P≥0.05) were found in DA species, in-vitro culture frequencies were significantly higher from bovine, equine and sheep (P<0.05) in comparison with swine and canine species. Ten serogroups of pathogenic Leptospira spp. were encountered, with the highest presence of Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup 34.65% (95% CI: 29.35-39.94). We identified 7 samples homologous to L. interrogans species Pyrogenes serovar and 3 samples as L. noguchii Louisiana or Panama serovars by analysis of lfb1 sequences. We were able to establish a temporal and spatial correlation from DA and cumulative incidence of human cases. Therefore an effective epidemiological surveillance should be implemented with a specific control program toward DA in order to reduce human leptospirosis incidence.","['Flores BJ', 'Pérez-Sánchez T', 'Fuertes H', 'Sheleby-Elías J', 'Múzquiz JL', 'Jirón W', 'Duttmann C', 'Halaihel N']",2017,170,,Acta Trop,"Flores BJ, et al.

30183962,[Prevalence of leptospirosis in Colombia: systematic literature review].,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic literature review to identify the prevalence of leptospirosis in Colombia between 2000 and 2012.
METHODS: Descriptive studies conducted and published between 2000 and 2012 on the prevalence of leptospirosis in humans, animals and the environment using microagglutination (MAT) and immunoassay (ELISA) diagnostic methods, were selected. The exclusion criteria included studies in languages other than Spanish, English and Portuguese, in which the prevalence of leptospirosis was determined by immunofluorescence (IF), or serum agglutination test (SAT).
RESULTS: Out of 91 articles reviewed in the different databases, 18 were selected since they met the inclusion criteria, which sought to determine the prevalence of leptospirosis in humans, canines, cattle, pigs, primates and rodents in the Atlántico, Antioquia, Meta, Córdoba, Risaralda, Tolima, Boyacá, Quindío and Valle del Cauca departments.
CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review allowed to determine the departments of the country where leptospirosis research is concentrated, as well as the authors with the highest number of publications on prevalence. The prevalence was found to be between 6% and 35% in humans, 41% and 60.9% in cattle, 10.3% in pigs, 12% and 47.14% in canines, 23.07 % in non-human primates, and the highest figure, between 25% and 82.7% in rodents, showing that the most frequent serovars were Icterohaemorrhagiae, Grippotyphosa and Canicola.","['Carreño LA', 'Salas D', 'Beltrán KB']",2017,19,2,Rev Salud Publica (Bogota),"Carreño LA, et al.

28245231,Adipose tissue is the first colonization site of Leptospira interrogans in subcutaneously infected hamsters.,"Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonoses in the world, and its most severe form in humans, ""Weil's disease,"" may lead to jaundice, hemorrhage, renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome, and sometimes,fatal multiple organ failure. Although the mechanisms underlying jaundice in leptospirosis have been gradually unraveled, the pathophysiology and distribution of leptospires during the early stage of infection are not well understood. Therefore, we investigated the hamster leptospirosis model, which is the accepted animal model of human Weil's disease, by using an in vivo imaging system to observe the whole bodies of animals infected with Leptospira interrogans and to identify the colonization and growth sites of the leptospires during the early phase of infection. Hamsters, infected subcutaneously with 104 bioluminescent leptospires, were analyzed by in vivo imaging, organ culture, and microscopy. The results showed that the luminescence from the leptospires spread through each hamster's body sequentially. The luminescence was first detected at the injection site only, and finally spread to the central abdomen, in the liver area. Additionally, the luminescence observed in the adipose tissue was the earliest detectable compared with the other organs, indicating that the leptospires colonized the adipose tissue at the early stage of leptospirosis. Adipose tissue cultures of the leptospires became positive earlier than the blood cultures. Microscopic analysis revealed that the leptospires colonized the inner walls of the blood vessels in the adipose tissue. In conclusion, this is the first study to report that adipose tissue is an important colonization site for leptospires, as demonstrated by microscopy and culture analyses of adipose tissue in the hamster model of Weil's disease.","['Ozuru R', 'Saito M', 'Kanemaru T', 'Miyahara S', 'Villanueva SY', 'Murray GL', 'Adler B', 'Fujii J', 'Yoshida SI']",2017,12,2,PLoS One,"Ozuru R, et al.

28241042,Seeking the environmental source of Leptospirosis reveals durable bacterial viability in river soils.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important re-emerging infectious disease that affects humans worldwide. Infection occurs from indirect environment-mediated exposure to pathogenic leptospires through contaminated watered environments. The ability of pathogenic leptospires to persist in the aqueous environment is a key factor in transmission to new hosts. Hence, an effort was made to detect pathogenic leptospires in complex environmental samples, to genotype positive samples and to assess leptospiral viability over time.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We focused our study on human leptospirosis cases infected with the New Caledonian Leptospira interrogans serovar Pyrogenes. Epidemiologically related to freshwater contaminations, this strain is responsible for ca. 25% of human cases in New Caledonia. We screened soil and water samples retrieved from suspected environmental infection sites for the pathogen-specific leptospiral gene lipL-32. Soil samples from all suspected infection sites tested showed detectable levels of pathogenic leptospiral DNA. More importantly, we demonstrated by viability qPCR that those pathogenic leptospires were viable and persisted in infection sites for several weeks after the index contamination event. Further, molecular phylogenetic analyses of the leptospiral lfb-1 gene successfully linked the identity of environmental Leptospira to the corresponding human-infecting strain.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, this study illustrates the potential of quantitative viability-PCR assay for the rapid detection of viable leptospires in environmental samples, which might open avenues to strategies aimed at assessing environmental risk.","['Thibeaux R', 'Geroult S', 'Benezech C', 'Chabaud S', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Girault D', 'Bierque E', 'Goarant C']",2017,11,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Thibeaux R, et al.

28237664,Il-10 deficient mice express IFN-γ mRNA and clear Leptospira interrogans from their kidneys more rapidly than normal C57BL/6 mice.,"Leptospira interrogans (L. interrogans), the causative agent of leptospirosis, is a widespread zoonotic spirochete that lives a dual lifestyle. L. interrogans infects mice, rats, and wildlife in a persistent and asymptomatic fashion, while also causing productive and acute infections in other mammals such as humans and hamsters. Infections in humans can be fatal, accompanied by a cytokine storm and shock-like symptoms. Production of IL-10 has been noted in both rodent and human infections which has led a number of investigators to hypothesize that IL-10 plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. To test this hypothesis we have compared bacteremia and the cytokine response of normal and IL-10 deficient C57Bl/6 mice following ip infection with L. interrogans. In normal mice bacterial 16s mRNA was detected in both lung and kidney tissues within a day after infection. Levels of 16s mRNA then dropped in both organs with complete elimination from the lung by day 3 but persistence in the kidney for 7days after infection. In contrast, in IL-10 deficient mice, the organism was eliminated more rapidly from the kidney. We found that infection of both control and IL-10 deficient mice produced similar levels of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs. On the other hand, IFN-γ mRNA was only induced in IL-10 deficient mice. These results support the hypothesis that L. interrogans ability to induce IL-10, which in turn prevents production of IFN-γ and inhibits T cell immunity, may contribute to the persistent growth of this microorganism in the murine kidney.","['Devlin AA', 'Halvorsen PJ', 'Miller JC', 'Laster SM']",2017,222,5,Immunobiology,"Devlin AA, et al.

28220151,Prioritizing zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia using a one health approach.,"BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has the second largest human population in Africa and the largest livestock population on the continent. About 80% of Ethiopians are dependent on agriculture and have direct contact with livestock or other domestic animals. As a result, the country is vulnerable to the spread of zoonotic diseases. As the first step of the country's engagement in the Global Health Security Agenda, a zoonotic disease prioritization workshop was held to identify significant zoonotic diseases of mutual concern for animal and human health agencies.
METHODS: A semi-quantitative tool developed by the US CDC was used for prioritization of zoonotic diseases. Workshop participants representing human, animal, and environmental health ministries were selected as core decision-making participants. Over 300 articles describing the zoonotic diseases considered at the workshop were reviewed for disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and DALYs for Ethiopia or the East Africa region. Committee members individually ranked the importance of each criterion to generate a final group weight for each criterion.
RESULTS: Forty-three zoonotic diseases were evaluated. Criteria selected in order of importance were: 1)severity of disease in humans, 2)proportion of human disease attributed to animal exposure, 3)burden of animal disease, 4)availability of interventions, and 5)existing inter-sectoral collaboration. Based on the results from the decision tree analysis and subsequent discussion, participants identified the following five priority zoonotic diseases: rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, and echinococcosis.
DISCUSSION: Multi-sectoral collaborations strengthen disease surveillance system development in humans and animals, enhance laboratory capacity, and support implementation of prevention and control strategies. To facilitate this, the creation of a One Health-focused Zoonotic Disease Unit is recommended. Enhancement of public health and veterinary laboratories, joint outbreak and surveillance activities, and intersectoral linkages created to tackle the prioritized zoonotic diseases will undoubtedly prepare the country to effectively address newly emerging zoonotic diseases.","['Pieracci EG', 'Hall AJ', 'Gharpure R', 'Haile A', 'Walelign E', 'Deressa A', 'Bahiru G', 'Kibebe M', 'Walke H', 'Belay E']",2016,2,,One Health,"Pieracci EG, et al.

28213654,Molecular Epidemiology of Leptospira Serogroup Pomona Infections Among Wild and Domestic Animals in Spain.,"Strains of Leptospira serogroup Pomona are known to cause widespread animal infections in many parts of the world. Forty-three isolates retrieved from domestic animals and wild small mammals suggest that serogroup Pomona is epidemiologically relevant in Spain. This is supported by the high prevalence of serovar Pomona antibodies in livestock and wild animals. In this study, the strains were serologically and genetically characterized in an attempt to elucidate their epidemiology. Serological typing was based on the microscopic agglutination test but molecular typing involved species-specific polymerase chain reaction, restriction endonuclease analysis, and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis. The study revealed that the infections are caused by two serovars, namely Pomona and Mozdok. Serovar Pomona was derived only from farm animals and may be adapted to pigs, which are recognized as the maintenance host. The results demonstrated that serovar Pomona is genetically heterogeneous and three different types were recognized. This heterogeneity was correlated with different geographical distributions of the isolates. All strains derived from small wild mammals were identified as serovar Mozdok. Some isolates of this serovar retrieved from cattle confirm that this serovar may also be the cause of infections in food-producing animals for which these wild species may be source of infection.","['Arent ZJ', 'Gilmore C', 'San-Miguel Ayanz JM', 'Neyra LQ', 'García-Peña FJ']",2017,14,1,Ecohealth,"Arent ZJ, et al.

In an effort to reduce uterine inflammatory responses induced by Leptospira, we evaluated the anti-inflammation effects of emodin, thymol, and astragalin in a mouse model. Our results showed that treatment with emodin, thymol, and astragalin alleviated uterine inflammation induced by leptospira infection via suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and prevented tissue damage. Furthermore, we used primary endometrium epithelial cells to show that treatment with these chemicals inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Western blot results showed that these chemicals suppressed the phosphorylation of p38, p65, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These results indicate that treatment with emodin, thymol, and astragalin suppressed inflammatory response by regulating NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in leptospira-infected uterine and endometrium epithelial cells of mice.","['Zhang W', 'Lu X', 'Wang W', 'Ding Z', 'Fu Y', 'Zhou X', 'Zhang N', 'Cao Y']",2017,40,2,Inflammation,"Zhang W, et al.

OBJECTIVES: Investigate job-specific Leptospira seroprevalence and its association with kidney disease biomarkers.
METHODS: In 282 sugarcane workers, 47 sugarcane applicants and 160 workers in other industries, we measured anti-leptospiral antibodies, serum creatinine, and urinary injury biomarkers, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase (NAG).
RESULTS: Leptospira seroprevalence differed among job categories and was highest among sugarcane cutters (59%). Seropositive sugarcane workers had higher NGAL concentrations (relative mean: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.94-1.75) compared to those who were seronegative, with similar findings among field and non-field workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospira seroprevalence varied by job category. There was some indication that seropositivity was associated with elevated biomarker levels, but results were inconsistent.

28207932,Detecting signals of chronic shedding to explain pathogen persistence: Leptospira interrogans in California sea lions.,"Identifying mechanisms driving pathogen persistence is a vital component of wildlife disease ecology and control. Asymptomatic, chronically infected individuals are an oft-cited potential reservoir of infection, but demonstrations of the importance of chronic shedding to pathogen persistence at the population-level remain scarce. Studying chronic shedding using commonly collected disease data is hampered by numerous challenges, including short-term surveillance that focuses on single epidemics and acutely ill individuals, the subtle dynamical influence of chronic shedding relative to more obvious epidemic drivers, and poor ability to differentiate between the effects of population prevalence of chronic shedding vs. intensity and duration of chronic shedding in individuals. We use chronic shedding of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) as a case study to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Using leptospirosis-induced strands as a measure of disease incidence, we fit models with and without chronic shedding, and with different seasonal drivers, to determine the time-scale over which chronic shedding is detectable and the interactions between chronic shedding and seasonal drivers needed to explain persistence and outbreak patterns. Chronic shedding can enable persistence of L. interrogans within the sea lion population. However, the importance of chronic shedding was only apparent when surveillance data included at least two outbreaks and the intervening inter-epidemic trough during which fadeout of transmission was most likely. Seasonal transmission, as opposed to seasonal recruitment of susceptibles, was the dominant driver of seasonality in this system, and both seasonal factors had limited impact on long-term pathogen persistence. We show that the temporal extent of surveillance data can have a dramatic impact on inferences about population processes, where the failure to identify both short- and long-term ecological drivers can have cascading impacts on understanding higher order ecological phenomena, such as pathogen persistence.","['Buhnerkempe MG', 'Prager KC', 'Strelioff CC', 'Greig DJ', 'Laake JL', 'Melin SR', 'DeLong RL', 'Gulland FM', 'Lloyd-Smith JO']",2017,86,3,J Anim Ecol,"Buhnerkempe MG, et al.

Positivity by urine PCR in rainy seasons was 42.3% (153/362) and 33.2% (73/220; P = 0.0296) in dry seasons. Additionally, increases in rainfall rates had different effects on host-adapted (serogroup Sejroe) and incidental (all other serogroups) leptospiral infections. There was a significant increase in the number of cattle shedding Leptospira during the rainy season (CI 1.04-2.09; P = 0.0296), suggesting temporary (transient) urinary shedding of incidental serogroups.

Investigations were carried out to determine the aetiology, and to describe the epidemiology of the outbreak. The data on fever cases attending Primary Health Centre (PHC), Havelock showed that the average number of cases reporting per week over the last 2 years was 46·1 (95% confidence interval 19·4-72·9). A total of 27 (43·5%) patients out of the 62 suspected cases were diagnosed as having DENV infection based on a positive enzyme immunoassay or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The overall attack rate was 9·4 cases/1000 population and it ranged between 2·8 and 18·8/1000 in different villages. The nucleotide sequencing showed that the virus responsible was DENV-3. DENV-3 was first detected in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands in 2013 among wharf workers in Port Blair and within a year it has spread to Havelock Island which is separated from South Andaman by 36 nautical miles.","['Kartick C', 'Bharathi GSJ', 'Surya P', 'Anwesh M', 'Arun S', 'Muruganandam N', 'Avijit R', 'Vijayachari P']",2017,145,7,Epidemiol Infect,"Kartick C, et al.

28182662,"Investigation on predominant Leptospira serovars and its distribution in humans and livestock in Thailand, 2010-2015.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic bacterial disease caused by infection with leptospires. Leptospirosis in humans and livestock is an endemic and epidemic disease in Thailand. Livestock may act as reservoirs for leptospires and source for human infection.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data on leptospirosis infection in humans and livestock (Buffaloes, Cattle, and Pigs) species during 2010 to 2015 were analyzed. Serum samples were examined using Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) to identify antibodies against Leptospira serovars using a cut-off titer ≥ 1:100. The seroprevalence was 23.7% in humans, 24.8% in buffaloes, 28.1% in cattle, and 11.3% in pigs. Region specific prevalence among humans and livestock was found in a wide range. The most predominant serovars were Shermani, followed by Bratislava, Panama, and Sejroe in human, Shermani, Ranarum, and Tarassovi in buffaloes, and Shermani and Ranarum in cattle and pigs. Equally highest MAT titers against multiple serovars per one sample were found mainly in buffaloes and cattle showing equally titers against Ranarum and Shermani. The correlations of distribution of serovars across Thailand's regions were found to be similar in pattern for cattle but not for buffaloes. In humans, the serovar distribution in the south differed from other regions. By logistic regression, the results indicated that livestock is more susceptible to infection by serovar Shermani when compared to humans.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study gives a detailed picture of the predominance of Leptospira serovars in relation to region, humans and typical livestock. The broad spatial distribution of seroprevalence was analyzed across and within species as well as regions in Thailand. Our finding may guide public health policy makers to implement appropriate control measures and help to reduce the impact of leptospirosis in Thailand.","['Chadsuthi S', 'Bicout DJ', 'Wiratsudakul A', 'Suwancharoen D', 'Petkanchanapong W', 'Modchang C', 'Triampo W', 'Ratanakorn P', 'Chalvet-Monfray K']",2017,11,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Chadsuthi S, et al.

28162129,Assessment of community awareness and risk perceptions of zoonotic causes of abortion in cattle at three selected livestock-wildlife interface areas of Zimbabwe.,"A study was conducted to assess the awareness of cattle abortions due to brucellosis, Rift Valley fever (RVF) and leptospirosis, and to compare frequencies of reported abortions in communities living at the periphery of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area in southeastern Zimbabwe. Three study sites were selected based on the type of livestock-wildlife interface: porous livestock-wildlife interface (unrestricted); non-porous livestock-wildlife interface (restricted by fencing); and livestock-wildlife non-interface (totally absent or control). Respondents randomly selected from a list of potential cattle farmers (N = 379) distributed at porous (40·1%), non-interface (35·5%) and non-porous (26·4%), were interviewed using a combined close- and open-ended questionnaire. Focus group discussions were conducted with 10-12 members of each community. More abortions in the last 5 years were reported from the porous interface (52%) and a significantly higher per cent of respondents from the porous interface (P < 0·05) perceived wildlife as playing a role in livestock abortions compared with the other interface types. The odds of reporting abortions in cattle were higher in large herd sizes (odds ratio (OR) = 2·6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·5-4·3), porous (OR = 1·9; 95% CI 1·0-3·5) and non-porous interface (OR = 2·2; 95% CI 1·1-4·3) compared with livestock-wildlife non-interface areas. About 21·6% of the respondents knew brucellosis as a cause of abortion, compared with RVF (9·8%) and leptospirosis (3·7%). These results explain to some extent, the existence of human/wildlife conflict in the studied livestock-wildlife interface areas of Zimbabwe, which militates against biodiversity conservation efforts. The low awareness of zoonoses means the public is at risk of contracting some of these infections. Thus, further studies should focus on livestock-wildlife interface areas to assess if the increased rates of abortions reported in cattle may be due to exposure to wildlife or other factors. The government of Zimbabwe needs to launch educational programmes on public health awareness in these remote areas at the periphery of transfrontier conservation areas where livestock-wildlife interface exists to help mitigate the morbidity and mortality of people from some of the known zoonotic diseases.","['Ndengu M', 'DE Garine-Wichatitsky M', 'Pfukenyi DM', 'Tivapasi M', 'Mukamuri B', 'Matope G']",2017,145,7,Epidemiol Infect,"Ndengu M, et al.

28161462,Immune response and protective profile elicited by a multi-epitope chimeric protein derived from Leptospira interrogans.,"INTRODUCTION: Pathogenic Leptospira is the causative agent of leptospirosis, a widely disseminated disease of human and veterinary concern. The development of vaccines that elicit cross-protective immunity through multiple leptospiral serovars has long been pursued. The aim of this study was to develop a novel chimeric multi-epitope fusion antigen, containing sequences of previously studied outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Leptospira.
METHODS: The chimeric protein was designed based on the amino acid sequences of the LigA, Mce, Lsa45, OmpL1, and LipL41 proteins, cloned into pAE vector, the protein expressed in Escherichia coli, and its immune response evaluated in the hamster infection model.
RESULTS: The recombinant chimeric protein (rChi) was recognized by antibodies present in serum samples of confirmed cases of human leptospirosis and experimentally infected hamsters, demonstrating that the rChi protein participates in the immune response activation during infection. However, despite high antibody titers achieved when the rChi protein was administered with either Alhydrogel or Bordetella pertussis monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), only 50% of the hamsters were protected against infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a complete characterization of the immune response elicited by rChi/adjuvant in hamsters is required, it is believed that the construction of chimeric genes is an important attempt towards the generation of an effective vaccine against leptospirosis.","['Fernandes LGV', 'Teixeira AF', 'Filho AFS', 'Souza GO', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Heinemann MB', 'Romero EC', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2017,57,,Int J Infect Dis,"Fernandes LGV, et al.

28141801,Distinct antibody responses of patients with mild and severe leptospirosis determined by whole proteome microarray analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease worldwide. Humans usually present a mild non-specific febrile illness, but a proportion of them develop more severe outcomes, such as multi-organ failure, lung hemorrhage and death. Such complications are thought to depend on several factors, including the host immunity. Protective immunity is associated with humoral immune response, but little is known about the immune response mounted during naturally-acquired Leptospira infection.
METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we used protein microarray chip to profile the antibody responses of patients with severe and mild leptospirosis against the complete Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni predicted ORFeome. We discovered a limited number of immunodominant antigens, with 36 antigens specific to patients, of which 11 were potential serodiagnostic antigens, identified at acute phase, and 33 were potential subunit vaccine targets, detected after recovery. Moreover, we found distinct antibody profiles in patients with different clinical outcomes: in the severe group, overall IgM responses do not change and IgG responses increase over time, while both IgM and IgG responses remain stable in the mild patient group. Analyses of individual patients' responses showed that >74% of patients in the severe group had significant IgG increases over time compared to 29% of patients in the mild group. Additionally, 90% of IgM responses did not change over time in the mild group, compared to ~51% in the severe group.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we detected antibody profiles associated with disease severity and speculate that patients with mild disease were protected from severe outcomes due to pre-existing antibodies, while patients with severe leptospirosis demonstrated an antibody profile typical of first exposure. Our findings represent a significant advance in the understanding of the humoral immune response to Leptospira infection, and we have identified new targets for the development of subunit vaccines and diagnostic tests.","['Lessa-Aquino C', 'Lindow JC', 'Randall A', 'Wunder E', 'Pablo J', 'Nakajima R', 'Jasinskas A', 'Cruz JS', 'Damião AO', 'Nery N', 'Ribeiro GS', 'Costa F', 'Hagan JE', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI', 'Medeiros MA', 'Felgner PL']",2017,11,1,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lessa-Aquino C, et al.

28138052,Estimating Burdens of Neglected Tropical Zoonotic Diseases on Islands with Introduced Mammals.,"Many neglected tropical zoonotic pathogens are maintained by introduced mammals, and on islands the most common introduced species are rodents, cats, and dogs. Management of introduced mammals, including control or eradication of feral populations, which is frequently done for ecological restoration, could also reduce or eliminate the pathogens these animals carry. Understanding the burden of these zoonotic diseases is crucial for quantifying the potential public health benefits of introduced mammal management. However, epidemiological data are only available from a small subset of islands where these introduced mammals co-occur with people. We examined socioeconomic and climatic variables as predictors for disease burdens of angiostrongyliasis, leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, toxocariasis, and rabies from 57 islands or island countries.

28133734,"Diagnostic value of two commercial chromatographic ""patient-side"" tests in the diagnosis of acute canine leptospirosis.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic performance of two patient-side tests (RDT-1: Test-it™ and RDT-2 Witness®Lepto) in the early diagnosis of canine leptospirosis.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 108 dogs with leptospirosis and 53 controls. Leptospirosis was diagnosed based on compatible clinical and clinicopathologic signs and either a single microscopic agglutination test titre_ >800 (n=49), seroconversion (n=53), positive urine real time PCR (RT-PCR) (n=1), evidence of spirochaetes in silver-stained tissues (n=1) or a combination of these (n=4). Leptospirosis was excluded in dogs with a convincing alternative diagnosis and single microscopic agglutination testing titres _<200 (n=46) or lack of seroconversion (n=7). Indices of diagnostic accuracy of the rapid diagnostic tests were calculated by comparing admission rapid diagnostic test results to the final disease status.
RESULTS: Rapid diagnostic test-1 was performed in 118 dogs, rapid diagnostic test-2 in 69 dogs and both tests in 26 dogs. Weak positive results occurred frequently representing 22·6% (rapid diagnostic test-1) and 32·3% (rapid diagnostic test-2) of all positive tests in dogs with leptospirosis. If weak positive rapid diagnostic tests were considered positive, rapid diagnostic test-1 and rapid diagnostic test-2 had sensitivities of 82 and 76%, specificities of 91 and 100%, positive predictive values of 94% and 100% and negative predictive values of 73% and 74%, respectively. There were some technical problems with rapid diagnostic test-1.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The diagnostic performance of the rapid diagnostic tests is similar to that reported for the microscopic agglutination test. Both can support a diagnosis of leptospirosis with high specificity but leptospirosis cannot be excluded based on a negative admission test result. Both RDTs are useful in conjunction with other confirmatory tests.","['Gloor CI', 'Schweighauser A', 'Francey T', 'Rodriguez-Campos S', 'Vidondo B', 'Bigler B', 'Schuller S']",2017,58,3,J Small Anim Pract,"Gloor CI, et al.

28118946,High frequency of leptospiral vaginal carriers among slaughtered cows.,"Bovine leptospirosis is one of the most important reproductive diseases that compromise the productivity of cattle farming. However, the presence of the agent on vaginal environment is still poorly understood in cattle. Considering this context, the present study aimed to detect the presence of pathogenic Leptospira sp. in vaginal fluid (VF) of cows. VF and urine were collected from 254 cows from a slaughterhouse for bacteriological culture and PCR (lipL32 gene). Overall, eleven pure culture (4.3%) of leptospiral isolates were obtained. Leptospiral DNA was detected in 128 (50.4%) of VF samples and 81 (31.0%) of urine samples, while on 75 (29.5%) it was exclusively in VF and 28 (11.3%) only in the urine. Detection of leptospiral DNA and the recovery of viable leptospires from VF of a high number of cows without apparent symptoms highlight the role of vaginal carriers and indicate that venereal transmission (female-to-male) could occur in that species. Moreover, VF should be encouraged as a valuable sample for diagnosis of bovine genital leptospirosis.","['Loureiro AP', 'Pestana C', 'Medeiros MA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2017,178,,Anim Reprod Sci,"Loureiro AP, et al.

28080908,ANTIDOG IgG SECONDARY ANTIBODY SUCCESSFULLY DETECTS IgG IN A VARIETY OF AQUATIC MAMMALS.,"Serological tests play an important role in the detection of wildlife diseases. However, while there are many commercial assays and reagents available for domestic species, there is a need to develop efficient serological assays for wildlife. In recent years, marine mammals have represented a wildlife group with emerging infectious diseases, such as influenza, brucellosis, and leptospirosis. However, with the exception of disease-agent-specific assays or functional assays, few reports describe the use of antibody detection assays in marine mammals. In an indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) or an immunofluorescence assay, antibody is detected using an antitarget species secondary conjugated antibody. The sensitivity of the assay depends on the avidity of the binding reaction between the bound antibody and the detection antibody. A commercial polyclonal antidog IgG conjugated antibody was tested in an EIA for its ability to sensitively detect the IgG of seven marine mammals including sea otter ( Enhydra lutris ), polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ), grey seal ( Halichoerus grypus ), harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina ), northern elephant seal ( Mirounga angustirostris ), California sea lion ( Zalophus californianus ), Pacific walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus ) and one freshwater mammal: Asian small-clawed otter ( Aonyx cinerea ). With the exception of Asian small-clawed sea otters, the detection of IgG in these marine mammals either exceeded or was nearly equal to detection of dog IgG. The use of the tested commercial antidog IgG antibody may be a valid approach to the detection of antibody response to disease in sea mammals.","['Roehl K', 'Jankowski M', 'Hofmeister E']",2016,47,4,J Zoo Wildl Med,"Roehl K, et al.

28077740,The Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction After Antibiotic Treatment of Spirochetal Infections: A Review of Recent Cases and Our Understanding of Pathogenesis.,"Within 24 hours after antibiotic treatment of the spirochetal infections syphilis, Lyme disease, leptospirosis, and relapsing fever (RF), patients experience shaking chills, a rise in temperature, and intensification of skin rashes known as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR) with symptoms resolving a few hours later. Case reports indicate that the JHR can also include uterine contractions in pregnancy, worsening liver and renal function, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial injury, hypotension, meningitis, alterations in consciousness, seizures, and strokes. Experimental evidence indicates it is caused by nonendotoxin pyrogen and spirochetal lipoproteins. Mediation of the JHR in RF by the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 has been proposed, consistent with measurements in patients' blood and inhibition by anti-TNF antibodies. Accelerated phagocytosis of spirochetes by polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes before rise in cytokines is responsible for removal of organisms from the blood, suggesting an early inflammatory signal from PMNs. Rarely fatal, except in neonates and in pregnancy for African women whose babies showed high perinatal mortality because of low birth weight, the JHR can be regarded as an adverse effect of antibiotics, necessary for achieving a cure of spirochetal infections.",['Butler T'],2017,96,1,Am J Trop Med Hyg,Butler T.

28069071,Sporadic cases of adult measles: a research article.,"BACKGROUND: Measles caused by a paramyxovirus, characterized by fever, malaise, cough, coryza conjunctivitis, a maculopapular rash is known to result in pneumonia, encephalitis and death. Fatal cases of measles in Sri Lanka are rare after implementation of the National Immunization Programme in 1984. Thereafter 0.1% case fatality rate was observed during October 1999-June 2000 which is a very low figure compared to other regional countries. Immunization guidelines were further revised in 2001, 2011 and in 2012 when additional immunization was recommended to age group 4-21 years; who are likely to have inadequate immunization, in order to achieve elimination of Measles by 2020. However, in 2013-2014, 4690 cases were reported and the majority were children less than 1 year of age. The occurrence in adults is hard to retrieve in published epidemiological reports, however had been 38% (out of 1008 patients) in the 3rd quarter of 2013. During this outbreak 73/101 (72%) reported from the North Central Province of Sri Lanka had been more than 12 years of age with 50% being more than 29 years. 14 Sri lankan adult patients [median age 32 years (range 25-48)] who presented sporadically from June 2014 to March 2016, with confirmed measles infection were enrolled retrospectively after informed consent. Details with regards to their clinical presentation, immunization and other relevant areas were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire or using patient management records.
RESULTS: The patients presented with high fever, headache, severe body aches, sore throat, dry cough, intense tearing, red eyes and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy over 3-5 days duration. Later they developed discrete maculopapular rash helping the diagnosis. They had a variable degree of leucopenia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia and derangements in the liver functions mimicking any other acute febrile illnesses such as dengue, chikungunya, leptospirosis or Zika virus infection.
CONCLUSION: At least a 3-5 day delay in the diagnosis was observed (even after the appearance of the rash in some patients), due to non-awareness of its occurrence, unfamiliarity of measles in adults, non-specific nature of the illness and non-availability of rapid diagnostics, risking transmission to the immune-compromised or non-immune staff or patients. Identification of the source of infection in these sporadic adult cases and their virologic surveillance and molecular epidemiology will be important to interrupt the transmission and to achieve the targeted elimination of measles from Sri Lanka by 2020.","['Premaratna R', 'Luke N', 'Perera H', 'Gunathilake M', 'Amarasena P', 'Chandrasena TG']",2017,10,1,BMC Res Notes,"Premaratna R, et al.

28056834,Comparing antibiotic treatment for leptospirosis using network meta-analysis: a tutorial.,"BACKGROUND: Network meta-analysis consists of simultaneous analysis of both direct comparisons of interventions within randomized controlled trials and indirect comparisons across trials based on a common comparator. In this paper, we aimed to characterise the conceptual understanding and the rationale for the use of network meta-analysis in assessing drug efficacy.
METHODS: We selected randomized controlled trials, assessing efficacy of antibiotics for the treatment of leptospirosis as a case study. A pairwise meta-analysis was conducted using a random effect model, assuming that different studies assessed different but related treatment effects. The analysis was then extended to a network meta-analysis, which consists of direct and indirect evidence in a network of antibiotics trials, using a suite of multivariate meta-analysis routines of STATA (mvmeta command). We also assessed an assumption of 'consistency' that estimates of treatment effects from direct and indirect evidence are in agreement.
RESULTS: Seven randomised controlled trials were identified for this analysis. These RCTs assessed the efficacy of antibiotics such as penicillin, doxycycline and cephalosporin for the treatment of human leptospirosis. These studies made comparisons between antibiotics (i.e. an antibiotic versus alternative antibiotic) in the primary study and a placebo, except for cephalosporin. These studies were sufficient to allow the creation of a network for the network meta-analysis; a closed loop in which three comparator antibiotics were connected to each other through a polygon. The comparison of penicillin versus the placebo has the largest contribution to the entire network (31.8%). The assessment of rank probabilities indicated that penicillin presented the greatest likelihood of improving efficacy among the evaluated antibiotics for treating leptospirosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that network meta-analysis, a meta-analysis comparing multiple treatments, is feasible and should be considered as better precision of effect estimates for decisions when several antibiotic options are available for the treatment of leptospirosis.","['Naing C', 'Reid SA', 'Aung K']",2017,17,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Naing C, et al.

32214618,"Towards a geocomputational landscape epidemiology: surveillance, modelling, and interventions.","The ability to explicitly represent infectious disease distributions and their risk factors over massive geographical and temporal scales has transformed how we investigate how environment impacts health. While landscape epidemiology studies have shed light on many aspects of disease distribution and risk differentials across geographies, new computational methods combined with new data sources such as citizen sensors, global spatial datasets, sensor networks, and growing availability and variety of satellite imagery offer opportunities for a more integrated approach to understanding these relationships. Additionally, a large number of new modelling and mapping methods have been developed in recent years to support the adoption of these new tools. The complexity of this research context results in study-dependent solutions and prevents landscape approaches from deeper integration into operational models and tools. In this paper we consider three common research contexts for spatial epidemiology; surveillance, modelling to estimate a spatial risk distribution and the need for intervention, and evaluating interventions and improving healthcare. A framework is proposed and a categorization of existing methods is presented. A case study into leptospirosis in Sri Lanka provides a working example of how the different phases of the framework relate to real research problems. The new framework for geocomputational landscape epidemiology encompasses four key phases: characterizing assemblages, characterizing functions, mapping interdependencies, and examining outcomes. Results from Sri Lanka provide evidence that the framework provides a useful way to structure and interpret analyses. The framework reported here is a new way to structure existing methods and tools of geocomputation that are increasingly relevant to researchers working on spatially explicit disease-landscape studies.",['Robertson C'],2017,82,2,GeoJournal,"Robertson C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 8 reference Leptospira spp. and 11 leptospira strains isolated from leptospiral patients and infected animals in the North-Western region of Russia were included into the study. Mass-spectra of all the studied strains were obtained by direct profiling of cell extracts. The created main spectral profiles (MSP) of reference strains were used for identification of isolates. Evaluation of identification was carried out by calculating coefficients of matching rate of separate spectra of each isolate with MSP of all the reference strains.
RESULTS: Results of identification have shown the similarity of spectra of isolates belonging to Pomona, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola serogroups, with MSP of saprophyte strain L. biflexa Patoc I. It is assumed that spectra of the studied strains contained peaks of polysaccha- ride Ο-antigens. Wherein maximum mean values of matching rate coefficients between spectra of isolates and MSP of pathogenic reference strains of leptospira correctly matched serovar type of the isolate.

28027297,Efficacy of the Rabbit Polyclonal Anti-leptospira Antibody against Homotype or Heterotype Leptospira Infection in Hamster.,"Leptospirosis, caused by Leptospira, is one of the most important of neglected emerging zoonotic diseases that has important impacts on public health worldwide. Polyclonal antibody (pcAb) therapy is a potential method to process a series of pathogens for which there are limited determination of treatment, such as leptospirosis. First, we evaluated the efficacy of pcAb, derived from the sera of rabbits inoculated with Leptospira, against homotype (Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai) or heterotype (Leptospira interrogans serovar Autumnalis) Leptospira infection in a lethal hamster model. The pcAb treatment improved survival compared to the controls. The histopathology's of the infected kidney, liver and lung were also examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we determined that most of the leptospires in the primary organs were almost completely removed by pcAb. In the second experiment, treatments, including antibiotic, pcAb, and combination, were started immediately after occurrence of the first serious sickness mouse in any group. No significant difference in survival rate between pcAb group and antibiotic group was found, but the combination therapy group significantly improved survival rate compared to the others (P<0.05). We conclude that the rabbit pcAb treatment may cure both the homotype and the heterotype lethal Leptospira infections in hamster, and combination therapy improved survival compared to antibiotic group in the late treatment of homotype leptospirosis.","['Jin X', 'Zhang W', 'Ding Z', 'Wang H', 'Wu D', 'Xie X', 'Lin T', 'Fu Y', 'Zhang N', 'Cao Y']",2016,10,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Jin X, et al.

28008823,Saccharomyces boulardii improves humoral immune response to DNA vaccines against leptospirosis.,"PURPOSE: Saccharomyces boulardii may improve the immune response by enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell activation. The immunomodulator effect of this probiotic has never been tested with DNA vaccines, which frequently induce low antibody titers. This study evaluated the capacity of Saccharomyces boulardii to improve the humoral and cellular immune responses using DNA vaccines coding for the leptospiral protein fragments LigAni and LigBrep. BALB/c mice were fed with rodent-specific feed containing 108 c.f.u. of Saccharomycesboulardii per gram.
METHODOLOGY: Animals were immunized three times intramuscularly with 100 µg of pTARGET plasmids containing the coding sequences for the above mentioned proteins. Antibody titers were measured by indirect ELISA. Expression levels of IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-γ and TGF-β were determined by quantitative real-time PCR from RNA extracted from whole blood, after an intraperitoneal boost with 50 µg of the recombinant proteins.Results/Key findings. Antibody titers increased significantly after the second and third application when pTARGET/ligAni and pTARGET/ligBrep were used to vaccinate the animals in comparison with the control group (P<0.05). In addition, there was a significant increase in the expression of the IL-10 in mice immunized with pTARGET/ligBrep and fed with Saccharomyces boulardii.
CONCLUSION: The results suggested that Saccharomyces boulardii has an immunomodulator effect in DNA vaccines, mainly by stimulating the humoral response, which is often limited in this kind of vaccine. Therefore, the use of Saccharomyces boulardii as immunomodulator represents a new alternative strategy for more efficient DNA vaccination.","['Silveira MM', 'Conceição FR', 'Mendonça M', 'Moreira GMSG', 'Da Cunha CEP', 'Conrad NL', 'Oliveira PD', 'Hartwig DD', 'De Leon PMM', 'Moreira ÂN']",2017,66,2,J Med Microbiol,"Silveira MM, et al.

Little is understood about Leptospira pathogenesis and host immune response. In the present work we have investigated how Leptospira modulates the host innate immune response mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) via surface exposed proteins. We screened Leptospira outer membrane/surface proteins for their ability to activate/inhibit TLR2/4 signaling in HEK293 cell lines. Of these the 21 kDa Leptospira surface adhesin, Lsa21 had strong TLR2 and TLR4 activity leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines and expression of costimulatory molecules in mouse macrophages. This activity of Lsa21 on innate response was dependent on activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) via stimulating the rapid phosphorylation of p38, JNK and activation of transcription factor NF-κB. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies against TLR2 and TLR4 significantly inhibited cytokine secretion and attenuated Lsa21 induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Furthermore, Lsa21 induced cytokine levels were significantly lower in TLR2","['Faisal SM', 'Varma VP', 'Subathra M', 'Azam S', 'Sunkara AK', 'Akif M', 'Baig MS', 'Chang YF']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Faisal SM, et al.

But the percentages of specific animal contact, including cattle (0.6 versus 0.8%) and goats (0.9 versus 1.0%), were low in both. The majority of suspected QF cases (89.4%) were simultaneously suspected with ST, MT or LS, and the combinations of suspected diseases differed between regions. The number of suspected QF cases from the eastern region decreased since 2009, which was not observed in other regions. A total of 1420 (12.8%) cases had confirmed diseases, including QF (453, 4.1%), QF+ST (7, 0.06%), QF+MT (4, 0.04%), QF+LS (4, 0.04%), MT (186, 1.7%), ST (545, 4.9%), ST+LS (11, 0.1%) and LS (210, 1.9%). Compared to cases of unknown disease, QF cases had larger percentages of high-risk occupations (16.2 versus 9.6%) but similar histories of animal contact (29.8 versus 25.1%). QF is an endemic disease in southern Taiwan. It is difficult to differentiate QF from ST, MT or LS only by high-risk occupations and history of animal contact, and co-infection of QF with these diseases should be considered.","['Lai CH', 'Sun W', 'Lee CH', 'Lin JN', 'Liao MH', 'Liu SS', 'Chang TY', 'Tsai KF', 'Chang YC', 'Lin HH', 'Chen YH']",2017,64,7,Zoonoses Public Health,"Lai CH, et al.

27955629,Cerebellar ataxia due to Leptospirosis- a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis involves nervous system in around 10-15% of the cases, the commonest presentation being aseptic meningitis. Most of the clinical features of neuroleptospirosis are due to capillary endothelial damage and vasculitis. Ataxia is an extremely uncommon manifestation of Leptospirosis occuring in <5% of cases.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 28 year old female from North India presented with a short febrile illness followed by an acute onset cerebellar ataxia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. Leptospira serology showed high titres of IgM (ELISA) and MAT (microscopic agglutination test titre >1:800) . She was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days following which she showed marked recovery.
CONCLUSION: The clinical features of neuroleptospirosis are varied, most of them resulting from endothelial damage and vasculitis. Immune mediated phenomenon with no structural damage is another possible mechanism leading to cerebellar ataxia. Cerebellar ataxia due to common tropical infections should be ruled out in the appropriate setting, as early institution of treatment can abate neurological morbidity. The case report highlights the importance of identifying a reversible cause of cerebellar ataixa due to a tropical infection, possibly due to a immune mediated phenomenon, and would be of interest to both internists and neurologists.","['Singh R', 'Khurana D', 'Mehta S', 'Choudhary A', 'Petluri G', 'Lal V']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Singh R, et al.

27942194,Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Illness in Patients Presenting to a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India: Clinical Spectrum and Outcome.,"BACKGROUND: Acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) may have similar clinical presentation, and the etiology is varied and region specific.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in South India. All adult patients presenting with AUFI of 3-14 days duration were evaluated for etiology, and the differences in presentation and outcome were analyzed.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 1258 patients. A microbiological cause was identified in 82.5% of our patients. Scrub typhus was the most common cause of AUFI (35.9%) followed by dengue (30.6%), malaria (10.4%), enteric fever (3.7%), and leptospirosis (0.6%). Both scrub typhus and dengue fever peaked during the monsoon season and the cooler months, whereas no seasonality was observed with enteric fever and malaria. The mean time to presentation was longer in enteric fever (9.9 [4.7] days) and scrub typhus (8.2 [3.2] days). Bleeding manifestations were seen in 7.7% of patients, mostly associated with dengue (14%), scrub typhus (4.2%), and malaria (4.6%). The requirement of supplemental oxygen, invasive ventilation, and inotropes was higher in scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and malaria. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% and was highest with scrub typhus (4.6%) followed by dengue fever (2.3%). Significant clinical predictors of scrub typhus were breathlessness (odds ratio [OR]: 4.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.38-7.3), total whole blood cell count >10,000 cells/mm
CONCLUSION: The similarity in clinical presentation and diversity of etiological agents demonstrates the complexity of diagnosis and treatment of AUFI in South India. The etiological profile will be of use in the development of rational guidelines for control and treatment of AUFI.","['Abhilash KP', 'Jeevan JA', 'Mitra S', 'Paul N', 'Murugan TP', 'Rangaraj A', 'David S', 'Hansdak SG', 'Prakash JA', 'Abraham AM', 'Ramasami P', 'Sathyendra S', 'Sudarsanam TD', 'Varghese GM']",2016,8,4,J Glob Infect Dis,"Abhilash KP, et al.

27935961,Emerging Infectious Disease Implications of Invasive Mammalian Species: The Greater White-Toothed Shrew (Crocidura russula) Is Associated With a Novel Serovar of Pathogenic Leptospira in Ireland.,"The greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) is an invasive mammalian species that was first recorded in Ireland in 2007. It currently occupies an area of approximately 7,600 km2 on the island. C. russula is normally distributed in Northern Africa and Western Europe, and was previously absent from the British Isles. Whilst invasive species can have dramatic and rapid impacts on faunal and floral communities, they may also be carriers of pathogens facilitating disease transmission in potentially naive populations. Pathogenic leptospires are endemic in Ireland and a significant cause of human and animal disease. From 18 trapped C. russula, 3 isolates of Leptospira were cultured. However, typing of these isolates by standard serological reference methods was negative, and suggested an, as yet, unidentified serovar. Sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA and secY indicated that these novel isolates belong to Leptospira alstonii, a unique pathogenic species of which only 7 isolates have been described to date. Earlier isolations were limited geographically to China, Japan and Malaysia, and this leptospiral species had not previously been cultured from mammals. Restriction enzyme analysis (REA) further confirms the novelty of these strains since no similar patterns were observed with a reference database of leptospires. As with other pathogenic Leptospira species, these isolates contain lipL32 and do not grow in the presence of 8-azagunaine; however no evidence of disease was apparent after experimental infection of hamsters. These isolates are genetically related to L. alstonii but have a novel REA pattern; they represent a new serovar which we designate as serovar Room22. This study demonstrates that invasive mammalian species act as bridge vectors of novel zoonotic pathogens such as Leptospira.","['Nally JE', 'Arent Z', 'Bayles DO', 'Hornsby RL', 'Gilmore C', 'Regan S', 'McDevitt AD', 'Yearsley J', 'Fanning S', 'McMahon BJ']",2016,10,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Nally JE, et al.

27929279,Pet-Related Infections.,"Physicians and veterinarians have many opportunities to partner in promoting the well-being of people and their pets, especially by addressing zoonotic diseases that may be transmitted between a pet and a human family member. Common cutaneous pet-acquired zoonoses are dermatophytosis (ringworm) and sarcoptic mange (scabies), which are both readily treated. Toxoplasmosis can be acquired from exposure to cat feces, but appropriate hygienic measures can minimize the risk to pregnant women. Persons who work with animals are at increased risk of acquiring bartonellosis (e.g., cat-scratch disease); control of cat fleas is essential to minimize the risk of these infections. People and their pets share a range of tick-borne diseases, and exposure risk can be minimized with use of tick repellent, prompt tick removal, and appropriate tick control measures for pets. Pets such as reptiles, amphibians, and backyard poultry pose a risk of transmitting Salmonella species and are becoming more popular. Personal hygiene after interacting with these pets is crucial to prevent Salmonella infections. Leptospirosis is more often acquired from wildlife than infected dogs, but at-risk dogs can be protected with vaccination. The clinical history in the primary care office should routinely include questions about pets and occupational or other exposure to pet animals. Control and prevention of zoonoses are best achieved by enhancing communication between physicians and veterinarians to ensure patients know the risks of and how to prevent zoonoses in themselves, their pets, and other people.",['Day MJ'],2016,94,10,Am Fam Physician,Day MJ.

Epidemiological data were obtained from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases of the Pará State Department of Public Health and the environmental, demographic and cartographical data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Men aged 20 to 39 of unknown profession and mixed ethnicity were the most affected. Laboratory diagnosis (82%) and hospital care (67.22%) confirmed satisfactory access to the Unified Health System. Numerical Kriging indicated the highest concentrations of the disease in the Guamá and Jurunas neighborhoods in lower lying areas near canals. The Buffer technique showed higher concentrations of the disease in areas with no domestic solid garbage collection service (26%), sewage (22%), piped water (38%), with unpaved roads (20%) and street flooding (65%). The Moran technique revealed a direct spatial correlation between these variables (p = 0.01543).

27921037,Acute Kidney Injury in Western Countries.,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent and is associated with poor outcomes, including increased mortality, higher risk of chronic kidney disease, and prolonged hospital lengths of stay. The epidemiology of AKI mainly derives from studies performed in Western high-income countries. More limited data are available from Western low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) located in Central and South America.
SUMMARY: In this review, we summarize the most recent data on the epidemiology of AKI in Western countries, aiming to contrast results from industrialized high-income countries with LMICs. The global picture of AKI in LMICs is not as well characterized as in the USA and Europe. In addition, in some LMICs, the epidemiology of AKI may vary depending on the region and socioeconomic status, which contributes to the difficulty of getting a better portrait of the clinical condition. In low-income regions and tropical countries, AKI is frequently attributed to diarrhea, infections, nephrotoxins, as well as obstetric complications. As opposed to the situation in high-income countries, access to basic care in LMICs is limited by economic constraints, and treatment is often delayed due to late presentation and recognition of the condition, which contribute to worse outcomes. In addition, dialysis is often not available or must be paid by patients, which further restricts its use.
KEY MESSAGES: There are great disparities in the epidemiology of AKI between Western high-income countries and Western LMICs. In LMICs, education and training programs should increase the public awareness of AKI and improve preventive and basic treatments to improve AKI outcomes.
FACTS FROM EAST AND WEST: (1) More than 90% of the patients recruited in AKI studies using KDIGO-equivalent criteria originate from North America, Europe, or Oceania, although these regions represent less than a fifth of the global population. However, the pooled incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients reaches 20% globally with moderate variance between regions. (2) The lower incidence rates observed in Asian countries (except Japan) may be due to a poorer recognition rate, for instance because of less systematically performed serum creatinine tests. (3) AKI patients in South and Southeastern Asia are younger than in East Asia and Western countries and present with fewer comorbidities. (4) Asian countries (and to a certain extent Latin America) face specific challenges that lead to AKI: nephrotoxicity of traditional herbal and less strictly regulated nonprescription medicines, environmental toxins (snake, bee, and wasp venoms), and tropical infectious diseases (malaria and leptospirosis). A higher incidence and less efficient management of natural disasters (particularly earthquakes) are also causes of AKI that Western countries are less likely to encounter. (5) The incidence of obstetric AKI decreased globally together with an improvement in socioeconomic levels particularly in China and India in the last decades. However, antenatal care and abortion management must be improved to reduce AKI in women, particularly in rural areas. (6) Earlier nephrology referral and better access to peritoneal dialysis should improve the outcome of AKI patients.","['Bouchard J', 'Mehta RL']",2016,2,3,Kidney Dis (Basel),Bouchard J and Mehta RL.

27918150,"Seroprevalence and Risk Factors for Leptospira Seropositivity in Beef Cattle, Sheep and Deer Farmers in New Zealand.","Leptospirosis is a global zoonosis that in New Zealand affects primarily people occupationally exposed to livestock. The objective of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of five Leptospira serovars in farmers working on cattle, sheep and deer farms that had the serological status of animals previously assessed and to identify risk factors for farmer seropositivity. A total of 178 farmers from 127 properties participated in the study. Blood samples were tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for the presence of antibodies to Leptospira. Samples with a MAT titre ≥48 were considered seropositive. Using Bayesian statistical analysis, the median seroprevalence of Leptospira, all serovars combined, was estimated to be 6.6% (95% probability interval (PI) 3.6-10.9%). Risk factors associated with seropositivity were assisting deer or cattle calving, farming deer, having ≥25% of flat terrain and high abundance of wild deer on farm, while high possum abundance on farm was negatively associated with seropositivity. No association was observed between farmer serostatus and previously recorded livestock serology. Leptospira seropositivity was associated with influenza-like illness of farmers (RR = 1.7; 95% PI 1.0-2.5). Assuming a causal relationship, this suggested an annual risk of 1.3% (95% PI 0.0-3.0%) of influenza-like illnesses due to Leptospira infection in the population of farmers. The association between seropositivity and disease can be used to estimate the public health burden of leptospirosis in New Zealand. Identifying and understanding risk factors for Leptospira seropositivity can inform preventive measures, hence contributing to the reduction of leptospirosis incidence in farmers.","['Sanhueza JM', 'Heuer C', 'Wilson PR', 'Benschop J', 'Collins-Emerson JM']",2017,64,5,Zoonoses Public Health,"Sanhueza JM, et al.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To characterize hematologic, hemostatic, and thromboelastometric abnormalities in dogs with leptospirosis and to study their association with hemorrhagic diatheses and outcomes.
ANIMALS: Thirty-five client-owned dogs.
METHODS: A prospective observational single cohort study was conducted. Results from the CBC, coagulation tests (prothrombin, activated partial thromboplastin and thrombin times, fibrinogen, fibrin(ogen) degradation products, and D-dimer concentrations), rotational thromboelastometry (TEM), signalment, hemorrhagic diatheses, occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) at admission, and survival to discharge were recorded.
RESULTS: The most common hematologic and hemostatic abnormalities were anemia (30/35), thrombocytopenia (21/35), and hyperfibrinogenemia (15/35). Eight dogs were diagnosed with DIC. A normal TEM profile was found in 14 dogs, a hypercoagulable profile in 14 dogs, and a hypocoagulable profile in 7 dogs. The 8 dogs with hemorrhagic diatheses at admission had significantly decreased platelet counts (P = .037) and increased D-dimer concentrations (P = .015) compared with other dogs. Dogs with a hypocoagulable profile exhibited more hemorrhagic diatheses compared with the dogs that had normal and hypercoagulable profiles (P = .049). The mortality rate was lower in dogs with a hypercoagulable profile than in those with a hypocoagulable profile (21% vs 57%; P = .043). Disseminated intravascular coagulation was not a significant prognostic factor.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Thromboelastometric parameters were altered in dogs with both hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable profiles.

27911902,Comparison of the Estimated Incidence of Acute Leptospirosis in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania between 2007-08 and 2012-14.,"BACKGROUND: The sole report of annual leptospirosis incidence in continental Africa of 75-102 cases per 100,000 population is from a study performed in August 2007 through September 2008 in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. To evaluate the stability of this estimate over time, we estimated the incidence of acute leptospirosis in Kilimanjaro Region, northern Tanzania for the time period 2012-2014.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Leptospirosis cases were identified among febrile patients at two sentinel hospitals in the Kilimanjaro Region. Leptospirosis was diagnosed by serum microscopic agglutination testing using a panel of 20 Leptospira serovars belonging to 17 separate serogroups. Serum was taken at enrolment and patients were asked to return 4-6 weeks later to provide convalescent serum. Confirmed cases required a 4-fold rise in titre and probable cases required a single titre of ≥800. Findings from a healthcare utilisation survey were used to estimate multipliers to adjust for cases not seen at sentinel hospitals. We identified 19 (1.7%) confirmed or probable cases among 1,115 patients who presented with a febrile illness. Of cases, the predominant reactive serogroups were Australis 8 (42.1%), Sejroe 3 (15.8%), Grippotyphosa 2 (10.5%), Icterohaemorrhagiae 2 (10.5%), Pyrogenes 2 (10.5%), Djasiman 1 (5.3%), Tarassovi 1 (5.3%). We estimated that the annual incidence of leptospirosis was 11-18 cases per 100,000 population. This was a significantly lower incidence than 2007-08 (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated a much lower incidence of acute leptospirosis than previously, with a notable absence of cases due to the previously predominant serogroup Mini. Our findings indicate a dynamic epidemiology of leptospirosis in this area and highlight the value of multi-year surveillance to understand leptospirosis epidemiology.","['Maze MJ', 'Biggs HM', 'Rubach MP', 'Galloway RL', 'Cash-Goldwasser S', 'Allan KJ', 'Halliday JE', 'Hertz JT', 'Saganda W', 'Lwezaula BF', 'Cleaveland S', 'Mmbaga BT', 'Maro VP', 'Crump JA']",2016,10,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Maze MJ, et al.

Many antibiotics at appropriate concentrations improved the survival rate and alleviated tissue injury, while, when dosing strategies fall below subtherapeutic levels, worse therapeutic effects are seen. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of low-dose norfloxacin (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg) and ciprofloxacin (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) against leptospirosis in a hamster model using Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae. The histopathology and bacterial loads of target organs (liver, kidney and lung) were also studied by treatment with norfloxacin at the dose of 10 mg/kg in this model. Using RT-PCR, the expression of inflammatory factor IL-1β and TNF-α was analyzed by comparing the norfloxacin and untreated group. All untreated animals, serving as a negative control, displayed 50% survival rate, while hamsters treated with norfloxacin at the dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg and ciprofloxacin at the dose of 1 and 2 mg/kg showed a lower survival rate than the untreated group. Furthermore, norfloxacin at the dose of 10 mg/kg increased bacterial loads and aggravated tissue injury of target organs. The delayed induction of IL-1β and TNF-α was found in tissues of norfloxacin group. Our study indicates an increased risk associated with low-dose norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in leptospirosis.","['Wu D', 'Zhang W', 'Wang T', 'Lin T', 'Jin X', 'Xie X', 'Guo J', 'Cao Y', 'Wu R']",2017,102,,Microb Pathog,"Wu D, et al.

Recent studies on Leptospira have demonstrated biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces. The protein expressed in the biofilm was investigated by using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting in combination with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The proteins expressed in Leptospira biofilm and planktonic cells was analyzed and compared. Among these proteins, one (60 kDa) was found to overexpress in biofilm as compared to the planktonic cells. MALDI-TOF analysis identified this protein as stress and heat shock chaperone GroEL. Our findings demonstrate that GroEL is associated with Leptospira biofilm. GroEL is conserved, highly immunogenic and a prominent stress response protein in pathogenic Leptospira spp., which may have clinical relevance.","['Vinod Kumar K', 'Lall C', 'Vimal Raj R', 'Vedhagiri K', 'Kartick C', 'Surya P', 'Natarajaseenivasan K', 'Vijayachari P']",2017,102,,Microb Pathog,"Vinod Kumar K, et al.

27863549,Cytokine and chemokine profiles of aqueous humor and serum in horses with uveitis measured using multiplex bead immunoassay analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether horses with clinically diagnosed Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) and those with Leptospirosis infection have a specific cytokine profile in their aqueous humor (AH) and serum that differs from horses with uveitis secondary to other ocular inflammatory processes and from horses with normal eyes.
ANIMALS STUDIED: Twenty-five client-owned horses with uveitis that were presented to the North Carolina State University Ophthalmology Service, and four University-owned horses without history or clinical signs of ocular disease.
PROCEDURE: Samples of AH and serum were obtained from horses with ERU (n=13), acute or non-recurrent uveitis (UV; n=7), uveitis secondary to infectious keratitis (IK; n=5), and normal eyes (N; n=4). Cytokine levels in AH and serum were quantified using a multiplex bead immunoassay. Leptospiral antibody titers in serum and AH and PCR for Leptospiral DNA in AH were performed.
RESULTS: In the AH of horses with ERU, increased levels of IL-1a, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, FGF-2, G-CSF, and RANTES were measured compared to UV, IK and N eyes, but the differences were not significant. However, IL-10 was significantly higher in ERU eyes compared to IK and N (P=0.029; 0.013), and IP-10 in ERU eyes was significantly higher than in UV and N (P=0.004). Furthermore, MCP-1 was significantly higher in ERU than N (P=0.04). In the serum, increased levels of IL-1a, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, fractalkine, and G-CSF were measured in horses with ERU, but the levels were not significantly higher than those observed in UV, IK, or N horses. However, serum IP-10 levels in horses with ERU were significantly higher than in UV and N horses (P=0.005) and MCP-1 levels were significantly higher in ERU than N (P=0.03). Horses with marked ocular inflammation had significantly higher serum levels of G-CSF, IL-1a, fractalkine, IL-13, IL-4, IL-17a, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, and MCP-1. Elevated IL-10 in AH was significantly associated with disease chronicity, both overall and in ERU eyes (P=0.049), and in horses with positive ocular leptospiral titers or leptospiral PCR, significant elevations of IL-10 (P=0.0018; 0.0032) and IP-10 (P=0.0342; 0.043) were detected in the AH compared to leptospiral negative eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IP-10 appear to play an important role in ERU. Further studies are needed to further clarify and characterize cytokine profiles of specific ocular inflammatory diseases, but multiplex bead immunoassay technology shows promise as a diagnostically valuable tool.","['Curto E', 'Messenger KM', 'Salmon JH', 'Gilger BC']",2016,182,,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,"Curto E, et al.

27862246,A retrospective analysis of mortality in captive pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) from 1912 to 2014.,"The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) is an IUCN Red List Endangered species (CITES Appendix II) that has been housed in zoological collections since 1912. As wild populations continue to decline throughout the species' range, successful ex situ breeding and management, including an understanding of morbidity and mortality, are of utmost importance. This study is the first comprehensive review of mortality data from the captive population since 1982 and significantly expands on previous analyses. We solicited necropsy reports from 129/187 zoological institutions worldwide that currently or previously held pygmy hippos and received data for 404 animals (177 ♂, 220 ♀, 7 undermined sex), representing 43% of pygmy hippos that have died in captivity. Mortality in neonates was primarily due to perinatal causes (51.8%-stillbirth, failure to thrive, weakness, poor suckling reflex, maternal neglect) or parent-inflicted trauma (28%). Common causes of mortality in adult and geriatric animals included cardiovascular disease (16%), degenerative musculoskeletal conditions (10%), obstructive gastrointestinal disease (9%), and renal insufficiency (13%), sometimes associated with advanced polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Although not the direct cause of mortality, a number of adult and geriatric pygmy hippos were also overweight to obese. Infectious causes of mortality in included leptospirosis and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter usually presenting as acute death due to cardiovascular demise. This comprehensive overview presents a useful guide for recommendations in preventative veterinary care and for improved husbandry and management of pygmy hippos in captivity.

27835672,The Expression of Water and Ion Channels in Diffuse Alveolar Damage Is Not Dependent on DAD Etiology.,"INTRODUCTION: Aquaporins and ion channels are membrane proteins that facilitate the rapid movement of water and solutes across biological membranes. Experimental and in vitro studies reported that the function of these channels and pulmonary edema resolution are impaired in acute lung injury (ALI). Although current evidence indicates that alveolar fluid clearance is impaired in patients with ALI/diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), few human studies have addressed the alterations in pulmonary channels in this clinical condition. Additionally, it is not known whether the primary cause of DAD is a relevant variable for the channel dysfunction.
METHODS: Autopsied lungs of 43 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to DAD of three different etiologies, non-pulmonary sepsis, H1N1 viral infection and leptospirosis, were compared to 18 normal lungs. We quantified the expression of aquaporin (AQP) 1, AQP3, AQP5, epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and sodium potassium ATPase (Na-K-ATPase) in the alveolar septum using immunohistochemistry and image analysis.
RESULTS: The DAD group presented with increased expression of AQP3, AQP5 and Na-K-ATPase and decreased expression of ENaC compared to controls. However, there was no difference in protein expression within the DAD groups of different etiologies.
CONCLUSION: Water and ion channels are altered in patients with ARF due to DAD. The cause of DAD does not seem to influence the level of impairment of these channels.","['Pires-Neto RC', 'Del Carlo Bernardi F', 'Alves de Araujo P', 'Mauad T', 'Dolhnikoff M']",2016,11,11,PLoS One,"Pires-Neto RC, et al.

27824878,High-Throughput Parallel Sequencing to Measure Fitness of Leptospira interrogans Transposon Insertion Mutants during Acute Infection.,"Pathogenic species of Leptospira are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that causes mortality and morbidity worldwide. The understanding of the virulence mechanisms of Leptospira spp is still at an early stage due to the limited number of genetic tools available for this microorganism. The development of random transposon mutagenesis in pathogenic strains a decade ago has contributed to the identification of several virulence factors. In this study, we used the transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) technique, which combines transposon mutagenesis with massive parallel sequencing, to study the in vivo fitness of a pool of Leptospira interrogans mutants. We infected hamsters with a pool of 42 mutants (input pool), which included control mutants with insertions in four genes previously analyzed by virulence testing (loa22, ligB, flaA1, and lic20111) and 23 mutants with disrupted signal transduction genes. We quantified the mutants in different tissues (blood, kidney and liver) at 4 days post-challenge by high-throughput sequencing and compared the frequencies of mutants recovered from tissues to their frequencies in the input pool. Control mutants that were less fit in the Tn-Seq experiment were attenuated for virulence when tested separately in the hamster model of lethal leptospirosis. Control mutants with unaltered fitness were as virulent as the wild-type strain. We identified two mutants with the transposon inserted in the same putative adenylate/guanylate cyclase gene (lic12327) that had reduced in vivo fitness in blood, kidney and liver. Both lic12327 mutants were attenuated for virulence when tested individually in hamsters. Growth of the control mutants and lic12327 mutants in culture medium were similar to that of the wild-type strain. These results demonstrate the feasibility of screening large pools of L. interrogans transposon mutants for those with altered fitness, and potentially attenuated virulence, by transposon sequencing.","['Lourdault K', 'Matsunaga J', 'Haake DA']",2016,10,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lourdault K, et al.

27812211,Cathelicidin Insufficiency in Patients with Fatal Leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide; however, the role of the host immune response in disease progression and high case fatality (>10-50%) is poorly understood. We conducted a multi-parameter investigation of patients with acute leptospirosis to identify mechanisms associated with case fatality. Whole blood transcriptional profiling of 16 hospitalized Brazilian patients with acute leptospirosis (13 survivors, 3 deceased) revealed fatal cases had lower expression of the antimicrobial peptide, cathelicidin, and chemokines, but more abundant pro-inflammatory cytokine receptors. In contrast, survivors generated strong adaptive immune signatures, including transcripts relevant to antigen presentation and immunoglobulin production. In an independent cohort (23 survivors, 22 deceased), fatal cases had higher bacterial loads (P = 0.0004) and lower anti-Leptospira antibody titers (P = 0.02) at the time of hospitalization, independent of the duration of illness. Low serum cathelicidin and RANTES levels during acute illness were independent risk factors for higher bacterial loads (P = 0.005) and death (P = 0.04), respectively. To investigate the mechanism of cathelicidin in patients surviving acute disease, we administered LL-37, the active peptide of cathelicidin, in a hamster model of lethal leptospirosis and found it significantly decreased bacterial loads and increased survival. Our findings indicate that the host immune response plays a central role in severe leptospirosis disease progression. While drawn from a limited study size, significant conclusions include that poor clinical outcomes are associated with high systemic bacterial loads, and a decreased antibody response. Furthermore, our data identified a key role for the antimicrobial peptide, cathelicidin, in mounting an effective bactericidal response against the pathogen, which represents a valuable new therapeutic approach for leptospirosis.","['Lindow JC', 'Wunder EA', 'Popper SJ', 'Min JN', 'Mannam P', 'Srivastava A', 'Yao Y', 'Hacker KP', 'Raddassi K', 'Lee PJ', 'Montgomery RR', 'Shaw AC', 'Hagan JE', 'Araújo GC', 'Nery N', 'Relman DA', 'Kim CC', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI']",2016,12,11,PLoS Pathog,"Lindow JC, et al.

27812090,Diagnosis of Persistent Fever in the Tropics: Set of Standard Operating Procedures Used in the NIDIAG Febrile Syndrome Study.,"In resource-limited settings, the scarcity of skilled personnel and adequate laboratory facilities makes the differential diagnosis of fevers complex [1-5]. Febrile illnesses are diagnosed clinically in most rural centers, and both Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) and clinical algorithms can be valuable aids to health workers and facilitate therapeutic decisions [6,7]. The persistent fever syndrome targeted by NIDIAG is defined as presence of fever for at least one week. The NIDIAG clinical research consortium focused on potentially severe and treatable infections and therefore targeted the following conditions as differential diagnosis of persistent fever: visceral leishmaniasis (VL), human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever, brucellosis, melioidosis, leptospirosis, malaria, tuberculosis, amoebic liver abscess, relapsing fever, HIV/AIDS, rickettsiosis, and other infectious diseases (e.g., pneumonia).

27805562,Acute kidney injury in leptospirosis: the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria and mortality .,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most serious complications of leptospirosis. In recent years, studies have evaluated this complication using the risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage kidney disease and the acute kidney injury network classification systems. More recently, the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) criteria have been developed to increase accuracy in detecting AKI. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with AKI and mortality in patients with leptospirosis, using KDIGO criteria. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with clinical and epidemiological diagnosis of leptospirosis between January 2007 and December 2011. AKI was defined and classified according to KDIGO guidelines. Independent risk factors for AKI and death were evaluated using logistic regression. Of the 205 patients included, only 10 patients (4.8%) exhibited Weil's syndrome. AKI occurred in 182 patients (88.7%), 33 (16.1%) of whom were classified as KDIGO 1, 36 (17.6%) as KDIGO 2, and 113 (55.1%) as KDIGO 3. There was an independent correlation between AKI and the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia and leukocytosis. KDIGO 3 and the need for mechanical ventilation were independently correlated with mortality. We observed a high prevalence of AKI using KDIGO criteria, even in patients with milder forms of leptospirosis. Hyperbilirubinemia and leukocytosis were independent risk factors for AKI.

We herein analyzed the phenotype of circulating neutrophils of patients with leptospirosis and healthy controls for the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) type 2 (TLR2, to sense the leptospiral LPS) and several activation markers: interleukin 8 chemokine receptor CD182 (CXCR2), CD11b of the integrin/opsonin complement receptor type 3 (CR3) and CD15 (ligand of the selectin). The plasmatic level of the main CD182 ligand, interleukin 8 (CXCL8), was measured by ELISA. Hospitalized leptospirosis cases showed marked neutrophilia, particularly in the most severe cases. Interestingly, TLR2 was significantly increased in leptospirosis but identical levels of CD182 and CD11b were detected when compared to controls. CD15 was significantly decreased on neutrophils in leptospirosis but returned to normal within 1 month. Basal levels of IL-8 were measured in control subjects and were not increased in leptospirosis cases at the initial stage of the disease. In conclusion, we observed that neutrophils failed to regulate the expression of several of the receptors involved in cell activation and recruitment. This study further emphasizes the paradigm that neutrophils may be impaired in their overall capacity to thwart bacterial infection in leptospirosis patients.","['Raffray L', 'Giry C', 'Vandroux D', 'Kuli B', 'Randrianjohany A', 'Pequin AM', 'Renou F', 'Jaffar-Bandjee MC', 'Gasque P']",2016,11,11,PLoS One,"Raffray L, et al.

In most cases, leptospirosis is a nonspecific self-limiting illness, but some patients can develop a severe form with a high mortality. This study was carried out in Santiago Island, Cape Verde, in 2012-2013. A total of 62 wild rodents (Rattus rattus and Mus domesticus) were analyzed. The lipL32 gene, present only in pathogenic Leptospira spp., was amplified by PCR, and 16 samples were positive (25.8%). In both rodent species, Leptospira interrogans was identified. The results show the presence of pathogenic Leptospira in the three localities analyzed in Santiago. The presence of L. interrogans demonstrates a serious health risk for the population, since this species has been associated with the most severe form of leptospirosis, the Weil's disease in humans, a severe infection with jaundice, renal failure, and hemorrhage.","['Plata-Luis J', 'Foronda P', 'Martín-Alonso A', 'Feliu C', 'Alves J', 'Gil H', 'Valladares B']",2016,16,11,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Plata-Luis J, et al.

JHR was seen in 23 (82%) of 28 cases, including 19 (90%) of 21 cases treated with bactericidal antibiotics compared to 4 (57%) of seven cases with bacteriostatic antibiotics (p=0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a wide variety of clinical manifestations, epidemiological exposures, and causative serovars of disease in an endemic region of Japan. We also found that JHR occurs frequently, and its recognition may be important for the diagnosis and management of leptospirosis in the early stage when laboratory confirmation is pending.","['Tsuha S', 'Taniguchi T', 'Shiiki S', 'Narita M', 'Leung DT']",2016,110,9,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Tsuha S, et al.

The aquatic environment represents a viable survival and transmission pathway. This study aimed to investigate the presence of anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies in Phrynops geoffroanus (Geoffroy's side-necked turtle) serum samples using the microagglutination test (MAT), and Leptospira spp. in gastric and cloacal lavage samples using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Antibodies against nine different Leptospira spp. serovars were detected in 45.45% (30/66) of the serum samples. Specific amplification of Leptospira spp. genomic material (331bp) was observed in 16.67% (11/66) of the samples. In conclusion, these freshwater testudines host Leptospira spp. and eliminate them. This situation may represent a risk to public health, especially to people who use urban streams for fishing and recreational activities. Additionally, we described some Leptospira spp. serovars, not yet reported in testudines, detected here in P. geoffroanus.","['Oliveira JP', 'Kawanami AE', 'Silva ASL', 'Chung DG', 'Werther K']",2016,164,,Acta Trop,"Oliveira JP, et al.

27763478,A case-control study of epidemiological factors associated with leptospirosis in South Gujarat region.,"BACKGROUND: The current study was planned to identify the epidemiological factors associated with leptospirosis in South Gujarat region using neighborhood controls.
METHODS: A total of 100 cases of leptospirosis occurred in South Gujarat region during the year 2012 were selected using simple random sampling. Three neighbors of the selected cases formed the controls (n = 300). A pretested structured questionnaire was used for data collection and data were analyzed using Epi Info 2007.
RESULTS: There was significant association of illiteracy (odds ratio [OR] =1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.14-2.89), working in waterlogged fields during the reference season (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.6-17.9), swimming/bathing in canals, open air defecation practices, storage of cow dung in or surrounding house, residence in the house made up of cow dung walls, households with access of food to rodents, injuries over hands/foot during the endemic season (OR = 3, 95% CI = 1.8-4.8), and history of skin disease during the endemic season (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 2-8.5), with leptospirosis. Only 10% of individuals had gumboots for protection. A total of 83 (83%) cases and 240 (80%) controls had taken oral doxycycline chemoprophylaxis (P > 0.05). Cases had taken chemoprophylaxis for a median 4 weeks (range: 1-8) while controls had taken the same for median 8 weeks (range = 1-8) (P < 0.002).

Although it is usually asymptomatic and self-limited, severe potentially fatal illness accompanied by multi-organ failure may occur.
CASE REPORT: Here we report an unusual case of severe leptospirosis successfully treated with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVHF) and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). The patient presented with pericardial tamponade, renal failure and macrophage activation syndrome, and later suffered prolonged jaundice and sclerosing cholangitis during hospitalization in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). To the best of our knowledge, sclerosing cholangitis due to leptospirosis has not been reported in the literature.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock with fever, thrombocytopenia, jaundice and renal failure.

The main threats faced by this population include habitat loss and road mortality. However, on 18 November 2013, a radio-implanted badger was found nonresponsive in an agricultural field with signs consistent with canine distemper virus infection, which was subsequently confirmed. This prompted our investigation into the occurrence of pathogens in this endangered carnivore to better quantify the level of risk infectious disease poses to population persistence. We examined serum samples from nine live-trapped individuals and 27 whole badger specimens submitted for postmortem examination. We found evidence of exposure to canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, and leptospires. However, infection associated with disease was not the leading cause of mortality. Future research into the effects of disease on kit survival and a comprehensive understanding of disease severity and spread from reservoir populations (e.g., raccoons [ Procyon lotor ] and striped skunks [ Mephitis mephitis ]) to badgers will be of particular importance to the conservation of this endangered population.","['Ethier DM', 'Sayers JB', 'Kyle CJ', 'Nocera JJ', 'Ojkic D', 'Campbell D']",2017,53,1,J Wildl Dis,"Ethier DM, et al.

27737644,Chimeric epitope vaccine against Leptospira interrogans infection and induced specific immunity in guinea pigs.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important reemerging zoonosis, with more than half a million cases reported annually, and is caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. Development of a universal vaccine is one of the major strategic goals to overcome the disease burden of leptospirosis. In this study, a chimeric multi-epitope protein-based vaccine was designed and tested for its potency to induce a specific immune response and provide protection against L. interrogans infection.
RESULTS: The protein, containing four repeats of six T- and B-cell combined epitopes from the leptospiral outer membrane proteins, OmpL1, LipL32 and LipL21, was expressed and purified. Western blot analysis showed that the recombinant protein (named r4R) mainly expressed in a soluble pattern, and reacted with antibodies raised in rabbit against heat-killed Leptospira and in guinea pigs against the r4R vaccine. Microscopic agglutination tests showed that r4R antisera was immunological cross-reactive with a range of Chinese standard reference strains of Leptospira belonging to different serogroups. In guinea pigs, the r4R vaccine induced a Th1-biased immune response, as reflected by the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio and cytokine production of stimulated splenocytes derived from immunized animals. Finally, r4R-immunized guinea pigs showed increased survival of lethal Leptospira challenges compared with PBS-immunized animals and tissue damage and leptospiral colonization of the kidney were reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: The multi-epitope chimeric r4R protein is a promising antigen for the development of a universal cross-reactive vaccine against leptospirosis.","['Lin X', 'Xiao G', 'Luo D', 'Kong L', 'Chen X', 'Sun D', 'Yan J']",2016,16,1,BMC Microbiol,"Lin X, et al.

DESIGN: Retrospective study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 55 dogs diagnosed with panuveitis at the Purdue University Veterinary Teaching Hospital between December 2000 and December 2015 were reviewed. Data collected included signalment, season of diagnosis, descriptions of ocular lesions, diagnostic testing, treatment protocols, etiologic diagnoses (when determined), and visual outcome.
RESULTS: The most common clinical sign in the anterior segment was aqueous flare and in the posterior segment was serous retinal detachment. The most common diagnosis was idiopathic/immune-mediated disease followed by systemic blastomycosis, lymphoma, and other causes (leptospirosis, aspergillosis, and histoplasmosis). Of the 43 dogs for which follow-up was available, 40% of dogs had resolution of visible inflammation and retinal reattachment, 32% of dogs had slight to moderate improvement, and 28% of dogs had no improvement or deterioration of lesions. Mean follow-up time was 11 months, and mean time to resolution of visible inflammation and retinal reattachment was 32 days. Sixty-five percent of dogs either retained or regained vision in one or both diseased eyes with initial medical therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic/immune-mediated panuveitis was the most common diagnosis. Dogs with idiopathic/immune-mediated panuveitis tended to respond more favorably to medical therapy than dogs with infectious panuveitis. Visual outcome was favorable in those dogs that responded to initial medical therapy, but long-term therapy was required in many dogs to maintain vision and prevent recurrence of disease.","['Bergstrom BE', 'Stiles J', 'Townsend WM']",2017,20,5,Vet Ophthalmol,"Bergstrom BE, et al.

METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We established the Enhanced Fatal Acute Febrile Illness Surveillance System (EFASS) to estimate dengue mortality rates in Puerto Rico. Healthcare professionals submitted serum and tissue specimens from patients who died from a dengue-like acute febrile illness, and death certificates were reviewed to identify additional cases. Specimens were tested for markers of dengue virus (DENV) infection by molecular, immunologic, and immunohistochemical methods, and were also tested for West Nile virus, Leptospira spp., and other pathogens based on histopathologic findings. Medical records were reviewed and clinical data abstracted. A total of 311 deaths were identified, of which 58 (19%) were DENV laboratory-positive. Dengue mortality rates were 1.05 per 100,000 population in 2010, 0.16 in 2011 and 0.36 in 2012. Dengue mortality was highest among adults 19-64 years and seniors ≥65 years (1.17 and 1.66 deaths per 100,000, respectively). Other pathogens identified included 34 Leptospira spp. cases and one case of Burkholderia pseudomallei and Neisseria meningitidis.

27697080,Evidence of leptospirosis in the kidneys and serum of feral swine (Sus scrofa) in the United States.,"Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis in humans worldwide. In the United States, widespread detection of antibodies to leptospirosis have been identified in feral swine (Sus scrofa) with the highest detection of serovars, Bratislava, Icterohaemorrhagiae, and Pomona. Over the past few years, feral swine populations have expanded their geographical range and distribution in the United States with reports in at least 39 of 50 states. Since feral swine serve as reservoirs for serovars that can infect humans, it is important to understand the risk of transmission. In order to learn more about the probability that feral swine shed infectious leptospires, we collected kidneys and paired serum when possible from 677 feral swine in 124 counties of 29 states. These counties had previously been identified as antibody positive for Leptospira interrogans serovars Bratislava, Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Hardjo, Icterohaemorrhagiae or Pomona. Although exposure to these same six serovars of leptospirosis continued to be high (53% overall) in the counties we sampled, we detected leptospiral DNA in only 3·4% of feral swine kidneys tested. Based on these results, it appears that although feral swine can serve as a source of infection to humans, especially in those who are more likely to encounter them directly such as wildlife biologists, veterinarians, and hunters, the risk may be relatively low. However, further studies to examine the relationship between leptospiral shedding in the urine and kidneys in addition to culturing the organism are recommended in order to better understand the risk associated with feral swine.","['Pedersen K', 'Anderson TD', 'Bevins SN', 'Pabilonia KL', 'Whitley PN', 'Virchow DR', 'Gidlewski T']",2017,145,1,Epidemiol Infect,"Pedersen K, et al.

30512544,[Leptospirosis].,"Leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is the first worldwide anthropozoonosis with an incidence of 1 000 000 cases per year. It is more frequently encountered in tropical areas but also can be diagnosed in tempered places. In France, the most exposed people are athletes in fresh water (canoeing, rafting, caving...) and agricultural workers. The peak incidence occurs in late summer. After transcutaneous or mucosal penetration, Leptospira can cause direct tissue injury by invasion, or indirect injury by toxinic and/or immunological mechanism. Also called summer flu, the clinical presentation is variable: it ranges from simple flu-like illness to septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, with varying degrees of fever, headache or myalgia. Conjunctival suffusion is also very evocative. Biology can show thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes, renal failure, hematuria and proteinuria. Mortality occurs very rarely if organ failures (renal failure, pulmonary edema lesions ...) are undertaken by adequate therapy. The diagnosis is usually based on serology (micro-agglutination test), repeated 15 days after the first test. A first negative serology is not sufficient to rule out the diagnosis. PCR detection is also available and can facilitate the diagnosis of leptospirosis. A vaccine is available but it only protects against serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae.

We investigated the genetic diversity of Leptospira in 28 species of wildlife other than rats using variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) and multispacer sequence typing (MST). The DNA of pathogenic Leptospira was detected in the kidney tissues of 201 individuals out of 3,738 tested individuals. A wide diversity, including 50 VNTR profiles and 8 MST profiles, was observed.

27680169,"COMPARISON OF 16S rRNA-PCR-RFLP, LipL32-PCR AND OmpL1-PCR METHODS IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF LEPTOSPIROSIS.","Leptospirosis is still one of the most important health problems in developing countries located in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Human infections are generally caused by exposure to water, soil or food contaminated with the urine of infected wild and domestic animals such as rodents and dogs. The clinical course of leptospirosis is variable and may be difficult to distinguish from many other infectious diseases. The dark-field microscopy (DFM), serology and nucleic acid amplification techniques are used to diagnose leptospirosis, however, a distinctive standard reference method is still lacking. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the presence of Leptospira spp., to differentiate the pathogenic L. interrogans and the non-pathogenic L. biflexa, and also to determine the sensitivity and specificity values of molecular methods as an alternative to conventional ones. A total of 133 serum samples, from 47 humans and 86 cattle were evaluated by two conventional tests: the Microagglutination Test (MAT) and the DFM, as well as three molecular methods, the 16S rRNA-PCR followed by Restriction Fragment Lenght Polymorphism (RFLP) of the amplification products 16S rRNA-PCR-RFLP, LipL32-PCR and OmpL1-PCR. In this study, for L. interrogans, the specificity and sensitivity rates of the 16S rRNA-PCR and the LipL32-PCR were considered similar (100% versus 98.25% and 100% versus 98.68%, respectively). The OmpL1-PCR was able to classify L. interrogans into two intergroups, but this PCR was less sensitive (87.01%) than the other two PCR methods. The 16S rRNA-PCR-RFLP could detect L. biflexa DNA, but LipL32-PCR and OmpL1-PCR could not. The 16S rRNA-PCR-RFLP provided an early and accurate diagnosis and was able to distinguish pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira species, hence it may be used as an alternative method to the conventional gold standard techniques for the rapid disgnosis of leptospirosis.","['Gökmen TG', 'Soyal A', 'Kalayci Y', 'Önlen C', 'Köksal F']",2016,58,,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"Gökmen TG, et al.

27670115,Spirochaete flagella hook proteins self-catalyse a lysinoalanine covalent crosslink for motility.,"Spirochaetes are bacteria responsible for several serious diseases, including Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), syphilis (Treponema pallidum) and leptospirosis (Leptospira interrogans), and contribute to periodontal diseases (Treponema denticola)(1). These spirochaetes employ an unusual form of flagella-based motility necessary for pathogenicity; indeed, spirochaete flagella (periplasmic flagella) reside and rotate within the periplasmic space(2-11). The universal joint or hook that links the rotary motor to the filament is composed of ∼120-130 FlgE proteins, which in spirochaetes form an unusually stable, high-molecular-weight complex(9,12-17). In other bacteria, the hook can be readily dissociated by treatments such as heat(18). In contrast, spirochaete hooks are resistant to these treatments, and several lines of evidence indicate that the high-molecular-weight complex is the consequence of covalent crosslinking(12,13,17). Here, we show that T. denticola FlgE self-catalyses an interpeptide crosslinking reaction between conserved lysine and cysteine, resulting in the formation of an unusual lysinoalanine adduct that polymerizes the hook subunits. Lysinoalanine crosslinks are not needed for flagellar assembly, but they are required for cell motility and hence infection. The self-catalytic nature of FlgE crosslinking has important implications for protein engineering, and its sensitivity to chemical inhibitors provides a new avenue for the development of antimicrobials targeting spirochaetes.","['Miller MR', 'Miller KA', 'Bian J', 'James ME', 'Zhang S', 'Lynch MJ', 'Callery PS', 'Hettick JM', 'Cockburn A', 'Liu J', 'Li C', 'Crane BR', 'Charon NW']",2016,1,10,Nat Microbiol,"Miller MR, et al.

27656479,Study of Aetiology and Outcome in Acute Febrile Illness Patients with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute febrile illness with Multi Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) carries significant morbidity and mortality despite standard therapy in intensive care settings. Infections are the most common cause of MODS followed by polytrauma. Present study was undertaken in medical intensive care units of a tertiary hospital to study the aetiology and outcome among patients with acute febrile illness developing MODS.
AIM: 1) To study the aetiology of acute febrile illness in patients developing MODS. 2) To study the final outcome among these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Mysuru, Karnataka, India, over a period of 6 months from July 2013 to December 2013. The Institutional Ethics Committee Approval (IEC) was obtained before the commencement of the study. A total of 213 cases admitted in intensive care unit with acute febrile illness with two or more organ dysfunction were screened for the inclusion and exclusion criterias.
RESULTS: A total of 213 cases of acute febrile illness with one or more organ dysfunction were screened. Of the screened patients 75 patients were finally included in the study out of which 46 (61.3%) patients were males and 29 (38.7%) patients were females. Aetiology for acute febrile illness with MODS could be established in 49 (65.3%) patients and it was obscure in 26 (34.7%) patients despite repeated investigations. Dengue infection (29.3%) was the commonest cause of febrile illness with MODS followed by leptospirosis (22.7%). Majority of these patients had haematological derangements (78.7%) and liver function test abnormalities (68%). Out of these 75 cases, 54 (72%) patients recovered completely and 21 (28%) patients died. Among males (N=46), 35 (76.1%) patients recovered and 11 (23.9%) patients died where as among females (N=29), 19 (65.5%) patients recovered and 10 (34.5%) patients died. Mortality was proportionate with the number of organ dysfunction, especially Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement.
CONCLUSION: Incidence of febrile illness with MODS is more prevalent in males but the outcome appears poorer among females. The diagnosis remained obscure in a sizable proportion of these patients. Prognosis was inversely dependent on the number of organs involved especially with CNS manifestations.","['Muthaiah B', 'Thippeswamy T', 'Kondareddy S', 'Chikkegowda P']",2016,10,8,J Clin Diagn Res,"Muthaiah B, et al.

27654037,An Extended Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) Scheme for Rapid Direct Typing of Leptospira from Clinical Samples.,"BACKGROUND: Rapid typing of Leptospira is currently impaired by requiring time consuming culture of leptospires. The objective of this study was to develop an assay that provides multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data direct from patient specimens while minimising costs for subsequent sequencing.
METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: An existing PCR based MLST scheme was modified by designing nested primers including anchors for facilitated subsequent sequencing. The assay was applied to various specimen types from patients diagnosed with leptospirosis between 2014 and 2015 in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Of 44 clinical samples (23 serum, 6 whole blood, 3 buffy coat, 12 urine) PCR positive for pathogenic Leptospira spp. at least one allele was amplified in 22 samples (50%) and used for phylogenetic inference. Full allelic profiles were obtained from ten specimens, representing all sample types (23%). No nonspecific amplicons were observed in any of the samples. Of twelve PCR positive urine specimens three gave full allelic profiles (25%) and two a partial profile. Phylogenetic analysis allowed for species assignment. The predominant species detected was L. interrogans (10/14 and 7/8 from UK and Lao PDR, respectively). All other species were detected in samples from only one country (Lao PDR: L. borgpetersenii [1/8]; UK: L. kirschneri [1/14], L. santarosai [1/14], L. weilii [2/14]).
CONCLUSION: Typing information of pathogenic Leptospira spp. was obtained directly from a variety of clinical samples using a modified MLST assay. This assay negates the need for time-consuming culture of Leptospira prior to typing and will be of use both in surveillance, as single alleles enable species determination, and outbreaks for the rapid identification of clusters.","['Weiss S', 'Menezes A', 'Woods K', 'Chanthongthip A', 'Dittrich S', 'Opoku-Boateng A', 'Kimuli M', 'Chalker V']",2016,10,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Weiss S, et al.

In contrast, LipL32 is abundant on cultured Lk and elicits infection antibody responses. The aim of this study was to develop an ELISA based on LipL32 or Lk sonicate and host-induced proteins to differentiate vaccine from infection serum antibody. IgG specific for recombinant Sph1, LigA, Lk90 (LigA; 379-1225 a.a), Hsp15, LipL45 and LipL32 of Lk were assayed in sera of horses infected naturally with Lk and before and after immunisation with serovar Pomona bacterin. Infection but not vaccine sera reacted strongly with Sph1, LigA and Lk90. LipL45 and Hsp15 reacted moderately with infection sera and weakly with vaccine sera. Lk sonicate and LipL32 reacted strongly with both infection and vaccine sera. As expected, culture-based vaccine failed to stimulate antibody to host-induced proteins. Therefore a dual antigen ELISA based on Lk sonicate or LipL32 combined with host-induced Sph1 and Lk90 will be valuable in differentiating infection from vaccine responses.","['Velineni S', 'Timoney JF']",2016,179,22,Vet Rec,Velineni S and Timoney JF.

27635213,Inhibitory effect of BMAP-28 on Leptospiral Lipopolysaccharide-Induced TLR2-Dependent Immune Response in Bovine Cells.,"BACKGROUND: Bovine leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease, leading to serious economic losses in animal production and causing potential hazards to human health. Leptospiral lipopolysaccharide (L-LPS) plays an important role in leptospirosis pathogenicity.
OBJECTIVES: With respect to L-LPS endotoxin-like activity, we examined bovine immune response to L-LPS and the inhibitory ability of bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide-28 (BMAP-28) against L-LPS-induced immune activation in bovine cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, L-LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in bovine cells was quantitatively measured with real-time PCR and ELISA, and we determined which cell membrane receptors (toll-like receptor [TLR]2 and TLR4) played a major role. In addition, the ability of BMAP-28 to inhibit L-LPS-induced endotoxin-like immune activation in bovine cells was determined by the decrease in cytokine secretion.
RESULTS: L-LPS showed the ability to induce cytokine production in bovine cells, and its induction was TLR2-dependent. BMAP-28 was used to inhibit L-LPS-induced endotoxin-like activity. The function of BMAP-28 was to inhibit LPS-induced TLR2 expression and cytokine production.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the L-LPS immune response of bovine cells was significant, indicating that TLR2 is the predominant receptor for L-LPS. Due to L-LPS endotoxin-like activity, we found a strategy through using BMAP-28 to prevent L-LPS-induced TLR2-dependent immune activation in bovine cells.","['Guo Y', 'Ding C', 'Zhang B', 'Xu J', 'Xun M', 'Xu J']",2016,9,6,Jundishapur J Microbiol,"Guo Y, et al.

27630853,Effectiveness of Pooled Platelet Transfusion in Concordant and Discordant Groups among Dengue Patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue affects more than 50 million people per year and is one of the most common causes of severe thrombocytopaenia. Thrombocytopaenia is a common complication of dengue and other viral fevers apart from malaria, typhoid, leptospirosis, leukaemia and megaloblastic anaemia. A platelet count of <20,000/μl is characteristically seen in dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue fever. It results from immune complex mediated platelet destruction or bone marrow suppression. Severe thrombocytopaenia <10,000/μl is one of the indications for prophylactic platelet transfusion therapy to prevent haemorrhage.
AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of transfusion of ABO compatible and ABO incompatible pooled platelet units in severe thrombocytopaenia cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study ABO compatible and incompatible pooled platelet units were transfused to serologically confirmed dengue cases having thrombocytopaenia with or without bleeding manifestations. Each of the adult patients received 4-6 units of pooled platelet concentrates prepared from random donor whole blood suspended in plasma for severe thrombocytopaenia. Pre and post transfusion platelet counts were compared. Children aged less than 12 years, pregnant women and patients with splenomegaly those on ayurvedic and homeopathic therapy, recipients of packed red cells on the same day of platelet transfusion and recipients of multiple platelet transfusions within 24 hours were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: The median post transfusion platelet increments (PPI) and corrected count increments (CCI) at 4hour post transfusion were 25,000/μL (5,000-80,000/μL) and 18,000/μL (range 8,000/μL- 47,500/μL) respectively among the responders. Median PPI and CCI at 24 hours were 45,000/μL and 28,863/μL among the responders. The median CCI at 4 hour post transfusion among the non-responders was 850/μL and at 24hours was 1,425/μL. At 24 hours responders showed significantly higher PPI as compared to non responders. The average platelets transfused were 4units in case of responders and 8 units in case of non-responders.
CONCLUSION: ABO identical and compatible pooled platelet transfusions were more successful in increasing the post transfusion platelet counts as compared to ABO incompatible pooled platelets.","['Bhat A', 'Chowdappa V', 'Masamatti SS']",2016,10,7,J Clin Diagn Res,"Bhat A, et al.

27622673,High Leptospira Diversity in Animals and Humans Complicates the Search for Common Reservoirs of Human Disease in Rural Ecuador.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease responsible for high morbidity around the world, especially in tropical and low income countries. Rats are thought to be the main vector of human leptospirosis in urban settings. However, differences between urban and low-income rural communities provide additional insights into the epidemiology of the disease.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our study was conducted in two low-income rural communities near the coast of Ecuador. We detected and characterized infectious leptospira DNA in a wide variety of samples using new real time quantitative PCR assays and amplicon sequencing. We detected infectious leptospira in a high percentage of febrile patients (14.7%). In contrast to previous studies on leptospirosis risk factors, higher positivity was not found in rats (3.0%) but rather in cows (35.8%) and pigs (21.1%). Six leptospira species were identified (L. borgpetersenii, L kirschnerii, L santarosai, L. interrogans, L noguchii, and an intermediate species within the L. licerasiae and L. wolffii clade) and no significant differences in the species of leptospira present in each animal species was detected (χ2 = 9.89, adj.p-value = 0.27).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A large portion of the world's human population lives in low-income, rural communities, however, there is limited information about leptospirosis transmission dynamics in these settings. In these areas, exposure to peridomestic livestock is particularly common and high prevalence of infectious leptospira in cows and pigs suggest that they may be the most important reservoir for human transmission. Genotyping clinical samples show that multiple species of leptospira are involved in human disease. As these genotypes were also detected in samples from a variety of animals, genotype data must be used in conjunction with epidemiological data to provide evidence of transmission and the importance of different potential leptospirosis reservoirs.","['Barragan V', 'Chiriboga J', 'Miller E', 'Olivas S', 'Birdsell D', 'Hepp C', 'Hornstra H', 'Schupp JM', 'Morales M', 'Gonzalez M', 'Reyes S', 'de la Cruz C', 'Keim P', 'Hartskeerl R', 'Trueba G', 'Pearson T']",2016,10,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Barragan V, et al.

27622634,Leptospira Immunoglobulin-Like Protein B (LigB) Binds to Both the C-Terminal 23 Amino Acids of Fibrinogen αC Domain and Factor XIII: Insight into the Mechanism of LigB-Mediated Blockage of Fibrinogen α Chain Cross-Linking.,"The coagulation system provides a primitive but effective defense against hemorrhage. Soluble fibrinogen (Fg) monomers, composed of α, β and γ chains, are recruited to provide structural support for the formation of a hemostatic plug. Fg binds to platelets and is processed into a cross-linked fibrin polymer by the enzymatic clotting factors, thrombin and Factor XIII (FXIII). The newly formed fibrin-platelet clot can act as barrier to protect against pathogens from entering the bloodstream. Further, injuries caused by bacterial infections can be confined to the initial wound site. Many pathogenic bacteria have Fg-binding adhesins that can circumvent the coagulation pathway and allow the bacteria to sidestep containment. Fg expression is upregulated during lung infection providing an attachment surface for bacteria with the ability to produce Fg-binding adhesins. Fg binding by leptospira might play a crucial factor in Leptospira-associated pulmonary hemorrhage, the main factor contributing to lethality in severe cases of leptospirosis. The 12th domain of Leptospira immunoglobulin-like protein B (LigB12), a leptospiral adhesin, interacts with the C-terminus of FgαC (FgαCC). In this study, the binding site for LigB12 was mapped to the final 23 amino acids at the C-terminal end of FgαCC (FgαCC8). The association of FgαCC8 with LigB12 (ELISA, KD = 0.76 μM; SPR, KD = 0.96 μM) was reduced by mutations of both charged residues (R608, R611 and H614 from FgαCC8; D1061 from LigB12) and hydrophobic residues (I613 from FgαCC8; F1054 and A1065 from LigB12). Additionally, LigB12 bound strongly to FXIII and also inhibited fibrin formation, suggesting that LigB can disrupt coagulation by suppressing FXIII activity. Here, the detailed binding mechanism of a leptospiral adhesin to a host hemostatic factor is characterized for the first time and should provide better insight into the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.","['Hsieh CL', 'Chang E', 'Tseng A', 'Ptak C', 'Wu LC', 'Su CL', 'McDonough SP', 'Lin YP', 'Chang YF']",2016,10,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Hsieh CL, et al.

In attempting to understand the causes of DF and leptospirosis seasonality, meteorological factors have been suspected, but quantitative correlation between seasonality and meteorological factors has not been fully investigated. In this study, we investigated correlation of temporal patterns of reported numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases of both DF and leptospirosis with meteorological conditions (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall) in Manila. We used time-series analysis combined with spectral analysis and the least squares method. A 1-year cycle explained underlying variations of DF, leptospirosis and meteorological data. There was a peak of the 1-year cycle in temperature during May, followed by maxima in rainfall, relative humidity and number of laboratory-confirmed DF and leptospirosis cases. This result suggests that DF and leptospirosis epidemics are correlated not only with rainfall but also relative humidity and temperature in the Philippines. Quantifying the correlation of DF and leptospirosis infections with meteorological conditions may prove useful in predicting DF and leptospirosis epidemics, and health services should plan accordingly.","['Sumi A', 'Telan EF', 'Chagan-Yasutan H', 'Piolo MB', 'Hattori T', 'Kobayashi N']",2017,145,1,Epidemiol Infect,"Sumi A, et al.

27574792,"Identification of Tenrec ecaudatus, a Wild Mammal Introduced to Mayotte Island, as a Reservoir of the Newly Identified Human Pathogenic Leptospira mayottensis.","Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis of major concern on tropical islands. Human populations on western Indian Ocean islands are strongly affected by the disease although each archipelago shows contrasting epidemiology. For instance, Mayotte, part of the Comoros Archipelago, differs from the other neighbouring islands by a high diversity of Leptospira species infecting humans that includes Leptospira mayottensis, a species thought to be unique to this island. Using bacterial culture, molecular detection and typing, the present study explored the wild and domestic local mammalian fauna for renal carriage of leptospires and addressed the genetic relationships of the infecting strains with local isolates obtained from acute human cases and with Leptospira strains hosted by mammal species endemic to nearby Madagascar. Tenrec (Tenrec ecaudatus, Family Tenrecidae), a terrestrial mammal introduced from Madagascar, is identified as a reservoir of L. mayottensis. All isolated L. mayottensis sequence types form a monophyletic clade that includes Leptospira strains infecting humans and tenrecs on Mayotte, as well as two other Malagasy endemic tenrecid species of the genus Microgale. The lower diversity of L. mayottensis in tenrecs from Mayotte, compared to that occurring in Madagascar, suggests that L. mayottensis has indeed a Malagasy origin. This study also showed that introduced rats (Rattus rattus) and dogs are probably the main reservoirs of Leptospira borgpetersenii and Leptospira kirschneri, both bacteria being prevalent in local clinical cases. Data emphasize the epidemiological link between the two neighbouring islands and the role of introduced small mammals in shaping the local epidemiology of leptospirosis.","['Lagadec E', 'Gomard Y', 'Le Minter G', 'Cordonin C', 'Cardinale E', 'Ramasindrazana B', 'Dietrich M', 'Goodman SM', 'Tortosa P', 'Dellagi K']",2016,10,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Lagadec E, et al.

30755889,A Rare Presentation of Leptospirosis.,"UNLABELLED: Leptospirosis has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Acute renal failure, an important complication, generally involves interstitial and tubular damage. We describe the case of a 42-year-old man who was admitted with fever, back pain and periorbital oedema. He had hypertension, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, hypoalbuminaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and proteinuria >4.00 g/l. The renal biopsy showed mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Due to the epidemiological context and clinical picture, ceftriaxone was started with rapid clinical improvement. Blood PCR for leptospira came back positive. The presentation of leptospirosis as nephrotic syndrome is rare and this diagnosis should be considered before performing a renal biopsy.
LEARNING POINTS: Leptospirosis is a zoonosis with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations including acute renal failure, which is an important complication.Leptospirosis should be considered in a patient with nephrotic syndrome and acute renal failure if the epidemiological context is favourable.Leptospirosis is one of the causes of nephrotic syndrome where a renal biopsy is not indicated.","['Silva F', 'Brandão M', 'Esteves A']",2016,3,6,Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,"Silva F, et al.

27554098,Utility of modified Faine's criteria in diagnosis of leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a globally emerging zoonotic disease and an important public health threat in developing countries. Diagnosis of leptospirosis is mainly based on clinical presentations in resource poor countries. World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced ""Faine's criteria"" for diagnosis of leptospirosis. This study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of modified Faine's criteria (with amendment) 2012 to detect leptospirosis in resource poor settings.
METHODS: Blood samples of 168 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria admitted between January 2013 to January 2014 were tested by a commercial immunochromatographic assay (Leptocheck WB, India), microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Leptospirosis was confirmed by a single MAT titre ≥1:400 and / or by a positive PCR. Diagnosis of leptospirosis was made using the clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data according to modified Faine's criteria (with amendment) 2012.
RESULTS: Leptospirosis was confirmed in 39 % (n = 66) by MAT and/or PCR. When modified Faine's criteria (MAT ≥ 1.400 &/ or PCR), was evaluated against LERG confirmed cases sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values were 95.45 %, 56.86 %, 58.88 %, 95.08 % respectively. The modified Faine's criteria with rapid immunochromatographic assay only had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value 89.39 %, 58.82 %, 58.42 %, and 89.55 % respectively.
CONCLUSION: The modified Faine's criteria which utilized only immunochromatographic assay (leptocheck IgM) in Part C was found to be useful tool for diagnosing leptospirosis in a resource poor setting.","['Bandara K', 'Weerasekera MM', 'Gunasekara C', 'Ranasinghe N', 'Marasinghe C', 'Fernando N']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Bandara K, et al.

27553785,A retrospective chart review study to describe selected zoonotic and arboviral etiologies in hospitalized febrile patients in the Republic of Armenia.,"BACKGROUND: Scant information is available on the infectious causes of febrile illnesses in Armenia. The goal of this study was to describe the most common causes, with a focus on zoonotic and arboviral infections and related epidemiological and clinical patterns for hospitalized patients with febrile illnesses of infectious origin admitted to Nork Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital, the referral center for infectious diseases in the capital city, Yerevan.
METHOD: A chart review study was conducted in 2014. Data were abstracted from medical charts of adults (≥18 years) with a fever (≥38 °C), who were hospitalized (for ≥24 h) in 2010-2012.
RESULTS: Of the 600 patients whose charts were analyzed, 76 % were from Yerevan and 51 % were male; the mean age (± standard deviation) was 35.5 (±16) years. Livestock exposure was recorded in 5 % of charts. Consumption of undercooked meat and unpasteurized dairy products were reported in 11 and 8 % of charts, respectively. Intestinal infections (51 %) were the most frequently reported final medical diagnoses, followed by diseases of the respiratory system (11 %), infectious mononucleosis (9.5 %), chickenpox (8.3 %), brucellosis (8.3 %), viral hepatitis (3.2 %), and erysipelas (1.5 %). Reviewed medical charts included two cases of fever of unknown origin (FUO), two cutaneous anthrax cases, two leptospirosis cases, three imported malaria cases, one case of rickettsiosis, and one case of rabies. Engagement in agricultural activities, exposure to animals, consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk, and male gender were significantly associated with brucellosis.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicated that brucellosis was the most frequently reported zoonotic disease among hospitalized febrile patients. Overall, these study results suggest that zoonotic and arboviral infections were not common etiologies among febrile adult patients admitted to the Nork Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital in Armenia.","['Paronyan L', 'Zardaryan E', 'Bakunts V', 'Gevorgyan Z', 'Asoyan V', 'Apresyan H', 'Hovhannisyan A', 'Palayan K', 'Bautista CT', 'Kuchuloria T', 'Rivard RG']",2016,16,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Paronyan L, et al.

In this regard, we sought to evaluate the asymptomatic renal carriage status of humans in the highly endemic region of Tiruchirapalli district, Tamilnadu, India. A total of 245 asymptomatic participants were included. Urine and blood samples were collected and the extent of leptospiral infection was characterized by MAT, qPCR, 16S rRNA, and dot blot assay. The qPCR screening with urine DNA identified 129 (52.7%) positive samples further confirmed by nested PCR. The dot blot assay marked 30.2% (74/245) as true positives. The phylogenetic analysis showed the sequences to cluster with pathogenic Leptospira spp. Serological results showed 50 people with urine positivity to be negative for MAT and can probably be classified as 'asymptomatic individuals.' In conclusion, it can be speculated that in endemic regions there is a greater possibility of humans as maintenance host rather than incidental hosts.","['Sivasankari K', 'Shanmughapriya S', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2016,110,4-5,Pathog Glob Health,"Sivasankari K, et al.

27537829,Molecular diagnostics for human leptospirosis.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The definitive diagnosis of leptospirosis, which results from infection with spirochetes of the genus Leptospira, currently relies on the use of culture, serological testing (microscopic agglutination testing), and molecular detection. The purpose of this review is to describe new molecular diagnostics for Leptospira and discuss advancements in the use of available methods.
RECENT FINDINGS: Efforts have been focused on improving the clinical sensitivity of Leptospira detection using molecular methods. In this review, we describe a reoptimized pathogenic species-specific real-time PCR (targeting lipL32) that has demonstrated improved sensitivity, findings by two groups that real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays targeting the 16S rrs gene can improve detection, and two new loop-mediated amplification techniques. Quantitation of leptospiremia, detection in different specimen types, and the complementary roles played by molecular detection and microscopic agglutination testing will be discussed. Finally, a protocol for Leptospira strain subtyping using variable number tandem repeat targets and high-resolution melting will be described.
SUMMARY: Molecular diagnostics have an established role for the diagnosis of leptospirosis and provide an actionable diagnosis in the acute setting. The use of real-time reverse-transcription PCR for testing serum/plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, when available, may improve the detection of Leptospira without decreasing clinical specificity.","['Waggoner JJ', 'Pinsky BA']",2016,29,5,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Waggoner JJ and Pinsky BA.

27529969,[A Case of Leptospirosis in which the Causative Pathogen was Detected Using Cerebrospinal Fluid PCR Eight Days after Onset].,"We report a patient with leptospirosis caused by infection with Leptospira interrogans serovar Rachmati. A 30-year-old Japanese man took part in a survival camp on Iriomote Island, Okinawa, from July 9 to July 15, 2014. During the camp, he swam in the river and kayaked. He developed a high fever and fatigue 7 days after completing his trip and was admitted to our hospital on July 22. On admission, he complained of a posterior cervical pain and a loss of appetite. Laboratory findings revealed granulocytosis, mildly elevated AST and ALT levels, elevated BUN and Cr levels, and a significantly elevated CRP level. No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid cultures. We included leptospirosis in the differential diagnosis because of the patient's history of participating in a survival camp on Iriomote Island. Minocycline 200 mg, p.o. showed an excellent efficacy. The Leptospira flagellar gene FlaB was detected using a cerebrospinal fluid PCR. A microscopic agglutination test (MAT) during the convalescent stage demonstrated significant increases in antibodies against L. interrogans serovar Rachmati, confirming the diagnosis of leptospirosis. A medical history including occupation and recent travel history, and an adequate specimen sampling are crucial for the accurate and early diagnosis of leptospirosis.","['Arita Y', 'Tono T', 'Hosoda T', 'Taguchi H', 'Sakamoto M', 'Osone Y', 'Nozaki H']",2016,90,3,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,"Arita Y, et al.

27528203,Case report: Weil's disease with multiple organ failure in a child living in dengue endemic area.,"BACKGROUND: There were few reports in the literature of Weil's disease with multiple organ failures, especially in children living in dengue endemic areas.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old child was admitted to Tangerang district hospital with a provisional diagnosis of dengue infection. On the third day of hospitalization, dengue diagnostic tests were negative. As fever still remained and was followed by jaundice, decreasing hemoglobin, increasing bilirubin with abnormal value of liver enzymes; other causes of disease were investigated. Leptospirosis was confirmed by rapid IgM test (SD(®)) for leptospira; and micro-agglutination test which indicated Leptospira serogroup bataviae infection. The patient developed Weil's disease during the course of illness. Renal function was back to normal on the 21st day of hospitalization, while hemoglobin and bilirubin returned to normal three weeks after discharged.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights the importance of considering leptospirosis as a differential diagnosis in children with acute febrile illness; even when the signs and symptoms for the more common diagnoses such as dengue or typhoid fever were pathognomonic. A normal leukocyte count with neutrophilia and negative dengue NS1, dengue IgM, and Salmonella typhi IgM on admission should raise suspicion of leptospirosis, and prompt diagnostic assays for leptospirosis should be conducted.","['Lokida D', 'Budiman A', 'Pawitro UE', 'Gasem MH', 'Karyana M', 'Kosasih H', 'Siddiqui S']",2016,9,1,BMC Res Notes,"Lokida D, et al.

27509584,"Fever, thrombocytopenia, and AKI-A profile of malaria, dengue, and leptospirosis with renal failure in a South Indian tertiary-care hospital.","INTRODUCTION: In the tropics, the triad of fever, thrombocytopenia, and AKI portends a grim prognosis with high mortality and a severe strain on already-stretched resources. Malaria, dengue, and leptospirosis account for most cases. We undertook a review of cases to determine factors accounting for adverse prognosis.
METHODS: All patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) with a history of fever, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure were included in the study. Patients were followed until discharge or death, and end points looked at were 1-week and 30-day mortality, and renal function upon discharge. Parameters like liver function test (LFT), renal function, and platelet count upon discharge were also documented.
RESULTS: A total of 43 patients was included in the study. Mean age was 42.5 years with 86% males. Mean APACHE and SOFA scores on admission were 23.89 and 15.42, respectively. Mean admission platelet counts were 41,000. Mean serum creatinine was 4.1, and bilirubin was 9.94. A platelet count of < 34,000, serum creatinine of > 4, albumin of > 2.3, SOFA score of > 20, and APACHE score of > 32.2 were significantly predictive of 1 week mortality. Need for mechanical ventilation, oliguria on admission, and need for dialysis all were highly predictive of 30-day mortality. In addition, a serum bicarbonate of < 12, INR of > 1.5, hemoglobin of < 9.5 were highly predictive of higher 30 day mortality. Overall, 1-week mortality was 16.3%, of which 48% was accounted for by patients with leptospirosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Factors like low platelet count, oliguria, need for dialysis, high APACHE and SOFA scores on admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and low serum albumin portend a grave prognosis. There is need for randomized control trials (RCT) to further determine adverse prognostic factors in this subsect of patients.","['Prabhu MV', 'S A', 'Ramesh V']",2016,86 (2016),13,Clin Nephrol,"Prabhu MV, et al.

27506868,Leptospirosis Presenting with Rapidly Progressing Acute Renal Failure and Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Unexplained renal insufficiency combined with hepatic failure is a common problem encountered by clinicians. As with many disease processes involving multi-organ systems, reversible causes are usually not readily identifiable, and for many patients their health deteriorates rapidly. We present a rare cause of acute renal failure and hyperbilirubinemia occurring simultaneously, with leptospirosis presenting as Weil's disease. CASE REPORT A 53-year-old male presented to our clinic with complaints of anuria over the past two days. His symptoms started with dark urine, severe cramps in the thighs, and chills. The patient was a visitor to the United States from Guyana. Positive physical examination findings included mild tachycardia and hypotension, scleral icterus, and tenderness over abdomen, costovertebral angles, and thighs. The patient had a high white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, renal/hepatic insufficiency, and an urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was initially treated under the suspicion of acute kidney injury secondary to rhabdomyolysis and pyelonephritis. The patient continued to deteriorate with decreasing platelet counts, worsening renal function, hyperbilirubinemia, and respiratory distress, with no improvement with hemodialysis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered, including doxycycline, due to a high suspicion of leptospirosis. The patient's condition drastically improved after initiation of doxycycline. On subsequent days, the patient's Leptospira antibody results were available, showing titers of more than 1:3200. Hemodialysis was discontinued as the patient started producing urine with improved kidney function. CONCLUSIONS As world travel becomes more economically feasible, we will continue to encounter foreign endemic diseases. Leptospirosis presenting as Weil's disease is a common cause of renal and hyperbilirubinemia in endemic areas. Often, as was the case for our patient where the time from presentation to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 72 hours, the diagnosis evolves over the course of several days. Antibody testing often takes time and delays in treatment can cause rapid clinical deterioration. In such cases, we recommend beginning empiric treatment before confirmation of laboratory tests.","['Pothuri P', 'Ahuja K', 'Kumar V', 'Lal S', 'Tumarinson T', 'Mahmood K']",2016,17,,Am J Case Rep,"Pothuri P, et al.

27506799,Lyme disease and relapsing fever Borrelia elongate through zones of peptidoglycan synthesis that mark division sites of daughter cells.,"Agents that cause Lyme disease, relapsing fever, leptospirosis, and syphilis belong to the phylum Spirochaetae-a unique lineage of bacteria most known for their long, spiral morphology. Despite the relevance to human health, little is known about the most fundamental aspects of spirochete growth. Here, using quantitative microscopy to track peptidoglycan cell-wall synthesis, we found that the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi displays a complex pattern of growth. B. burgdorferi elongates from discrete zones that are both spatially and temporally regulated. In addition, some peptidoglycan incorporation occurs along the cell body, with the notable exception of a large region at the poles. Newborn cells inherit a highly active zone of peptidoglycan synthesis at midcell that contributes to elongation for most of the cell cycle. Concomitant with the initiation of nucleoid separation and cell constriction, second and third zones of elongation are established at the 1/4 and 3/4 cellular positions, marking future sites of division for the subsequent generation. Positioning of elongation zones along the cell is robust to cell length variations and is relatively precise over long distances (>30 µm), suggesting that cells ‟sense"" relative, as opposed to absolute, cell length to establish zones of peptidoglycan synthesis. The transition from one to three zones of peptidoglycan growth during the cell cycle is also observed in relapsing fever Borrelia. However, this mode of growth does not extend to representative species from other spirochetal genera, suggesting that this distinctive growth mode represents an evolutionary divide in the spirochete phylum.","['Jutras BL', 'Scott M', 'Parry B', 'Biboy J', 'Gray J', 'Vollmer W', 'Jacobs-Wagner C']",2016,113,33,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Jutras BL, et al.

Very rarely, it also displays a ""crazy paving"" pattern (also described as a ""paving stone,"" ""flagstone,"" or ""slabstone"" pattern), which is rarer still in discrete bilateral nodules. This pattern is considered to be caused by pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, but its association with various diseases is unclear.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with pulmonary melanoma. Computed tomography revealed discrete bilateral nodules surrounded by a ""paving"" pattern. A literature review found more than 40 types of diseases that have presented with ""paving"" patterns in the lung-predominantly pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, viral pneumonia, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, interstitial pneumonia, ARDS, squalene aspiration pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonitis, pulmonary leptospirosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary nocardiosis.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first case of pulmonary melanoma in the form of discrete bilateral nodules accompanied with a computed tomography paving pattern. Although pulmonary paving patterns are rare, more than 40 diseases reportedly display them; clinicians should consider melanoma of the lung in differential diagnoses for patients who show such a pattern.","['Feng Y', 'Zhao J', 'Yang Q', 'Xiong W', 'Zhen G', 'Xu Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang H']",2016,16,,BMC Cancer,"Feng Y, et al.

27487084,An Optimized Method for Quantification of Pathogenic Leptospira in Environmental Water Samples.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease usually acquired by contact with water contaminated with urine of infected animals. However, few molecular methods have been used to monitor or quantify pathogenic Leptospira in environmental water samples. Here we optimized a DNA extraction method for the quantification of leptospires using a previously described Taqman-based qPCR method targeting lipL32, a gene unique to and highly conserved in pathogenic Leptospira. QIAamp DNA mini, MO BIO PowerWater DNA and PowerSoil DNA Isolation kits were evaluated to extract DNA from sewage, pond, river and ultrapure water samples spiked with leptospires. Performance of each kit varied with sample type. Sample processing methods were further evaluated and optimized using the PowerSoil DNA kit due to its performance on turbid water samples and reproducibility. Centrifugation speeds, water volumes and use of Escherichia coli as a carrier were compared to improve DNA recovery. All matrices showed a strong linearity in a range of concentrations from 106 to 10° leptospires/mL and lower limits of detection ranging from <1 cell /ml for river water to 36 cells/mL for ultrapure water with E. coli as a carrier. In conclusion, we optimized a method to quantify pathogenic Leptospira in environmental waters (river, pond and sewage) which consists of the concentration of 40 mL samples by centrifugation at 15,000×g for 20 minutes at 4°C, followed by DNA extraction with the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit. Although the method described herein needs to be validated in environmental studies, it potentially provides the opportunity for effective, timely and sensitive assessment of environmental leptospiral burden.","['Riediger IN', 'Hoffmaster AR', 'Casanovas-Massana A', 'Biondo AW', 'Ko AI', 'Stoddard RA']",2016,11,8,PLoS One,"Riediger IN, et al.

27487001,Hemodiafiltration Decreases Serum Levels of Inflammatory Mediators in Severe Leptospirosis: A Prospective Study.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a health problem worldwide. Its most severe form is a classic model of sepsis, provoking acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI), with associated mortality that remains unacceptably high. We previously demonstrated that early initiation of sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) followed by daily SLED significantly decreases mortality. However, the mode of clearance can also affect dialysis patient outcomes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the effects of SLED with traditional (diffusive) clearance, via hemodialysis, and SLED with convective clearance, via hemodiafiltration (SLEDf), in patients with severe leptospirosis.
METHODS: In this prospective study, conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) from 2009 through 2012, we compared two groups-SLED (n = 19) and SLEDf (n = 20)-evaluating demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters, as well as serum levels of interleukins, up to the third day after admission. All patients received dialysis early and daily thereafter.
RESULTS: During the study period, 138 patients were admitted to our ICU with a diagnosis of leptospirosis; 39 (36 males/3 females) met the criteria for ARDS and AKI. All patients were on mechanical ventilation and were comparable in terms of respiratory parameters. Mortality did not differ between the SLEDf and SLED groups. However, post-admission decreases in the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-7, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were significantly greater in the SLEDf group. Direct bilirubin and the arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio were significantly higher in the SLED group. We identified the following risk factors (sensitivities/specificities) for mortality in severe leptospirosis: age ≥ 55 years (67%/91%); serum urea ≥ 204 mg/dl (100%/70%); creatinine ≥ 5.2 mg/dl (100%/58%); Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score ≥ 39.5 (67%/88%); Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ≥ 20.5 (67%/85%); and inspiratory pressure ≥ 31 mmHg (84%/85%).

27486445,Interaction of Bovine Peripheral Blood Polymorphonuclear Cells and Leptospira Species; Innate Responses in the Natural Bovine Reservoir Host.,"Cattle are the reservoir hosts of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo, and can also be reservoir hosts of other Leptospira species such as L. kirschneri, and Leptospira interrogans. As a reservoir host, cattle shed Leptospira, infecting other animals, including humans. Previous studies with human and murine neutrophils have shown activation of neutrophil extracellular trap or NET formation, and upregulation of inflammatory mediators by neutrophils in the presence of Leptospira. Humans, companion animals and most widely studied models of Leptospirosis are of acute infection, hallmarked by systemic inflammatory response, neutrophilia, and septicemia. In contrast, cattle exhibit chronic infection with few outward clinical signs aside from reproductive failure. Taking into consideration that there is host species variation in innate immunity, especially in pathogen recognition and response, the interaction of bovine peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and several Leptospira strains was evaluated. Studies including bovine-adapted strains, human pathogen strains, a saprophyte and inactivated organisms. Incubation of PMNs with Leptospira did induce slight activation of neutrophil NETs, greater than unstimulated cells but less than the quantity from E. coli P4 stimulated PMNs. Very low but significant from non-stimulated, levels of reactive oxygen peroxides were produced in the presence of all Leptospira strains and E. coli P4. Similarly, significant levels of reactive nitrogen intermediaries (NO2) was produced from PMNs when incubated with the Leptospira strains and greater quantities in the presence of E. coli P4. PMNs incubated with Leptospira induced RNA transcripts of IL-1β, MIP-1α, and TNF-α, with greater amounts induced by live organisms when compared to heat-inactivated leptospires. Transcript for inflammatory cytokine IL-8 was also induced, at similar levels regardless of Leptospira strain or viability. However, incubation of Leptospira strains with bovine PMNs did not affect Leptospira viability as measured by limiting dilution culture. This is in contrast to previously reported results of innate inflammatory activation by Leptospira in human and other animal models, or the activation and interaction of bovine PMNs with Escherichia coli and other bacterial pathogens. While it could be hypothesized that variations in innate receptor recognition, specifically variance in toll-like receptor 2, could underlie the observed reduction of activation in bovine PMNs, additional studies would be needed to explore this possibility. Reduction in neutrophil responses may help to establish nearly asymptomatic chronic Leptospira infection of cattle. This study emphasizes the importance of studying host-pathogen relationships in the appropriate species as extrapolation from other animal models may be incorrect and confounded by differences in the host responses.","['Wilson-Welder JH', 'Frank AT', 'Hornsby RL', 'Olsen SC', 'Alt DP']",2016,7,,Front Microbiol,"Wilson-Welder JH, et al.

DESIGN Diagnostic survey and test evaluation. SAMPLE Leptospiral DNA isolated from urine samples from 98 dogs confirmed through PCR testing to have pathogenic leptospires in their urine. PROCEDURES VNTR analysis of DNA isolates was performed to identify the infecting leptospiral serovar and strain by use of primer pairs for the loci 4, 7, 10, and Lb5. Eighteen pathogenic and 2 saprophytic leptospiral serovars were used as reference strains for VNTR analysis. Results of MAT were compared with those of the PCR assay and VNTR analysis to determine the sensitivity and specificity of MAT for diagnosing leptospirosis and identifying the infecting serovar at various reciprocal titers. RESULTS VNTR analysis identified Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa strain DF as the most common infecting serovar in dogs (78/98 [80%]). Thirteen unique VNTR patterns could not be identified by comparison with the Leptospira reference strains used. The MAT had a maximum sensitivity of 41% and a specificity of 100% for identifying Grippotyphosa as the infecting serogroup. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings confirmed the importance of Leptospira serovar Grippotyphosa among dogs in the United States. Serologic testing had poor sensitivity for identifying the infecting serogroup, and conclusions about emerging serogroups should be cautiously interpreted when serologic data are reported.","['Harkin KR', 'Hays MP']",2016,249,4,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Harkin KR and Hays MP.

27479026,"Situation of Sri Lanka, where autochthonous malaria is no longer a problem, and other infections dominate, such as dengue, leptospirosis and rickettsioses.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sri Lanka achieved a major milestone in communicable disease control in 2012 by reporting zero incidence of autochthonous malaria. However, reduction of malaria was associated with concurrent increase of several tropical diseases. This review looks into the time trends and epidemiology of these communicable diseases in Sri Lanka.
RECENT FINDINGS: Reduction of malaria cases coincides with an increase of dengue, leptospirosis and rickettsioses in Sri Lanka. Although the case fatality rate of dengue has reduced and maintained below 1%, leptospirosis in clinical management is questionable. Despite having national focal points for control and prevention, these emerging diseases are completely out of control. Whether the holding back of vector control activities of malaria after a successful control programme is having an effect on emergence of other vector-borne diseases should be studied.
SUMMARY: The communicable disease control programme in Sri Lanka should be further strengthened with availability of proper and rapid diagnostic facilities. Malaria control could not be considered as a great achievement due to the fact that other emerging infectious diseases are replacing malaria.","['Agampodi S', 'Wijerathne B', 'Weerakoon K']",2016,29,5,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Agampodi S, et al.

27478327,Clinical Evaluation of Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit for Scrub Typhus with Improved Performance.,"Diagnosis of scrub typhus is challenging due to its more than twenty serotypes and the similar clinical symptoms with other acute febrile illnesses including leptospirosis, murine typhus and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Accuracy and rapidity of a diagnostic test to Orientia tsutsugamushi is an important step to diagnose this disease. To discriminate scrub typhus from other diseases, the improved ImmuneMed Scrub Typhus Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) was evaluated in Korea and Sri Lanka. The sensitivity at the base of each IgM and IgG indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) in Korean patients was 98.6% and 97.1%, and the specificity was 98.2% and 97.7% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for retrospective diagnosis at the base of IFA in Sri Lanka was 92.1% and 96.1%. ImmuneMed RDT was not reactive to any serum from seventeen diseases including hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (n = 48), leptospirosis (n = 23), and murine typhus (n = 48). ImmuneMed RDT shows superior sensitivity (98.6% and 97.1%) compared with SD Bioline RDT (84.4% at IgM and 83.3% at IgG) in Korea. The retrospective diagnosis of ImmuneMed RDT exhibits 94.0% identity with enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using South India patient serum samples. These results suggest that this RDT can replace other diagnostic tests and is applicable for global diagnosis of scrub typhus. This rapid and accurate diagnosis will be beneficial for diagnosing and managing scrub typhus.","['Kim YJ', 'Park S', 'Premaratna R', 'Selvaraj S', 'Park SJ', 'Kim S', 'Kim D', 'Kim MS', 'Shin DH', 'Choi KC', 'Kwon SH', 'Seo W', 'Lee NT', 'Kim SH', 'Kang HK', 'Kim YW']",2016,31,8,J Korean Med Sci,"Kim YJ, et al.

27468683,"Mammalian cell entry (Mce) protein of Leptospira interrogans binds extracellular matrix components, plasminogen and β2 integrin.","A severe re-emergingzoonosis, leptospirosis, is caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Several studies have identified leptospiral surface proteins with the ability to bind ECM and plasma components, which could mediate adhesion and invasion through the hosts. It has been shown that Mce of pathogenic Leptospira spp. is an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-motif-dependent virulence factor, responsible for infection of cells and animals. In the present article, we decided to further study the repertoire of the Mce activities in leptospiral biological properties. We report that the recombinant Mce is a broad-spectrum ECM-binding protein, capable of interacting with laminin, cellular and plasma fibronectin and collagen IV. Dose--r-esponse interaction was observed for all the components, fulfilling ligand--receptor requirements. Mce is a PLG binding protein capable to recruit this component from NHS, generating PLA in the presence of PLG activator. Binding of Mce was also observed with the leukocyte cell receptors αLβ2 [(CD11a/CD18)-LFA-1] and αMβ2 [(CD11b/CD18)-Mac-1], suggesting the involvement of this protein in the host immune response. Indeed, virulent Leptospira L1-130 was capable of binding both integrins, whereas culture-attenuated M-20 strain only bind to αMβ2 [(CD11b/CD18)-Mac-1]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to describe that Mce surface protein could mediate the attachment of Leptospira interrogans to human cell receptors αLβ2(CD11a/CD18) and αMβ2(CD11b/CD18).","['Cosate MR', 'Siqueira GH', 'de Souza GO', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Nascimento AL']",2016,60,9,Microbiol Immunol,"Cosate MR, et al.

Therefore, we determined the prevalence and carrier status of leptospirosis in large ruminants using molecular techniques and assessed the risk factors of acquiring leptospirosis in these animals. Water buffalo and cattle urine samples (n=831) collected from 21 farms during 2013-2015 were subjected to flaB-nested PCR to detect pathogenic Leptospira spp. Leptospiral flaB was detected in both species with a detection rate of 16.1%. Leptospiral DNA was detected only in samples from animals managed in communal farms. Sequence analysis of Leptospira flaB in large ruminants revealed the formation of three major clusters with L. borgpetersenii or L. kirschneri. One farm contained Leptospira flaB sequences from all clusters identified in this study, suggesting this farm was the main source of leptospires for other farms. This study suggested that these large ruminants are infected with various pathogenic Leptospira species causing possible major economic loss in the livestock industry as well as potential Leptospira reservoirs that can transmit infection to humans and other animals in the Philippines.","['Villanueva MA', 'Mingala CN', 'Balbin MM', 'Nakajima C', 'Isoda N', 'Suzuki Y', 'Koizumi N']",2016,78,11,J Vet Med Sci,"Villanueva MA, et al.

27448599,Mapping risk of leptospirosis in China using environmental and socioeconomic data.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a water-borne and widespread spirochetal zoonosis caused by pathogenic bacteria called leptospires. Human leptospirosis is an important zoonotic infectious disease with frequent outbreaks in recent years in China. Leptospirosis's emergence has been linked to many environmental and ecological drivers of disease transmission. In this paper, we identified the environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with leptospirosis in China, and predict potential risk area of leptospirosis using predictive models.
METHODS: Leptospirosis incidence data were derived from the database of China's web-based infectious disease reporting system, a national surveillance network maintained by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We built statistical relationship between occurrence of leptospirosis and nine environmental and socioeconomic risk factors using logistic regression model and Maxent model.
RESULTS: Both logistic regression model and Maxent model have high performance in predicting the occurrence of leptospirosis, with AUC value of 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. Annual mean temperature (Bio1) and annual total precipitation (Bio12) are two most important variables governing the geographic distribution of leptospirosis in China. The geographic distributions of areas at risk of leptospirosis predicted from both models show high agreement. The risk areas are located mainly in seven provinces of China: Sichuan Province, Chongqing Municipality, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Guangdong Province, Guangxi Province, and Hainan Province, where surveillance and control programs are urgently needed. Logistic regression model and Maxent model predicted that 403 and 464 counties are at very high risk of leptospirosis, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of socioeconomic and environmental variables and predictive models in identifying risk areas for leptospirosis in China. The values of Geographic Information System and predictive models were demonstrated for investigating the geographic distribution, estimating socioeconomic and environmental risk factors, and enhancing our understanding of leptospirosis in China.","['Zhao J', 'Liao J', 'Huang X', 'Zhao J', 'Wang Y', 'Ren J', 'Wang X', 'Ding F']",2016,16,,BMC Infect Dis,"Zhao J, et al.

27421882,Immunoreactivity of the AAA+ chaperone ClpB from Leptospira interrogans with sera from Leptospira-infected animals.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospira interrogans is a spirochaete responsible for leptospirosis in mammals. The molecular mechanisms of the Leptospira virulence remain mostly unknown. Recently, it has been demonstrated that L. interrogans ClpB (ClpBLi) is essential for bacterial survival under stressful conditions and also during infection. The aim of this study was to provide further insight into the role of ClpB in L. interrogans and answer the question whether ClpBLi as a potential virulence factor may be a target of the humoral immune response during leptospiral infections in mammals.
RESULTS: ClpBLi consists of 860 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 96.3 kDa and shows multi-domain organization similar to that of the well-characterized ClpB from Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence identity between ClpBLi and E. coli ClpB is 52 %. The coding sequence of the clpB Li gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. Immunoreactivity of the recombinant ClpBLi protein was assessed with the sera collected from Leptospira-infected animals and uninfected healthy controls. Western blotting and ELISA analysis demonstrated that ClpBLi activates the host immune system, as evidenced by an increased level of antibodies against ClpBLi in the sera from infected animals, as compared to the control group. Additionally, ClpBLi was found in kidney tissues of Leptospira-infected hamsters.
CONCLUSIONS: ClpBLi is both synthesized and immunogenic during the infectious process, further supporting its involvement in the pathogenicity of Leptospira. In addition, the immunological properties of ClpBLi point to its potential value as a diagnostic antigen for the detection of leptospirosis.","['Krajewska J', 'Arent Z', 'Więckowski D', 'Zolkiewski M', 'Kędzierska-Mieszkowska S']",2016,16,1,BMC Microbiol,"Krajewska J, et al.

During the French Polynesian chikungunya virus outbreak in 2014-2015, two leptospirosis and chikungunya co-infections were reported, one of which was fatal. Diagnosis of leptospiroses was delayed in the context of chikungunya outbreak. In the context of arbovirus outbreak, the risk of misdiagnosis of leptospirosis is maximum and clinicians should initiate early antibiotic therapy if leptospirosis is suspected. A delayed diagnosis of leptospirosis can be responsible for fatal outcome.

METHODS: The cross-sectional study involved 350 asymptomatic oil palm plantation workers in Melaka and Johor. A serological test using the microscopic agglutination test was conducted in the Institute of Medical Research with a cut-off titre for seropositivity of ≥1:100.
RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of leptospiral antibodies was 28.6%. The job category with the highest seroprevalence was the fruit collector with 59.2%. The predominant serovar identified was serovar Sarawak (Lepto 175) (62%).
CONCLUSION: A high seroprevalence of leptospiral antibodies was detected among oil palm plantation workers and specifically among fruit collectors.

27413521,Clinical and Laboratory Characteristics of Dengue-Orientia tsutsugamushi co-Infection from a Tertiary Care Center in South India.,"BACKGROUND: Concurrent infection with multiple pathogens is common in tropics, posing diagnostic and treatment challenges. Although co-infections of dengue, malaria, leptospirosis and typhoid in various combinations have been described, data on dengue and scrub typhus co-infection is distinctly limited.
METHODOLOGY: This study was a retrospective analysis of dengue and scrub typhus co-infection diagnosed between January 2010 and July 2014 at a tertiary care center. Clinical and laboratory features of these cases were compared with age and gender-matched patients with isolated dengue fever and isolated scrub typhus. Positive test for dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen was considered diagnostic of dengue whereas scrub typhus was diagnosed by IgM scrub antibodies demonstrated by ELISA.
RESULTS: There were 6 cases of dengue-scrub co-infection during the review period which fitted clinical and laboratory profile with a mean age of 42.5 years. Fever, headache, and arthralgia were common. Normal hemoglobin, significant thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, and hypoalbuminemia were identified in these patients. Compared to patients with isolated dengue, those with co-infection had higher pulse rate, lower systolic blood pressure, normal leucocyte counts, higher levels of liver enzymes, greater prolongation of partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and lower serum albumin. Co-infection was characterized by a lower nadir platelet count compared to scrub typhus, and lesser time to nadir platelet count and longer duration of hospital stay compared to either isolated dengue or scrub typhus.
CONCLUSION: Dengue-scrub typhus co-infection may be under-diagnosed in tropics, particularly confounded during dengue epidemics. Normal leukocyte counts, early drop in platelets and hypoalbuminemia in dengue patients could be clues to concurrent scrub typhus infection. Prompt recognition and treatment of scrub typhus in such cases may reduce unnecessary hospital stay and cost.","['Basheer A', 'Iqbal N', 'Mookkappan S', 'Anitha P', 'Nair S', 'Kanungo R', 'Kandasamy R']",2016,8,1,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,"Basheer A, et al.

Leptospirosis is a notifiable disease in Malaysia since 2010 whereby probable or confirmed cases must be notified to relevant health district office. There were 3,665 and 4,457 probable and laboratory confirmed leptospirosis cases notified in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In the 2-year period, the most common age group of patients was 19 years old or less (23.3%) with male:female ratio of 2.61:1. Students consisted about 16.9% of patients, followed by agriculture-based or plantation workers (14.7%). Overall age-standardized incidence rate of leptospirosis in Malaysia for 2012 and 2013 was 29.02 per 100,000. Overall case fatality rate was 1.47% for 2-year period and overall age-standardized mortality rate was 0.45 per 100,000.

In the context of a flood-related outbreak of leptospirosis evaluated in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, a specimen bank was obtained with detailed metadata accompanied by gold standard diagnostic test results. Blood samples collected on admission and 14 days later from suspected cases of leptospirosis were tested using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) (17 serovars), an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a locally obtained strain of Leptospira kirschneri as sonicated antigen, a commercially available ELISA based on sonicated Leptospira biflexa, and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay targeting the pathogenic Leptospira-specific 16S rRNA gene. Of 62 patients presenting within the first 2 days of illness, 31 had confirmed leptospirosis based either on paired-sample MAT or qPCR. During the acute phase, qPCR was most sensitive, detecting 74% of definitively diagnosed cases; immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA (in-house), IgG ELISA (commercial), and MAT had sensitivities of 35.5%, 12.0%, and 22.6%, respectively, in detecting definitively diagnosed cases using acute phase serum. Of 40 patients with paired sera, 10 were qPCR positive. Of these, five samples were negative by paired-sample MAT. Of the 11 MAT-positive samples, only five were detected using qPCR confirming that both tests are needed for maximal sensitivity. Regional leptospiral serovar-specific IgG ELISA was superior to MAT. Knowing the regionally dominant serovars improves serological sensitivity in the analysis of acute specimens by ELISA, but qPCR was most sensitive in this patient population.","['Agampodi SB', 'Dahanayaka NJ', 'Nöckler K', 'Mayer-Scholl A', 'Vinetz JM']",2016,95,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Agampodi SB, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the work environment-related risk factors for leptospirosis infection among oil palm plantation workers in Malaysia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 350 workers was conducted. The participants were interviewed and administered a microscopic agglutination test. Seropositivity was determined using a cut-off titer of ≥1:100.
RESULTS: 100 of 350 workers tested positive for leptospiral antibodies, hence, a seroprevalence of 28.6% (95% CI 23.8% to 33.3%). The workplace environment-related risk factors significantly associated with seropositive leptospirosis were the presence of cows in plantations (adjusted OR 4.78, 95% CI 2.76 to 8.26) and the presence of a landfill in plantations (adjusted OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.40).
CONCLUSION: Preventing leptospirosis incidence among oil palm plantation workers necessitates changes in policy on work environments. Identifying modifiable factors may also contribute to the reduction of the infection.","['Mohd Ridzuan J', 'Aziah BD', 'Zahiruddin WM']",2016,7,3,Int J Occup Environ Med,"Mohd Ridzuan J, et al.

We described the efficacy and safety of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) as rescue therapy in acute respiratory failure secondary to LPHS. This is a retrospective case study of five patients with diagnosis of severe LPHS, who were admitted to Intensive Care Unit from October 2014 to January 2015. They developed refractory hypoxemia on conventional mechanical ventilation and rescue therapy was indicated. All patients responded rapidly by showing improvements in oxygen index and PaO2/FiO2 ratio within first 72 h of therapy. Despite severity of illness evidenced by high Simplified Acute Physiological II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, all patients were discharged from hospital alive. In view of the rapid onset and extent of hemorrhage which may culminate quickly into asphyxiation and death, HFOV may indeed be lifesaving in severe LPHS.","['Mat Nor MB', 'Md Ralib A', 'Ibrahim NA', 'Abdul-Ghani MR']",2016,20,6,Indian J Crit Care Med,"Mat Nor MB, et al.

27387046,Micronutrients and Leptospirosis: A Review of the Current Evidence.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonoses and represents a major threat to human health. Due to the high burden of disease, limitations in diagnostics, and limited coverage and availability of effective human and veterinary vaccines, leptospirosis remains an important neglected zoonotic disease. Improved surveillance and identification of modifiable risk factors for leptospirosis are urgently needed to inform preventive interventions and reduce the risk and severity of Leptospira infection.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This review was conducted to examine the evidence that links micronutrient status and Leptospira infection. A total of 56 studies were included in this review: 28 in vitro, 17 animal, and 11 observational human studies. Findings indicated that Leptospira infection is associated with higher iron and calcium concentrations and hypomagnesemia.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Few prospective studies and no randomized trials have been conducted to date to examine the potential role of micronutrients in Leptospira infection. The limited literature in this area constrains our ability to make specific recommendations; however, the roles of iron, calcium, and magnesium in leptospirosis represent important areas for future research. The role of micronutrients in leptospirosis risk and severity needs to be elucidated in larger prospective human studies to inform public health interventions.","['Herman HS', 'Mehta S', 'Cárdenas WB', 'Stewart-Ibarra AM', 'Finkelstein JL']",2016,10,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Herman HS, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate people's perceptions and behavioral risks regarding leptospirosis infection.
METHODS: The cross-sectional descriptive study collected data in May, 2013. Data on individuals' perceptions and risky behaviors concerning leptospirosis were collected from 104 completed questionnaires.
RESULTS: Regarding perceptions of leptospirosis, we found them to be at a high level (97.1%) and risky behaviors regarding leptospirosis were reported at a moderate level (74.0%). The study found no correlation between perceptions and risky behaviors regarding leptospirosis (r 0.186, p-value 0.059).
CONCLUSION: This study suggest that people in these areas have good knowledge about leptospirosis. However, some people have risky behavior associated with leptospirosis.

This study was designed to evaluate cardiac injury and dysfunction in acute kidney injury in dogs and its association with outcome.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled 24 client-owned dogs with acute kidney injury. Cardiac disorders were evaluated with thoracic radiographs, echocardiography, 24-hour Holter monitoring and cardiac troponin I concentrations within 2 days of admission and 7 to 10 days later.
RESULTS: Most dogs were diagnosed with leptospirosis (n=18, 75%) and presented with moderate-to-severe acute kidney injury, International Renal Interest Society grades III to V. Dogs with ê100 ventricular premature complexes per 24 hour in the first examination (n=8) had significantly higher initial cTnI concentrations (P=0·007) compared to dogs with fewer than 100. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the number of ventricular premature complexes was predictive of outcome (AUC 0·83, P<0·001).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Acute kidney injury seems to be associated with cardiac injury and arrhythmias in dogs.

27350908,"Detection of dengue, west Nile virus, rickettsiosis and leptospirosis by a new real-time PCR strategy.","Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes sudden fever along with several nonspecific signs and symptoms and in severe cases, death. DENV is transmitted to people by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, whose populations increase during rainy season. West Nile Virus (WNV), Rickettsia spp. and Leptospira spp. are fever-causing pathogens that share many of the initial symptoms of DENV infection and also thrive in the rainy season. Outbreaks in some regions may be due to any of these pathogens that can co-circulate. Plus, they are clinically indistinguishable until severe symptoms appear, even though these diseases should be treated differently. An effective differential diagnosis would help clinicians and vector control departments to make right decisions for control and treatment of these diseases. Therefore, we developed four different SYBR green (®) -based reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays for simultaneous detection of DENV, WNV, Rickettsia spp. and Leptospira spp. The assay has been optimized to yield results in less than 1 h; and in order to reduce contamination risk, all reagents were premixed and lyophilized on 96 well plates and thus only requires the addition of water and total nucleic acids from the sample. Sensitivities of the assays were less than 100 copies of nucleic acid targeted for these four pathogens. Assays did not show cross reactivity with any of the four pathogens nor to human nucleic acids.

27348885,Serological investigation of Leptospira infection and its circulation in one intensive-type water buffalo farm in the Philippines.,"Water buffalo is an indispensable livestock in the Philippines. Leptospirosis is a serious zoonosis that can be fatal to humans and cause reproductive problems in livestock. Leptospirosis has been reported in some countries where water buffaloes are commercially raised, highlighting the Leptospira prevalence in this farming system, but information on leptospirosis in water buffalo farms in the Philippines is limited. In this study, we collected blood samples from rats (n = 21), and water buffaloes (n = 170) from different groups and locations in one intensive-type buffalo farm in the Philippines. Serum was analyzed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Anti-Leptospira antibodies reacting with serogroups Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pomona were found in sera of 30% tested rats, and 48% of water buffalo sera tested positive for at least one Leptospira strain, in which serogroups Mini, Hebdomadis, Tarassovi and Pyrogenes were predominantly agglutinated. The number of seropositive young water buffaloes (< 1 year-old) was lower than that of older seropositive ones. Furthermore, sera from younger water buffaloes were reactive with single serotypes with low MAT titers, but older animals were reactive with multiple Leptospira strains with variable MAT titers. In addition, antibodies against serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pomona were detected in both animals. Finally, Leptospira infection was found associated with age and animal grouping, highlighting the impact of management in the persistence of leptospirosis at intensive-type buffalo farm settings in the Philippines. Further investigation and appropriate control strategies are required to prevent leptospirosis from causing risks to public health and economic losses to the water buffalo farming industry.","['Villanueva MA', 'Mingala CN', 'Gloriani NG', 'Yanagihara Y', 'Isoda N', 'Nakajima C', 'Suzuki Y', 'Koizumi N']",2016,64,1,Jpn J Vet Res,"Villanueva MA, et al.

27344919,Urinary shedding of leptospires and presence of Leptospira antibodies in healthy dogs from Upper Bavaria.,"Leptospirosis is classified as a re-emerging zoonotic disease with global impor- tance. The aim of this study was to determine urinary shedding of leptospires in healthy dogs and to identify the shedded leptospire species. Furthermore, antibody presence against leptospires was evaluated. In a prospective study urine samples of 200 healthy dogs from Upper Bavaria were randomly collected and evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for the lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira (L) spp. Positive samples were further character- ized via multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to identify the Leptospira species. Microagglutination test (MAT) was performed to determine serum antibody titers. Three of 200 urine samples were found to be PCR-positive resulting in a urinary shedding prevalence of 1.5% (95% confidence interval 0.3-4.5%). All three dogs had been vaccinated before with a bivalent vaccine, covering the serogroups Canicola and lcterohaemorrhagiae. One dog shed leptospires of the species L. borgpetersenii, and two of the species L. interrogans. Of all dogs, 17.0% had antibody titers ≥ 1:100, and 3.5% titers ≥ 1:400 to serovars of non-vaccinal sero- groups. Healthy dogs that shed leptospires represent a possible risk for humans and other animals. The study emphasizes the importance of general hygiene measures in veterinary practice while handling urine of all dogs, and the use of vaccines that protect against a broader range of serogroups and that prevent urinary shedding.","['Llewellyn JR', 'Krupka-Dyachenko I', 'Rettinger AL', 'Dyachenko V', 'Stamm I', 'Kopp PA', 'Straubinger RK', 'Hartmann K']",2016,129,5-6,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,"Llewellyn JR, et al.

In a population of 225 horses leptospira were examined in vitreous humor by culture and leptospira antibody were detected in vitreous humor and serum samples. Preoperative serum samples were collected from 221/225 ERU patients of different age, gender and breed. Undiluted vitreous humor was aseptically taken from 198/225 patients that underwent pars plana vitrectomy at the beginning of surgery and from 27/225 patients' eyeball after enucleation: Serum and vitreous humor were tested for specific leptospiral antibodies by microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Furthermore, vitreous humor was examined by culture. 20 patients which were euthanized due to a live-threatening disease other than ERU served as a control group. A total of 127/221 (57.5%) horses had serum antibodies (≥ 1:100). Most frequently antibodies against L. interrogans serovar Grippotyphosa were detected (79/127), followed by L. interrogans serovar lcterohaemorrhagiae (34/127) and L. interrogans serovar Bratislava (29/127). Only 79/225 horses (35.1%) had leptospiral antibodies in vitreous humor, in which L. interrogans serovar Grippotyphosa (67/79) was identified most frequently followed by L. interrogans serovar Pomona (18/79) and L. interrogans serovar lcterohaemorrhagiae (8/79) which was identified as single or multiple reaction. Isolation of leptospira from vitreous humor was positive in 34/212 horses (16%). 10/20 control horses had a positive antibody titer against leptospira in serum and 2/20 horses in vitreous humor, whereas there was no leptospira detected in culture. The result of 84% negative cultures from vitreous humor of 212 ERU patients is decisive for the diagnosis and therapy of ERU.","['Dorrego-Keiter E', 'Tóth J', 'Dikker L', 'Sielhorst J', 'Schusser GF']",2016,129,5-6,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,"Dorrego-Keiter E, et al.

27333195,A Diagnostic Scoring Model for Leptospirosis in Resource Limited Settings.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection with significant morbidity and mortality. The clinical presentation of leptospirosis is known to mimic the clinical profile of other prevalent tropical fevers. Laboratory confirmation of leptospirosis is based on the reference standard microscopic agglutination test (MAT), direct demonstration of the organism, and isolation by culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. However these methods of confirmation are not widely available in resource limited settings where the infection is prevalent, and reliance is placed on clinical features for provisional diagnosis. In this prospective study, we attempted to develop a model for diagnosis of leptospirosis, based on clinical features and standard laboratory test results.
METHODS: The diagnostic score was developed based on data from a prospective multicentre study in two hospitals in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. All patients presenting to these hospitals with a suspected diagnosis of leptospirosis, based on the WHO surveillance criteria, were recruited. Confirmed disease was defined as positive genus specific MAT (Leptospira biflexa). A derivation cohort and a validation cohort were randomly selected from available data. Clinical and laboratory manifestations associated with confirmed leptospirosis in the derivation cohort were selected for construction of a multivariate regression model with correlation matrices, and adjusted odds ratios were extracted for significant variables. The odds ratios thus derived were subsequently utilized in the criteria model, and sensitivity and specificity examined with ROC curves.
RESULTS: A total of 592 patients were included in the final analysis with 450 (180 confirmed leptospirosis) in the derivation cohort and 142 (52 confirmed leptospirosis) in the validation cohort. The variables in the final model were: history of exposure to a possible source of leptospirosis (adjusted OR = 2.827; 95% CI = 1.517-5.435; p = 0.001) serum creatinine > 150 micromol/l (adjusted OR = 2.735; 95% CI = 1.374-4.901; p = 0.001), neutrophil differential percentage > 80.0% of total white blood cell count (adjusted OR 2.163; 95% CI = 1.309-3.847; p = 0.032), serum bilirubin > 30 micromol/l (adjusted OR = 1.717; 95% CI 0.938-3.456; p = 0.049) and platelet count < 85,000/mm3 (adjusted OR = 2.350; 95% CI = 1.481-4.513; p = 0.006). Hosmer-Lemeshow test for goodness of fit was 0.931. The Nagelkerke R2 was 0.622. The area under the curve (AUC) was noted as 0.762. A score value of 14 reflected a sensitivity of 0.803, specificity of 0.602, a PPV of 0.54, NPV of 0.84, a positive LR of 2.01 and a negative LR of 0.32.
CONCLUSIONS: The above diagnostic model for diagnosis of leptospirosis is suggested for use in clinical settings. It should be further validated in clinical practice.","['Rajapakse S', 'Weeratunga P', 'Niloofa R', 'Fernando N', 'de Silva NL', 'Rodrigo C', 'Maduranga S', 'Nandasiri N', 'Premawansa S', 'Karunanayake L', 'de Silva HJ', 'Handunnetti S']",2016,10,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Rajapakse S, et al.

27303713,Transcriptome Sequencing Reveals Wide Expression Reprogramming of Basal and Unknown Genes in Leptospira biflexa Biofilms.,"The genus Leptospira is composed of pathogenic and saprophytic spirochetes. Pathogenic Leptospira is the etiological agent of leptospirosis, a globally spread neglected disease. A key ecological feature of some pathogenic species is their ability to survive both within and outside the host. For most leptospires, the ability to persist outside the host is associated with biofilm formation, a most important bacterial strategy to face and overcome hostile environmental conditions. The architecture and biochemistry of leptospiral biofilms are rather well understood; however, the genetic program underpinning biofilm formation remains mostly unknown. In this work, we used the saprophyte Leptospira biflexa as a model organism to assess over- and underrepresented transcripts during the biofilm state, using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Our results showed that some basal biological processes like DNA replication and cell division are downregulated in the mature biofilm. Additionally, we identified significant expression reprogramming for genes involved in motility, sugar/lipid metabolism, and iron scavenging, as well as for outer membrane-encoding genes. A careful manual annotation process allowed us to assign molecular functions to many previously uncharacterized genes that are probably involved in biofilm metabolism. We also provided evidence for the presence of small regulatory RNAs in this species. Finally, coexpression networks were reconstructed to pinpoint functionally related gene clusters that may explain how biofilm maintenance is regulated. Beyond elucidating some genetic aspects of biofilm formation, this work reveals a number of pathways whose functional dissection may impact our understanding of leptospiral biology, in particular how these organisms adapt to environmental changes. IMPORTANCE In this work, we describe the first transcriptome based on RNA-seq technology focused on studying transcriptional changes associated with biofilm growth in a member of the genus Leptospira. As many pathogenic species of this genus can survive inside the host but also persist in environmental water, mostly forming biofilms, identifying the molecular basis of this capacity can impact the understanding of how leptospires are able to fulfill a complete life cycle that alternates between adaptation to the host and adaptation to hostile external environmental conditions. We identified several genes and regulatory networks that can be the kickoff for deepening understanding of the molecular mechanisms involving bacterial persistence via biofilm formation; understanding this is important for the future development of tools for controlling leptospirosis.","['Iraola G', 'Spangenberg L', 'Lopes Bastos B', 'Graña M', 'Vasconcelos L', 'Almeida Á', 'Greif G', 'Robello C', 'Ristow P', 'Naya H']",2016,1,2,mSphere,"Iraola G, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital-based study done in medical ICU, from June to September 2014 with a sample size of 48. Patients aged 18 years and above, diagnosed with infectious disease were included. Patients with history of chronic illness (renal/hepatic/pulmonary/  cardiovascular), diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, those on immunosuppressive therapy/chemoradiotherapy for malignancy and patients in immunocompromised state were excluded. Blood investigations were obtained. Six organ dysfunctions were assessed using initial SOFA score and graded from 0 to 4. SAPS was calculated as the sum of points assigned to each of the 17 variables (12 physiological, age, type of admission, and three underlying diseases). The outcome measure was survival status at ICU discharge.
RESULTS: We categorized infectious diseases into dengue fever, leptospirosis, malaria, respiratory tract infections, and others which included undiagnosed febrile illness, meningitis, urinary tract infection and gastroenteritis. Initial SOFA score was both sensitive and specific; SAPS lacked sensitivity. We found no significant association between age and survival status. Both SAPS and initial SOFA score were found to be statistically significant as mortality predictors. There is significant association of initial SOFA score in analyzing organ dysfunction in infectious diseases (P < 0.001). SAPS showed no statistical significance. There was statistically significant (P = 0.015) percentage of nonsurvivors with moderate and severe dysfunction, based on SOFA score. Nonsurvivors had higher SAPS but was not statistically significant (P = 0.094).
CONCLUSIONS: Initial SOFA score is a superior mortality predictor. It easily measures degree of organ dysfunction in infectious diseases and complements other scoring systems.","['Nair R', 'Bhandary NM', ""D'Souza AD""]",2016,20,4,Indian J Crit Care Med,"Nair R, et al.

Cattle and buffaloes are important livestock species that live in close contact with humans, especially in rural areas. These animals may, therefore, act as long-term carriers of leptospirosis for humans and other livestock species. The present study employed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to detect pathogenic leptospiral 16S rDNA in the urine of cattle and buffaloes for assessing associations between uroprevalence and species, sex, age and spatial distribution. A total of 3,657 urine samples were collected for laboratory diagnosis, and 312 of which turned positive to the test (true prevalence 5.90%; 95% CI 4.98-6.91). The highest true uroprevalence was found in lower northern region at 19.80% (95% CI 15.83-24.32) followed by upper and lower northeastern regions at 15.22% and 6.25%, respectively. However, the highest true uroprevalence in beef cattle, the majority of cattle in Thailand, was recorded in northeastern region which is the endemic area of human leptospirosis. The uroprevalence was not statistically different among species and types of examined animals. Male animals were over twice more likely to be infected compared to females. Excluding animals younger than one year of age due to small sample size, the uroprevalence upraised with increasing age. A collaborative investigation between veterinary and public health sectors is required to holistically explore the link between leptospirosis in humans and livestock, especially in high prevalent areas.","['Suwancharoen D', 'Limlertvatee S', 'Chetiyawan P', 'Tongpan P', 'Sangkaew N', 'Sawaddee Y', 'Inthakan K', 'Wiratsudakul A']",2016,78,9,J Vet Med Sci,"Suwancharoen D, et al.

27297907,Large-scale purification and in vitro characterization of the assembly of MreB from Leptospira interrogans.,"BACKGROUND: Weil's syndrome is caused by Leptospira interrogans infections, a Gram negative bacterium with a distinct thin corkscrew cell shape. The molecular basis for this unusual morphology is unknown. In many bacteria, cell wall synthesis is orchestrated by the actin homolog, MreB.
METHODS: Here we have identified the MreB within the L. interrogans genome and expressed the His-tagged protein product of the synthesized gene (Li-MreB) in Escherichia coli. Li-MreB did not purify under standard nucleotide-free conditions used for MreBs from other species, requiring the continual presence of ATP to remain soluble. Covalent modification of Li-MreB free thiols with Alexa488 produced a fluorescent version of Li-MreB.
RESULTS: We developed native and denaturing/refolding purification schemes for Li-MreB. The purified product was shown to assemble and disassemble in MgCl2 and KCl dependent manners, as monitored by light scattering and sedimentation studies. The fluorescence spectrum of labeled Li-MreB-Alexa488 showed cation-induced changes in line with an activation process followed by a polymerization phase. The resulting filaments appeared as bundles and sheets under the fluorescence microscope. Finally, since the Li-MreB polymerization was cation dependent, we developed a simple method to measure monovalent cation concentrations within a test case prokaryote, E. coli.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified and initially characterized the cation-dependent polymerization properties of a novel MreB from a non-rod shaped bacterium and developed a method to measure cation concentrations within prokaryotes.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This initial characterization of Li-MreB will enable future structural determination of the MreB filament from this corkscrew-shaped bacterium.","['Barkó S', 'Szatmári D', 'Bódis E', 'Türmer K', 'Ujfalusi Z', 'Popp D', 'Robinson RC', 'Nyitrai M']",2016,1860,9,Biochim Biophys Acta,"Barkó S, et al.

27294677,"Human Leptospirosis on Reunion Island, Indian Ocean: Are Rodents the (Only) Ones to Blame?","BACKGROUND: Although leptospirosis is a zoonosis of major concern on tropical islands, the molecular epidemiology of the disease aiming at linking human cases to specific animal reservoirs has been rarely explored within these peculiar ecosystems.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Five species of wild small mammals (n = 995) as well as domestic animals (n = 101) were screened for Leptospira infection on Reunion Island; positive samples were subsequently genotyped and compared to Leptospira from clinical cases diagnosed in 2012-2013 (n = 66), using MLST analysis. We identified two pathogenic species in human cases, namely Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira borgpetersenii. Leptospira interrogans was by far dominant both in clinical samples (96.6%) and in infected animal samples (95.8%), with Rattus spp and dogs being its exclusive carriers. The genetic diversity within L. interrogans was apparently limited to two sequence types (STs): ST02, identified among most clinical samples and in all rats with complete MLST, and ST34, identified in six humans, but not in rats. Noteworthy, L. interrogans detected in two stray dogs partially matched with ST02 and ST34. Leptospira borgpetersenii was identified in two clinical samples only (3.4%), as well as in cows and mice; four haplotypes were identified, of which two seemingly identical in clinical and animal samples. Leptospira borgpetersenii haplotypes detected in human cases were clearly distinct from the lineage detected so far in the endemic bat species Mormopterus francoismoutoui, thus excluding a role for this volant mammal in the local human epidemiology of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data confirm rats as a major reservoir of Leptospira on Reunion Island, but also pinpoint a possible role of dogs, cows and mice in the local epidemiology of human leptospirosis. This study shows that a comprehensive molecular characterization of pathogenic Leptospira in both clinical and animal samples helps to gaining insight into leptospirosis epidemiology within a specific environmental setting.","['Guernier V', 'Lagadec E', 'Cordonin C', 'Le Minter G', 'Gomard Y', 'Pagès F', 'Jaffar-Bandjee MC', 'Michault A', 'Tortosa P', 'Dellagi K']",2016,10,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Guernier V, et al.

In this study, we investigated the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α in leptospirosis patients with mild or severe illnesses. Sera samples were divided into two groups. The OI group and NOI groups included sera from patients with and without organ involvement, respectively. Each group consisted of 20 pairs of sera. Twenty-five sera from healthy individuals were included as controls. Cytokine levels were compared. Although IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels in acute sera from the OI group were significantly higher than NOI group, only IL-8 level was significantly higher in the OI group when cytokine levels in convalescent sera were compared. TNF-α, an inflammatory cytokine widely studied in leptospirosis was not significantly different between two groups of patients. Our data suggested that IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were involved in disease severity. However, time of specimen collection could affect the significant levels of cytokines especially as biomarkers for monitoring disease severity.","['Chirathaworn C', 'Supputtamongkol Y', 'Lertmaharit S', 'Poovorawan Y']",2016,85,,Cytokine,"Chirathaworn C, et al.

27287703,Human leptospirosis in Tanzania: sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirm that pathogenic Leptospira species circulate among agro-pastoralists living in Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease of worldwide public health importance. The disease affects humans, domestic animals and wildlife. However, leptospirosis is challenging in its diagnosis in humans. Culture technique, which is time consuming, is not recommended for clinical diagnosis. For these reasons, serological and molecular techniques remain the test of choice. The major objective of this study was to explore the genetic characteristic of Leptospira species which are prevalent among agro-pastoralists living in Katavi-Rukwa Ecosystem, Tanzania.
METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out in the Katavi-Region South-west, Tanzania between August, 2013 and November, 2014. A total of 267 participants were randomly recruited for the study. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used to detect antibody against six Leptospira antigens including local serogroups Icterohaemorrhagiae, Ballum, Grippotyphosa, Sejroe and reference serogroups Hebdomadis, and Australis. Samples with MAT titers ≥ 1:160 were scored as positive, samples with MAT titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:80 were scored as exposed to Leptospira, and absence of agglutination titers was scored as negative. All MAT positive samples, including the low titre samples were subjected to PCR using the respective 16S rRNA primers for the pathogenic and non-pathogenic species.
RESULTS: Out of 267 samples tested, 80 (29.9 %) were positive with MAT. The major circulating leptospiral serogroups were Sejroe (15.7 %,), Icterohaemorrhagiae (8.9 %), Grippotyphosa (4.8 %), Hebdomadis (3.37 %), Australis (1.49 %) and Ballum (1.19 %). By using PCR, 33 (15.7 %) out of 210 samples were pathogenic Leptospira while no saprophytic Leptospira spp. was detected. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of Leptospira species which were obtained from this study were submitted to GenBank and acquired accession numbers KP313246 and KP313247. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed that species obtained from Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem clustered in the same group with several published pathogenic Leptospira specifically Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira kirschneri. To the best of the authors' knowledge(,) this is the first study from Tanzania to confirm pathogenic Leptospira in human subjects using genomic typing technique.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide ultimate evidence of pathogenic Leptospira species circulating among agro-pastoralists living in Katavi-Rukwa Ecosystem suggesting that active disease surveillance should be undertaken in order to achieve greater protection of the agro-pastoral communities in Tanzania.","['Muller SK', 'Assenga JA', 'Matemba LE', 'Misinzo G', 'Kazwala RR']",2016,16,,BMC Infect Dis,"Muller SK, et al.

27283852,Leptospira interrogans serovars Bratislava and Muenchen animal infections: Implications for epidemiology and control.,"Strains of Leptospira interrogans belonging to two very closely related serovars - Bratislava and Muenchen - have been associated with disease in domestic animals, in particular pigs, but also in horses and dogs. Similar strains have also been recovered from various wildlife species. Their epidemiology is poorly understood. Two hundred and forty seven such isolates, from UK domestic animal and wildlife species, were examined by restriction endonuclease analysis in an attempt to elucidate their epidemiology. A representative sub-sample of 65 of these isolates was further examined by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis and 22 by secY sequencing. Ten restriction pattern types were identified. The majority of isolates fell into one of three restriction endonuclease analysis pattern types designated B2a, B2b and M2a. B2a was ubiquitous and was isolated from 10 species and represented the majority of the horse and all dog isolates. B2b was very different, being isolated only from pigs, indicating that this type was maintained by pigs. The pattern M2a was reported for the majority of isolates from pigs but also was common in small rodents isolates. Five restriction pattern types were found only in wildlife suggesting that they are unlikely to pose a disease threat to domestic animals. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis identified six clusters. The REA types B2a and B2b were all found in one MLVA cluster while the majority of the M2a strains examined occurred in another cluster. The secY sequencing detected only one sequence type, clustered with other serovars of Leptospira interrogans.","['Arent Z', 'Frizzell C', 'Gilmore C', 'Allen A', 'Ellis WA']",2016,190,,Vet Microbiol,"Arent Z, et al.

27280281,"Protein Carbonyl as a Biomarker of Oxidative Stress in Severe Leptospirosis, and Its Usefulness in Differentiating Leptospirosis from Dengue Infections.","Pathogenesis of disease severity in leptospirosis is not clearly understood whether it is due to direct damage by pathogen or by adverse immune responses. Knowledge on biomarkers of oxidative stress which could be used in identifying patients with severe illness has shown to be of great value in disease management. Thus, the main aim of this study was to assess the damage to serum proteins and lipids, and their significance as biomarkers of oxidative stress in severe leptospirosis. In regions endemic for both leptospirosis and dengue, leptospirosis cases are often misdiagnosed as dengue during dengue epidemics. Therefore, the second aim was to assess the potential of the oxidative stress markers in differentiating severe leptospirosis from critical phase dengue. We measured serum antioxidants (uric acid and bilirubin), total antioxidant capacity (AOC), protein carbonyl (PC) and lipid hydroperoxide (LP) in patients with severe leptospirosis (n = 60), mild leptospirosis (n = 50), dengue during the critical phase (n = 30) and in healthy subjects (n = 30). All patient groups had similar total antioxidant capacity levels. However, the presence of significantly high uric acid and total bilirubin levels may reflect the degree of renal and hepatic involvement seen in severe leptospirosis patients (p<0.02). Serum PC and LP levels were significantly higher in leptospirosis patients compared to critical phase dengue infections (p<0.005). Moreover, high serum PC levels appear to differentiate SL from DC [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96; p<0.001]. Serum PC may be a reliable biomarker of oxidative damage to serum proteins to identify severe leptospirosis patients (AUC = 0.99) and also to differentiate severe leptospirosis from mild cases (AUC = 0.78; p<0.005) indicating its contribution to pathogenesis. Use of serum PC as an indicator of leptospirosis severity and as an oxidative stress biomarker in differentiating leptospirosis from dengue would provide the opportunity to save lives via prompt patient management.","['Fernando N', 'Wickremesinghe S', 'Niloofa R', 'Rodrigo C', 'Karunanayake L', 'de Silva HJ', 'Wickremesinghe AR', 'Premawansa S', 'Rajapakse S', 'Handunnetti SM']",2016,11,6,PLoS One,"Fernando N, et al.

27278903,Leptospiral outer membrane protein LipL32 induces inflammation and kidney injury in zebrafish larvae.,"Leptospirosis is an often overlooked cause of acute kidney injury that can lead to multiple organ failure and even death. The principle protein that conserved in many pathogenic leptospires is the outer membrane protein LipL32. However, the role of LipL32 in the pathogenesis of renal injury in leptospirosis is not entirely clear. Here we studied the effects of LipL32 on the developing kidney in zebrafish larvae. Incubation of zebrafish larvae with Leptospira santarosai serovar Shermani induced acute tubular injury predominantly in the proximal pronephric ducts. Furthermore, microinjection of lipl32 mRNA or recombinant LipL32 protein into zebrafish larvae increased macrophage accumulation and disrupted the basolateral location of NA-K-ATPase in pronephric ducts. These changes led to substantial impairment of the pronephric kidney structure. We further demonstrated that morpholino knockdown of tlr2, but not tlr4, reduced the LipL32-induced leukocyte infiltration and kidney injury. These data demonstrate that LipL32 contributes to the renal pathology in leptospirosis and gives some clues to the potential virulence of LipL32. Our results support the use of zebrafish as a model organism for studying the disease mechanism of leptospiral infection. This model might permit the future exploration of the virulence and molecular pathways of different leptospiral outer membrane proteins.","['Chang MY', 'Cheng YC', 'Hsu SH', 'Ma TL', 'Chou LF', 'Hsu HH', 'Tian YC', 'Chen YC', 'Sun YJ', 'Hung CC', 'Pan RL', 'Yang CW']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Chang MY, et al.

27260249,Decrease in antithrombin III and prothrombin serum levels contribute to coagulation disorders during leptospirosis.,"Pathogenic bacteria of the genus Leptospira are the causative agent of leptospirosis, an emergent infectious disease that affects humans and animals worldwide. Severe forms of the disease in humans include jaundice, multiple organ failure and intense haemorrhage. Up to now, mechanisms associated with the haemorrhage foci are poorly understood. We report in this work that, despite the low levels of antithrombin III in convalescent human serum samples, virulent, culture-attenuated and saprophyte strains of Leptospira are unable to bind and/or degrade this thrombin inhibitor, suggesting an indirect mechanism of pathogenesis. Lower levels of prothrombin were found in serum samples at the onset and convalescent phase of the disease when compared to normal human sera. The concomitant decreased levels of antithrombin III and prothrombin suggest a process of stimulated coagulation, which is corroborated by the increase of prothrombin fragment F1+2 in the serum samples. Data obtained with hamsters experimentally infected with virulent Leptospira interrogans serovars Kennewicki and Canicola strongly point out that haemorrhage is correlated with decreased levels of thrombin inhibitors and prothrombin. Activated coagulation might lead to an overconsumption of coagulation factors ultimately leading to bleeding and organ failure.","['Fernandes LGV', 'Filho AFS', 'Souza GO', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Romero EC', 'Nascimento ALTO']",2016,162,8,Microbiology (Reading),"Fernandes LGV, et al.

27259371,The adaptor molecule Trif contributes to murine host defense during Leptospiral infection.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and is caused by pathogenic species of the Leptospira genus, including Leptospira interrogans (L. interrogans). Humans, domestic and wild animals are susceptible to acute or chronic infection. The innate immune response is a critical defense mechanism against Leptospira interrogans, and has been investigated in mouse models. Murine Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been shown to be key factors in sensing and responding to L. interrogans infection. Specifically, TLR2, TLR4 and the TLR adaptor molecule MyD88 are essential for host defense against L. interrogans; however, the role of the TLR adaptor molecule TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon β (TRIF) in the response to L. interrogans has not been previously determined. In the present study, TRIF was found to play an important role during leptospiral infection. Following challenge with L. interrogans, Trif(-/-) mice exhibited delayed weight gain compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, Trif(-/-) mice exhibited an increase in L. interrogans burden in the kidneys, lungs, and blood at early time points (less than 7days post infection). Multiple components of the innate immune responses were dampened in response to leptospiral infection including transcription and production of cytokines, and the humoral response, which suggested that TRIF contributes to expression and production of cytokines important for the host defense against L. interrogans.","['Jayaraman PA', 'Devlin AA', 'Miller JC', 'Scholle F']",2016,221,9,Immunobiology,"Jayaraman PA, et al.

Rodents appear to be the most important reservoirs of infection. They contaminate the environment and food and can transmit the pathogen when they are consumed by carnivores. Capybara ( Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris ) are efficient reservoirs of Leptospira, and because they are in close contact with farm animals and are found in semiurban areas, they represent a risk to public health. We isolated five Leptospira strains from capybara kidneys in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in 2001 and typed them using serologic and molecular techniques. These strains include the Leptospira santarosai serogroup Grippotyphosa serovar Bananal. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis resulted in a unique pattern distinct from the reference strains, and the isolates clustered with greater than 85% similarity. The isolates also presented higher growth rates than other Leptospira serovars, with high minimal inhibitory concentration values for most of the tested antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin and ampicillin.

Acute leptospiral infection during pregnancy has been associated with spontaneous abortion and fetal death during the first trimester and the abortion may occur as consequence of systemic failure.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency of Leptospira interrogans infection in women with spontaneous abortion in the state of Yucatan, Mexico.
METHODS: A cross sectional study on women with spontaneous abortion was conducted. Serum samples were tested for Leptospirosis by the microaglutination test, to estimate the frequency of the infecting serovar. The indirect ELISA IgM was used to detect recent infection by L. interrogans. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue of placenta for PCR detection of L. interrogans.
RESULTS: Overall frequency of infection with L. interrogans in the 81 women with abortion was 13.6%. Five of the 12 serovars evaluated were found and included. Two of the 11 women with abortion and positive to microaglutination test were also positive to the ELISA IgM test. None samples were positive for PCR Leptospira diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: two women could be associated with spontaneous abortion due to leptospirosis, because they showed antibodies against L. interrogans in the microaglutination test and ELISA IgM assays.

27219334,Cytokine and Chemokine Expression in Kidneys during Chronic Leptospirosis in Reservoir and Susceptible Animal Models.,"Leptospirosis is caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Humans can be infected after exposure to contaminated urine of reservoir animals, usually rodents, regarded as typical asymptomatic carriers of leptospires. In contrast, accidental hosts may present an acute form of leptospirosis with a range of clinical symptoms including the development of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is considered as a possible AKI-residual sequela but little is known about the renal pathophysiology consequent to leptospirosis infection. Herein, we studied the renal morphological alterations in relation with the regulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, comparing two experimental models of chronic leptospirosis, the golden Syrian hamster that survived the infection, becoming carrier of virulent leptospires, and the OF1 mouse, a usual reservoir of the bacteria. Animals were monitored until 28 days after injection with a virulent L. borgpetersenii serogroup Ballum to assess chronic infection. Hamsters developed morphological alterations in the kidneys with tubulointerstitial nephritis and fibrosis. Grading of lesions revealed higher scores in hamsters compared to the slight alterations observed in the mouse kidneys, irrespective of the bacterial load. Interestingly, pro-fibrotic TGF-β was downregulated in mouse kidneys. Moreover, cytokines IL-1β and IL-10, and chemokines MIP-1α/CCL3 and IP-10/CXCL-10 were significantly upregulated in hamster kidneys compared to mice. These results suggest a possible maintenance of inflammatory processes in the hamster kidneys with the infiltration of inflammatory cells in response to bacterial carriage, resulting in alterations of renal tissues. In contrast, lower expression levels in mouse kidneys indicated a better regulation of the inflammatory response and possible resolution processes likely related to resistance mechanisms.","['Matsui M', 'Roche L', 'Geroult S', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Monchy D', 'Huerre M', 'Goarant C']",2016,11,5,PLoS One,"Matsui M, et al.

27187029,GLOBAL PATTERNS OF LEPTOSPIRA PREVALENCE IN VERTEBRATE RESERVOIR HOSTS.,"Leptospirosis is a widespread emerging bacterial zoonosis. As the transmission is believed to be predominantly waterborne, human incidence is expected to increase in conjunction with global climate change and associated extreme weather events. Providing more accurate predictions of human leptospirosis requires more detailed information on animal reservoirs that are the source of human infection. We evaluated the prevalence of Leptospira in vertebrates worldwide and its association with taxonomy, geographic region, host biology, ambient temperature, and precipitation patterns. A multivariate regression analysis with a meta-analysis-like approach was used to analyze compiled data extracted from 300 Leptospira-related peer reviewed papers. A fairly uniform Leptospira infection prevalence of about 15% was found in the majority of mammalian families. Higher prevalence was frequently associated with species occupying urban habitats, and this may explain why climatic factors were not significantly correlated with prevalence as consistently as expected. Across different approaches of the multiple regression analyses, the variables most frequently correlated with Leptospira infection prevalence were the host's ability to swim, minimum ambient temperature, and methodologic quality of the study. Prevalence in carnivores was not associated with any climatic variable, and the importance of environmental risk factors were indicated to be of lesser consequence in nonhuman mammals. The dataset is made available for further analysis.","['Andersen-Ranberg EU', 'Pipper C', 'Jensen PM']",2016,52,3,J Wildl Dis,"Andersen-Ranberg EU, et al.

27178006,Functional thioredoxin reductase from pathogenic and free-living Leptospira spp.,"Low molecular mass thiols and antioxidant enzymes have essential functions to detoxify reactive oxygen and nitrogen species maintaining cellular redox balance. The metabolic pathways for redox homeostasis in pathogenic (Leptospira interrogans) and free-living (Leptospira biflexa) leptospires species were not functionally characterized. We performed biochemical studies on recombinantly produced proteins to in depth analyze kinetic and structural properties of thioredoxin reductase (LinTrxR) and thioredoxin (LinTrx) from L. interrogans, and two TrxRs (LbiTrxR1 and LbiTrxR2) from L. biflexa. All the TrxRs were characterized as homodimeric flavoproteins, with LinTrxR and LbiTrxR1 catalyzing the NADPH dependent reduction of LinTrx and DTNB. The thioredoxin system from L. interrogans was able to use glutathione disulfide, lipoamide disulfide, cystine and bis-γ-glutamyl cysteine and homologous peroxiredoxin as substrates. Classic TrxR activity of LinTrxR2 had not been evidenced in vitro, but recombinant Escherichia coli cells overexpressing LbiTrxR2 showed high tolerance to oxidative stress. The enzymatic systems herein characterized could play a key role for the maintenance of redox homeostasis and the function of defense mechanisms against reactive oxidant species in Leptospira spp. Our results contribute to the general knowledge about redox biochemistry in these bacteria, positioning TrxR as a critical molecular target for the development of new anti-leptospiral drugs.","['Sasoni N', 'Iglesias AA', 'Guerrero SA', 'Arias DG']",2016,97,,Free Radic Biol Med,"Sasoni N, et al.

This worldwide emerging infectious disease is caused by the pathogenic species belonging to the genus Leptospira. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic assays have been developed for detecting Leptospira DNA in cell cultures and clinical samples. Because PCR requires specialized equipment and extensive end-user training, it is not suitable for routine work in resource-limited areas. We have developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect the presence of Leptospira in patient, animal and environmental samples using lyophilized reagents at a single temperature of around 63°C with a heating block. The sensitivity of this LAMP assay is very similar to the PCR method. The amplified DNA products can be visualized with the naked eyes using hydroxy naphthol blue or detected by the fluorescence signal of SYBR green dye in the reaction when an ultraviolet lamp or compact fluorescence tube scanner is used. This LAMP assay is simple, rapid, and can be performed with a water bath or heating block. The lyophilized LAMP reagents are stable for 3 months when stored at 4°C and 1 month when stored at 25°C, respectively. It is ideal for resource-limited settings where leptospirosis is endemic.","['Chen HW', 'Weissenberger G', 'Ching WM']",2016,181,5 Suppl,Mil Med,"Chen HW, et al.

27167223,Modulation of Hemostatic and Inflammatory Responses by Leptospira Spp.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide spread zoonotic and neglected infectious disease of human and veterinary concern that is caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. In severe infections, hemostatic impairments such as coagulation/fibrinolysis dysfunction are frequently observed. These complications often occur when the host response is controlled and/or modulated by the bacterial pathogen. In the present investigation, we aimed to analyze the modulation of the hemostatic and inflammatory host responses by the bacterial pathogen Leptospira. The effects of leptospires and their secreted products on stimulation of human intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation were investigated by means of altered clotting times, assembly and activation of contact system and induction of tissue factor. We show that both extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation cascades are modulated in response to Leptospira or leptospiral secreted proteins. We further find that the pro-inflammatory mediator bradykinin is released following contact activation at the bacterial surface and that pro-coagulant microvesicles are shed from monocytes in response to infection. Also, we show that human leptospirosis patients present higher levels of circulating pro-coagulant microvesicles than healthy individuals. Here we show that both pathways of the coagulation system are modulated by leptospires, possibly leading to altered hemostatic and inflammatory responses during the disease. Our results contribute to the understanding of the leptospirosis pathophysiological mechanisms and may open new routes for the discovery of novel treatments for the severe manifestations of the disease.","['Vieira ML', 'Naudin C', 'Mörgelin M', 'Romero EC', 'Nascimento AL', 'Herwald H']",2016,10,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Vieira ML, et al.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of LAMP assay and real-time PCR using bacterial culture as the gold standard and to assess the agreement among these three tests using Cohen's kappa statistics. In total, 533 urine samples were collected from 266 beef and 267 dairy cattle reared in central region of Thailand. Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP were 96.8% (95% CI 81.5-99.8) and 97.0% (95% CI 94.9-98.2), respectively. The accuracy of LAMP (97.0%) was significantly higher than that of real-time PCR (91.9%) at 95% CI. With Cohen's kappa statistics, culture method and LAMP were substantially agreed with each other (77.4%), whereas real-time PCR only moderately agreed with culture (47.7%) and LAMP (45.3%), respectively. Consequently, LAMP was more effective than real-time PCR in detecting Leptospira spp. in the urine of cattle. Besides, LAMP had less cost and was simpler than real-time PCR. Thus, LAMP was an excellent alternative for routine surveillance of leptospirosis in cattle.","['Suwancharoen D', 'Sittiwicheanwong B', 'Wiratsudakul A']",2016,78,8,J Vet Med Sci,"Suwancharoen D, et al.

27142134,Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology in Sri Lanka: Are leptospirosis and Hantaviral infection likely causes?,"Chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) has been a severe burden and a public health crisis in Sri Lanka over the past two decades. Many studies have established hypotheses to identify potential risk factors although causative agents, risk factors and etiology of this disease are still uncertain. Several studies have postulated that fungal and bacterial nephrotoxins are a possible etiological factor; however, the precise link between hypothesized risk factors and the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease has yet to be proven in prior studies. Leptospirosis and Hantavirus infections are important zoonotic diseases that are naturally maintained and transmitted via infected rodent populations and which present similar clinical and epidemiological features. Both infections are known to be a cause of acute kidney damage that can proceed into chronic renal failure. Several studies have reported presence of both infections in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we hypothesized that pathogenic Leptospira or Hantavirus are possible causative agents of acute kidney damage which eventually progresses to chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka. The proposed hypothesis will be evaluated by means of an observational study design. Past infection will be assessed by a cross-sectional study to detect the presence of IgG antibodies with further confirmatory testing among chronic kidney disease patients and individuals from the community in selected endemic areas compared to low prevalence areas. Identification of possible risk factors for these infections will be followed by a case-control study and causality will be further determined with a cohort study. If the current hypothesis is true, affected communities will be subjected for medical interventions related to the disease for patient management while considering supportive therapies. Furthermore and possibly enhance their preventive and control measures to improve vector control to decrease the risk of infection.","['Gamage CD', 'Sarathkumara YD']",2016,91,,Med Hypotheses,Gamage CD and Sarathkumara YD.

27129366,Evaluation of two novel leptospiral proteins for their interaction with human host components.,"Pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira are the etiological agents of leptospirosis, the most widespread zoonosis. Mechanisms involved in leptospiral pathogenesis are not well understood. By data mining the genome sequences of Leptospira interrogans we have identified two proteins predicted to be surface exposed, LIC10821 and LIC10064. Immunofluorescence and proteinase K assays confirmed that the proteins are exposed. Reactivity of the recombinant proteins with human sera has shown that rLIC10821, but not rLIC10064, is recognized by antibodies in confirmed leptospirosis serum samples, suggesting its expression during infection. The rLIC10821 was able to bind laminin, in a dose-dependent fashion, and was called Lsa37 (leptospiral surface adhesin of 37 kDa). Studies with human plasma components demonstrated that rLIC10821 interacts with plasminogen (PLG) and fibrinogen (Fg). The binding of Lsa37 with PLG generates plasmin when PLG activator was added. Fibrin clotting reduction was observed in a thrombin-catalyzed reaction, when Fg was incubated with Lsa37, suggesting that this protein may interfere in the coagulation cascade during the disease. Although LIC10064 protein is more abundant than the corresponding Lsa37, binding activity with all the components tested was not detected. Thus, Lsa37 is a novel versatile adhesin that may mediate Leptospira-host interactions.","['Silva LP', 'Fernandes LG', 'Vieira ML', 'de Souza GO', 'Heinemann MB', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Romero EC', 'Nascimento AL']",2016,74,5,Pathog Dis,"Silva LP, et al.

27128631,Underestimation of Leptospirosis Incidence in the French West Indies.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis affecting mainly tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, particularly South America and the Caribbean. As in many other countries, under-reporting of cases was suspected in the French West Indies because of inadequate access to diagnostic tests for the general population.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to estimate the real incidence of leptospirosis in Guadeloupe and Martinique, a study was performed in 2011 using the three prevailing available biological tests for diagnosis: Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), IgM ELISA and PCR. The study investigated inpatients and outpatients and used active case ascertainment from data provided by a general practitioners' sentinel network. The epidemiology of the disease was also described in terms of severity and demographic characteristics. Leptospirosis incidence was estimated at 69.4 (95%CI 47.6-91.1) and 60.6 (95%CI 36.3-85.0) annual cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Guadeloupe and Martinique, respectively, which was 3 and 4 times higher than previous estimations.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Inclusion of PCR and IgM ELISA tests for diagnosis of leptospirosis resulted in improved sensitivity in comparison with MAT alone. Our results highlighted the substantial health burden of the disease in these two territories and the importance of access to appropriate laboratory tests. Based on our results, PCR and IgM ELISA tests have now been included in the list of tests reimbursed by the national system of social security insurance in France. Our results also underline the relevance of implementing an integrated strategy for the surveillance, prevention and control of leptospirosis in the French West Indies.","['Cassadou S', 'Rosine J', 'Flamand C', 'Escher M', 'Ledrans M', 'Bourhy P', 'Picardeau M', 'Quénel P']",2016,10,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Cassadou S, et al.

27113476,"A novel flagellar sheath protein, FcpA, determines filament coiling, translational motility and virulence for the Leptospira spirochete.","Leptospira are unique among bacteria based on their helical cell morphology with hook-shaped ends and the presence of periplasmic flagella (PF) with pronounced spontaneous supercoiling. The factors that provoke such supercoiling, as well as the role that PF coiling plays in generating the characteristic hook-end cell morphology and motility, have not been elucidated. We have now identified an abundant protein from the pathogen L. interrogans, exposed on the PF surface, and named it Flagellar-coiling protein A (FcpA). The gene encoding FcpA is highly conserved among Leptospira and was not found in other bacteria. fcpA(-) mutants, obtained from clinical isolates or by allelic exchange, had relatively straight, smaller-diameter PF, and were not able to produce translational motility. These mutants lost their ability to cause disease in the standard hamster model of leptospirosis. Complementation of fcpA restored the wild-type morphology, motility and virulence phenotypes. In summary, we identified a novel Leptospira 36-kDa protein, the main component of the spirochete's PF sheath, and a key determinant of the flagella's coiled structure. FcpA is essential for bacterial translational motility and to enable the spirochete to penetrate the host, traverse tissue barriers, disseminate to cause systemic infection and reach target organs.","['Wunder EA', 'Figueira CP', 'Benaroudj N', 'Hu B', 'Tong BA', 'Trajtenberg F', 'Liu J', 'Reis MG', 'Charon NW', 'Buschiazzo A', 'Picardeau M', 'Ko AI']",2016,101,3,Mol Microbiol,"Wunder EA, et al.

27109564,Effectiveness of a commercial leptospiral vaccine on urinary shedding in naturally exposed sheep in New Zealand.,"L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo and L. interrogans serovar Pomona are endemic in New Zealand sheep. An effective vaccine and vaccination strategy would protect both humans and livestock. Four to 12 lambs were selected from each of eight farms (total=84, vaccinated group), while four to 16 lambs (total=98) served as unvaccinated controls. A commercial Hardjo/Pomona vaccine was given at 1-6 weeks of age, 5-11 weeks later and 33-67 weeks later on seven farms and at 18 weeks of age and 5 weeks later on the eighth farm. Vaccinates and controls were grazed together. Blood was regularly collected from the control group to assess flock exposure. Urine was collected from both groups 26-82 weeks after the second vaccination and tested by quantitative PCR. Seroprevalence in controls at the time of urine sampling ranged from 2.7 to 98.2% for Hardjo and from 0 to 54.1% for Pomona with seroconversion occurring 13 to 67 weeks after the second vaccination in all but one farm where exposure had happened by the time of vaccination. The shedding prevalence adjusted for clustering in farms was 45.1% [95% CI 17.6-72.7] (for an observed number of 50/98) in the control animals and 1.8% [95% CI 0.0-10.1] (for an observed number of 5/84) in the vaccinated animals. The vaccine was 100% effective on five farms where animals were vaccinated before 12 weeks of age and before natural exposure occurred, but the effectiveness was 80% [0-97] on one farm where the lambs were exposed before vaccination and 65% [9-87] to 80% [0-97] on one farm where the animals were fully vaccinated by 24 weeks of age. The overall vaccine effectiveness was 86.3% [63.6-94.8%] despite maternal antibodies in some flocks at first vaccination.

27059657,Challenges in the Etiology and Diagnosis of Acute Febrile Illness in Children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,"Acute febrile illness is a common cause of hospital admission, and its associated infectious causes contribute to substantial morbidity and death among children worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Declining transmission of malaria in many regions, combined with the increasing use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, has led to the increasing recognition of leptospirosis, rickettsioses, respiratory viruses, and arboviruses as etiologic agents of fevers. However, clinical discrimination between these etiologies can be difficult. Overtreatment with antimalarial drugs is common, even in the setting of a negative test result, as is overtreatment with empiric antibacterial drugs. Viral etiologies remain underrecognized and poorly investigated. More-sensitive diagnostics have led to additional dilemmas in discriminating whether a positive test result reflects a causative pathogen. Here, we review and summarize the current epidemiology and focus particularly on children and the challenges for future research.","['Iroh Tam PY', 'Obaro SK', 'Storch G']",2016,5,2,J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,"Iroh Tam PY, et al.

27057122,Caprine leptospirosis: Hematobiochemical and urinalyses studies.,"AIM: The present study was designed to evaluate clinicopathological alterations in naturally occurring leptospirosis in goats of South Gujarat region, Gujarat.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total 459 blood/serum and 292 urine samples were collected from different districts of South Gujarat region, India. Blood/serum and urine samples were subjected to hematobiochemical analyses and urinalyses. The serum samples were screened for anti-leptospiral antibodies using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). On the bases of presence or absence of anti-leptospiral antibodies in serum, seropositive and seronegative groups were made. The results were analyzed using standard statistical methods to know pathological changes in the disease.
RESULTS: In MAT, out of 459, 116 goats were seropositive, and 343 were seronegative. In hematobiochemical analyses, statistically significant (p<0.01) decrease in values of packed cell volume, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, mean corpuscular Hb concentration and total protein and increased activity/level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin between seropositive and seronegative goats were noted. Urinalyses did not reveal any specific changes. In the dark field microscopy, urine samples were found to be negative for leptospires.
CONCLUSION: Hematobiochemical changes noted in seropositive goats were indicative of hepatic damage, and this knowledge would aid in the therapeutic management of the disease.","['Vihol PD', 'Patel JM', 'Patel JH', 'Prasad MC', 'Kalyani IH', 'Brahmkshtri BP']",2016,9,3,Vet World,"Vihol PD, et al.

27050192,"The Aetiologies and Impact of Fever in Pregnant Inpatients in Vientiane, Laos.","INTRODUCTION: Laos has the highest maternal mortality ratio in mainland Southeast Asia and a high incidence of infectious diseases. Globally, malaria has been the pathogen most intensively investigated in relation to impact on pregnancy, but there has been relatively little research on the aetiology and impact of other diseases. We therefore aimed to determine the causes and impact of fever in pregnant women admitted to two central hospitals in Vientiane City, Lao PDR (Laos).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This hospital-based prospective study was conducted in Mahosot Hospital and the Mother and Child Hospital, Vientiane, between 2006 and 2010, with the aim to recruit 250 consenting pregnant women admitted with tympanic temperature ≥37.5°C. Primary outcome was the cause of fever and secondary outcomes were pregnancy outcomes. Specific investigations (culture, antigen, molecular and serological tests) were performed to investigate causes of fever. After discharge, all pregnant women were asked to return for review and convalescence serum on day 10-14 and were monitored until delivery.
PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: 250 pregnant women were recruited to this study between February 2006 and November 2010. Fifty percent were pregnant for the first time. Their median (range) gestational age on admission was 24 (4-43) weeks. The median (range) tympanic admission temperature was 38.5°C (37.5-40.5°C). Fifteen percent of patients stated that they had taken antibiotics before admission. Headache, myalgia, back pain and arthralgia were described by >60% of patients and 149 (60%) were given a laboratory diagnosis. Of those with confirmed diagnoses, 132 (53%) had a single disease and 17 (7%) had apparent mixed diseases. Among those who had a single disease, dengue fever was the most common diagnosis, followed by pyelonephritis, scrub typhus, murine typhus and typhoid. Patients were also diagnosed with tuberculosis, appendicitis, Staphylococcus aureus septicemia, leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis virus infection and Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Severe consequences, including maternal death, miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and preterm birth, were found among 28 (78%) mothers with dengue fever, rickettsioses and typhoid.
CONCLUSION: Fevers other than malaria, such as dengue, pyelonephritis, rickettsioses and typhoid are common causes of fever during pregnancy in the Asian tropics. Further investigations of their impact in the community on maternal death, fetal loss, vertical transmission, low birth weight and preterm birth are needed.","['Chansamouth V', 'Thammasack S', 'Phetsouvanh R', 'Keoluangkot V', 'Moore CE', 'Blacksell SD', 'Castonguay-Vanier J', 'Dubot-Pérès A', 'Tangkhabuanbutra J', 'Tongyoo N', 'Souphaphonh P', 'Sengvilaipaseuth O', 'Vongsouvath M', 'Phommasone K', 'Sengdethka D', 'Seurbsanith A', 'Craig SB', 'Hermann L', 'Strobel M', 'Newton PN']",2016,10,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Chansamouth V, et al.

Previous studies have demonstrated that leptospirosis is an endemic disease in Malaysia occurring in both urban and rural locations. The number of cases has risen dramatically since the Ministry of Health Malaysia highlighted leptospirosis as a notifiable disease in 2010, with reported cases increasing from 248 cases in 2004 to 3604 in 2012. The incidence of infection among the population suggests that occupation, sex, age, ethnic background, water recreational activities, and sporting events are risk factors. A robust surveillance system is now in place to monitor temporal and spatial changes in the incidence and prevalence of infection and to identify risk areas and disease behavior. Despite extensive studies over the past decade, there is a still a need to describe local serovars in host carriers and the human population, with the view to develop an effective vaccine against leptospirosis.","['Benacer D', 'Thong KL', 'Verasahib KB', 'Galloway RL', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Lewis JW', 'Mohd Zain SN']",2016,28,4,Asia Pac J Public Health,"Benacer D, et al.

27044038,Analysis of a Spontaneous Non-Motile and Avirulent Mutant Shows That FliM Is Required for Full Endoflagella Assembly in Leptospira interrogans.,"Pathogenic Leptospira strains are responsible for leptospirosis, a worldwide emerging zoonotic disease. These spirochetes are unique amongst bacteria because of their corkscrew-like cell morphology and their periplasmic flagella. Motility is reported as an important virulence determinant, probably favoring entry and dissemination of pathogenic Leptospira in the host. However, proteins constituting the periplasmic flagella and their role in cell shape, motility and virulence remain poorly described. In this study, we characterized a spontaneous L. interrogans mutant strain lacking motility, correlated with the loss of the characteristic hook-shaped ends, and virulence in the animal model. Whole genome sequencing allowed the identification of one nucleotide deletion in the fliM gene resulting in a premature stop codon, thereby preventing the production of flagellar motor switch protein FliM. Genetic complementation restored cell morphology, motility and virulence comparable to those of wild type cells. Analyses of purified periplasmic flagella revealed a defect in flagella assembly, resulting in shortened flagella compared to the wild type strain. This also correlated with a lower amount of major filament proteins FlaA and FlaB. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that FliM is required for full and correct assembly of the flagella which is essential for motility and virulence.","['Fontana C', 'Lambert A', 'Benaroudj N', 'Gasparini D', 'Gorgette O', 'Cachet N', 'Bomchil N', 'Picardeau M']",2016,11,4,PLoS One,"Fontana C, et al.

27043016,"Estimating the Burden of Leptospirosis among Febrile Subjects Aged below 20 Years in Kampong Cham Communities, Cambodia, 2007-2009.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an emerging but neglected public health challenge in the Asia/Pacific Region with an annual incidence estimated at 10-100 per 100,000 population. No accurate data, however, are available for at-risk rural Cambodian communities.
METHOD: We conducted anonymous, unlinked testing for IgM antibodies to Leptospira spp. on paired sera of Cambodian patients <20 years of age between 2007-2009 collected through active, community-based surveillance for febrile illnesses in a convenience sample of 27 rural and semi-rural villages in four districts of Kampong Cham province, Cambodia. Leptospirosis testing was done on paired serological samples negative for Dengue, Japanese encephalitis and Chikungunya viruses after random selection. Convalescent samples found positive while initial samples were negative were considered as proof of acute infection. We then applied a mathematical model to estimate the risk of fever caused by leptospirosis, dengue or other causes in rural Cambodia.
RESULTS: A total of 630 samples are coming from a randomly selected subset of 2358 samples. IgM positive were found on the convalescent serum sample, among which 100 (15.8%) samples were IgM negative on an earlier sample. Seventeen of these 100 seroconversions were confirmed using a Microagglutination Test. We estimated the probability of having a fever due to leptospirosis at 1. 03% (95% Credible Interval CI: 0. 95%-1. 22%) per semester. In comparison, this probability was 2. 61% (95% CI: 2. 55%, 2. 83%) for dengue and 17. 65% (95% CI: 17. 49%, 18. 08%) for other causes.
CONCLUSION: Our data from febrile cases aged below 20 years suggest that the burden of leptospirosis is high in rural Cambodian communities. This is especially true during the rainy season, even in the absence of identified epidemics.","['Hem S', 'Ly S', 'Votsi I', 'Vogt F', 'Asgari N', 'Buchy P', 'Heng S', 'Picardeau M', 'Sok T', 'Ly S', 'Huy R', 'Guillard B', 'Cauchemez S', 'Tarantola A']",2016,11,4,PLoS One,"Hem S, et al.

27033527,Seroprevalence study of the main causes of abortion in dairy cattle in Morocco.,"Sera from 221 cattle were collected in 25 farms in Morocco to investigate the evidence and circulation of some of the main bovine abortive agents in the dairy cattle farming, where abortions are often reported. All sera were examined for brucellosis, 176 for neosporosis, 88 for leptospirosis, and 42 for Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD/MD), Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) (Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, IBR/IPV), and Bovine Herpesvirus 4 (BHV-4) infections (at least 1 sample per herd). Abortions were reported in 23 (10.4%) of the 221 tested cattle. Antibodies against the investigated pathogens were detected in all samples tested, with an overall seroprevalence of 33.48% for Brucella, 9.09% for Leptospira, 8.52% for Neospora, 37.71% for BVDV, 50% for BHV-1, 9.52% for BHV-4. As for Leptospira antibodies against serovars Hardjo, Pomona, and Tarassovi were identified. Mixed infections were common. The lack of evidence of non-infectious factors epidemiologically related to abortions suggested that the investigated agents are to be considered important risk factors in the dynamic of the abortion syndrome, even if further investigations are necessary to identify the abortion cause. Particular attention should be paid on brucellosis, considering the high seroprevalence and its zoonotic relevance.","['Lucchese L', 'Benkirane A', 'Hakimi I', 'El Idrissi A', 'Natale A']",2016,52,1,Vet Ital,"Lucchese L, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 2 pairs of primers were used for PCR, that jointly flank 1423b.p. sized fragment. Sequences of Leptospira spp. strain 16S rRNA, presented in the international database, were used for phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: A high similarity, including interspecies, of the 16S fragment in Leptospira spp. strains was shown independently of the source, serovar and serogroup. Heterogeneity of the primary matrix, spontaneous mutations of hotspots and erroneous nucleotide couplings, characteristic for 16S sequence of pathogenic Leptospira spp. strains, are discussed. Molecular-genetic characteristic of certain reference Leptospira spp. strains by 16S sequence is obtained.
CONCLUSION: Results of the studies give evidence on expedience of introduction into clinical practice of identification of Leptospira spp. by 16S sequence directly from the clinical material, that would allow to significantly reduce identification time, dismiss complex type-specific sera and other labor-intensive methods.","['Ostankova YV', 'Semenov AV', 'Stoyanova NA', 'Tokarevich NK', 'Lyubimova NE', 'Petrova OA', 'Ananina YV', 'Petrov EM']",2016,,1,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Ostankova YV, et al.

27020774,Development of Point-of-Care Testing for Disaster-Related Infectious Diseases.,"After disaster, the victims lose their safe lives and are even exposed to nature where they could suffer from animal bites and vectors followed by suffering from zoonosis or vector-born diseases. Because of the urgent need for rapid and cheap diagnosis for infectious diseases after disaster, anonymous questionnaire clarified that leptospirosis, dengue, diarrhea, and cholera were recognized as common disaster-related infections in the Philippines, while diarrhea and pneumonia were more common in Indonesia. It should also be noted that infectious disease itself such as tuberculosis associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in South Africa is a disaster. Thus, the possible occurrence of similar situation in Asia should be prevented. We have conducted an international collaborative research in the Philippines and Indonesia on dengue virus, leptospira and mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infectious diseases. Development of point-of-care testing for molecular diagnosis and disease severity was the principal purpose of the research. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay, which does not require a source of electricity, was developed for leptospirosis, dengue and MTB and has been proved to be useful where resource is limited. The plasma levels of matricellular proteins, including galectin-9 and osteopontin, were found to reflect the disease severities in dengue virus and MTB infection, probably because matricellular proteins are one of the most functional extracellular proteins that are associated with inflammatory edema. The study on disaster-related infectious disease facilitates the international cooperation for development of point-of-care testing for tropical infectious diseases.","['Hattori T', 'Chagan-Yasutan H', 'Shiratori B', 'Egawa S', 'Izumi T', 'Kubo T', 'Nakajima C', 'Suzuki Y', 'Niki T', 'Alisjahbana B', 'Telan E']",2016,238,4,Tohoku J Exp Med,"Hattori T, et al.

27015596,Prevalence and Genotype Allocation of Pathogenic Leptospira Species in Small Mammals from Various Habitat Types in Germany.,"Small mammals serve as most important reservoirs for Leptospira spp., the causative agents of Leptospirosis, which is one of the most neglected and widespread zoonotic diseases worldwide. The knowledge about Leptospira spp. occurring in small mammals from Germany is scarce. Thus, this study's objectives were to investigate the occurrence of Leptospira spp. and the inherent sequence types in small mammals from three different study sites: a forest in southern Germany (site B1); a National Park in south-eastern Germany (site B2) and a renaturalised area, in eastern Germany (site S) where small mammals were captured. DNA was extracted from kidneys of small mammals and tested for Leptospira spp. by real-time PCR. Positive samples were further analysed by duplex and conventional PCRs. For 14 positive samples, multi locus sequence typing (MLST) was performed. Altogether, 1213 small mammals were captured: 216 at site B1, 456 at site B2 and 541 at site S belonging to following species: Sorex (S.) araneus, S. coronatus, Apodemus (A.) flavicollis, Myodes glareolus, Microtus (Mi.) arvalis, Crocidura russula, Arvicola terrestris, A. agrarius, Mustela nivalis, Talpa europaea, and Mi. agrestis. DNA of Leptospira spp. was detected in 6% of all small mammals. At site B1, 25 small mammals (11.6%), at site B2, 15 small mammals (3.3%) and at site S, 33 small mammals (6.1%) were positive for Leptospira spp. Overall, 54 of the positive samples were further determined as L. kirschneri, nine as L. interrogans and four as L. borgpetersenii while five real-time PCR-positive samples could not be further determined by conventional PCR. MLST results revealed focal occurrence of L. interrogans and L. kirschneri sequence type (ST) 117 while L. kirschneri ST 110 was present in small mammals at all three sites. Further, this study provides evidence for a particular host association of L. borgpetersenii to mice of the genus Apodemus.","['Obiegala A', 'Woll D', 'Karnath C', 'Silaghi C', 'Schex S', 'Eßbauer S', 'Pfeffer M']",2016,10,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Obiegala A, et al.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the frequency and level of specific antibodies against members of the Bbsl group, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap), and Leptospira (L.) interrogans serovars in BMD and compare the results with those found in dogs of other breeds.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 171 healthy BMD and 57 healthy control dogs of other breeds were included in the study. Controls were large dogs (> 30 kg) with long, dark hair coats. A two-tiered testing method consisting of computerized kinetic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (KELA) and Western blotting was used for detection of antibodies against Bbsl, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used for detection of antibodies against Ap, and microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibodies to 18 different serovars of L. interrogans.
RESULTS: The prevalence of anti-Bbsl antibodies was significantly higher in BMD (43.3%) than in controls (17.5%) (p < 0.001). Antibodies to Bbsl attributable to vaccination were excluded from the calculation of prevalence. Antibodies to Ap were found in 50.3% of BMD, whereas only 24.6% of the controls dogs were tested positive for Ap (p < 0.001). Antibody titers of the 18 different serovars of L. interrogans antibodies did not differ significantly between BMD and control dogs except for L. copenhageni antibody titers which were higher in BMD. Significantly higher antibody titers to L. canicola (p = 0.003), L. copenhageni (p = 0.005), L. grippothyphosa (p = 0.029) and L. vanderhoedoni (p = 0.035) were seen in BMD compared to control dogs.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: BMD had a higher prevalence of anti-Bbsl, anti-L. copenhageni and anti-Ap antibodies than control dogs. Significantly higher antibody titers against L. canicola (p = 0.003), L. copenhageni (p = 0.005), L. grippothyphosa (p = 0.029) and L. vanderhoedoni (p = 0.035) were seen in BMD compared with control dogs, but the reason for this and potential clinical implications are not known.","['Preyß-Jägeler C', 'Müller E', 'Straubinger RK', 'Hartmann K']",2016,44,2,Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere,"Preyß-Jägeler C, et al.

26978023,In Vitro Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Pathogenic Leptospira Biofilm.,"Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the causative agent of leptospirosis. Biofilm formation in leptospires is a new area of study, and its role in pathogenesis is not fully explored. As in other biofilm-forming bacteria, Leptospira biofilm may play a significant role in antibiotic resistance. In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibility of Leptospira biofilm was investigated by 96-well plate assay using Alamar Blue. Leptospira biofilm showed five to sixfold increase in resistance in all the strains used. The range of minimal bactericidal concentrations for penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, and doxycycline was 1,600 U/ml, 800-1,600 μg/ml, 800-1,600 μg/ml, and 800-1,600 μg/ml, respectively. In agar substrate, the biofilm showed six- to sevenfold increase in resistance to antibiotics compared to planktonic cell. The present study emphasizes the importance of biofilm formation and its antibiotic susceptibility patterns. This could pave the way for devising appropriate strategy to prevent the occurrence of potential chronic leptospirosis in endemic areas and also during an outbreak situation.","['Vinod Kumar K', 'Lall C', 'Raj RV', 'Vedhagiri K', 'Sunish IP', 'Vijayachari P']",2016,22,7,Microb Drug Resist,"Vinod Kumar K, et al.

26976804,Acquisition of negative complement regulators by the saprophyte Leptospira biflexa expressing LigA or LigB confers enhanced survival in human serum.,"Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins are surface exposed molecules present in pathogenic but not in saprophytic Leptospira species. We have previously shown that Lig proteins interact with the soluble complement regulators Factor H (FH), FH like-1 (FHL-1), FH related-1 (FHR-1) and C4b Binding Protein (C4BP). In this study, we used the saprophyte L. biflexa serovar Patoc as a surrogate host to address the specific role of LigA and LigB proteins in leptospiral complement evasion. L. biflexa expressing LigA or LigB was able to acquire FH and C4BP. Bound complement regulators retained their cofactor activities of FI in the proteolytic cleavage of C3b and C4b. Moreover, heterologous expression of ligA and ligB genes in the saprophyte L. biflexa enhanced bacterial survival in human serum. Complement deposition on lig-transformed L. biflexa was assessed by flow cytometry analysis. With regard to MAC deposition, L. biflexa expressing LigA or LigB presented an intermediate profile: MAC deposition levels were greater than those found in the pathogenic L. interrogans, but lower than those observed for L. biflexa wildtype. In conclusion, Lig proteins contribute to in vitro control of complement activation on the leptospiral surface, promoting an increased bacterial survival in human serum.","['Castiblanco-Valencia MM', 'Fraga TR', 'Breda LC', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Figueira CP', 'Picardeau M', 'Wunder E', 'Ko AI', 'Barbosa AS', 'Isaac L']",2016,173,,Immunol Lett,"Castiblanco-Valencia MM, et al.

26975185,"Influenza-like illness in an urban community of Salvador, Brazil: incidence, seasonality and risk factors.","BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the epidemiology of influenza is limited in tropical regions, which in turn has hampered identifying optimal region-specific policy to diminish disease burden. Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a clinical diagnosis that can be used as a surrogate for influenza. This study aimed to define the incidence and seasonality of ILI and to assess its association with climatic variables and school calendar in an urban community in the tropical region of Salvador, Brazil.
METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, we conducted enhanced community-based surveillance for acute febrile illnesses (AFI) among patients ≥ 5 years of age in a slum community emergency unit in Salvador, Brazil. ILI was defined as a measured temperature of ≥ 37.8 °C or reported fever in a patient with cough or sore throat for ≤ 7 days, and negative test results for dengue and leptospirosis. Seasonality was analyzed with a harmonic regression model. Negative binomial regression models were used to correlate ILI incidence with rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and the number of days per month that schools were in session while controlling for seasonality.
RESULTS: There were 2,651 (45.6% of 5,817 AFI patients) ILI cases with a mean annual incidence of 60 cases/1,000 population (95% CI 58-62). Risk of ILI was highest among 5-9 year olds with an annual incidence of 105 cases/1,000 population in 2009. ILI had a clear seasonal pattern with peaks between the 35-40th week of the year. ILI peaks were higher and earlier in 5-9 year olds compared with > 19 year olds. No association was seen between ILI and precipitation, relative humidity or temperature. There was a significant association between the incidence of ILI in children 5-9 years of age and number of scheduled school days per month.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a significant burden of ILI with distinct seasonality in the Brazilian tropics and highest rates among young school-age children. Seasonal peaks of ILI in children 5-9 years of age were positively associated with the number of school days, indicating that children may play a role in the timing of seasonal influenza transmission.","['Oliveira CR', 'Costa GSR', 'Paploski IAD', 'Kikuti M', 'Kasper AM', 'Silva MMO', 'Tavares AS', 'Cruz JS', 'Queiroz TL', 'Lima HCAV', 'Calcagno J', 'Reis MG', 'Weinberger DM', 'Shapiro ED', 'Ko AI', 'Ribeiro GS']",2016,16,,BMC Infect Dis,"Oliveira CR, et al.

26969849,"Feral Swine Leptospira Seroprevalence Survey in Hawaii, USA, 2007-2009.","Leptospirosis is considered the most widespread of zoonotic diseases. It was a notifiable disease in the United States until 1995 and was reinstated to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in 2014. During the time of national surveillance, Hawaii consistently led the nation in reported annual incidence rates. Leptospirosis has remained a reportable disease in Hawaii. Significant changes have been documented since the early 1970s in the predominant serogroup infecting humans in Hawaii: infections due to Icterohaemorrhagiae have declined while infections due to Australis have increased. A recent study from Hawaii demonstrated that Australis was an uncommon infecting serogroup for small mammal hosts. Swine have not been previously studied in Hawaii but are well-recognized maintenance hosts for leptospires belonging to the Australis serogroup. This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of Leptospira antibody in feral swine in Hawaii. From January 2007 through December 2009, blood samples were collected opportunistically from feral swine. Using the microscopic agglutination test, we found antibody titres ≥1 : 100 to leptospires in 272 (33.8%) of 804 feral swine. The most frequently reacting serovars to the swine sera were Icterohaemorrhagiae (Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup) (41.5%) and Bratislava (Australis serogroup) (33.8%). The high seroprevalence and presumptively infecting serovars suggest a link between swine and human infection.","['Buchholz AE', 'Katz AR', 'Galloway R', 'Stoddard RA', 'Goldstein SM']",2016,63,8,Zoonoses Public Health,"Buchholz AE, et al.

26967136,PATHOGENIC LEPTOSPIRA SEROVARS IN FREE-LIVING SEA LIONS IN THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA AND ALONG THE BAJA CALIFORNIA COAST OF MEXICO.,"The California sea lion ( Zalophus californianus ), a permanent inhabitant of the Gulf of California in Mexico, is susceptible to pathogenic Leptospira spp. infection, which can result in hepatic and renal damage and may lead to renal failure and death. During summer 2013, we used the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) to investigate the prevalence of anti-Leptospira antibodies in blood of clinically healthy sea lion pups from seven rookery islands on the Pacific Coast of Baja California (Pacific Ocean) and in the Gulf of California. We also used PCR to examine blood for Leptospira DNA. Isolation of Leptospira in liquid media was unsuccessful. We found higher antibody prevalence in sea lions from the rookery islands in the gulf than in those from the Pacific Coast. Antibodies against 11 serovars were identified in the Gulf of California population; the most frequent reactions were against serovars Bataviae (90%), Pyrogenes (86%), Wolffi (86%), Celledoni (71%), and Pomona (65%). In the Pacific Ocean population, MAT was positive against eight serovars, where Wolffi (88%), Pomona (75%), and Bataviae (70%) were the most frequent. Serum samples agglutinated with more than one Leptospira serovar. The maximum titer was 3,200. Each island had a different serology profile, and islands combined showed a distinct profile for each region. We detected pathogenic Leptospira DNA in 63% of blood samples, but we found no saprophytic Leptospira. Positive PCR results were obtained in blood samples with high and low MAT titers. Together, these two methods enhance the diagnosis and interpretation of sea lion leptospirosis. Our results may be related to human activities or the presence of other reservoirs with which sea lions interact, and they may also be related to sea lion stranding.","['Avalos-Téllez R', 'Carrillo-Casas EM', 'Atilano-López D', 'Godínez-Reyes CR', 'Díaz-Aparicio E', 'Ramírez-Delgado D', 'Ramírez-Echenique MF', 'Leyva-Leyva M', 'Suzán G', 'Suárez-Güemes F']",2016,52,2,J Wildl Dis,"Avalos-Téllez R, et al.

26964740,Atypical leptospirosis: an overlooked cause of aseptic meningitis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, probably the most common zoonosis in the world, is caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. Clinical presentations range from nonspecific fevers to fulminant diseases such as Weil's syndrome. Neurological forms of leptospirosis (neuroleptospirosis) are usually underestimated, and many cases of leptospirosis are overlooked because of the lack of specificity of signs and symptoms. Diagnosis confirmation is difficult because of the challenges associated with isolating the organism and positive serologic testing. A comprehensive understanding of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis and risk factors for exposure to leptospirae are required for early diagnosis, in order to initiate appropriate treatment immediately.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present one male patient with anicteric leptospirosis that manifested as neuroleptospirosis with aseptic meningitis, although he did not have impaired kidney function or thrombocytopenia. He recovered well after an early investigation and treatment for leptospirosis based on suspected relevant risk factors and clinical manifestations.
CONCLUSION: To facilitate optimal use of antibiotic treatments and prevent lethal complications of leptospirosis, we report this case of leptospirosis, which highlights the importance of knowing the occupational history and environmental exposures of patients living in leptospirosis-endemic areas and presenting meningeal signs.","['Wang N', 'Han YH', 'Sung JY', 'Lee WS', 'Ou TY']",2016,9,,BMC Res Notes,"Wang N, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 10 reference strains of Leptospira spp. were used in the study according to microscopic agglutination reaction from the collection of Pasteur RIEM. All the strains were cultivated for 10 days in Terskikh medium at 28 degrees C. Cell extracts were obtained by ethanol/formic acid method. α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution was used as a matrix. Mass-spectra were obtained in Microflex mass-spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). External validation of the test-model was carried out using novel spectra of every reference strain during their repeated reseeding.
RESULTS: Values of cross-validation and confirmatory ability of the optimal model, built on a genetic algorithm, was 99.14 and 100%, respectively. This model contained 11 biomarker peaks (m/z 2959, 3447, 3548, 3764, 3895, 5221, 5917, 6173, 6701, 7013, 8364) for serovar classification. Results of the external validation have shown a 100% correct classification in serovar classesin Sejroe, Ballum, Tarassovi; Copenhageni, Mozdoc, Grippotyphosa and Patoc, that indicates a high prognostic ability of the model in these classes. However, data from verification matrix have shown, that 50%.of the spectra from Canicola and Pomona serovars were classified as Patoc class, that could be associated with cross serological activity of Patoc serovar L. biflexa with pathogenic leptospirae.
CONCLUSION: MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry method combined with building and using the classification model could be a useful instrument for intra-laboratory control of leptospira reseeding.","['Zyeva EV', 'Stoyanova NA', 'Tokarevich NK', 'Totolyan AA']",2015,,6,Zh Mikrobiol Epidemiol Immunobiol,"Zyeva EV, et al.

26943982,CKD and Infectious Diseases in Asia Pacific: Challenges and Opportunities.,"The exact number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Asia Pacific is uncertain. In numeric terms, the region is home to the largest population of patients with untreated chronic kidney failure. The climatic, geographic, social, cultural, economic, and environmental diversity within this region is higher than in any other part of the world. Large parts of the region face a climate-related burden of infectious diseases. Infections contribute to the development and progression of CKD and complicate the course of patients with pre-existing CKD (especially those on dialysis therapy or who are immunosuppressed), increase the cost of CKD care, and contribute to mortality and morbidity. Kidney involvement is a feature of several infectious diseases prevalent in Asia Pacific. Examples include malaria, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C virus, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and Hantaan virus infections. The contribution of infection-associated acute kidney injury to the overall burden of CKD has not been evaluated systematically. Research is needed to quantify the impact of infections on kidney health by undertaking prospective studies.

26943334,"Mixed Methods Survey of Zoonotic Disease Awareness and Practice among Animal and Human Healthcare Providers in Moshi, Tanzania.","BACKGROUND: Zoonoses are common causes of human and livestock illness in Tanzania. Previous studies have shown that brucellosis, leptospirosis, and Q fever account for a large proportion of human febrile illness in northern Tanzania, yet they are infrequently diagnosed. We conducted this study to assess awareness and knowledge regarding selected zoonoses among healthcare providers in Moshi, Tanzania; to determine what diagnostic and treatment protocols are utilized; and obtain insights into contextual factors contributing to the apparent under-diagnosis of zoonoses.
METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: We conducted a questionnaire about zoonoses knowledge, case reporting, and testing with 52 human health practitioners and 10 livestock health providers. Immediately following questionnaire administration, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 60 of these respondents, using the findings of a previous fever etiology study to prompt conversation. Sixty respondents (97%) had heard of brucellosis, 26 (42%) leptospirosis, and 20 (32%) Q fever. Animal sector respondents reported seeing cases of animal brucellosis (4), rabies (4), and anthrax (3) in the previous 12 months. Human sector respondents reported cases of human brucellosis (15, 29%), rabies (9, 18%) and anthrax (6, 12%). None reported leptospirosis or Q fever cases. Nineteen respondents were aware of a local diagnostic test for human brucellosis. Reports of tests for human leptospirosis or Q fever, or for any of the study pathogens in animals, were rare. Many respondents expressed awareness of malaria over-diagnosis and zoonoses under-diagnosis, and many identified low knowledge and testing capacity as reasons for zoonoses under-diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed differences in knowledge of different zoonoses and low case report frequencies of brucellosis, leptospirosis, and Q fever. There was a lack of known diagnostic services for leptospirosis and Q fever. These findings emphasize a need for improved diagnostic capacity alongside healthcare provider education and improved clinical guidelines for syndrome-based disease management to provoke diagnostic consideration of locally relevant zoonoses in the absence of laboratory confirmation.","['Zhang HL', 'Mnzava KW', 'Mitchell ST', 'Melubo ML', 'Kibona TJ', 'Cleaveland S', 'Kazwala RR', 'Crump JA', 'Sharp JP', 'Halliday JE']",2016,10,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zhang HL, et al.

26927873,Determination of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Javanica and Leptospira interrogans serovar Bataviae as the persistent Leptospira serovars circulating in the urban rat populations in Peninsular Malaysia.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease of global significance, and is endemic in tropical countries, including Malaysia. Over the last decade, a dramatic increase of human cases was reported; however, information on the primary vector, the rat, and the Leptospira serovars circulating among the rat population is limited. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to isolate Leptospira and characterise the serovars circulating in the urban rat populations from selected main cities in Peninsular Malaysia.
METHODS: Rat trappings were carried out between October 2011 to February 2014 in five urban cities which were chosen as study sites to represent different geographical locations in Peninsular Malaysia. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and PCR were carried out to identify the Leptospiral serogroup and determine the pathogenic status of the isolates, respectively while pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR were used to characterize the isolates.
RESULTS: Three rat species were identified from the three hundred and fifty seven rats captured with Rattus rattus, being the dominant rat species (285, 80 %) followed by Rattus norgevicus (53, 15 %) and Rattus exulans (19, 5 %). Only 39 samples (11.0 %) were positive by culture and further confirmed as pathogenic Leptospira by PCR. Significant associations were shown between host infection with locality, season, host-age and species. Based on MAT, two serogroups were identified in the population namely; L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica (n = 16) and L. interrogans serogroup Bataviae (n = 23). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) distinguished the two serovars in the urban rat populations: L. borgpetersenii serovar Javanica (41 %), and L. interrogans serovar Bataviae (59 %). RAPD-PCR yielded 14 distinct patterns and was found to be more discriminative than PFGE.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms two Leptospira serovars circulating among the urban rats population in Peninsular Malaysia namely; L. borgpetersenii serovar Javanica and L. interrogans serovars Bataviae. Despite the low number of isolates obtained from the rat population, this study suggests that rodent control programs and disease surveillance may help to reduce the possible risk of disease transmission.","['Benacer D', 'Mohd Zain SN', 'Sim SZ', 'Mohd Khalid MK', 'Galloway RL', 'Souris M', 'Thong KL']",2016,9,,Parasit Vectors,"Benacer D, et al.

26924349,Determinants of mortality and impact of therapy in patients with leptospirosis admitted for intensive care in a Sri Lankan hospital--a three year retrospective study.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a disease of epidemic proportions in Sri Lanka. There is paucity of data on the determinants of mortality and impact of therapy in patients with leptospirosis admitted to critical care settings in endemic territories.
METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cross-sectional study was performed in patients with serologically confirmed leptospirosis admitted to the intensive care unit of the General Hospital, Kalutara from January 2011 to April 2014. Associations between socio-epidemiological, clinical and laboratory parameters and patient mortality were examined.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included. The mean age was 49.11(SD = 16.95) and majority (92%) were male. Percentage mortality was 44.4%. Patient mortality was associated with age > 40 (p = 0.012), symptoms of uremia (p = 0.017), evidence of CNS involvement (p = 0.039), presence of oliguria (p = 0.002) and anuria (p = 0.014), presence of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (p < 0.001), CRP > 96 (p = 0.036), platelet count < 20,000 (p = 0.045), Potassium > 5.0 (p = 0.05), metabolic acidosis with pH < 7.2 (p = 0.03), INR > 2 (p = 0.037) and requirement of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001).

26914210,Early Indicators of Fatal Leptospirosis during the 2010 Epidemic in Puerto Rico.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal bacterial zoonosis that is endemic throughout the tropics and may be misdiagnosed as dengue. Delayed hospital admission of leptospirosis patients is associated with increased mortality.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During a concurrent dengue/leptospirosis epidemic in Puerto Rico in 2010, suspected dengue patients that tested dengue-negative were tested for leptospirosis. Fatal and non-fatal hospitalized leptospirosis patients were matched 1:1-3 by age. Records from all medical visits were evaluated for factors associated with fatal outcome. Among 175 leptospirosis patients identified (4.7 per 100,000 residents), 26 (15%) were fatal. Most patients were older males and had illness onset during the rainy season. Fatal case patients first sought medical care earlier than non-fatal control patients (2.5 vs. 5 days post-illness onset [DPO], p < 0.01), but less frequently first sought care at a hospital (52.4% vs. 92.2%, p < 0.01). Although fatal cases were more often diagnosed with leptospirosis at first medical visit (43.9% vs. 9.6%, p = 0.01), they were admitted to the hospital no earlier than non-fatal controls (4.5 vs. 6 DPO, p = 0.31). Cases less often developed fever (p = 0.03), but more often developed jaundice, edema, leg pain, hemoptysis, and had a seizure (p ≤ 0.03). Multivariable analysis of laboratory values from first medical visit associated with fatal outcome included increased white blood cell (WBC) count with increased creatinine (p = 0.001), and decreased bicarbonate with either increased WBC count, increased creatinine, or decreased platelet count (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with fatal leptospirosis sought care earlier, but were not admitted for care any earlier than non-fatal patients. Combinations of routine laboratory values predictive of fatal outcome should be considered in admission decision-making for patients with suspected leptospirosis.","['Sharp TM', 'Rivera García B', 'Pérez-Padilla J', 'Galloway RL', 'Guerra M', 'Ryff KR', 'Haberling D', 'Ramakrishnan S', 'Shadomy S', 'Blau D', 'Tomashek KM', 'Bower WA']",2016,10,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Sharp TM, et al.

26913271,Clinical and laboratory manifestation and outcome of icterohemorrhagic leptospirosis patients in Northern Iran.,"BACKGROUND: Icterohemorrhagic form of leptospirosis has a high mortality rate. In this study, the clinical manifestations, epidemiologic and laboratory findings and outcome of Weil's disease were investigated.
METHODS: A descriptive cross- sectional study was conducted on 66 consecutive patients with icterohemorrhagic leptospirosis who were admitted to Razi Hospital (The Therapeutic Center of Infectious Diseases in the North of Iran) in 2013. The inclusion criteria were as follows: All patients who had clinical and epidemiological data suggestive of leptospirosis and displayed icterohemorrhagic form at the time of admission or during hospitalization. All patients were visited on admission, one, two and six weeks later. Demographic data, clinical, laboratory features and complications were evaluated, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 13.0.
RESULTS: Among 66 patients, 89.4% (n = 59) were male, 60% (n = 40) were farmers and 9.1% (n= 6) had a history of swimming in rivers. The most common complaints were fever and jaundice, respectively. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (90.9%), myalgia (75.8%), chills (70.8%) and headache (65.1%). Hyponatremia and hypernatremia were seen in 7.6% and 72.8% of the participants, respectively. Also, hypokalemia was observed in two patients (3%). Approximately, half of the cases had leukocytosis and 90% had thrombocytopenia. Rise of AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin were seen in 95.2%, 93.6%, 76.2% and 100% of the patients, respectively. Of the patients, 42.4% experienced complications of icterohemorrhagic leptospirosis including acute renal failure (30.3%) pneumonia (25.8%), pancreatitis (4.5%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.5%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (1.5%). Three cases (4.5%) died, 42 cases (63.7%) were discharged with residual effects and 52 patients (78.8%) had positive serology.
CONCLUSION: The most significant biochemical abnormalities were thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hyponatremia and hypernatremia and azotemia and the latter remained stable in 2% of the patients at least until the end of the 6-week period.","['Alian S', 'Davoudi A', 'Najafi N', 'Ghasemian R', 'Ahangarkani F', 'Hamdi Z']",2015,29,,Med J Islam Repub Iran,"Alian S, et al.

26909976,Isolation and molecular characterization of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strain Hardjobovis in the urine of naturally infected cattle in Brazil.,"Most epidemiologic studies on bovine leptospirosis are based on serological tests that use antibodies against several serotypes, including the serovar Hardjo, which is widespread and considered to be the most adapted to bovine hosts. However, using only serological studies is not sufficient to identify and distinguish species of leptospires. The aim of this study was report the first isolation in Brazil of two strains serovar Hardjo obtained in urine samples from naturally infected cows in a small Brazilian dairy herd and find the genetic species and consequently the type strain Hardjobovis by molecular characterization. Fifteen dairy cows with a history of reproductive failure, such as abortion and infertility, were selected. Urine samples obtained from each animal were immediately seeded in tubes containing Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris culture medium. The identification of the isolates was performed by Multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) technique and phylogenetic analysis of partial sequence of gene sec Y. From the 15 urine samples evaluated, two Leptospira were found and identified as the Londrina 49 and Londrina 54 strains. The MLVA profiles and sequencing of gene sec Y characterized the isolates as L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo strain Hadjobovis because it has different genetic pattern of Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo strain Hardjoprajitno. Therefore, more studies are needed including isolation and molecular characterization from regional strains to obtain a better knowledge about epidemiology of serovar Hardjo in bovine which may assist in future strategies of prevention and control of bovine leptospirosis.","['Chideroli RT', 'Pereira UP', 'Gonçalves DD', 'Nakamura AY', 'Alfieri AA', 'Alfieri AF', 'Freitas JC']",2016,15,1,Genet Mol Res,"Chideroli RT, et al.

26904743,Highly Sensitive Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification for the Detection of Leptospira.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by an infection with the pathogenic species of Leptospira. We have developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect the DNA of Leptospira spp. Six sets of primers targeting the gene of the subsurface protein, lipL32, were evaluated for their detection sensitivity. The best primer set detected less than 25 copies of lipL32 per reaction of both plasmid DNA template and purified leptospiral genomic DNA. By combining primers targeting lipL32 with the previously published primer set targeting lipL41, the sensitivity of the assay was improved to 12 copies of L. interrogans. The specificity of the LAMP assay was evaluated by using the genomic DNA from other clinically encountered bacterial species such as different strains of Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia rickettsii, Coxiella burnetii, and Bartonella bacilliformis. These genomic DNA samples were all negative in our LAMP assay. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was very similar to that of quantitative real time PCR. Several detection methods for the amplified product of LAMP assay were performed to demonstrate the simplicity of the assay. In summary, our results have suggested that this assay is rapid, robust, and easy to perform and has the potential to be used in endemic locations.","['Chen HW', 'Weissenberger G', 'Atkins E', 'Chao CC', 'Suputtamongkol Y', 'Ching WM']",2015,2015,,Int J Bacteriol,"Chen HW, et al.

26890609,What Makes a Bacterial Species Pathogenic?:Comparative Genomic Analysis of the Genus Leptospira.,"Leptospirosis, caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira, is a globally widespread, neglected and emerging zoonotic disease. While whole genome analysis of individual pathogenic, intermediately pathogenic and saprophytic Leptospira species has been reported, comprehensive cross-species genomic comparison of all known species of infectious and non-infectious Leptospira, with the goal of identifying genes related to pathogenesis and mammalian host adaptation, remains a key gap in the field. Infectious Leptospira, comprised of pathogenic and intermediately pathogenic Leptospira, evolutionarily diverged from non-infectious, saprophytic Leptospira, as demonstrated by the following computational biology analyses: 1) the definitive taxonomy and evolutionary relatedness among all known Leptospira species; 2) genomically-predicted metabolic reconstructions that indicate novel adaptation of infectious Leptospira to mammals, including sialic acid biosynthesis, pathogen-specific porphyrin metabolism and the first-time demonstration of cobalamin (B12) autotrophy as a bacterial virulence factor; 3) CRISPR/Cas systems demonstrated only to be present in pathogenic Leptospira, suggesting a potential mechanism for this clade's refractoriness to gene targeting; 4) finding Leptospira pathogen-specific specialized protein secretion systems; 5) novel virulence-related genes/gene families such as the Virulence Modifying (VM) (PF07598 paralogs) proteins and pathogen-specific adhesins; 6) discovery of novel, pathogen-specific protein modification and secretion mechanisms including unique lipoprotein signal peptide motifs, Sec-independent twin arginine protein secretion motifs, and the absence of certain canonical signal recognition particle proteins from all Leptospira; and 7) and demonstration of infectious Leptospira-specific signal-responsive gene expression, motility and chemotaxis systems. By identifying large scale changes in infectious (pathogenic and intermediately pathogenic) vs. non-infectious Leptospira, this work provides new insights into the evolution of a genus of bacterial pathogens. This work will be a comprehensive roadmap for understanding leptospirosis pathogenesis. More generally, it provides new insights into mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens adapt to mammalian hosts.","['Fouts DE', 'Matthias MA', 'Adhikarla H', 'Adler B', 'Amorim-Santos L', 'Berg DE', 'Bulach D', 'Buschiazzo A', 'Chang YF', 'Galloway RL', 'Haake DA', 'Haft DH', 'Hartskeerl R', 'Ko AI', 'Levett PN', 'Matsunaga J', 'Mechaly AE', 'Monk JM', 'Nascimento AL', 'Nelson KE', 'Palsson B', 'Peacock SJ', 'Picardeau M', 'Ricaldi JN', 'Thaipandungpanit J', 'Wunder EA', 'Yang XF', 'Zhang JJ', 'Vinetz JM']",2016,10,2,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Fouts DE, et al.

26884415,Predicting global variation in infectious disease severity: A bottom-up approach.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Understanding the underlying causes for the variation in case-fatality-ratios (CFR) is important for assessing the mechanism governing global disparity in the burden of infectious diseases. Variation in CFR is likely to be driven by factors such as population genetics, demography, transmission patterns and general health status. We present data here that support the hypothsis that changes in CFRs for specific diseases may be the result of serial passage through different hosts. For example passage through adults may lead to lower CFR, whereas passage through children may have the opposite effect. Accordingly changes in CFR may occur in parallel with demographic transitions.
METHODOLOGY: We explored the predictability of CFR using data obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) disease databases for four human diseases: mumps, malaria, tuberculosis and leptospirosis and assessed these for association with a range of population characteristics, such as crude birth and death rates, median age of the population, mean body mass index, proportion living in urban areas and tuberculosis vaccine coverage. We then tested this predictive model on Danish historical demographic and population data.
RESULTS: Birth rates were the best predictor for mumps and malaria CFR. For tuberculosis CFR death rates were the best predictor and for leptospirosis population density was a significant predictor.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: CFR predictors differed among diseases according to their biology. We suggest that the overall result reflects an interaction between the forces driving demographic change and the virulence of human-to-human transmitted diseases.","['Jensen PM', 'De Fine Licht HH']",2016,2016,1,Evol Med Public Health,Jensen PM and De Fine Licht HH.

26880775,The Utility of Blood Culture Fluid for the Molecular Diagnosis of Leptospira: A Prospective Evaluation.,"Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis worldwide, with infections occurring after exposure to contaminated water. Despite being a global problem, laboratory diagnosis remains difficult with culture results taking up to 3 months, serology being retrospective by nature, and polymerase chain reaction showing limited sensitivity. Leptospira have been shown to survive and multiply in blood culture media, and we hypothesized that extracting DNA from incubated blood culture fluid (BCF), followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) could improve the accuracy and speed of leptospira diagnosis. We assessed this retrospectively, using preincubated BCF of Leptospira spp. positive (N= 109) and negative (N= 63) febrile patients in Vientiane, Lao PDR. The final method showed promising sensitivities of 66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55-76) and 59% (95% CI: 49-68) compared with direct or direct and indirect testing combined, as the respective reference standards (specificities > 95%). Despite these promising diagnostic parameters, a subsequent prospective evaluation in a Lao hospital population (N= 352) showed that the sensitivity was very low (∼30%) compared with qPCR on venous blood samples. The disappointingly low sensitivity does suggest that venous blood samples are preferable for the clinical microbiology laboratory, although BCF might be an alternative if leptospirosis is only suspected postadmission after antibiotics have been used.","['Dittrich S', 'Rudgard WE', 'Woods KL', 'Silisouk J', 'Phuklia W', 'Davong V', 'Vongsouvath M', 'Phommasone K', 'Rattanavong S', 'Knappik M', 'Craig SB', 'Weier SL', 'Tulsiani SM', 'Dance DAB', 'Newton PN']",2016,94,4,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Dittrich S, et al.

Of these, almost 90% were positive and there were reactions to the 22 serovars used in the study. The most common serovar in these snakes was Javanica, Andamana and Patoc. Most frequent titers were 25 and 50, although high titers (such as 1600) were also recorded, despite the absence of clinical symptoms. The possibility should be considered of captive snakes serving as a serious source of leptospiral infection in humans, which is why it is essential to study, prevent and control the disease in breeding centers and serpentariums.","['Rodrigues TCS', 'Santos ALQ', 'Lima AMC', 'Gomes DO', 'Brites VLC']",2016,158,,Acta Trop,"Rodrigues TCS, et al.

26851589,Multiple etiologies of equine recurrent uveitis--A natural model for human autoimmune uveitis: A brief review.,"Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) has various etiologies, with Leptospira infection and genetic predisposition being the leading risk factors. Regardless of etiology, expression of ocular proteins associated with maintenance of the blood-ocular barrier is impaired in ERU. The recurring-remitting cycle of ERU repeatedly disrupts the blood-ocular barrier, allowing the previously immune-privileged ocular environment to become the site of a progressive local autoimmune pathology that ultimately results in tissue destruction and vision loss. The immune-mediated process involves humoral and cellular mechanisms. Intraocular antibodies either produced in the eye or that leak through the blood-ocular barrier, are often present at higher levels than in serum and react with antigens in ocular tissue of horses with ERU. Ocular infiltration of auto-aggressive lymphocytes occurs with each uveitis episode and is the most crucial contributor to inflammation and eye damage. Recurring uveitis episodes may be initiated when epitopes of an ocular antigen become visible to the immune system (intramolecular spreading) or another autoantigen (intermolecular spreading), resulting in a new inflammatory reaction.","['Witkowski L', 'Cywinska A', 'Paschalis-Trela K', 'Crisman M', 'Kita J']",2016,44,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Witkowski L, et al.

Their significant degree of symptomatic similarity makes clinical diagnosis difficult.
OBJECTIVE: To diagnose leptospirosis differentially in patients with clinically suspected dengue.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 86 patients with clinically suspected dengue underwent virological and serological diagnostic evaluations for dengue (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, NS1 immunochromatographic test, and NS1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA), as well as tests to detect immunoglobulin M (IgM; IgM/IgG Rapid Test and IgM ELISA). The same patients were subsequently evaluated for leptospirosis using Rapid Test IgG/IgM (Bioeasy®) and Leptospira IgM ELISA (PanBio®).
RESULTS: Of the 86 patients, 48 (55.8%) had positive results for dengue in at least one of the tests and five (7.35%) showed positive reactions for leptospirosis.

Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests for leptospirosis are a critical step to diagnose the disease. There are some commercial kits available for diagnosis of leptospirosis, but the obscurity of a species- or genus-specific antigen of pathogenic Leptospira interrogans causes the reduced sensitivity and specificity. In this study, the polysaccharide derived from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of nonpathogenic Leptospira biflexa serovar patoc was prepared, and the antigenicity was confirmed by immunoblot and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The performance of the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kit using the polysaccharide as a diagnostic antigen was evaluated in Korea, Bulgaria and Argentina. The sensitivity was 93.9%, 100%, and 81.0% and the specificity was 97.9%, 100%, and 95.4% in Korea (which is a rare region occurring with 2 serovars mostly), Bulgaria (epidemic region with 3 serovars chiefly) and Argentina (endemic region with 19 serovars mainly) respectively. These results indicate that this RDT is applicable for global diagnosis of leptospirosis. This rapid and effective diagnosis will be helpful for diagnosis and manage of leptospirosis to use and the polysaccharide of Leptospira may be called as genus specific antigen for diagnosis.","['Lee JW', 'Park S', 'Kim SH', 'Christova I', 'Jacob P', 'Vanasco NB', 'Kang YM', 'Woo YJ', 'Kim MS', 'Kim YJ', 'Cho MK', 'Kim YW']",2016,31,2,J Korean Med Sci,"Lee JW, et al.

Current diagnostic methods are generally inadequate for dealing with large numbers of samples, are outdated, and provide little useful diagnostic and epidemiological information. This aim of this study was to apply a microsphere immunoassay (MIA), utilising Luminex xMap technology, to 200 bovine serum samples to determine this method's usefulness in leptospirosis diagnosis in comparison with the current gold standard, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Although MAT is the most widely used laboratory test for the diagnosis of leptospirosis, its reliance on live cultures, subjective interpretation of results and an inability to differentiate between antibody classes, suggest MAT is no longer the best method for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. The results presented in this paper show that MIA was able to determine reactive from non-reactive samples when compared with MAT, and was able to differentiate IgG and IgM classes of antibody. The results suggest increased sensitivity in MIA and the ability to multiplex up to 500 antigens at one time allows for significant improvements in cost-effectiveness as well as a reduced dependency on live cultures. The relatively low cost, high throughput platform and differentiation of antibody class, as shown in previous research, make this assay worthy of consideration for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in small-scale or large-scale bovine populations.","['Wynwood SJ', 'Burns MA', 'Graham GC', 'Weier SL', 'McKay DB', 'Craig SB']",2016,3,1,Vet Rec Open,"Wynwood SJ, et al.

26833181,Whole genome sequencing revealed host adaptation-focused genomic plasticity of pathogenic Leptospira.,"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., has recently been recognized as an emerging infectious disease worldwide. Despite its severity and global importance, knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis and virulence evolution of Leptospira spp. remains limited. Here we sequenced and analyzed 102 isolates representing global sources. A high genomic variability were observed among different Leptospira species, which was attributed to massive gene gain and loss events allowing for adaptation to specific niche conditions and changing host environments. Horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication allowed the stepwise acquisition of virulence factors in pathogenic Leptospira evolved from a recent common ancestor. More importantly, the abundant expansion of specific virulence-related protein families, such as metalloproteases-associated paralogs, were exclusively identified in pathogenic species, reflecting the importance of these protein families in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. Our observations also indicated that positive selection played a crucial role on this bacteria adaptation to hosts. These novel findings may lead to greater understanding of the global diversity and virulence evolution of Leptospira spp.","['Xu Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Chang YF', 'Zhang Y', 'Jiang X', 'Zhuang X', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhang J', 'Zeng L', 'Yang M', 'Li S', 'Wang S', 'Ye Q', 'Xin X', 'Zhao G', 'Zheng H', 'Guo X', 'Wang J']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Xu Y, et al.

26822552,Plasmin cleaves fibrinogen and the human complement proteins C3b and C5 in the presence of Leptospira interrogans proteins: A new role of LigA and LigB in invasion and complement immune evasion.,"Plasminogen is a single-chain glycoprotein found in human plasma as the inactive precursor of plasmin. When converted to proteolytically active plasmin, plasmin(ogen) regulates both complement and coagulation cascades, thus representing an important target for pathogenic microorganisms. Leptospira interrogans binds plasminogen, which is converted to active plasmin. Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins are surface exposed molecules that interact with extracellular matrix components and complement regulators, including proteins of the FH family and C4BP. In this work, we demonstrate that these multifunctional molecules also bind plasminogen through both N- and C-terminal domains. These interactions are dependent on lysine residues and are affected by ionic strength. Competition assays suggest that plasminogen does not share binding sites with C4BP or FH on Lig proteins at physiological molar ratios. Plasminogen bound to Lig proteins is converted to proteolytic active plasmin in the presence of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Lig-bound plasmin is able to cleave the physiological substrates fibrinogen and the complement proteins C3b and C5. Taken together, our data point to a new role of LigA and LigB in leptospiral invasion and complement immune evasion. Plasmin(ogen) acquisition by these versatile proteins may contribute to Leptospira infection, favoring bacterial survival and dissemination inside the host.","['Castiblanco-Valencia MM', 'Fraga TR', 'Pagotto AH', 'Serrano SM', 'Abreu PA', 'Barbosa AS', 'Isaac L']",2016,221,5,Immunobiology,"Castiblanco-Valencia MM, et al.

26819575,Anti-leptospirosis agglutinins in Brazilian capybaras (hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).,"BACKGROUND: The interest in commercial use of wild animals is increasing, especially regarding raising of capybaras. Although this wild species is potentially lucrative for the production of meat, oil and leather, it is suggested as a probable reservoir of leptospires.
METHODS: Due to the economic importance of this species and the lack of studies concerning leptospirosis, the presence of anti-leptospirosis agglutinins was assayed in 55 serum samples of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) from commercial and experimental breeding flocks located in São Paulo state, Paraná state, and Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Samples were obtained through cephalic or femoral venipunction (5 to 10 mL). Microscopic agglutination test was used according to the Brazilian Health Ministry considering as cut-off titer of 100.
RESULTS: Out of the 55 samples analyzed, 23 (41.82 %) tested positive. The most prevalent serovar was Icterohaemorrhagiae (56.52 %) in 13 samples, followed by Copenhageni in nine samples (39.13 %), Pomona in four samples (17.39 %), Djasiman and Castellonis in three samples each (13.04 %), Grippotyphosa, Hardjo, Canicola, and Cynopteri in two samples each (8.7 %), and Andamana and Bratislava in one sample each (4.34 %).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the evidence of exposure to Leptospira spp. and the need of new studies to evaluate a higher number of capybaras from different regions to better understand the importance of leptospirosis infection in these animals and verify the zoonotic role of this species as a possible source of infection to humans and other animals.","['Langoni H', 'Kuribara IY', 'Ferreira Lopes Correa AP', 'Ullmann LS', 'Sánchez GP', 'Lucheis SB']",2016,22,,J Venom Anim Toxins Incl Trop Dis,"Langoni H, et al.

OBJECTIVE: In the present study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed to detect L. interrogans using lipL32 as a gene target.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Four specific primers were designed based on the conserved region of lipL32 gene of various serovars ofpathogenic leptospires. LAMP reaction was performed at 65 °C for 1 hour The LAMP products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis andfluorescence dye.
RESULTS: The lipL32 LAMP assay showed highly specificity to the reference stains of L. interrogans serovar Autumnalis, Bataviae, Javanica, Pyrogenes, Icterohaemorrhagiae, and Saigon. No product was produced from non-pathogenic leptospire (L. biflexa), human, or Escherichia coli. The lower limit of detection analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis andfluorescence dye visualization was 0.02 pg/µl which equivalent to 4 genomic equivalents/reaction. Moreover the clinical strain of leptospires including pathogenic and intermediate group of L. interrogans were detected by lipL32 LAMP CONCLUSION: The developed lipL32 LAMP is high specificity and sensitivity that can be applied to detect pathogenic leptospires in clinical samples.","['Seesom W', 'Thongket P', 'Rattanathanawan K', 'Mekseepralard C', 'Sukhumsirichart W']",2015,98 Suppl 9,,J Med Assoc Thai,"Seesom W, et al.

26809943,Circulating serovars of Leptospira in cart horses of central and southern Ethiopia and associated risk factors.,"Little work has been done on diseases of horses in Ethiopia or tropical regions of the world. Yet, Ethiopia has the largest horse population in Africa and their horses play a pivotal role in their economy as traction animals. A serological and questionnaire survey was therefore conducted to determine the circulating serovars of Leptospira and their association with potential risk factors in the cart horse population of Central and Southern Ethiopia. A total of 184 out of 418 cart horses from 13 districts had antibody titres of 1:100 or greater to at least one of 16 serovars of Leptospira species in Central and Southern Ethiopian horses. A significantly higher seropositivity (62.1%) was noted in horses from the highland agroecology followed by midland (44.4%) and lowland (39.8%). Serovar Bratislava (34.5%) was the predominant serovar followed by serovars Djasiman (9.8%), Topaz (5.98%) and Pomona (5.3%). Age and location proved to be associated with seropositive horses with older horses being more commonly affected and the districts of Ziway (Batu) (Apparent Prevalence (AP)=65.5%), Shashemene (AP=48.3%) and Sebeta (AP=41.4%) having the highest prevalence. Multivariable logistic regression found risk factors significantly associated with Leptospira seropositive horses were drinking river water (OR=2.8) and horses 7-12 years old (OR=5) and risk factors specifically associated with serovar Bratislava seropositive horses were drinking river water (OR=2.5), horses ≥13 years (OR=3.5) and the presence of dogs in adjacent neighbouring properties (OR=0.3). Dogs had a protective effect against seropositivity to serovars Bratislava and Djasiman, which may be due to their ability to control rodents. The high seroprevalence confirm that leptospirosis is endemic among horses of Central and Southern Ethiopia. The predominance of serovar Bratislava supports the idea that serovar Bratislava may be adapted to and maintained by the horse population of Central and Southern Ethiopia. This study emphasizes the need for further countrywide serological surveys and isolation of circulating leptospires in animals and humans in order to understand the role of horses in the epidemiology of this disease.","['Tsegay K', 'Potts AD', 'Aklilu N', 'Lötter C', 'Gummow B']",2016,125,,Prev Vet Med,"Tsegay K, et al.

The seasonal outbreak of pyrexia is common in Arunachal Pradesh (AP); many times the disease remains undiagnosed.
OBJECTIVE: An outbreak of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) occurred in Longding district of Arunachal Pradesh in 2013, with 108 deaths, which was investigated to elucidate the cause of illness.
METHODOLOGY: Blood samples from the affected region with acute pyrexia were collected, and screened for the malaria parasite, scrub typhus IgM and leptospira IgM.
RESULTS: Scrub typhus IgM was reactive in 97% (30/31), and 25% (8/31) cases were co-infected with leptospira. Incidentally, scrub typhus reactive (67%) and leptospira co-infection (62.7%) were higher in females. Record of previous 3 years (2011-2013) from Longding, Community Health Centre showed an increase in indoor pyrexia cases by 2-fold or more during October and November.

Histopathological analysis showed that both isolates caused severe tissue damage when used to infect hamsters. While L. kirschneri serogroup Pomona serovar Mozdok is endemic in animals in Europe, there is only one report of human leptospirosis in the literature. Although strains belonging to L. kirschneri serogroup Pomona have been identified in cases of human leptospirosis in Europe, serovar Mozdok has not yet been implicated. The 4-year interval between isolations and the fact that this is the first report of serovar Mozdok as the causative agent of human leptospirosis in the southern hemisphere, demonstrates its epidemiological importance to public health. Moreover, the presence of serovar Mozdok in Brazil has the potential to affect vaccine and diagnostic test development.","['da Cunha CE', 'Felix SR', 'Neto AC', 'Campello-Felix A', 'Kremer FS', 'Monte LG', 'Amaral MG', 'de Oliveira Nobre M', 'da Silva ÉF', 'Hartleben CP', 'McBride AJ', 'Dellagostin OA']",2016,94,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"da Cunha CE, et al.

Rodent control is a frequent strategy in those settings to prevent the disease but rapid growth from residual populations and immigration limit the long-term effectiveness of interventions. To characterize the breeding ecology of R. norvegicus and provide needed information for the level of genetic mixing, which can help identify inter-connected eradication units, we estimated the occurrence of multiple paternity, distances between mothers and sires, and inbreeding in rats from urban slum habitat in Salvador, Brazil. We genotyped 9 pregnant females, their 66 offspring, and 371 males at 16 microsatellite loci. Multiple paternity was observed in 22% (2/9) of the study litters. Of the 12 sires that contributed to the 9 litters, we identified 5 (42%) of those sires among our genotyped males. Related males were captured in close proximity to pregnant females (the mean inter-parent trapping distance per litter was 70 m, ±58 m SD). Levels of relatedness between mother-sire pairs were higher than expected and significantly higher than relatedness between all females and non-sire males. Our findings indicate multiple paternity is common, inbreeding is apparent, and that mother-sire dyads occur in close proximity within the study area. This information is relevant to improve the spatial definition of the eradication units that may enhance the effectiveness of rodent management programs aimed at preventing human leptospirosis. High levels of inbreeding may also be a sign that eradication efforts are successful.","['Costa F', 'Richardson JL', 'Dion K', 'Mariani C', 'Pertile AC', 'Burak MK', 'Childs JE', 'Ko AI', 'Caccone A']",2016,107,2,J Hered,"Costa F, et al.

26732289,Ocular and cutaneous manifestation of leptospirosis acquired in Albania: A retrospective analysis with implications for travel medicine.,"UNLABELLED: Albania is an attractive tourism destination with an increasing volume of travel. As a Mediterranean country some tropical infectious diseases are present in certain areas of Albania, including leptospirosis, which is a zoonotic infectious disease prevalent around the world. The goal of this retrospective study is to describe the ocular and cutaneous manifestations of leptospirosis in Albanian patients and raise awareness to travelers travelling in and out of the country.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 107 cases of leptospirosis, treated at ""Mother Teresa"" University Hospital Center, in Tirana, Albania between January 2009 and December 2014. All cases included in the analysis had a clinical and epidemiological presentation suggestive of leptospirosis, confirmed with ELISA (enzyme linked immunoassay) positive for IgM antibodies against Leptospira.
RESULTS: There were 89.7% males (n = 96) and 10.2% females (n = 11). Mean age at the time of diagnoses was 43.7 ± 17.8 years old (range 17-78). All patients were native and residents of Albania. Conjunctival suffusion was present in 81.3% of the cases, whereas subconjunctival hemorrhage was seen in 12 patients (11.2%). Uveitis was seen in 38.3% of the cases and all patients with uveitis presented a severe systemic disease. A cutaneous rash was present in 58.8% of patients. Other cutaneous manifestations include jaundice in 62.6% and intense pruritus in 5.6% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Ocular and cutaneous involvement happens more frequently in patients with Leptospirosis, than it was thought to be. Therefore the clinician should be more careful in his systemic evaluation of the disease.","['Puca E', 'Pilaca A', 'Kalo T', 'Pipero P', 'Bino S', 'Hysenaj Z', 'Abazaj E', 'Gega A', 'Petrela E', 'Kraja D']",2016,14,2,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Puca E, et al.

26727033,Leptospira spp.: Novel insights into host-pathogen interactions.,"Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. It is an important infectious disease that affects humans and animals. The disease causes economic losses as it affects livestock, with decreased milk production and death. Our group is investigating the genome sequences of L. interrogans targeting surface-exposed proteins because, due to their location, these proteins are capable to interact with several host components that could allow establishment of the infection. These interactions may involve adhesion of the bacteria to extracellular matrix (ECM) components and, hence, help bacterial colonization. The bacteria could also react with the host fibrinolytic system and/or with the coagulation cascade components, such as, plasminogen (PLG) and fibrinogen (Fg), respectively. The binding with the first system generates plasmin (PLA), increasing the proteolytic power of the bacteria, while the second interferes with clotting in a thrombin-catalyzed reaction, which may promote hemorrhage foci and increase bacterial dissemination. Interaction with the complement system negative regulators may help bacteria to evade the host immune system, facilitating the invasion. This work compiles the main described leptospiral proteins that could act as adhesins, as PLG and fibrinogen receptors and as complement regulator binding proteins. We present models in which we suggest possible mechanisms of how leptospires might colonize and invade host tissues, causing the disease. Understanding leptospiral pathogenesis will help to identify antigen candidates that would contribute to the development of more effective vaccines and diagnostic tests.","['Fernandes LG', 'Siqueira GH', 'Teixeira AR', 'Silva LP', 'Figueredo JM', 'Cosate MR', 'Vieira ML', 'Nascimento AL']",2016,176,,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,"Fernandes LG, et al.

The majority of cases were in children from urban areas (57/74; 77%), between 10 and 14 years of age (33/74; 44.5%). The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) revealed that the most frequent serogroups were Grippotyphosa and Bratislava, which are associated with wildlife and livestock reservoirs, respectively. There was a association between the presence of household pets and the severity of the disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98-7.60; p=0.05). The risk of severe childhood leptospirosis is linked to having household pets.","['Pérez-García J', 'Arboleda M', 'Agudelo-Flórez P']",2016,33,4,Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,"Pérez-García J, et al.

26714322,Isolation of a Seawater Tolerant Leptospira spp. from a Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis).,"Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world. It is caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira spp. and is maintained in nature through chronic renal infection of carrier animals. Rodents and other small mammals are the main reservoirs. Information on leptospirosis in marine mammals is scarce; however, cases of leptospirosis have been documented in pinniped populations from the Pacific coast of North America from southern California to British Columbia. We report the isolation of a Leptospira spp. strain, here named Manara, from a kidney sample obtained from a Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) calf, which stranded dead in Playa Manara, Península Valdés, Argentina. This strain showed motility and morphology typical of the genus Leptospira spp. under dark-field microscopy; and grew in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium and Fletcher medium after 90 days of incubation at 28°C. Considering the source of this bacterium, we tested its ability to grow in Fletcher medium diluted with seawater at different percentages (1%, 3%, 5%, 7% and 10% v/v). Bacterial growth was detected 48 h after inoculation of Fletcher medium supplemented with 5% sea water, demonstrating the halophilic nature of the strain Manara. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences placed this novel strain within the radiation of the pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira spp., with sequence similarities within the range 97-100%, and closely related to L. interrogans. Two different PCR protocols targeting genus-specific pathogenic genes (G1-G2, B64I-B64II and LigB) gave positive results, which indicates that the strain Manara is likely pathogenic. Further studies are needed to confirm this possibility as well as determine its serogroup. These results could modify our understanding of the epidemiology of this zoonosis. Until now, the resistance and ability to grow in seawater for long periods of time had been proven for the strain Muggia of L. biflexa, a saprophytic species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first isolation of a Leptospira sp. from cetaceans. Our phenotypic data indicate that strain Manara represents a novel species of the genus Leptospira, for which the name Leptospira brihuegai sp. nov. is proposed.","['Grune Loffler S', 'Rago V', 'Martínez M', 'Uhart M', 'Florin-Christensen M', 'Romero G', 'Brihuega B']",2015,10,12,PLoS One,"Grune Loffler S, et al.

26711524,Whole Genome Shotgun Sequencing Shows Selection on Leptospira Regulatory Proteins During in vitro Culture Attenuation.,"Leptospirosis is the most common zoonotic disease worldwide with an estimated 500,000 severe cases reported annually, and case fatality rates of 12-25%, due primarily to acute kidney and lung injuries. Despite its prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying leptospirosis pathogenesis remain poorly understood. To identify virulence-related genes in Leptospira interrogans, we delineated cumulative genome changes that occurred during serial in vitro passage of a highly virulent strain of L. interrogans serovar Lai into a nearly avirulent isogenic derivative. Comparison of protein coding and computationally predicted noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes between these two polyclonal strains identified 15 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (nsSNV) alleles that increased in frequency and 19 that decreased, whereas no changes in allelic frequency were observed among the ncRNA genes. Some of the nsSNV alleles were in six genes shown previously to be transcriptionally upregulated during exposure to in vivo-like conditions. Five of these nsSNVs were in evolutionarily conserved positions in genes related to signal transduction and metabolism. Frequency changes of minor nsSNV alleles identified in this study likely contributed to the loss of virulence during serial in vitro culture. The identification of new virulence-associated genes should spur additional experimental inquiry into their potential role in Leptospira pathogenesis.","['Lehmann JS', 'Corey VC', 'Ricaldi JN', 'Vinetz JM', 'Winzeler EA', 'Matthias MA']",2016,94,2,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Lehmann JS, et al.

26701861,Pre-travel health advice guidelines for humanitarian workers: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: In the last decades, there have been several natural disasters and global catastrophies with a steady increase in humanitarian relief work. This has resulted in increased research in the field of humanitarian aid, however the focus is mostly on the victims of the disasters and not on the individuals and organisations providing aid.
OBJECTIVES: The intent of this research is to review the information available on pre-deployment interventions and recommendations such as vaccinations and other health preserving measures in volunteers and professionals deploying abroad in humanitarian relief missions.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of papers written in English, French, Italian or German. We searched the following databases: Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and also hand searched reference lists. The cut-off date for the publication search was November 20th, 2014. In addition to the literature search we also sent a questionnaire to 30 organisations to detail their approach to preparing relief workers.
RESULTS: We identified 163 papers of possible relevance and finally included 35 papers in the systematic review. Six organisations provided information on pre-deployment preparation of aid workers. Identified papers show that pre-deployment physical and mental fitness are paramount for success in humanitarian missions. However, in many settings, pre-travel medical and psychological assessments and/or training/education sessions are not mandatory. We identified high-risk hazards for aid workers (often location specific), these included: travellers׳ diarrhoea, vector-borne infections, accidents, violence, tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis A, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, seasonal and H1N1 influenza.
CONCLUSIONS: The medical evaluation can identify problems or risk factors, such as psychological frailty, that can be exacerbated by the stressful settings of humanitarian missions. In this pre-travel setting, the status of routine vaccinations can be controlled and completed, medication dispensed and targeted preventive advice provided. A mission specific first-aid kit can be recommended. There is a lack of evidence-based literature on the theme of pre-travel advice guidelines for humanitarian workers. We propose a shared database of literature on this topic as a resource and suggest that some standardization of guidelines would be useful for future planning.","['Costa M', 'Oberholzer-Riss M', 'Hatz C', 'Steffen R', 'Puhan M', 'Schlagenhauf P']",2015,13,6,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Costa M, et al.

26690093,Characteristics of leptospirosis with systemic inflammatory response syndrome: a multicenter study.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic infection in the world. In patients with leptospirosis, in case of presence of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), clinical and laboratory findings can be mistaken for sepsis due to other causes of infection. The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with leptospirosis in terms of the presence of SIRS and to examine the association of these with mortality.
METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients were included in the study. The patients were classified according to the presence or absence of SIRS and divided into SIRS (+) and SIRS (-). Patient files were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical features and laboratory data were compared, and risk factors associated with mortality were determined.
RESULTS: SIRS (+) was found in 70 % (n = 110) of patients who had signs on admission. Comparison of the clinical symptoms and findings of organ systems in the SIRS (+) and SIRS (-) showed that abdominal pain and vomiting were significantly more common in the SIRS (+) than in the SIRS (-) (p = 0.025 and p = 0.046, respectively). BUN and serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in the SIRS (+) than in the SIRS (-) (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively). In follow-up posterior-anterior chest radiography, pathological findings improved in 58.8 % (n = 40) of patients in the SIRS (+) and 27.3 % (n = 9) of patients in the SIRS (-) (p = 0.003). The mortality rate of the SIRS (+) and SIRS (-) was not significantly different (p = 0.868).
CONCLUSION: In patients with positive SIRS findings, while examining the etiology of sepsis, leptospirosis should come to mind especially in endemic areas for differential diagnosis. Early initiation of antibiotic and supportive therapy can be lifesaving in these patients.","['Yilmaz H', 'Turhan V', 'Yasar KK', 'Hatipoglu M', 'Sunbul M', 'Leblebicioglu H']",2015,14,,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,"Yilmaz H, et al.

26687262,Suspected leptospiral meningitis in adults: report of four cases and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease characterised by headache and fever. These symptoms are often suggestive of meningitis, but only a proportion of patients have leptospiral meningitis.
METHODS: We report episodes of leptospiral meningitis in patients admitted to a tertiary referral centre in the Netherlands, in whom lumbar puncture was performed, and conducted a literature search of adult cases of leptospiral meningitis to describe clinical characteristics and outcome.
RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2014, 19 patients with leptospirosis were identified. Seven underwent a lumbar puncture for suspected meningitis (37%), of which six had been in contact with fresh water in a tropical area. Four patients with suspected meningitis (57%) had cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis indicative of leptospiral meningitis and presented with headache, fever and neck stiffness. In a review of the literature we identified 366 patients with leptospiral meningitis with a median age of 33 years (range 17-77). Risk factors for leptospirosis were identified in 32 of 33 patients. Typical cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities consisted of a mildly elevated leukocyte count (median 206 leukocytes/mm3, range 6-2072) with a lymphocytic predominance (median 95%). Outcome was generally favourable, with a mortality rate of 3% and neurological sequelae in 5% of the survivors.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis in the Netherlands has a low incidence. In the case of suspected meningitis and a history of visiting tropical areas or direct or indirect contact with animal urine, leptospiral meningitis should be considered. Cerebrospinal fluid examination is vital for the differential diagnosis of leptospirosis. Outcome is generally favourable in patients with leptospiral meningitis treated with antibiotics.","['van Samkar A', 'van de Beek D', 'Stijnis C', 'Goris M', 'Brouwer MC']",2015,73,10,Neth J Med,"van Samkar A, et al.

It finds increasing application in the study of environmentally modulated neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Obtaining and assuring the quality of the relevant spatially and temporally indexed EO data remain challenges. Our objective was to review the Earth observation products currently used in studies of NTD epidemiology and to discuss fundamental issues relating to spatial data quality (SDQ), which limit the utilization of EO and pose challenges for its more effective use. We searched Web of Science and PubMed for studies related to EO and echinococossis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminth infections. Relevant literature was also identified from the bibliographies of those papers. We found that extensive use is made of EO products in the study of NTD epidemiology; however, the quality of these products is usually given little explicit attention. We review key issues in SDQ concerning spatial and temporal scale, uncertainty, and the documentation and use of quality information. We give examples of how these issues may interact with uncertainty in NTD data to affect the output of an epidemiological analysis. We conclude that researchers should give careful attention to SDQ when designing NTD spatial-epidemiological studies. This should be used to inform uncertainty analysis in the epidemiological study. SDQ should be documented and made available to other researchers.","['Hamm NA', 'Soares Magalhães RJ', 'Clements AC']",2015,9,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Hamm NA, et al.

26676320,DNA prime-protein boost based vaccination with a conserved region of leptospiral immunoglobulin-like A and B proteins enhances protection against leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the Leptospira genus. Vaccination with bacterins has severe limitations. Here, we evaluated the N-terminal region of the leptospiral immunoglobulin-like B protein (LigBrep) as a vaccine candidate against leptospirosis using immunisation strategies based on DNA prime-protein boost, DNA vaccine, and subunit vaccine. Upon challenge with a virulent strain ofLeptospira interrogans, the prime-boost and DNA vaccine approaches induced significant protection in hamsters, as well as a specific IgG antibody response and sterilising immunity. Although vaccination with recombinant fragment of LigBrep also produced a strong antibody response, it was not immunoprotective. These results highlight the potential of LigBrep as a candidate antigen for an effective vaccine against leptospirosis and emphasise the use of the DNA prime-protein boost as an important strategy for vaccine development.","['Forster KM', 'Hartwig DD', 'Oliveira TL', 'Bacelo KL', 'Schuch R', 'Amaral MG', 'Dellagostin OA']",2015,110,8,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,"Forster KM, et al.

26671764,Multiple specificities of immunoglobulin M in equine fetuses infected with Leptospira interrogans indicate a competent immune response.,"REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Foals of mares infected with Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona type kennewicki (Lk) may be aborted/stillborn or delivered as healthy foals. Is fetal survival explained in part by the immune response of the fetus to Leptospira antigens?
OBJECTIVES: To describe an outbreak of Leptospira abortion in which infected mares delivered dead/sick or normal foals and determine specificities of antibody in a collection of 54 fetuses from similar outbreaks.
STUDY DESIGN: Outbreak investigation in combination with a case-control study of a larger set of samples from aborted fetuses.
METHODS: Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on urine and amniotic fluids were used to diagnose infection during an outbreak of Leptospira abortion. Specificities of immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgGa and IgGb for recombinant proteins of Lk in archived fluids of fetuses from similar outbreaks were compared by ELISA with those of fluids of fetuses not infected with Leptospira spp.
RESULTS: Five fetuses of 11 infected mares in an outbreak survived in utero in the presence of persistent placental infection and were healthy at foaling. Fetuses of 6 mares in the outbreak were aborted or died soon after birth. Significantly greater (P<0.05) IgM reactivity with all recombinant proteins and with Lk sonicate was observed in 54 archived fluids from Leptospira infected fetuses than in fluids of 30 of non-Leptospira infected fetuses. Low levels of IgGa and IgGb specific for LipL32 and Lk sonicate and traces of LigA and Hsp15 specific IgGa were detected in a minority of archived fluids from Leptospira infected fetuses.
CONCLUSION: Although mainly mediated by IgM, a high level of immune competence in aborted fetuses was evidenced by the multiplicity of Leptospira proteins targeted. This is likely to contribute to survival of foals in mares with evidence of placental infection at foaling as detailed in a typical outbreak.","['Velineni S', 'Timoney JF', 'Artiushin SC', 'Donahue JM', 'Steinman M']",2016,48,6,Equine Vet J,"Velineni S, et al.

26667541,SEROLOGIC SURVEY AND RESULTS OF URINARY PCR TESTING FOR LEPTOSPIROSIS IN CAPTIVE BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOGS (CYNOMYS LUDOVICIANUS).,"Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease occurring clinically and subclinically in humans and a wide variety of mammal species worldwide. Often, rodents and wild animals are identified as important reservoirs for the disease. Twenty-two captive black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) housed within a zoo were examined as part of a routine census and preventive medicine program. During examinations, blood and urine were collected to screen for exposure to, or infection with, leptospirosis. All animals were apparently healthy at the time of examination. Leptospira microscopic agglutination test identified 12 of 22 (54.5%) prairie dogs with antibody titers ≥1 : 100 against Leptospira interrogans serovar bratislava on initial serologic examination. All prairie dogs within this collection were serologically negative for L. interrogans serovars canicola, hardjo, icterohaemorrhagiae, and pomona and Leptospira kirschneri serovar grippotyphosa. Leptospira polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of urine was negative in all animals tested. This report describes evidence that captive prairie dogs may be exposed to leptospirosis, most likely from wild rodent reservoirs; however, serum titers are low, and lack of leptospiral DNA detected by PCR indicates that these captive animals are unlikely to be important reservoirs for the disease.","['Olds JE', 'Sun Y', 'Baum DH', 'Gauger P']",2015,46,4,J Zoo Wildl Med,"Olds JE, et al.

26643849,Molecular detection of pathogenic leptospiral protein encoding gene (lipL32) in environmental aquatic biofilms.,"UNLABELLED: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease often encountered during post-monsoon season due to exposure with contaminated water. Leptospires have long been regarded as solitary organisms that persist in soil and aquatic environments. Here, the presence of leptospires in the aquatic biofilm exposed in the paddy field, sewers and stagnant rain water was demonstrated. Biofilm samples from paddy field water, submerged paddy leaves, sewers and stagnant rain waters from urban and rural areas were collected. Total genomic DNA was extracted and pathogenic leptospiral specific gene amplification was carried out to determine the spatial distribution of the bacteria. The degree of pathogenic Leptospira in biofilms from paddy field surface water, submerged leaf, were 33·3% and 27·2% respectively, whereas in rural and urban area, the sampling sites such as stagnant rain water, domestic sewer and collective sewers showed 11·1%, 13% and 16·6% with leptospires respectively. Higher proportion of pathogenic Leptospira in aquatic ecosystems, such as paddy field, could be one of the main factors for the occurrence of disease, more among the agricultural workers. This study would help to identify various survival strategies of leptospires in the environment and thus disease transmission.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Little is known regarding the mechanisms by which pathogenic leptospires persist in aqueous environment, outside the mammalian host. In this view this is the first report of the distribution of Leptospira in environmental biofilm such as sewers and paddy leaf surfaces. This ability of pathogenic Leptospira to survive in aquatic ecosystems especially in biofilms could be one of the main factors which facilitate its survival in the environment, and thus disease transmission among the risk groups, such as sewage and agriculture worker. This study will encourage researchers in the field to consider biofilm as an important factor, when detecting leptospires in environment.","['Vinod Kumar K', 'Lall C', 'Vimal Raj R', 'Vedhagiri K', 'Vijayachari P']",2016,62,4,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Vinod Kumar K, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency and socio-demographic characteristics associated with leptospirosis in febrile patients in northern Perú.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from January to December 2014 in 143 fever cases admitted to the Hospital Regional Lambayeque, Perú. Structured for socio-demographic information and sanitation questionnaire was used. Serum samples were examined to quantitatively determine the presence of IgM antibodies to leptospira using ELISA IgM.
RESULTS: The frequency was 26.6% (95% CI 19.3 to 33.8) and independently associated features were: be between 20-54 years (OR: 3.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 9, 64), work in agriculture-livestock (OR: 6.15, 95% CI 1.99 to 19.05),contact with animals (OR: 4,13, IC 95%: 1,76-9,65) and consumption of unsafe water(OR: 3,33, IC 95%: 1,49-7,43).

26629810,Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in Leptospirosis Acute Kidney Injury: A Multicenter Study in Thailand.,"AKI is one of the most serious complications of leptospirosis, an important zoonosis in the tropics. Recently, NGAL, one of the novel AKI biomarkers, is extensively studied in various specific settings such as sepsis, cardiac surgery, and radiocontrast nephropathy. In this multicenter study, we aimed to study the role of NGAL as an early marker and an outcome predictor of leptospirosis associated AKI. Patients who presented with clinical suspiciousness of leptospirosis were prospectively enrolled in 9 centers from August 2012 to November 2014. The first day of enrollment was the first day of clinical suspicious leptospirosis. Blood and urine samples were serially collected on the first three days and day 7 after enrollment. We used three standard techniques (microscopic agglutination test, direct culture, and PCR technique) to confirm the diagnosis of leptospirosis. KDIGO criteria were used for AKI diagnosis. Recovery was defined as alive and not requiring dialysis during hospitalization or maintaining maximum KDIGO stage at hospital discharge. Of the 221 recruited cases, 113 cases were leptospirosis confirmed cases. Thirty seven percent developed AKI. Median uNGAL and pNGAL levels in those developing AKI were significantly higher than in patients not developing AKI [253.8 (631.4) vs 24.1 (49.6) ng/ml, p < 0.001] and [1,030 (802.5) vs 192.0 (209.0) ng/ml, p < 0.001], respectively. uNGAL and pNGAL levels associated with AKI had AUC-ROC of 0.91, and 0.92, respectively. Both of urine NGAL and pNGAL level between AKI-recovery group and AKI-non recovery were comparable. From this multicenter study, uNGAL and pNGAL provided the promising result to be a marker for leptospirosis associated AKI. However, both of them did not show the potential role to be the predictor of renal recovery in this specific setting.","['Srisawat N', 'Praditpornsilpa K', 'Patarakul K', 'Techapornrung M', 'Daraswang T', 'Sukmark T', 'Khositrangsikun K', 'Fakthongyoo A', 'Oranrigsupak P', 'Praderm L', 'Suwattanasilpa U', 'Peerapornratana S', 'Loahaveeravat P', 'Suwachittanont N', 'Wirotwan TO', 'Phonork C', 'Kumpunya S', 'Tiranathanagul K', 'Chirathaworn C', 'Eiam-ong S', 'Tungsanga K', 'Sitprija V', 'Kellum JA', 'Townamchai N', 'Thai Lepto-AKI study group']",2015,10,12,PLoS One,"Srisawat N, et al.

26626338,Cytokines in human leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with increased public health concern. Cytokines produced in response to the infection with pathogenic leptospires have been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim of the study was to measure and evaluate the levels of 27 cytokines in patients with acute leptospirosis.
METHODS: The levels of 27 cytokines were measured from 42 acute leptospirosis cases; 47 samples were obtained from severe cases. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS.
RESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, and VEGF levels differed significantly between the severe cases and the control group, while GM-CSF levels differed significantly between the mild cases and the control group (p<0.05). IL-6, IP-10 and MCP-1 were elevated in most cases. IP-10 was significantly higher in severe than in non-severe cases (p<0.05). The high IP-10 levels suggest a cellular immune response, despite the fact that leptospires are not intracellular organisms. IL-1ra, MCP-1, MIP-1b and TNF-α peaked 1-5 days post onset of illness (p.o.i.), IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, GM-CSF, IP-10 and MIP-1a peaked 6-10 days p.o.i., while VEGF peaked later (11-15 days p.o.i.). TNF-α was significantly lower in the severe cases with pulmonary involvement (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Having a better insight into the host immune response in leptospirosis could be the basis for immunotherapeutic targets, especially for the severe cases in which antibiotic treatment is not enough.","['Papa A', 'Kotrotsiou T']",2015,109,12,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Papa A and Kotrotsiou T.

26624890,Leptospira Serovars for Diagnosis of Leptospirosis in Humans and Animals in Africa: Common Leptospira Isolates and Reservoir Hosts.,"The burden of leptospirosis in humans and animals in Africa is higher than that reported from other parts of the world. However, the disease is not routinely diagnosed in the continent. One of major factors limiting diagnosis is the poor availability of live isolates of locally circulating Leptospira serovars for inclusion in the antigen panel of the gold standard microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for detecting antibodies against leptospirosis. To gain insight in Leptospira serovars and their natural hosts occurring in Tanzania, concomitantly enabling the improvement of the MAT by inclusion of fresh local isolates, a total of 52 Leptospira isolates were obtained from fresh urine and kidney homogenates, collected between 1996 and 2006 from small mammals, cattle and pigs. Isolates were identified by serogrouping, cross agglutination absorption test (CAAT), and molecular typing. Common Leptospira serovars with their respective animal hosts were: Sokoine (cattle and rodents); Kenya (rodents and shrews); Mwogolo (rodents); Lora (rodents); Qunjian (rodent); serogroup Grippotyphosa (cattle); and an unknown serogroup from pigs. Inclusion of local serovars particularly serovar Sokoine in MAT revealed a 10-fold increase in leptospirosis prevalence in Tanzania from 1.9% to 16.9% in rodents and 0.26% to 10.75% in humans. This indicates that local serovars are useful for diagnosis of human and animal leptospirosis in Tanzania and other African countries.","['Mgode GF', ""Machang'u RS"", 'Mhamphi GG', 'Katakweba A', 'Mulungu LS', 'Durnez L', 'Leirs H', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Belmain SR']",2015,9,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Mgode GF, et al.

Here, we attempt to overview the evolution of human prevalence during the past decade and identify the environmental factors that correlate with the incidence of leptospirosis and the clinical incidence in humans. We used an extensive survey of Leptospira infection in rodents conducted in 2008 and 2009 and the human incidence of the disease from 2003 to 2012 in 168 villages of two districts of Nan province in Northern Thailand. Using an ad-hoc developed land-use cover implemented in a geographical information system we showed that humans and rodents were not infected in the same environment/habitat in the land-use cover. High village prevalence was observed in open habitat near rivers for the whole decade, or in 2008-2009 mostly in rice fields prone to flooding, whereas infected rodents (2008-2009) were observed in patchy habitat with high forest cover, mostly situated on sloping ground areas. We also investigated the potential effects of public health campaigns conducted after the dramatic flood event of 2006. We showed that, before 2006, human incidence in villages was explained by the population size of the village according to the environmental source of infection of this disease, while as a result of the campaigns, human incidence in villages after 2006 appeared independent of their population size. This study confirms the role of the environment and particularly land use, in the transmission of bacteria, emphasized by the effects of the provincial public health campaigns on the epidemiological pattern of incidence, and questions the role of rodents as reservoirs.","['Della Rossa P', 'Tantrakarnapa K', 'Sutdan D', 'Kasetsinsombat K', 'Cosson JF', 'Supputamongkol Y', 'Chaisiri K', 'Tran A', 'Supputamongkol S', 'Binot A', 'Lajaunie C', 'Morand S']",2016,144,7,Epidemiol Infect,"Della Rossa P, et al.

Here, to identify appropriate diagnostic antigens for serodiagnosis of syphilis, 6 recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, including flagellins (FlaB1 [Tp0868], FlaB2 [Tp0792], and FlaB3 [Tp0870]), Tp0463, Tp0751, and Tp1038. The sensitivities were determined by screening sera from individuals with primary (n=82), secondary (n=115), latent (n=105), and congenital (n=65) syphilis. The specificities were determined by screening sera from uninfected controls (n=30) and potentially cross-reactive infections including Lyme disease (n=30), leptospirosis (n=5), and hepatitis B (n=30). Our data showed that FlaB1, FlaB2, FlaB3, Tp0463, and Tp1038 exhibited higher overall sensitivities and specificities for detecting IgG antibody, with 95.4% and 98.9%, 92.6% and 95.8%, 95.1% and 95.8%, 92.6% and 97.9%, and 95.9% and 98.9%, respectively.

Timely diagnosis of locally distributed serovars of high virulence is crucial for successful care and outbreak management. Using pooled patient sera, an expression gene library of a virulent Leptospira interrogans serovar Autumnalis strain N2 isolated in South India was screened. The identified genes were characterized, and the purified recombinant proteins were used as antigens in IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) either singly or in combination. Sera (n = 118) from cases of acute leptospirosis along with sera (n = 58) from healthy subjects were tested for reactivity with the identified proteins in an ELISA designed to detect specific IgM responses. We have identified nine immunoreactive proteins, ArgC, RecA, GlpF, FliD, TrmD, RplS, RnhB, Lp28.6, and Lrr44.9, which were found to be highly conserved among pathogenic leptospires. Apparently, the proteins ArgC, RecA, GlpF, FliD, TrmD, and Lrr44.9 are expressed during natural infection of the host and undetectable in in vitro cultures. Among all the recombinant proteins used as antigens in IgM ELISA, ArgC had the highest sensitivity and specificity, 89.8% and 95.5%, respectively, for the conclusive diagnosis of leptospirosis. The use of ArgC and RecA in combination for IgM ELISA increased the sensitivity and specificity to 95.7% and 94.9%, respectively. ArgC and RecA thus elicited specific IgM responses and were therefore effective in laboratory confirmation of Leptospira infection.","['Raja V', 'Shanmughapriya S', 'Kanagavel M', 'Artiushin SC', 'Velineni S', 'Timoney JF', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2016,23,1,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Raja V, et al.

Cattle populations from all sites (9.88%) were exposed to smooth Brucella, but only one jaguar from Cerrado was exposed to this agent. Jaguars captured in the Cerrado (60.0%) and in the Pantanal (45.5%) were seropositive for different serovars of Leptospira spp., cattle (72.18%) and domestic dogs (13.1%) from the three sites and one domestic cat from Pantanal were also seropositive for the agent. The most prevalent serotype of Leptospira spp. identified in jaguars from the Cerrado (Grippotyphosa) and the Pantanal (Pomona) biomes were distinct from those found in the domestic animals sampled. Jaguars (100%), domestic dogs (38.28%) and domestic cats (82.76%) from the three areas were exposed to T. gondii.

Therefore, it is difficult to accurately determine the number of leptospirosis cases in these areas, which contributes to significant under-reporting this disease. In this study, we estimated the number of possible leptospirosis cases among dengue-like cases that were reported during 2008, 2010, and 2012 in the city of Fortaleza, northeast Brazil. Patients were evaluated for dengue and leptospirosis using immunoenzymatic tests for IgM antibodies that were specific to each pathogen. Among the suspected cases of dengue that resulted as negative in laboratory tests, 10.8% (2008), 19.2% (2010), and 30.8% (2012) were confirmed to be leptospirosis. Considering the cases reported by the surveillance authority as dengue that were subsequently discarded based on the laboratory test results, we estimate that the number of actual leptospirosis cases may be 26 to 49 times higher than those diagnosed and reported by the Health Services. Furthermore, we believe that approximately 20% of dengue-like cases may be leptospirosis cases in areas where the two diseases are endemic.","['Fontes RM', 'Cavalcanti LP', 'Oliveira AC', 'Bezerra LF', 'Gomes AM', 'Colares JK', 'Lima DM']",2015,57,5,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"Fontes RM, et al.

However, one such candidate is OmpL37, a potentially surface-exposed antigen that has the highest elastin-binding ability described to date, suggesting that it plays an important role in host colonization. In order to evaluate OmpL37's ability to induce a protective immune response, prime-boost, DNA and subunit vaccine strategies were tested in the hamster model of lethal leptospirosis. The humoral immune response was evaluated using an indirect ELISA test, and the cytokine profile in whole blood was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Unlike the DNA vaccine, the administration of recombinant OmpL37 induced a strong IgG antibody response. When individually administrated, both formulations stimulated a TNF-α mediated inflammatory response. However, none of the OmpL37 formulations or vaccination strategies induced protective immunity.

Only 105 articles regarding to serosurveys using MAT were found in several countries, and 61 (58.1 %) met all the inclusion criteria. In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrated a high prevalence of the infection (75.0 % at herd level and 44.2 % at animal level), with predominance of strains of serogroup Sejroe (80.3 %). It was evident that there is the necessity of more studies in several countries, as well as the need for greater standardization in studies, especially with regard to the adopted cutoff point at serological tests.","['Pinto Pda S', 'Libonati H', 'Penna B', 'Lilenbaum W']",2016,48,2,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Pinto Pda S, et al.

The objectives of this study were to 1) perform a systematic review of published cases of marine mammal disease to determine spatial and temporal trends in disease from 1972-2012, including changes in regions and taxa affected and specific causes; and 2) compare numbers of published cases of neoplasia with known, hospital-based neoplasia records to explore the causes of discrepancy between numbers of published cases and true disease trends. Peer-reviewed literature was compiled, and data were collected from The Marine Mammal Center database in Sausalito, California for comparison of numbers of neoplasia cases. Toxicoses from harmful algal blooms appear to be increasing. Viral epidemics are most common along the Atlantic U.S. coastline, while bacterial epidemics, especially leptospirosis, are most common along the Pacific coast. Certain protozoal and fungal zoonoses appear to be emerging, such as Toxoplasma gondii in southern sea otters in California, and Cryptococcus gattii in cetaceans in the Pacific Northwest. Disease reports were most common from California where pinniped populations are large, but increased effort also occurs. Anthropogenic trauma remains a large threat to marine mammal health, through direct mortality and indirect chronic disease. Neoplasia cases were under-reported from 2003-2012 when compared to true number of cases, and over-reported in several years due to case duplication. Peer-reviewed literature greatly underestimates the true magnitude of disease in marine mammals as it focuses on novel findings, fails to reflect etiology of multifactorial diseases, rarely reports prevalence rather than simple numbers of cases, and is typically presented years after a disease first occurs. Thus literature cannot guide management actions adequately, nor inform indices of ocean health. A real-time, nationally centralized system for reporting marine mammal disease data is needed to be able to understand how marine mammal diseases are changing with ecosystem changes, and before these animals can truly be considered 'sentinels of ocean health'.","['Simeone CA', 'Gulland FM', 'Norris T', 'Rowles TK']",2015,10,11,PLoS One,"Simeone CA, et al.

The severe pulmonary form of leptospirosis is a lesser known entity and is characterized by intra-alveolar hemorrhage and can lead to acute respiratory failure with resistant hypoxemia, which leads to high mortality rates despite maximally invasive mechanical ventilation and adequate treatment. We herein present a case of severe leptospirosis complicated by massive pulmonary hemorrhage, which was successfully managed by extra corporeal membrane oxygenation.","['Liao CY', 'Ben RJ', 'Wu HM', 'Chang SK', 'Liu MY', 'Chin HK', 'Yeh YC']",2015,54,22,Intern Med,"Liao CY, et al.

26563835,[Endoscopy-guided 20-G vitrectomy in severe endophthalmitis: Report of 18 cases and literature review].,"OBJECTIVE: To report the anatomical and functional outcomes after endoscopy-guided vitrectomy in a series of cases of severe endophthalmitis. Also to identify and compare the outcomes of two different modes of clinical presentation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective case study, single center; all patients who underwent endoscopic 20Ga vitrectomy (Endo optiks E4 system) for severe endophthalmitis were included. For each case, data were recorded for: etiology, surgical indication, preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, comorbidity factors and postoperative complications, and whether any additional surgery was performed. Two groups were distinguished according to their initial mode of presentation; results were then compared in terms of complications and visual prognosis to those found in the literature.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included, with mean age 62±19years. Severe endophthalmitis was initially obvious for 8 cases (group 1). For 10 cases, disease progression had been considered unfavorable despite adequate medical treatment (group 2). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.55). Endophthalmitis occurred: after intravitreal injections (4 cases), after intraocular foreign body (n=2), after cataract surgery (n=5), following a trabeculectomy (n=2), after epiretinal membrane peeling (n=3), 1 case caused by a corneal infection and 1 case of endogenous leptospirosis. Mean follow-up was 13.7months. The surgical technique was a complete 20Ga vitrectomy under endoscopic visual control. The mean operative time was 70±27minutes. The causative organism was identified in 72% of cases in vitreous humor samples, among which 77% were gram-positive organisms. The infection was controlled in 89% of cases, and these patients have recovered useful visual acuity.
CONCLUSION: The value of endoscopic visualization in ophthalmology has been proven for 30 S. aureus years, but its miniaturization enhances the current enthusiasm for the use of this instrumentation. When visualization is compromised, endoscopic guided vitrectomy is very useful and may assist the surgeon in the management of these difficult cases. Our anatomical and functional outcomes are encouraging, but we must keep in mind the poor long-term prognosis of severe endophthalmitis.","['Martiano D', ""L'helgoualc'h G"", 'Cochener B']",2015,38,10,J Fr Ophtalmol,"Martiano D, et al.

26562157,"Leptospirosis in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil: An Ecosystem Approach in the Animal-Human Interface.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an epidemic-prone neglected disease that affects humans and animals, mostly in vulnerable populations. The One Health approach is a recommended strategy to identify drivers of the disease and plan for its prevention and control. In that context, the aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of human cases of leptospirosis in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and to explore possible drivers. Additionally, it sought to provide further evidence to support interventions and to identify hypotheses for new research at the human-animal-ecosystem interface.
METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: The risk for human infection was described in relation to environmental, socioeconomic, and livestock variables. This ecological study used aggregated data by municipality (all 496). Data were extracted from secondary, publicly available sources. Thematic maps were constructed and univariate analysis performed for all variables. Negative binomial regression was used for multivariable statistical analysis of leptospirosis cases. An annual average of 428 human cases of leptospirosis was reported in the state from 2008 to 2012. The cumulative incidence in rural populations was eight times higher than in urban populations. Variables significantly associated with leptospirosis cases in the final model were: Parana/Paraiba ecoregion (RR: 2.25; CI95%: 2.03-2.49); Neossolo Litolítico soil (RR: 1.93; CI95%: 1.26-2.96); and, to a lesser extent, the production of tobacco (RR: 1.10; CI95%: 1.09-1.11) and rice (RR: 1.003; CI95%: 1.002-1.04).
CONCLUSION: Urban cases were concentrated in the capital and rural cases in a specific ecoregion. The major drivers identified in this study were related to environmental and production processes that are permanent features of the state. This study contributes to the basic knowledge on leptospirosis distribution and drivers in the state and encourages a comprehensive approach to address the disease in the animal-human-ecosystem interface.","['Schneider MC', 'Najera P', 'Pereira MM', 'Machado G', 'dos Anjos CB', 'Rodrigues RO', 'Cavagni GM', 'Muñoz-Zanzi C', 'Corbellini LG', 'Leone M', 'Buss DF', 'Aldighieri S', 'Espinal MA']",2015,9,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Schneider MC, et al.

26555137,Distribution of Plasmids in Distinct Leptospira Pathogenic Species.,"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. The genus Leptospira includes at least 21 species clustered into three groups--pathogens, non-pathogens, and intermediates--based on 16S rRNA phylogeny. Research on Leptospira is difficult due to slow growth and poor transformability of the pathogens. Recent identification of extrachromosomal elements besides the two chromosomes in L. interrogans has provided new insight into genome complexity of the genus Leptospira. The large size, low copy number, and high similarity of the sequence of these extrachromosomal elements with the chromosomes present challenges in isolating and detecting them without careful genome assembly. In this study, two extrachromosomal elements were identified in L. borgpetersenii serovar Ballum strain 56604 through whole genome assembly combined with S1 nuclease digestion following pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) analysis. Further, extrachromosomal elements in additional 15 Chinese epidemic strains of Leptospira, comprising L. borgpetersenii, L. weilii, and L. interrogans, were successfully separated and identified, independent of genome sequence data. Southern blot hybridization with extrachromosomal element-specific probes, designated as lcp1, lcp2 and lcp3-rep, further confirmed their occurrences as extrachromosomal elements. In total, 24 plasmids were detected in 13 out of 15 tested strains, among which 11 can hybridize with the lcp1-rep probe and 11 with the lcp2-rep probe, whereas two can hybridize with the lcp3-rep probe. None of them are likely to be species-specific. Blastp search of the lcp1, lcp2, and lcp3-rep genes with a nonredundant protein database of Leptospira species genomes showed that their homologous sequences are widely distributed among clades of pathogens but not non-pathogens or intermediates. These results suggest that the plasmids are widely distributed in Leptospira species, and further elucidation of their biological significance might contribute to our understanding of biology and infectivity of pathogenic spirochetes.","['Wang Y', 'Zhuang X', 'Zhong Y', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zeng L', 'Zhu Y', 'He P', 'Dong K', 'Pal U', 'Guo X', 'Qin J']",2015,9,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Wang Y, et al.

26553295,Synanthropic Cockroaches (Blattidae: Periplaneta spp.) Harbor Pathogenic Leptospira in Colombia.,"Leptospirosis cases in Colombia are typically linked to peridomestic rodents; however, empirical data suggest that Leptospira-infected patients with no apparent exposure to these reservoirs are common. Cockroaches (Periplaneta spp.) have equal or greater interaction with humans than rodents, yet their potential role as carriers of Leptospira has not been assessed. We determined if pathogenic Leptospira is harbored by Periplaneta spp. in Cali (Colombia) and the variables influencing this relationship. Fifty-nine cockroaches were captured from seven sites and DNA was extracted from the body surface and digestive tract for a multiplex polymerase chain reaction, targeting genes secY and flaB. Logistic regression models and proportion tests showed a higher likelihood for Leptospira to be isolated from body surfaces (P > 0.001) and from individuals inside houses (six times more likely). These findings are the first to demonstrate an association between Periplaneta spp. and Leptospira, suggesting the need to investigate the potential for cockroaches to serve as reservoirs or transport hosts for Leptospira.","['Gonzalez-Astudillo V', 'Bustamante-Rengifo JA', 'Bonilla Á', 'Lehmicke AJ', 'Castillo A', 'Astudillo-Hernández M']",2016,53,1,J Med Entomol,"Gonzalez-Astudillo V, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study. We studied 441 serum samples corresponding to Argentinean patients with suspected leptospirosis derived during from July to December, 2009 and from January to October, 2013.
RESULTS: The same number of positive samples was obtained using the MAT with the 19 or 12 strains. In six cases a serovar of the expanded collection was presumably infecting, but always coagglutinated with strains of the reduced panel.
CONCLUSION: In Argentina, the diagnosis of leptospirosis by MAT could be made using the reduced 12 strains panel, obtaining the same result in case detection as using the 19 strains panel.

While blood-borne pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, cause significant illness, the risk of acquiring these agents during sporting activities is minimal. Skin infections are more commonplace, arising from a variety of microbial agents including bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Sports involving water contact can lead to enteric infections, eye infections, or disseminated infections such as leptospirosis. Mumps, measles, and influenza are vaccine-preventable diseases that have been transmitted during sporting events, both in players and in spectators. Prevention is the key to many of these infections. Players should be vaccinated and should not participate in sports if their infection can be spread by contact, airborne, or droplet transmission.","['Minooee A', 'Wang J', 'Gupta GK']",2015,3,5,Microbiol Spectr,"Minooee A, et al.

Cases were confirmed by PCR or real time PCR, or by serology using MAT or a combination of IgM-ELISA and MAT. A retrospective analysis of surveillance data shows that the disease was endemic with a mean annual incidence of 844 cases per 100,000 over an 11-year period from 2004 to 2014. An epidemic peak as high as 1,945 cases per 100,000 occurred in 2008. Serogroup Australis was predominant until 2007, Icterohaemorrhagiae was dominant afterwards. Cluster analysis revealed different hot spots over time. Lifestyle habits, such as walking barefoot in irrigated taro fields or pig pens probably contributed to contamination from the swine and rodent reservoirs to humans. Severe forms were rare, and the case fatality rate was 0.5%. The medical community and general population were aware of leptospirosis and rapid treatment with amoxycillin was the main treatment, probably contributing to this low fatality rate.","['Massenet D', 'Yvon JF', 'Couteaux C', 'Goarant C']",2015,10,11,PLoS One,"Massenet D, et al.

26527082,Genomic survey and expression analysis of DNA repair genes in the genus Leptospira.,"Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis with important economic and public health consequences and is caused by pathogenic leptospires. The genus Leptospira belongs to the order Spirochaetales and comprises saprophytic (L. biflexa), pathogenic (L. interrogans) and host-dependent (L. borgpetersenii) members. Here, we present an in silico search for DNA repair pathways in Leptospira spp. The relevance of such DNA repair pathways was assessed through the identification of mRNA levels of some genes during infection in animal model and after exposition to spleen cells. The search was performed by comparison of available Leptospira spp. genomes in public databases with known DNA repair-related genes. Leptospires exhibit some distinct and unexpected characteristics, for instance the existence of a redundant mechanism for repairing a chemically diverse spectrum of alkylated nucleobases, a new mutS-like gene and a new shorter version of uvrD. Leptospira spp. shares some characteristics from Gram-positive, as the presence of PcrA, two RecQ paralogs and two SSB proteins; the latter is considered a feature shared by naturally competent bacteria. We did not find a significant reduction in the number of DNA repair-related genes in both pathogenic and host-dependent species. Pathogenic leptospires were enriched for genes dedicated to base excision repair and non-homologous end joining. Their evolutionary history reveals a remarkable importance of lateral gene transfer events for the evolution of the genus. Up-regulation of specific DNA repair genes, including components of SOS regulon, during infection in animal model validates the critical role of DNA repair mechanisms for the complex interplay between host/pathogen.","['Martins-Pinheiro M', 'Schons-Fonseca L', 'da Silva JB', 'Domingos RH', 'Momo LH', 'Simões AC', 'Ho PL', 'da Costa RM']",2016,291,2,Mol Genet Genomics,"Martins-Pinheiro M, et al.

29897698,Mortality Predictors of ARDS in Medical Intensive Care Unit of a Tertiary Care Centre in a Tropical Country.,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome of severe dyspnoea of rapid onset, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates leading to respiratory failure in the absence of cardiac failure. We did the study to asses various aetiologies of ARDS, to determine the correlation between the diagnostic criteria, mortality predictors, need of mechanical ventilation and the outcome of patients. This was an observational, prospective study in medical intensive care unit (MICU) of a tertiary care hospital, over a period of 15 months.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: This study encompassed 116 patients of ARDS admitted to an MICU at a tertiary care centre in Mumbai. We included all consecutive patients with ARDS in this study. We excluded patients with known ischemic heart diseases, valvular heart diseases or in congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney diseases with fluid overload states and age below 18 years.
RESULTS: Males comprised almost 70% (81) of the study population and the presentation was more common in younger age group with total mortality of 57.8% (67 out of 116). Factors attributable for ARDS were malaria in 31 patients (26.72%), pneumonia in 23 (19.82%), sepsis in 20 (17.2%), dengue in 15 (12.96%), undiagnosed fever in 13 (11.1%), leptospirosis in 7 (6.03%), pancreatitis in 3 (2.58%), H1N1 infection in 2 (1.72%), urinary tract infection (UTI) in 1 (0.86%) and UTI with pyelonephritis and Dengue in 1 (0.86 %) patients. Tropical diseases in present study constituted 66 (56.89%) cases of which 31 (47%) died. This difference was statistically found to be significant. Mean PaO2/FiO2 was 178.32 amongst discharged and 127.69 amongst those who expired. Sixty patients had severe LIS, out of which 45 (75%) patients expired, as compared to 56 patients with moderate LIS out of which 22 (39.3%) expired.
CONCLUSION: Tropical diseases like malaria, dengue, and leptospirosis were the main factors responsible for ARDS. LIS, Modified LIS and PaO2/FiO2 ratio predicted outcome as well as need for mechanical ventilation.

26518696,Comparative analysis of lipopolysaccharides of pathogenic and intermediately pathogenic Leptospira species.,"BACKGROUND: Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are complex, amphipathic biomolecules that constitute the major surface component of Gram-negative bacteria. Leptospira, unlike other human-pathogenic spirochetes, produce LPS, which is fundamental to the taxonomy of the genus, involved in host-adaption and also the target of diagnostic antibodies. Despite its significance, little is known of Leptospira LPS composition and carbohydrate structure among different serovars.
RESULTS: LPS from Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130, a pathogenic species, and L. licerasiae serovar Varillal strain VAR 010, an intermediately pathogenic species, were studied. LPS prepared from aqueous and phenol phases were analyzed separately. L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni has additional sugars not found in L. licerasiae serovar Varillal, including fucose (2.7%), a high amount of GlcNAc (12.3%), and two different types of dideoxy HexNAc. SDS-PAGE indicated that L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni LPS had a far higher molecular weight and complexity than that of L. licerasiae serovar Varillal. Chemical composition showed that L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni LPS has an extended O-antigenic polysaccharide consisting of sugars, not present in L. licerasiae serovar Varillal. Arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose and L-glycero-D-mannoheptose were detected in both the species. Fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed the presence of hydroxypalmitate (3-OH-C16:0) only in L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni. Negative staining electron microscopic examination of LPS showed different filamentous morphologies in L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni vs. L. licerasiae serovar Varillal.

26517479,Characterization of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona isolated from swine in Brazil.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospira interrogans swine infection is a cause of serious economic loss and a potential human health hazard. In Brazil, the most common serovars associated with swine infections are Pomona, Icterohaemorrhagie and Tarassovi. Cross-reactions among serovars and the failure of infected animals to seroconvert may complicate the interpretation of serological tests. Molecular methods with better discriminatory powers are useful tools for swine leptospirosis characterization and diagnosis.
METHODOLOGY: This study evaluated nine L. interrogans isolates from the States of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais during different time periods. Isolates from diseased and apparently healthy swine were characterized by microscopic agglutination tests with polyclonal antibodies and were genotyped by VNTR, PFGE and MLST techniques. Broth microdilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of the antimicrobials of veterinary interest.
RESULTS: The strains were identified as L. interrogans serogroup Pomona serovar Pomona Genotype A, while MLST grouped all of the isolates in sequence type 37. The PFGE analysis resulted in two pulsotypes with more than 70% similarity, distinguishing serovar Pomona isolates from the serovar Kennewicki reference strain. All of the isolates presented low MIC values to penicillin, ampicillin, ceftiofur and tulathromycin. High MIC values for fluoroquinolones, tiamulin, gentamicin, tetracyclines, neomycin, tilmicosin and sulfas were also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: All molecular techniques were concordant in L. interrogans serovar Pomona identification. This serovar may have a different antibiotic susceptibility profile than previously reported for Leptospira isolates.","['Miraglia F', 'Moreno LZ', 'Morais ZM', 'Langoni H', 'Shimabukuro FH', 'Dellagostin OA', 'Hartskeerl R', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Moreno AM']",2015,9,10,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Miraglia F, et al.

26517116,Fine Mapping of the Interaction between C4b-Binding Protein and Outer Membrane Proteins LigA and LigB of Pathogenic Leptospira interrogans.,"The complement system consists of more than 40 proteins that participate in the inflammatory response and in pathogen killing. Complement inhibitors are necessary to avoid the excessive consumption and activation of this system on host cells. Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by spirochetes from the genus Leptospira. Pathogenic leptospires are able to escape from complement activation by binding to host complement inhibitors Factor H [FH] and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) while non-pathogenic leptospires are rapidly killed in the presence of fresh serum. In this study, we demonstrate that complement control protein domains (CCP) 7 and 8 of C4BP α-chain interact with the outer membrane proteins LcpA, LigA and LigB from the pathogenic leptospire L. interrogans. The interaction between C4BP and LcpA, LigA and LigB is sensitive to ionic strength and inhibited by heparin. We fine mapped the LigA and LigB domains involved in its binding to C4BP and heparin and found that both interactions are mediated through the bacterial immunoglobulin-like (Big) domains 7 and 8 (LigA7-8 and LigB7-8) of both LigA and LigB and also through LigB9-10.

26515048,Meta-Analyses of Factors Associated with Leptospirosis in Domestic Dogs.,"Factors related with leptospirosis in domestic dogs have been reported worldwide. The aims of this study were to identify factors associated with this disease described in different observational studies and to combine the coinciding factors in at least four studies using meta-analyses, to obtain a pooled odds ratio (OR) as measure of infection risk. A literature search was performed in electronic databases, electronic databases of specific journals and search engines to find studies published in English, Spanish and Portuguese available from January 1960 to January 2015. Two hundred and eighteen factors were identified in 31 publications including cross-sectional and case-control studies. Finally, independent meta-analyses were performed with six different variables, which included between 4 and 8 articles. The pooled OR indicated that the variables 'mixed-breed dogs', 'flooding occurrence in the habitat of the dog' and 'working dogs' were risk factors for leptospirosis, while 'being a dog less than 1 year old' was a protective factor; however, all these associations were not statistically significant. Otherwise, the variables 'male dog' and 'urban dog' were statistically significant risk factors for infection. This study highlights the need for more formal studies on the epidemiology of canine leptospirosis. Nevertheless, the study revealed that some risk factors for infection coincided in different observational studies. These factors could be considered to raise suspicion about the disease, especially when there is a history of exposure to the bacteria.","['Azócar-Aedo L', 'Monti G']",2016,63,4,Zoonoses Public Health,Azócar-Aedo L and Monti G.

26513929,MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF FLAB FOR LEPTOSPIRA IDENTIFICATION.,"PCR amplification of the nearly full-length of virulence flagellin gene (flaB) was employed for rapid identification of Leptospira spp and of Leptospira-specific 16S rDNA (rrs) for differentiation from other bacteria. This approach distinguished pathogenic from non-pathogenic Leptospira strains, and the generation of restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles using a combination of restriction endonucleases allowed identification of pathogenic Leptospira species. PCR-based identification of Leptospira flaB provides an accurate and rapid tool for identification of leptospires and can be used as a means for rapidly identifying animal reservoirs responsible for leptospirosis outbreaks. Furthermore, these techniques could be applied to clinical diagnosis without the need for leptospiral isolation.","['Wajjwalkul W', 'Sukmak M', 'Amavisit P', 'Sukpuaram T', 'La-ard A']",2015,46,2,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,"Wajjwalkul W, et al.

Both travelers swam in Ngardmau Falls, which was flooded for two days after typhoon Phanfone. The diagnoses were confirmed by microscopic agglutination test or polymerase chain reaction. This is the first report of leptospirosis in travelers who returned from Palau. It should be noted that choosing the appropriate test to biologically confirm leptospirosis was highly time-dependent. Awareness of the risk factors for leptospirosis, mainly that of the exposure to contaminated fresh water after a flooding, would lead to an early and appropriate treatment before the confirmed diagnosis.","['Matono T', 'Kutsuna S', 'Koizumi N', 'Fujiya Y', 'Takeshita N', 'Hayakawa K', 'Kanagawa S', 'Kato Y', 'Ohmagari N']",2015,22,6,J Travel Med,"Matono T, et al.

26491036,Specific CD4+ T-Cell Reactivity and Cytokine Release in Different Clinical Presentations of Leptospirosis.,"Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis are highly variable: from asymptomatic to severe and potentially fatal. The outcome of the disease is usually determined in the immunological phase, beginning in the second week of symptoms. The underlying mechanisms, predictive factors, and individual immune responses that contribute to clinical variations are not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the specifics of CD4(+) T-cell reactivity and cytokine release after stimulation with leptospiral antigens in patients with leptospirosis of different disease severities (patients with mild and severe symptoms) and in control subjects (with and without proven exposure to Leptospira). Whole-blood specimens were stimulated with Leptospira antigens in vitro. Subsequently, intracellular staining of cytokines was performed, and flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L) and the production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) by CD4(+) T cells. The production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α by CD4(+) T cells after stimulation with leptospiral antigens was highest in patients with severe disease. In contrast, the ratio of IL-10 production to TNF-α production was higher in exposed subjects than in patients with mild and severe disease. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α may be useful markers of the severity of the immunological phase of leptospirosis. IL-10 production by T cells after antigen-specific stimulation may indicate a more successful downregulation of the inflammatory response and may contribute to an asymptomatic course of the disease.","['Volz MS', 'Moos V', 'Allers K', 'Luge E', 'Mayer-Scholl A', 'Nöckler K', 'Loddenkemper C', 'Jansen A', 'Schneider T']",2015,22,12,Clin Vaccine Immunol,"Volz MS, et al.

26481969,Flagellar motility of the pathogenic spirochetes.,"Bacterial pathogens are often classified by their toxicity and invasiveness. The invasiveness of a given bacterium is determined by how capable the bacterium is at invading a broad range of tissues in its host. Of mammalian pathogens, some of the most invasive come from a group of bacteria known as the spirochetes, which cause diseases, such as syphilis, Lyme disease, relapsing fever and leptospirosis. Most of the spirochetes are characterized by their distinct shapes and unique motility. They are long, thin bacteria that can be shaped like flat-waves, helices, or have more irregular morphologies. Like many other bacteria, the spirochetes use long, helical appendages known as flagella to move; however, the spirochetes enclose their flagella in the periplasm, the narrow space between the inner and outer membranes. Rotation of the flagella in the periplasm causes the entire cell body to rotate and/or undulate. These deformations of the bacterium produce the force that drives the motility of these organisms, and it is this unique motility that likely allows these bacteria to be highly invasive in mammals. This review will describe the current state of knowledge on the motility and biophysics of these organisms and provide evidence on how this knowledge can inform our understanding of spirochetal diseases.",['Wolgemuth CW'],2015,46,,Semin Cell Dev Biol,Wolgemuth CW.

26471012,The effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation on skin and skin-related diseases: a message from the International Society of Dermatology Climate Change Task Force.,"The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a complex climate phenomenon occurring in the Pacific Ocean at intervals of 2-7 years. The term refers to fluctuations in ocean temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (El Niño [the warm phase of ENSO] and La Niña [the cool phase of ENSO]) and in atmospheric pressure across the Pacific basin (Southern Oscillation). This weather pattern is attributed with causing climate change in certain parts of the world and is associated with disease outbreaks. The question of how ENSO affects skin and skin-related disease is relatively unanswered. We aimed to review the literature describing the effects of this complex weather pattern on skin. El Niño has been associated with increases in the occurrence of actinic keratosis, tinea, pityriasis versicolor, miliaria, folliculitis, rosacea, dermatitis by Paederus irritans and Paederus sabaeus, and certain vector-borne and waterborne diseases, such as dengue fever, leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, Barmah Forest virus, and leptospirosis, and with decreases in the occurrence of dermatitis, scabies, psoriasis, and papular urticaria. La Niña has been associated with increases in the occurrence of varicella, hand, foot, and mouth disease, and Ross River virus (in certain areas), and decreases in viral warts and leishmaniasis. Reports on the effects of ENSO on skin and skin-related disease are limited, and more studies could be helpful in the future.","['Andersen LK', 'Davis MD']",2015,54,12,Int J Dermatol,Andersen LK and Davis MD.

26452161,Overlooked Risk for Chronic Kidney Disease after Leptospiral Infection: A Population-Based Survey and Epidemiological Cohort Evidence.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis. Chronic human infection and asymptomatic colonization have been reported. However, renal involvement in those with leptospira chronic exposure remains undetermined.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In 2007, a multistage sampling survey for chronic kidney disease (CKD) was conducted in a southern county of Taiwan, an area with a high prevalence of dialysis. Additionally, an independent cohort of 88 participants from a leptospira-endemic town was followed for two years after a flooding in 2009. Risks of CKD, stages of CKD, associated risk factors as well as kidney injury markers were compared among adults with anti-leptospira antibody as defined by titers of microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Of 3045 survey participants, the individuals with previous leptospira exposure disclosed a lower level of eGFR (98.3 ± 0.4 vs 100.8 ± 0.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2, P < 0.001) and a higher percentage of CKD, particularly at stage 3a-5 (14.4% vs 8.5%), than those without leptospira exposure. Multivariable linear regression analyses indicated the association of leptospiral infection and lower eGFR (95% CI -4.15 to -1.93, P < 0.001). In a leptospiral endemic town, subjects with a MAT titer ≥ 400 showed a decreased eGFR and higher urinary kidney injury molecule-1 creatinine ratio (KIM1/Cr) level as compared with those having lower titers of MAT (P < 0.05). Furthermore, two participants with persistently high MAT titers had positive urine leptospira DNA and deteriorating renal function.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our data are the first to show that chronic human exposure of leptospirosis is associated significantly with prevalence and severity of CKD and may lead to deterioration of renal function. This study also shed light on the search of underlying factors in areas experiencing CKD of unknown aetiology (CKDu) such as Mesoamerican Nephropathy.","['Yang HY', 'Hung CC', 'Liu SH', 'Guo YG', 'Chen YC', 'Ko YC', 'Huang CT', 'Chou LF', 'Tian YC', 'Chang MY', 'Hsu HH', 'Lin MY', 'Hwang SJ', 'Yang CW']",2015,9,10,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Yang HY, et al.

26450835,A comparison of two real-time polymerase chain reaction assays using hybridization probes targeting either 16S ribosomal RNA or a subsurface lipoprotein gene for detecting leptospires in canine urine.,"Leptospires are excreted in the urine of infected animals, and the prompt detection of leptospiral DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is increasingly being used. However, contradictory data has emerged concerning the diagnostic accuracy of the most popular PCR assays that target either the 16S ribosomal RNA (rrs) or the subsurface lipoprotein (LipL32) genes. In order to clarify the effect of the gene target, a novel hydrolysis probe-based, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay targeting the LipL32 gene was developed, validated, and then compared directly to the previously described rrs hydrolysis probe-based qPCR using a convenience collection of canine urine samples. The novel LipL32 qPCR assay was linear from 5.9 × 10(6) to 59 genome equivalents per reaction. Both the LipL32 and the rrs qPCR assays showed a limit of detection of 10 target copies per reaction indicating an approximately equivalent analytical sensitivity. Both assays amplified all 20 pathogenic leptospiral strains tested but did not amplify a representative collection of bacteria commonly found in voided canine urine. When the field samples were assayed, 1 and 5 out of 184 samples yielded an amplification signal in the LipL32 and rrs assays, respectively. Nevertheless, when the limit of detection was considered as the cutoff for interpreting findings, the 4 discordant cases were judged as negative. In conclusion, our study confirmed that both LipL32 and rrs are suitable targets for qPCR for the detection of leptospiral DNA in canine urine. However, the rrs target requires the mandatory use of a cutoff value in order to correctly interpret spurious amplifications.","['Gentilini F', 'Zanoni RG', 'Zambon E', 'Turba ME']",2015,27,6,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Gentilini F, et al.

26447693,Distribution of Leptospira interrogans by Multispacer Sequence Typing in Urban Norway Rats (Rattus norvegicus): A Survey in France in 2011-2013.,"BACKGROUND: Urban leptospirosis has increasingly been reported in both developing and developed countries. The control of the disease is limited because our understanding of basic aspects of the epidemiology, including the transmission routes of leptospires among rat populations, remains incomplete. Through the ability to distinguish among Leptospira strains in rats, multispacer sequence typing (MST) could provide a modern understanding of Leptospira epidemiology; however, to our knowledge, the distribution of Leptospira strains among urban rat colonies has not been investigated using MST.
AIMS AND METHODOLOGY: The objective of this study was to identify the Leptospira strains present in rats (Rattus norvegicus) in Lyon (France) using MST and to characterize their spatial distribution. Kidneys and urine were collected from rats trapped live in seven locations in the city and in one suburban location. Each location was considered to represent a rat colony. Bacterial cultures and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were performed, and the L. interrogans DNA identified was then genotyped using MST. The distributions of Leptospira strains were spatially described.
KEY RESULTS: Among 84 wild rats, MST profiles were obtained in 35 of 37 rats that had a positive result for L. interrogans by bacterial culture and/or qPCR analyses. All of the MST profiles were related to reference strains previously isolated from human patients that belong to the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae and the serovars [strain(s)] Copenhageni [Wijinberg or M20] (n = 26), Icterohaemorrhagiae [CHU Réunion] (n = 7), Icterohaemorrhagiae [R1] (n = 1) and Copenhageni [Shibaura 9] (n = 1). Each colony was infected with leptospires having the same MST profile.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that MST could be used for the purpose of field studies, either on culture isolates or on DNA extracted from kidneys and urine, to distinguish among L. interrogans isolates in rats. MST could thus be used to monitor their distributions in urban rats from the same city, thereby providing new knowledge that could be applied to explore the circulation of L. interrogans infection in rat colonies. Because the strains are related to those previously found in humans, this application of MST could aid in the source tracking of human leptospirosis, and the findings would be relevant for public health purposes according to the One Health principle.","['Ayral F', 'Zilber AL', 'Bicout DJ', 'Kodjo A', 'Artois M', 'Djelouadji Z']",2015,10,10,PLoS One,"Ayral F, et al.

26442766,Is it too cold for Leptospira interrrogans transmission on the Faroese Islands?,"Leptospira interrogans is a bacterium that can infect most mammal species. Brown rats are considered to be one of the most important reservoirs of Leptospira because they frequently are infected and live in close proximity to humans. Past studies of prevalence of Leptospira in brown rats indicate that temperature--both high and low--may negatively affect the prevalence rate in rats, so that Leptospira is rare or even absent at temperatures below 7-8 °C. Here we investigated the prevalence of infection in brown rats on the Faroese Islands (mean temperature of 6.5 °C) and did not find any infected animals in a sample of 95 animals. We propose that prevalence rates of Leptospira are very low in rural brown rats in the cooler Scandinavian regions, even though urban/sewer rats might be highly infected in the same regions.","['Jensen PM', 'Magnussen E']",2016,48,2,Infect Dis (Lond),Jensen PM and Magnussen E.

26438342,Diagnostics barriers and innovations in rural areas: insights from junior medical doctors on the frontlines of rural care in Peru.,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, rural communities face barriers when accessing health services. In response, numerous initiatives have focused on fostering technological innovations, new management approaches and health policies. Research suggests that the most successful innovations are those involving stakeholders at all levels. However, there is little evidence exploring the opinions of local health providers that could contribute with further innovation development and research. The aims of this study were to explore the perspectives of medical doctors (MDs) working in rural areas of Peru, regarding the barriers impacting the diagnostic process, and ideas for diagnostic innovations that could assist them.
METHODS: Data gathered through three focus group discussions (FGG) and 18 individual semi-structured interviews (SSI) with MDs who had completed their medical service in rural areas of Peru in the last two years were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Three types of barriers emerged. The first barrier was the limited access to point of care (POC) diagnostic tools. Tests were needed for: i) the differential diagnosis of malaria vs. pneumonia, ii) dengue vs. leptospirosis, iii) tuberculosis, iv) vaginal infections and cervical cancer, v) neurocysticercosis, and vi) heavy metal toxicity. Ultrasound was needed for the diagnosis of obstetric and intra-abdominal conditions. There were also health system-related barriers such as limited funding for diagnostic services, shortage of specialists, limited laboratory services and access to telecommunications, and lack of institutional support. Finally, the third type of barriers included patient related-barriers to follow through with diagnostic referrals. Ideas for innovations proposed included POC equipment and tests, and telemedicine.
CONCLUSIONS: MDs at primary health facilities in rural Peru face diagnostic challenges that are difficult to overcome due to a limited access to diagnostic tools. Referrals to specialized facilities are constrained by deficiencies in the organization of health services and by barriers that impede the patients' travel to distant health facilities. Technological innovations suggested by the participants such as POC diagnostic tools and mobile-health (m-health) applications could help address part of the problem. However, other types of innovation to address social, adaptation and policy issues should not be dismissed.","['Anticona Huaynate CF', 'Pajuelo Travezaño MJ', 'Correa M', 'Mayta Malpartida H', 'Oberhelman R', 'Murphy LL', 'Paz-Soldan VA']",2015,15,,BMC Health Serv Res,"Anticona Huaynate CF, et al.

26431366,Global Burden of Leptospirosis: Estimated in Terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a spirochaetal zoonosis, occurs in diverse epidemiological settings and affects vulnerable populations, such as rural subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Although leptospirosis can cause life-threatening disease, there is no global burden of disease estimate in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) available.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We utilised the results of a parallel publication that reported global estimates of morbidity and mortality due to leptospirosis. We estimated Years of Life Lost (YLLs) from age and gender stratified mortality rates. Years of Life with Disability (YLDs) were developed from a simple disease model indicating likely sequelae. DALYs were estimated from the sum of YLLs and YLDs. The study suggested that globally approximately 2.90 million DALYs are lost per annum (UIs 1.25-4.54 million) from the approximately annual 1.03 million cases reported previously. Males are predominantly affected with an estimated 2.33 million DALYs (UIs 0.98-3.69) or approximately 80% of the total burden. For comparison, this is over 70% of the global burden of cholera estimated by GBD 2010. Tropical regions of South and South-east Asia, Western Pacific, Central and South America, and Africa had the highest estimated leptospirosis disease burden.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospirosis imparts a significant health burden worldwide, which approach or exceed those encountered for a number of other zoonotic and neglected tropical diseases. The study findings indicate that highest burden estimates occur in resource-poor tropical countries, which include regions of Africa where the burden of leptospirosis has been under-appreciated and possibly misallocated to other febrile illnesses such as malaria.","['Torgerson PR', 'Hagan JE', 'Costa F', 'Calcagno J', 'Kane M', 'Martinez-Silveira MS', 'Goris MG', 'Stein C', 'Ko AI', 'Abela-Ridder B']",2015,9,10,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Torgerson PR, et al.

26422413,Disease Risk Assessments Involving Companion Animals: an Overview for 15 Selected Pathogens Taking a European Perspective.,"Prioritization of companion animal transmissible diseases was performed by the Companion Animals multisectoriaL interprofessionaL Interdisciplinary Strategic Think tank On zoonoses (CALLISTO) project. The project considered diseases occurring in domesticated species commonly kept as pets, such as dogs and cats, but also included diseases occurring in captive wild animals and production animal species. The prioritization process led to the selection of 15 diseases of prime public health relevance, agricultural economic importance, or both. An analysis was made of the current knowledge on the risk of occurrence and transmission of these diseases among companion animals, and from companion animals to man (zoonoses) or to livestock. The literature was scanned for risk assessments for these diseases. Studies were classified as import risk assessments (IRAs) or risk factor analyses (RFAs) in endemic areas. For those pathogens that are absent from Europe, only IRAs were considered; for pathogens present throughout Europe, only RFAs were considered. IRAs were identified for seven of the eight diseases totally or partially absent from Europe. IRAs for classical rabies and alveolar echinococcosis found an increased risk for introduction of the pathogen into officially disease-free areas as a consequence of abandoning national rules and adopting the harmonized EU rules for pet travel. IRAs for leishmaniosis focused on risk associated with the presence of persistently infected dogs in new geographical areas, taking into consideration the risk of disease establishment should a competent vector arise. IRAs for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and West Nile fever indicated that the likelihood of introduction via companion animals was low. IRAs for bluetongue paid no attention to the risk of introduction via companion animals, which was also the case for IRAs for foot-and-mouth disease, the only disease considered to be absent from Europe. RFAs dealing with the risk factors for companion animals to become infected were identified for eight of the 14 diseases found in Europe or parts of it. RFAs for leptospirosis were most numerous (four studies). The host related risk factor 'age' was identified as significant for dogs in at least two RFAs for cystic echinococcosis and giardiasis. Among husbandry and healthcare related factors, 'eating (uncooked) offal', 'being free roaming' and 'poor deworming practice' were associated with risk for dogs in at least two RFAs for cystic echinococcosis, while 'having received recent veterinary treatment' was identified as a risk factor in at least two studies on infection with extended spectrum beta lactamase-producing bacteria, one in horses and the other in dogs and cats. Finally, although the environmental factors 'season' and 'hydrological density' were identified as significant risk factors for dogs in at least two RFAs for leptospirosis, the inconsistent case definitions used in those studies made comparison of study results problematic. RFAs considering the risk of people becoming infected from companion animals were identified for eight of the 14 diseases found in Europe or parts of it. RFAs for human campylobacteriosis were the most numerous (n = 6). Most studies made an assessment as to whether keeping a pet per se, or keeping a pet with supposed or known risk factors, was a risk factor for people relative to other risks. This allowed some studies to report the population attributable risk or population attributable fraction of the incidence of human disease due to companion animals (for campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and toxoplasmosis), which is a measure that is easy to perceive for laymen and policy makers. No RFAs were found that dealt with the risk to food animals from companion animals for any of the 15 pathogens investigated. Few risk method-based studies were identified that provided information on risk factors for companion animals and on their role as a source of these 15 selected diseases, indicating a clear knowledge gap. There were not enough assessments for any of the 15 diseases to allow meta-analyses, whether these assessments dealt with companion animal disease risk or companion animal-associated human disease risk. Important method and technology gaps were the lack of harmonization in the case definitions used for a given disease and the lack of good diagnostics allowing pathogen identification to taxonomic levels that are meaningful for risk analysis. Molecular epidemiology studies on zoonotic pathogens, which included companion animals among the potential human risk factors, were not found, although such studies would provide good preliminary insights without requiring any tracing of people or any interviews. In addition to performing further risk studies that take into account these issues, there is a need for responsible pet ownership and continued education of professionals in companion animal zoonoses. Additional risk assessment studies should allow more targeted actions to reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases transferred via companion animals and provide information that will promote risk-awareness in healthy human-animal relationships.","['Rijks JM', 'Cito F', 'Cunningham AA', 'Rantsios AT', 'Giovannini A']",2016,155,1 Suppl 1,J Comp Pathol,"Rijks JM, et al.

26418542,Pulmonary Leptospirosis With Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: High-Resolution Computed Tomographic Findings in 16 Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings from patients with leptospirosis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed HRCT findings from 16 patients diagnosed as having leptospirosis causing DAH. The patient sample was composed of 13 men and 3 women aged 22 to 53 years (mean age, 34.5 years). Diagnosis was established with confirmation of leptospirosis infection by serologic microagglutination test. Histopathological study was performed in 8 patients. Two chest radiologists analyzed the HRCT images and reached decisions by consensus.
RESULTS: The predominant HRCT findings were ground-glass opacities and airspace nodules (both n = 12, 75%), ground-glass nodules (n = 9, 56.25%), consolidations (n = 7, 43.75%), ""crazy-paving"" pattern (n = 3, 18.75%), and interlobular septal thickening without ground-glass opacity (n = 3, 18.75%). Bilateral pleural effusion was an associated finding in 2 (12.5%) patients. Analysis of the axial distribution of the lesions revealed diffuse distribution in 11 (68.75%) patients and peripheral lung zone predominance in 5 (31.25%) patients. Abnormalities were bilateral in all 16 (100%) patients. Analysis of the craniocaudal distribution of the lesions revealed lower zone predominance in 9 (56.25%) patients, diffuse distribution in 5 (31.25%) patients, middle zone predominance in 1 (6.25%) patient, and upper zone predominance in 1 (6.25%) patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent HRCT findings in patients with leptospirosis causing DAH were ground-glass opacities, airspace nodules, ground-glass nodules, and consolidations. The lesions showed symmetrical distribution with lower zone predominance in most cases.","['von Ranke FM', 'Zanetti G', 'Escuissato DL', 'Hochhegger B', 'Marchiori E']",2016,40,1,J Comput Assist Tomogr,"von Ranke FM, et al.

26415509,Gloriosa superba poisoning mimicking an acute infection- a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Gloriosa superba (GSb) is a highly poisonous plant and its toxicity is due to anti-mitotic effects of constituents such as colchicine and gloriosine on rapidly proliferating cells. Poisoning is known to cause very rapid and severe clinical manifestations due gastro intestinal, neurological, cardiac and bone marrow toxicity.
CASE PRESENTATION: A young male presented with an acute onset febrile illness associated with diarrhoea, confusion, haematuria and aggressive behavior of 4 days duration. He developed subconjunctival haemorrhages, bleeding gums, neck stiffness, bilateral papilloedema, tender hepatomegaly and features suggestive of subacute intestinal obstruction. He had progressive reduction in white cell counts, platelets and derrangements in liver functions. The illness mimicked acute severe leptospirosis or dengue. On day 9 of illness he started to loose his hair and was totally alopecic by day 14. At this stage of illness, possibility of GSb poisoning was suspected. He admitted the act of self harm after repeated questioning.
CONCLUSION: His presentation mimicked an acute severe tropical febrile illness such as leptospirosis or dengue until he started to loose his hair. Therefore we feel that Clinicians practicing in tropical setting where Gloriosa superba is endemic should be aware of its clinical presentations and should always consider the possibility of ingestion of Gloriosa superba when the patient has pancytopenia and develops shedding of hairs which results in total alopecia in a case of unexplained gastroenterocolitis, rather investigating.","['Premaratna R', 'Weerasinghe MS', 'Premawardana NP', 'de Silva HJ']",2015,16,,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,"Premaratna R, et al.

26408270,Usage of a selective media (EMJH-STAFF) in primary culturing of pathogenic leptospires from bovine clinical samples.,"UNLABELLED: Isolation of local strains is mandatory for the success of control programs. However, clinical samples are typically contaminated by other bacteria, which impair leptospires growth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a previously reported EMJH-STAFF media in the recovery of pathogenic leptospires from bovine clinical samples, namely urine (n = 123) and vaginal fluid-VF (n = 102). EMJH-STAFF presented less contamination than EMJH (<0·005), which was more evident in VF culture tubes. Nine pure leptospires cultures were obtained, six from urine (4·9%) and three from VF (2·9%). From those, seven grew on EMJH-STAFF, one on EMJH and one in both media. All the isolates were confirmed as pathogenic leptospires by lipL32-PCR, and sequencing of partial rrs showed them to belong to Leptospira noguchii, Leptospira santarosai and Leptospira interrogans species. EMJH-STAFF media was an important tool in the recovery of leptospires from bovine clinical samples.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The slow growth of leptospires and overgrowth of co-existing micro-organisms from environmental and microbiota are the major difficult to recovery Leptospira from animal clinical samples. Implementing an efficient control programme is essential to determine circulating leptospires in the region and their reservoirs. This study evaluated the relationship of a selective media (EMJH-STAFF) on the recovery of pathogenic leptospires (Leptospira noguchii, Leptospira santarosai and Leptospira interrogans), from bovine clinical samples (urine and vaginal fluid). EMJH-STAFF seems to be an important tool in obtaining local strains for epidemiological and control purposes.","['Loureiro AP', 'Martins G', 'Pinto P', 'Narduche L', 'Teixeira RC', 'Lilenbaum W']",2015,61,6,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Loureiro AP, et al.

26394405,Epidemiology of Tropical Neglected Diseases in Ecuador in the Last 20 Years.,"BACKGROUND: Tropical and zoonotic diseases are major problems in developing countries like Ecuador. Poorly designed houses, the high proportion of isolated indigenous population and under developed infrastructure represent a fertile environment for vectors to proliferate. Control campaigns in Ecuador over the years have had varying success, depending on the disease and vectors targeted.
AIMS: In our study we analyse the current situation of some neglected diseases in Ecuador and the efficiency of the control campaigns (by measuring changes in numbers of cases reported) that the Ecuadorian government has been running to limit the spread of these infectious and parasitic diseases.
RESULTS: Our study reveals that Brucellosis, Chagas Disease, Rabies and Onchocerciasis have been controlled, but small outbreaks are still detected in endemic areas. Leptospirosis and Echinococcosis have been increasing steadily in recent years in Ecuador since the first records. The same increase has been reported world-wide also. Better diagnosis has resulted in a higher number of cases being identified, particularly with regard to the linking of outdoor activities and contact with farm animals as contributing vectors. Improvements in diagnosis are due to regular professional training, implementation of automatized systems, establishing diagnosis protocols and the creation of an epidemiological vigilance network that acts as soon as a case is reported.
CONCLUSION: Control campaigns performed in Ecuador have been successful in recent years, although natural phenomena limit their efficiency. Leptospirosis and Echinococcosis infections remain a growing problem in Ecuador as it is worldwide.","['Cartelle Gestal M', 'Holban AM', 'Escalante S', 'Cevallos M']",2015,10,9,PLoS One,"Cartelle Gestal M, et al.

26392297,Beyond Rabies: Are Free-Ranging Skunks (Mephitis mephitis) in British Columbia Reservoirs of Emerging Infection?,"Wild animal reservoirs are an important source of emerging and zoonotic infection. Skunks (Mephitis mephitis) are a reservoir of skunk strain rabies virus in Canada, with the exception of some areas including the province of British Columbia (BC). Beyond rabies, the reservoir status of skunks for emerging and zoonotic pathogens in BC is unknown. From March 2011 to February 2015, 50 free-ranging skunks were necropsied and tested for 4 pathogens: influenza A, Aleutian disease virus (ADV), Leptospira spp. and Salmonella spp. Two skunks (4%) with respiratory disease caused by influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 were detected during the human flu season suggesting that skunks may represent a target population for reverse zoonosis of this strain of influenza A virus. High prevalence of ADV infection was detected (43/50, 86%). Two of the infected skunks exhibited Aleutian disease (AD) suggesting that skunks act as both a reservoir and a target population for the virus. Most studies of ADV have focused on the potential for infection of free-ranging species living near mink farms. Our study suggests that urban skunks may be a primary host for the virus independent of domestic mink. Whether skunks act as a reservoir of ADV infection for other peridomestic species will depend on host specificity of the viral strains. Leptospira interrogans was detected in 18% (9/49) of the skunks. Identification of the serovar(s) detected is needed to determine any public health risk of leptospirosis following exposure to infected skunks. Salmonella spp. was isolated from three of 43 skunks (7%), specifically S. Typhimurium, S. Muenchen and S. Enteritidis. These serotypes cause disease in humans, but the low prevalence of infection suggests there is a low risk for zoonotic transmission.","['Britton AP', 'Redford T', 'Bidulka JJ', 'Scouras AP', 'Sojonky KR', 'Zabek E', 'Schwantje H', 'Joseph T']",2017,64,2,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Britton AP, et al.

26379143,Global Morbidity and Mortality of Leptospirosis: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a spirochaetal zoonosis, occurs in diverse epidemiological settings and affects vulnerable populations, such as rural subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Although leptospirosis is a life-threatening disease and recognized as an important cause of pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome, the lack of global estimates for morbidity and mortality has contributed to its neglected disease status.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review of published morbidity and mortality studies and databases to extract information on disease incidence and case fatality ratios. Linear regression and Monte Carlo modelling were used to obtain age and gender-adjusted estimates of disease morbidity for countries and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO regions. We estimated mortality using models that incorporated age and gender-adjusted disease morbidity and case fatality ratios. The review identified 80 studies on disease incidence from 34 countries that met quality criteria. In certain regions, such as Africa, few quality assured studies were identified. The regression model, which incorporated country-specific variables of population structure, life expectancy at birth, distance from the equator, tropical island, and urbanization, accounted for a significant proportion (R(2) = 0.60) of the variation in observed disease incidence. We estimate that there were annually 1.03 million cases (95% CI 434,000-1,750,000) and 58,900 deaths (95% CI 23,800-95,900) due to leptospirosis worldwide. A large proportion of cases (48%, 95% CI 40-61%) and deaths (42%, 95% CI 34-53%) were estimated to occur in adult males with age of 20-49 years. Highest estimates of disease morbidity and mortality were observed in GBD regions of South and Southeast Asia, Oceania, Caribbean, Andean, Central, and Tropical Latin America, and East Sub-Saharan Africa.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospirosis is among the leading zoonotic causes of morbidity worldwide and accounts for numbers of deaths, which approach or exceed those for other causes of haemorrhagic fever. Highest morbidity and mortality were estimated to occur in resource-poor countries, which include regions where the burden of leptospirosis has been underappreciated.","['Costa F', 'Hagan JE', 'Calcagno J', 'Kane M', 'Torgerson P', 'Martinez-Silveira MS', 'Stein C', 'Abela-Ridder B', 'Ko AI']",2015,9,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Costa F, et al.

26379035,Environmental and Behavioural Determinants of Leptospirosis Transmission: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases, which is of global medical and veterinary importance, and also a re-emerging infectious disease. The main tracks of transmission are known; however, the relative importance of each of the components and the respective environmental risk factors are unclear. We aimed to assess and specify quantitative evidence of environmental risks of leptospirosis transmission.
METHODS/FINDINGS: A database of pre-selected studies, with publication dates from 1970 until 2008, was provided by an expert group. The database has been updated until 2015 using a text mining algorithm. Study selection was based on stringent quality criteria. A descriptive data analysis was performed to calculate the medians of the log transformed odds ratios. From a selection of 2723 unique publications containing information on leptospirosis, 428 papers dealing with risk factors were identified. Of these, 53 fulfilled the quality criteria, allowing us to identify trends in different geo-climatic regions. Water associated exposures were, with few exceptions, associated with an increased leptospirosis risk. In resource poor countries, floods and rainfall were of particular importance, whereas recreational water activities were more relevant in developed countries. Rodents were associated with increased leptospirosis risk, but the variation among studies was high, which might be partly explained by differences in exposure definition. Livestock contact was commonly associated with increased risk; however, several studies found no association. The median odds ratios associated with dog and cat contacts were close to unity. Sanitation and behavioural risk factors were almost always strongly associated with leptospirosis, although their impact was rarely investigated in Europe or North America.
CONCLUSION: This review confirms the complex environmental transmission pathways of leptospirosis, as previously established. Although, floods appeared to be among the most important drivers on islands and in Asia, the consistent pattern observed for exposure to rodents and behavioural and sanitation related risk factors indicate potential areas for intervention.","['Mwachui MA', 'Crump L', 'Hartskeerl R', 'Zinsstag J', 'Hattendorf J']",2015,9,9,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Mwachui MA, et al.

26373626,Leptospirosis infection in a homeless patient in December in Tokyo: a case report.,"INTRODUCTION: We report a case of severe leptospirosis that occurred during winter in Tokyo, the capital of Japan. Leptospirosis is endemic in tropical regions and extremely rare in the urban areas of Japan. Only six new cases were reported in Tokyo in 2014. Most leptospirosis cases reported in urban areas of Japan were a result of occupational hazards, and there is no previous report of leptospirosis in a homeless patient in Tokyo. We believe this report could provide a widened perspective about the clinical presentation and epidemiology of leptospirosis in Japan.
CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 73-year-old Asian man. He had been homeless for over 10 years, with exposure to rodents and their excrement in parks and on the streets. He presented with fever and severe inflammatory response, satisfying the diagnostic criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Laboratory findings showed multiple-organ dysfunction, including renal failure, liver failure with increased total bilirubin level, and coagulopathy with decreased platelets. We suspected leptospirosis on the basis of these clinical findings. The diagnosis was also confirmed by polymerase chain reaction first, and paired antibody titers on day 9, in the recovery period, showed positive results for three species.
CONCLUSIONS: Our patient's case suggests that even patients without a history of traveling abroad or exposure to freshwater can develop leptospirosis in winter in urban areas in Japan. If a patient has symptoms like fever, calf pain and MOF; as a differential diagnosis we should rule outthe Leptospirosis. From the perspective of sensitivity, specificity, and clinical convenience, polymerase chain reaction could be the preferred diagnostic tool of choice.","['Kang YM', 'Hagiwara A', 'Uemura T']",2015,9,,J Med Case Rep,"Kang YM, et al.

26363628,Epidemiology of travel-associated infections in Oman 1999-2013: A retrospective analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The number of travelers in Oman has increased significantly in the last 2 decades with an increase in the expatriate population workforce leading to the emergence of infections related to travel. This paper aims to highlight the burden of travel-related infections in Oman.
METHOD: Our study is a descriptive record-based review and analysis of travel-associated diseases over a 14 year time period from 1999 to 2013. The data was sourced from the communicable disease surveillance system, and central public health laboratory results.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2013 there were a combined total of 7022 cases of cholera, chikungunya, dengue, filariasis, leptospirosis, meningococcal infection, poliomyelitis, measles, schistosomiasis, viral hepatitis (A), typhoid and para-typhoid reported to and subsequently investigated by the Department of Communicable Diseases. Among these cases, 558 (7.9%) were attributed to travel. Fifty percent of these patients were admitted to hospitals.
CONCLUSION: Travel-associated infections account for about 8% of notifiable infections in Oman and have low mortality rate. However, some travel-associated infections are considered as a threat to polio eradication and measles elimination programs. Furthermore, some can cause outbreaks that can overwhelm the healthcare system.","['Al-Abri SS', 'Abdel-Hady DM', 'Al Mahrooqi SS', 'Al-Kindi HS', 'Al-Jardani AK', 'Al-Abaidani IS']",2015,13,5,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Al-Abri SS, et al.

26350325,Infectious Risks of Traveling Abroad.,"A popular leisure activity, international travel can be associated with some infections. The most common travel-related illnesses appear to be gastrointestinal, dermatologic, respiratory, and systemic febrile syndromes. The pretravel medical consultation includes immunizations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, self-treatment for traveler's diarrhea, and advice on the prevention of a myriad of other infectious causes including dengue, chikungunya, rickettsiosis, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis. Travel to locations experiencing outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and chikungunya call for specific alerts on preventive strategies. After travel, evaluation of an ill traveler must explore details of exposure, including destinations visited; activities; ingestion of contaminated food or drinks; contact with vectors, animals, fresh water, or blood and body fluids; and other potential exposures. Knowledge of the geographic distribution of infectious diseases is important in generating the differential diagnoses and testing accordingly. Empiric treatment is sometimes necessary when suspicion of a certain diagnosis is strong and confirmatory tests are delayed or lacking, particularly for infections that are rapidly progressive (for example, malaria) or for which timing of testing is prolonged (such as leptospirosis).","['Chen LH', 'Blair BM']",2015,3,4,Microbiol Spectr,Chen LH and Blair BM.

26350317,Diseases Transmitted by Man's Best Friend: The Dog.,"The relationship between dogs and humans is ancient and mutually beneficial. Dogs have served people well as companions, workmates, guides, and protectors. However, on occasion, dogs may injure humans through biting or may transmit pathogens resulting in a large number of problems ranging from a trivial rash to life-threatening bacteremia. Given that there are more than 80 million pet dogs in the United States, it is worth knowing the potential problems that can result from canine exposure. Annually, almost 5 million people in the United States suffer a dog bite. Dog bite wounds become infected up to 15% of the time. In those who have had a splenectomy, a dog bite may transmit the bacterium Capnocytophaga canimorsus, leading to life-threatening bacteremia. Other illnesses that humans can acquire from dog contact include ringworm, diarrheal disease (salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, and intestinal parasites), leptospirosis, brucellosis, Q fever, visceral larva migrans, and echinococcosis. Evidence exists that the family dog may serve as a reservoir for uropathogenic Escherichia coli that can lead to urinary tract infections among human household contacts. In this article we discuss dog-related infectious diseases as well as measures to minimize dog-associated illness (e.g., do not disturb sleeping dogs; HIV-infected persons who wish to acquire a puppy should have the dog's stool checked for Cryptosporidium).","['Jacob J', 'Lorber B']",2015,3,4,Microbiol Spectr,Jacob J and Lorber B.

26341206,Control of Gene Expression in Leptospira spp. by Transcription Activator-Like Effectors Demonstrates a Potential Role for LigA and LigB in Leptospira interrogans Virulence.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that affects ∼1 million people annually, with a mortality rate of >10%. Currently, there is an absence of effective genetic manipulation tools for targeted mutagenesis in pathogenic leptospires. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are a recently described group of repressors that modify transcriptional activity in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells by directly binding to a targeted sequence within the host genome. To determine the applicability of TALEs within Leptospira spp., two TALE constructs were designed. First, a constitutively expressed TALE gene specific for the lacO-like region upstream of bgaL was trans inserted in the saprophyte Leptospira biflexa (the TALEβgal strain). Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis and enzymatic assays demonstrated that BgaL was not expressed in the TALEβgal strain. Second, to study the role of LigA and LigB in pathogenesis, a constitutively expressed TALE gene with specificity for the homologous promoter regions of ligA and ligB was cis inserted into the pathogen Leptospira interrogans (TALElig). LigA and LigB expression was studied by using three independent clones: TALElig1, TALElig2, and TALElig3. Immunoblot analysis of osmotically induced TALElig clones demonstrated 2- to 9-fold reductions in the expression levels of LigA and LigB, with the highest reductions being noted for TALElig1 and TALElig2, which were avirulent in vivo and nonrecoverable from animal tissues. This study reconfirms galactosidase activity in the saprophyte and suggests a role for LigA and LigB in pathogenesis. Collectively, this study demonstrates that TALEs are effective at reducing the expression of targeted genes within saprophytic and pathogenic strains of Leptospira spp., providing an additional genetic manipulation tool for this genus.","['Pappas CJ', 'Picardeau M']",2015,81,22,Appl Environ Microbiol,Pappas CJ and Picardeau M.

26340095,Lipopolysaccharide Specific Immunochromatography Based Lateral Flow Assay for Serogroup Specific Diagnosis of Leptospirosis in India.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a re-emerging infectious disease that is under-recognized due to low-sensitivity and cumbersome serological tests. MAT is the gold standard test and it is the only serogroup specific test used till date. Rapid reliable alternative serogroup specific tests are needed for surveillance studies to identify locally circulating serogroups in the study area.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present investigation the serological specificity of leptospiral lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was evaluated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), dot blot assay and rapid immunochromatography based lateral flow assay (ICG-LFA). Sera samples from 120 MAT positive cases, 174 cases with febrile illness other than leptospirosis, and 121 seronegative healthy controls were evaluated for the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the developed assays. LPS was extracted from five locally predominant circulating serogroups including: Australis (27.5%), Autumnalis (11.7%), Ballum (25.8%), Grippotyphosa (12.5%), Pomona (10%) and were used as antigens in the diagnostics to detect IgM antibodies in patients' sera. The sensitivity observed by IgM ELISA and dot blot assay using various leptospiral LPS was >90% for homologous sera. Except for Ballum LPS, no other LPS showed cross-reactivity to heterologous sera. An attempt was made to develop LPS based ICG-LFA for rapid and sensitive serogroup specific diagnostics of leptospirosis. The developed ICG-LFA showed sensitivity in the range between 93 and 100% for homologous sera. The Wilcoxon analysis showed LPS based ICG-LFA did not differ significantly from the gold standard MAT (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: The application of single array of LPS for serogroup specific diagnosis is first of its kind. The developed assay could potentially be evaluated and employed for as MAT alternative.","['Vanithamani S', 'Shanmughapriya S', 'Narayanan R', 'Raja V', 'Kanagavel M', 'Sivasankari K', 'Natarajaseenivasan K']",2015,10,9,PLoS One,"Vanithamani S, et al.

26296603,Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis of Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira borgpetersenii isolated from small feral and wild mammals in East Asia.,"Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of a worldwide zoonosis, leptospirosis, maintained by various mammals. Each Leptospira serovar is frequently associated with a particular maintenance host, and recently, Leptospira genotype-host association has also been suggested to limit serovars to restricted areas. We investigated the molecular characteristics of L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii which were isolated from small feral and wild animals in four East Asian states using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). MLVA using 11 loci was performed on 110 L. interrogans serogroups from Japan (79 strains of 5 serogroups from 3 animal species), Philippines (21; 3; 2), Taiwan (7; 2; 3), and Vietnam (3; 1; 1). A MLVA method using 4 loci for L. borgpetersenii was established and performed on 52 isolates from Japan (26; 3; 7), Philippines (13; 1; 2), and Taiwan (13; 1; 3). In L. interrogans, serogroups Autumnalis and Hebdomadis appeared more genetically diverse than serogroups Bataviae, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, or Pyrogenes. The former serogroup strains with the exception of one Hebdomadis strain were isolated from Apodemus speciosus while all the latter serogroup strains with the exception of Grippotyphosa were isolated from Rattus norvegicus. L. borgpetersenii was isolated from at least 11 animal species while L. interrogans was isolated from five species, which might suggest a wider host range for L. borgpetersenii. Broad host preference in a single genotype was also observed, which colonized not only different species of the same genera but also multiple animal genera. This study demonstrates that there may be variability in the range of genetic diversity among different Leptospira serogroups, which may be attributed to maintenance host animals and environmental factors.","['Koizumi N', 'Izumiya H', 'Mu JJ', 'Arent Z', 'Okano S', 'Nakajima C', 'Suzuki Y', 'Mizutani Muto M', 'Tanikawa T', 'Taylor KR', 'Komatsu N', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Thi Thu Ha H', 'Ohnishi M']",2015,36,,Infect Genet Evol,"Koizumi N, et al.

26283339,Leptospira interrogans lpxD Homologue Is Required for Thermal Acclimatization and Virulence.,"Leptospirosis is an emerging disease with an annual occurrence of over 1 million human cases worldwide. Pathogenic Leptospira bacteria are maintained in zoonotic cycles involving a diverse array of mammals, with the capacity to survive outside the host in aquatic environments. Survival in the diverse environments encountered by Leptospira likely requires various adaptive mechanisms. Little is known about Leptospira outer membrane modification systems, which may contribute to the capacity of these bacteria to successfully inhabit and colonize diverse environments and animal hosts. Leptospira bacteria carry two genes annotated as UDP-3-O-[3-hydroxymyristoyl] glucosamine N-acyltransferase genes (la0512 and la4326 [lpxD1 and lpxD2]) that in other bacteria are involved in the early steps of biosynthesis of lipid A, the membrane lipid anchor of lipopolysaccharide. Inactivation of only one of these genes, la0512/lpxD1, imparted sensitivity to the host physiological temperature (37°C) and rendered the bacteria avirulent in an animal infection model. Polymyxin B sensitivity assays revealed compromised outer membrane integrity in the lpxD1 mutant at host physiological temperature, but structural analysis of lipid A in the mutant revealed only minor changes in the lipid A moiety compared to that found in the wild-type strain. In accordance with this, an in trans complementation restored the phenotypes to a level comparable to that of the wild-type strain. These results suggest that the gene annotated as lpxD1 in Leptospira interrogans plays an important role in temperature adaptation and virulence in the animal infection model.","['Eshghi A', 'Henderson J', 'Trent MS', 'Picardeau M']",2015,83,11,Infect Immun,"Eshghi A, et al.

26281489,Leptospiral Uveitis.,"Leptospirosis is widely regarded as the most widespread zoonosis in the world. Systemic leptospirosis is a biphasic illness. Ocular involvement in leptospirosis has been reported to be extremely variable, ranging from 2% to 90%. Ocular involvement is seen both in the systemic bacteraemic phase as well as in the immunological phase. Leptospiral uveitis is a common entity in the tropical countries. However it remains underdiagnosed mainly because ocular manifestations are noted in the second phase of illness. The primary anatomical location of inflammation is either in the anterior segment or pan uveitis. We report the case of a 40 year old lady who had presented to us with leptospiral uveitis.","['Koshy JM', 'Koshy J', 'John M', 'Loomba V', 'Deodhar D']",2014,62,11,J Assoc Physicians India,"Koshy JM, et al.

26274394,Role of sph2 Gene Regulation in Hemolytic and Sphingomyelinase Activities Produced by Leptospira interrogans.,"Pathogenic members of the genus Leptospira are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a neglected disease of public and veterinary health concern. Leptospirosis is a systemic disease that in its severest forms leads to renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, and pulmonary failure. Many strains of Leptospira produce hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities, and a number of candidate leptospiral hemolysins have been identified based on sequence similarity to well-characterized bacterial hemolysins. Five of the putative hemolysins are sphingomyelinase paralogs. Although recombinant forms of the sphingomyelinase Sph2 and other hemolysins lyse erythrocytes, none have been demonstrated to contribute to the hemolytic activity secreted by leptospiral cells. In this study, we examined the regulation of sph2 and its relationship to hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities produced by several L. interrogans strains cultivated under the osmotic conditions found in the mammalian host. The sph2 gene was poorly expressed when the Fiocruz L1-130 (serovar Copenhageni), 56601 (sv. Lai), and L495 (sv. Manilae) strains were cultivated in the standard culture medium EMJH. Raising EMJH osmolarity to physiological levels with sodium chloride enhanced Sph2 production in all three strains. In addition, the Pomona subtype kennewicki strain LC82-25 produced substantially greater amounts of Sph2 during standard EMJH growth than the other strains, and sph2 expression increased further by addition of salt. When 10% rat serum was present in EMJH along with the sodium chloride supplement, Sph2 production increased further in all strains. Osmotic regulation and differences in basal Sph2 production in the Manilae L495 and Pomona strains correlated with the levels of secreted hemolysin and sphingomyelinase activities. Finally, a transposon insertion in sph2 dramatically reduced hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities during incubation of L. interrogans at physiologic osmolarity. Complementation of the mutation with the sph2 gene partially restored production of hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities. These results indicate that the sph2 gene product contributes to the hemolytic and sphingomyelinase activities secreted by L. interrogans and most likely dominates those functions under the culture condition tested.","['Narayanavari SA', 'Lourdault K', 'Sritharan M', 'Haake DA', 'Matsunaga J']",2015,9,8,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Narayanavari SA, et al.

26269796,Cluster of Leptospirosis Acquired Through River Surfing in Switzerland.,"Background.  In Switzerland, leptospirosis is still considered as a travel-associated disease. After the surprising diagnosis of leptospirosis in a patient who was initially suspected as having primary human immunodeficiency virus infection, we recognized that acquisition of leptospirosis occurred through recreational activities and we identified additional affected individuals. Methods.  Detailed anamnesis, excluding occupational exposure, acquisition abroad, and pet contacts, enabled us to detect the source of infection and identify a cluster of leptospirosis. Convalescent sera testing was performed to confirm Leptospira infection. Microscopic agglutination tests were used to determine the infecting serovar. Results.  We identified a cluster of leptospirosis in young, previously healthy persons. Acquisition of leptospirosis was traced back to a surfing spot on a river in Switzerland (Reuss, Aargau). Clinical presentation was indistinct. Two of the 3 reported cases required hospitalization, and 1 case even suffered from meningitis. Serologic tests indicated infection with the serovar Grippotyphosa in all cases. With the exception of the case with meningitis, no antibiotics were administered, because leptospirosis was diagnosed after spontaneous resolution of most symptoms. Despite a prolonged period of convalescence in 2 cases, full recovery was achieved. Recent reports on beavers suffering from leptospirosis in this region underline the possible water-borne infection of the 3 cases and raise the question of potential wildlife reservoirs. Conclusions.  Insufficient awareness of caregivers, which may be promoted by the missing obligation to report human leptospirosis, combined with the multifaceted presentation of the disease result in significant underdiagnosis. More frequent consideration of leptospirosis as differential diagnosis is inevitable, particularly as veterinary data suggest re-emergence of the disease.","['Schreiber PW', 'Aceto L', 'Korach R', 'Marreros N', 'Ryser-Degiorgis MP', 'Günthard HF']",2015,2,3,Open Forum Infect Dis,"Schreiber PW, et al.

26261776,"Severe scrub typhus infection: Clinical features, diagnostic challenges and management.","Scrub typhus infection is an important cause of acute undifferentiated fever in South East Asia. The clinical picture is characterized by sudden onset fever with chills and non-specific symptoms that include headache, myalgia, sweating and vomiting. The presence of an eschar, in about half the patients with proven scrub typhus infection and usually seen in the axilla, groin or inguinal region, is characteristic of scrub typhus. Common laboratory findings are elevated liver transaminases, thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. About a third of patients admitted to hospital with scrub typhus infection have evidence of organ dysfunction that may include respiratory failure, circulatory shock, mild renal or hepatic dysfunction, central nervous system involvement or hematological abnormalities. Since the symptoms and signs are non-specific and resemble other tropical infections like malaria, enteric fever, dengue or leptospirosis, appropriate laboratory tests are necessary to confirm diagnosis. Serological assays are the mainstay of diagnosis as they are easy to perform; the reference test is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the detection of IgM antibodies. However in clinical practice, the enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay is done due to the ease of performing this test and a good sensitivity and sensitivity when compared with the IFA. Paired samples, obtained at least two weeks apart, demonstrating a ≥ 4 fold rise in titre, is necessary for confirmation of serologic diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is the tetracycline group of antibiotics or chloramphenicol although macrolides are used alternatively. In mild cases, recovery is complete.

26261162,Leptospirosis among the self-supporting convicts of Andaman Island during the 1920s--the first report on pulmonary haemorrhage in leptospirosis?,"Several researchers had carried out investigations on the possibility of existence of Weil's disease in Andaman Islands during early 20 th century. The first report of a series of confirmed cases of leptospirosis that occurred during 1929 was published in 1931.There were several reports during 1995 to 2009 that described detailed account of leptospirosis including various clinical syndromes. The possibility of pulmonary involvement in leptospirosis being a manifestation historically overlooked rather than newly emerged during the past two decades is examined in this review in the context of Andaman Islands. Two case series of leptospirosis, one occurred in 1929 and the other in 1996-1997 were reviewed with special emphasis on pulmonary involvement and haemorrhagic manifestations. The similarities and differences in the clinical profile of patients of the two case series were analysed. The review shows that respiratory system involvement and pulmonary haemorrhage as evidenced by presence of haemoptysis as a complication of leptospirosis was occurring during 1920s in Andaman Islands. The incidence of pulmonary involvement, however, rose from 9.4 per cent during 1929 to 52 per cent in 1996-1997. The case fatality ratio in patients with pulmonary involvement, which was 50 per cent during 1929 and 42.9 per cent during 1996-1997, was higher than that in cases without pulmonary involvement.Fever, conjunctival congestion, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhoea, hepatomagaly, haemoptysis, haematemesis and subconjunctival haemorrhage were common in both series. The case series in Andaman Islands in 1929 was probably the first report of pulmonary haemorrhage as a manifestation of leptospirosis. The increase in the incidence of pulmonary involvement in leptospirosis in the recent past is probably due to the increase in the density and diversity of its animal vectors,the broadening of the range of circulating serovars and the interactions between the vector and the agent. An increased virulence of Leptospira through gene acquisition and loss on an evolutionary time scale and the resulting change in the gene content, gene order and gene expression cannot be ruled out.","['Vijayachari P', 'Sugunan AP', 'Singh SS', 'Mathur PP']",2015,142,1,Indian J Med Res,"Vijayachari P, et al.

26259957,Evaluation of two immunodiagnostic tests for early rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis in Sri Lanka: a preliminary study.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is often treated based on clinical diagnosis. There is a need for rapid laboratory diagnosis for this condition. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of two rapid IgM based immunodiagnostic assays with the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), in acute leptospirosis infection.
METHODS: MAT, IgM based immunochromatographic test (Leptocheck-WB) and IgM ELISA were performed using acute sera of patients clinically suspected to have leptospirosis (n = 83). Bayesian latent class modeling was used to compare the accuracy of these tests.
RESULTS: Percentage positivity for MAT, Leptocheck-WB, and IgM ELISA were 48.1, 55.3, and 45.7 % respectively. Bayesian latent class modeling showed a combined positivity rate of leptospirosis of 44.7 %. The sensitivity of MAT, Leptocheck-WB and IgM ELISA were 91.4, 95 and 81.1 %, and specificity were 86.7, 76.4 and 83.1 %, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptocheck-WB has high sensitivity, and, because it is quick and easy to perform, would be a good screening test for acute leptospirosis infection. IgM ELISA has good specificity, and is comparable with MAT; given that it is easier to perform and more widely available than MAT, it would be a more appropriate confirmatory test for use in hospitals with limited access to a specialized laboratory.","['Eugene EJ', 'Handunnetti SM', 'Wickramasinghe SA', 'Kalugalage TL', 'Rodrigo C', 'Wickremesinghe H', 'Dikmadugoda N', 'Somaratne P', 'De Silva HJ', 'Rajapakse S']",2015,15,,BMC Infect Dis,"Eugene EJ, et al.

Between 2006 and 2012, the cumulative incidence of HL in Korea was higher than that in Japan (1.26 vs. 0.14 per 100,000 population, respectively), and the total reported cases were 632 and 196, respectively. Significantly more men were infected than women in both Korea (63.0% men, P < 0.01) and Japan (87.8% men, P < 0.01). In both countries, the incidence was highest among those aged 40 years and older (60%), and peaked in autumn (78.5% cases in Korea, and 46.9% cases in Japan). However, Japan exhibited a significantly higher proportion of male cases, a younger age distribution, and less prominent seasonality. A significant difference was observed in the incidence of HL between the capital city and rural areas in Korea, but not in Japan. The differences in agricultural and forestry practices, and the efficacy or wastewater treatment infrastructure might influence the incidence level in rural areas in both countries. The differences between the 2 countries might be because of their unique geographical characteristics and variations in their levels of industrialization.","['Lee MJ', 'Miki S', 'Kitagawa M', 'Lee WC']",2016,69,3,Jpn J Infect Dis,"Lee MJ, et al.

26247102,Comparative genomic analyses of transport proteins encoded within the genomes of Leptospira species.,"Select species of the bacterial genus Leptospira are causative agents of leptospirosis, an emerging global zoonosis affecting nearly one million people worldwide annually. We examined two Leptospira pathogens, Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai str. 56601 and Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo-bovis str. L550, as well as the free-living leptospiral saprophyte, Leptospira biflexa serovar Patoc str. 'Patoc 1 (Ames)'. The transport proteins of these leptospires were identified and compared using bioinformatics to gain an appreciation for which proteins may be related to pathogenesis and saprophytism. L. biflexa possesses a disproportionately high number of secondary carriers for metabolite uptake and environmental adaptability as well as an increased number of inorganic cation transporters providing ionic homeostasis and effective osmoregulation in a rapidly changing environment. L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii possess far fewer transporters, but those that they have are remarkably similar, with near-equivalent representation in most transporter families. These two Leptospira pathogens also possess intact sphingomyelinases, holins, and virulence-related outer membrane porins. These virulence-related factors, in conjunction with decreased transporter substrate versatility, indicate that pathogenicity was accompanied by progressively narrowing ecological niches and the emergence of a limited set of proteins responsible for host invasion. The variability of host tropism and mortality rates by infectious leptospires suggests that small differences in individual sets of proteins play important physiological and pathological roles.","['Buyuktimkin B', 'Saier MH']",2015,88,,Microb Pathog,Buyuktimkin B and Saier MH.

No positive culture was obtained, but DNA was detected by qPCR on urine samples (26.3%), VF (44.7%) and EB (18.4%) collected 2 months or longer following diagnosis of early fetal death and endometritis. Leptospira cell aggregations were visible by indirect immunofluorescence on 57.1% (4/7) EBs and 17.6% (3/17) VFs. A total of 18 amplicons showed interpretable sequences. Out of those 18 amplicons, 15 presented 100% of identity with the species L. interrogans (sv Bratislava and Pomona), while three were L. borgpertersenii. This study suggests the presence of leptospires in the uterus of mares with reproductive problems. Moreover, serology was shown not to be indicated for the diagnosis of presumptive Leptospira infection in early gestation. The most common agent of the genital infection in those mares was L. interrogans, most probably sg Australis.","['Hamond C', 'Pestana CP', 'Rocha-de-Souza CM', 'Cunha LE', 'Brandão FZ', 'Medeiros MA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2015,179,3-4,Vet Microbiol,"Hamond C, et al.

26207827,Leptospirosis in Mexico: Epidemiology and Potential Distribution of Human Cases.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is widespread in Mexico, yet the potential distribution and risk of the disease remain unknown.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analysed morbidity and mortality according to age and gender based on three sources of data reported by the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Geography and Statics of Mexico, for the decade 2000-2010. A total of 1,547 cases were reported in 27 states, the majority of which were registered during the rainy season, and the most affected age group was 25-44 years old. Although leptospirosis has been reported as an occupational disease of males, analysis of morbidity in Mexico showed no male preference. A total number of 198 deaths were registered in 21 states, mainly in urban settings. Mortality was higher in males (61.1%) as compared to females (38.9%), and the case fatality ratio was also increased in males. The overall case fatality ratio in Mexico was elevated (12.8%), as compared to other countries. We additionally determined the potential disease distribution by examining the spatial epidemiology combined with spatial modeling using ecological niche modeling techniques. We identified regions where leptospirosis could be present and created a potential distribution map using bioclimatic variables derived from temperature and precipitation. Our data show that the distribution of the cases was more related to temperature (75%) than to precipitation variables. Ecological niche modeling showed predictive areas that were widely distributed in central and southern Mexico, excluding areas characterized by extreme climates.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, an epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis is recommended in Mexico, since 55.7% of the country has environmental conditions fulfilling the criteria that favor the presence of the disease.","['Sánchez-Montes S', 'Espinosa-Martínez DV', 'Ríos-Muñoz CA', 'Berzunza-Cruz M', 'Becker I']",2015,10,7,PLoS One,"Sánchez-Montes S, et al.

26178973,'Spotted Nanoflowers': Gold-seeded Zinc Oxide Nanohybrid for Selective Bio-capture.,"Hybrid gold nanostructures seeded into nanotextured zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoflowers (NFs) were created for novel biosensing applications. The selected 'spotted NFs' had a 30-nm-thick gold nanoparticle (AuNP) layer, chosen from a range of AuNP thicknesses, sputtered onto the surface. The generated nanohybrids, characterized by morphological, physical and structural analyses, were uniformly AuNP-seeded onto the ZnO NFs with an average length of 2-3 μm. Selective capture of molecular probes onto the seeded AuNPs was evidence for the specific interaction with DNA from pathogenic Leptospirosis-causing strains via hybridization and mis-match analyses. The attained detection limit was 100 fM as determined via impedance spectroscopy. High levels of stability, reproducibility and regeneration of the sensor were obtained. Selective DNA immobilization and hybridization were confirmed by nitrogen and phosphorus peaks in an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The created nanostructure hybrids illuminate the mechanism of generating multiple-target, high-performance detection on a single NF platform, which opens a new avenue for array-based medical diagnostics.","['Perumal V', 'Hashim U', 'Gopinath SC', 'Haarindraprasad R', 'Foo KL', 'Balakrishnan SR', 'Poopalan P']",2015,5,,Sci Rep,"Perumal V, et al.

26177295,Reverse-Transcriptase PCR Detection of Leptospira: Absence of Agreement with Single-Specimen Microscopic Agglutination Testing.,"BACKGROUND: Reference diagnostic tests for leptospirosis include nucleic acid amplification tests, bacterial culture, and microscopic agglutination testing (MAT) of acute and convalescent serum. However, clinical laboratories often do not receive paired specimens. In the current study, we tested serum samples using a highly sensitive real-time nucleic acid amplification test for Leptospira and compared results to MAT performed on the same specimens.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 478 serum samples from suspected leptospirosis cases in Rio de Janeiro were tested using a real-time RT-PCR for the diagnosis of leptospirosis, malaria and dengue (the Lepto-MD assay). The Lepto-MD assay detects all species of Leptospira (saprophytic, intermediate, and pathogenic), and in the current study, we demonstrate that this assay amplifies both Leptospira RNA and DNA. Dengue virus RNA was identified in 10 patients, and no cases of malaria were detected. A total of 65 samples (13.6%) were positive for Leptospira: 35 samples (7.3%) in the Lepto-MD assay, 33 samples (6.9%) by MAT, and 3 samples tested positive by both (kappa statistic 0.02). Poor agreement between methods was consistent regardless of the titer used to define positive MAT results or the day of disease at sample collection. Leptospira nucleic acids were detected in the Lepto-MD assay as late as day 22, and cycle threshold values did not differ based on the day of disease. When Lepto-MD assay results were added to the MAT results for all patients in 2008 (n=818), the number of detected leptospirosis cases increased by 30.4%, from 102 (12.5%) to 133 (16.3%).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates a lack of agreement between nucleic acid detection of Leptospira and single-specimen MAT, which may result from the clearance of bacteremia coinciding with the appearance of agglutinating antibodies. A combined testing strategy for acute leptospirosis, including molecular and serologic testing, appears necessary to maximize case detection.","['Waggoner JJ', 'Balassiano I', 'Mohamed-Hadley A', 'Vital-Brazil JM', 'Sahoo MK', 'Pinsky BA']",2015,10,7,PLoS One,"Waggoner JJ, et al.

26177144,[ETHIOLOGY OF LEPTOSPIROSIS IN GEORGIA].,"Investigation of leptospirosis was initiated in 1950s, when the first cases in humans were detected in Gudauta rayon. Serology test confirmed the diagnose. High level of antibodies to serogroup Pomona was revealed in all cases. Later on the infection encountered as sporadic cases, the exception was 1986, when a large outbreak was reported in Sukhumi. At present leptospirosis is widely spread in the country, especially in Ajara region, where indicators of morbidity recently reached 11.4 per 100 thousand population. It is likely that warm humid climate creates exceptionally favorite conditions for spreading of Leptospira. In order to determine the true magnitude of the infection in the country a seroprevalence study was carried out in 50-60-ies of the past century in humans, agricultural animals and rodents. It was found that serotgroups Pomona, Icteroheamorrhagiae and Grippothypos prevailed in humans, Serogroup L. Pomona - dominated in animals, while in rodents the dominated serotgrouo was L. Icteroheamorrhagiae. Similar study, conducted by us in 1990-2005 showed that L.Pomona and L. Icteroheamorrhagiae prevailed in humans and rodents while L. Icteroheamorrhagiae was the only serogroup isolated in gray rats, trapped in Tbilisi. Infectivity of rodants composed 70%. Currently lesptosirosis is caused by a new serogroups of Leptospira - L. Sejroe, namely by serotypes Wolfii and Hardjo, L. Australis (serotype Bratislava) and L. Autumnalis along with the previously occurring serogroups L. Icteroheamorrhagiae, L. Bataviae, L. Hebdomadis. In our opinion the recent increase in leptospirosis in the country is attributable to the improvements in diagnostics of the infection as well as to the emergence of new serogroups of Leptospira, which in turn is a result of intensive migration processes in the country.","['Mamuchishvili N', 'Kuchuloria T', 'Mchedlishvili I', 'Imnadze P', 'Mirzashvili D']",2015,,244-245,Georgian Med News,"Mamuchishvili N, et al.

26167830,[Brucellosis as a cause of hemophagocytic syndrome].,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare syndrome of excessive inflammation and tissue destruction due to abnormal immune activation and inflammation. HLH can occur primarily due to genetic etiology, or secondarily associated with malignancies, autoimmmune diseases or infections. There are a number of reports that revealed the relationship of hemophagocytosis with brucellosis. In this report, we described a brucellosis-related HLH case. A 73-year-old male who work as farmer was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of fever continuing for 10 days, loss of appetite and back pain. Physical examination revealed right upper quadrant tenderness and hepatomegaly. Since the patient exhibited five of the diagnostic criteria for HLH (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, bicytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia and high ferritin level), he was diagnosed as secondary HLH. PCR, microscopic agglutination and indirect fluorescent antibody tests gave negative results for the diagnosis of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis and Q fever, respectively. On the other hand, Rose Bengal test for brucellosis was positive, while standard tube agglutination test (STA) was negative. The patient's serum yielded a very high positive (1/1280) result when Coombs' test was performed in terms of the possibility of blocking antibodies or prozone phenomenon. Additionally, B.melitensis was isolated from his blood culture on the sixth day. The patient was treated with doxycycline and rifampicin, and on the 10th day of antibiotic therapy the patient was discharged and recommended to complete his treatment up to 6 weeks. In conclusion, in patients with secondary HLH symptoms especially in the endemic areas, brucellosis should be considered as a predisposing infection.","['Aydın S', 'Günal Ö', 'Taşkın MH', 'Atilla A', 'Kılıç SS']",2015,49,2,Mikrobiyol Bul,"Aydın S, et al.

26161745,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps are Involved in the Innate Immune Response to Infection with Leptospira.,"NETosis is a process by which neutrophils extrude their DNA together with bactericidal proteins that trap and/or kill pathogens. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of Leptospira spp. to induce NETosis using human ex vivo and murine in vivo models. Microscopy and fluorometric studies showed that incubation of human neutrophils with Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 (LIC) resulted in the release of DNA extracellular traps (NETs). The bacteria number, pathogenicity and viability were relevant factors for induction of NETs, but bacteria motility was not. Entrapment of LIC in the NETs resulted in LIC death; however, pathogenic but not saprophytic Leptospira sp. exerted nuclease activity and degraded DNA. Mice infected with LIC showed circulating NETs after 2 days post-infection (dpi). Depletion of neutrophils with mAb1A8 significantly reduced the amount of intravascular NETs in LIC-infected mice, increasing bacteremia at 3 dpi. Although there was a low bacterial burden, scarce neutrophils and an absence of inflammation in the early stages of infection in the kidney and liver, at the beginning of the leptospiruric phase, the bacterial burden was significantly higher in kidneys of neutrophil-depleted-mice compared to non-depleted and infected mice. Surprisingly, interstitial nephritis was of similar intensity in both groups of infected mice. Taken together, these data suggest that LIC triggers NETs, and that the intravascular formation of these DNA traps appears to be critical not only to prevent early leptospiral dissemination but also to preclude further bacterial burden.","['Scharrig E', 'Carestia A', 'Ferrer MF', 'Cédola M', 'Pretre G', 'Drut R', 'Picardeau M', 'Schattner M', 'Gómez RM']",2015,9,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Scharrig E, et al.

26159354,The Infectious and Noninfectious Dermatological Consequences of Flooding: A Field Manual for the Responding Provider.,"Meteorological data show that disastrous floods are increasingly frequent and more severe in recent years, perhaps due to climatic changes such as global warming. During and after a flood disaster, traumatic injuries, communicable diseases, chemical exposures, malnutrition, decreased access to care, and even mental health disorders dramatically increase, and many of these have dermatological manifestations. Numerous case reports document typical and atypical cutaneous infections, percutaneous trauma, immersion injuries, noninfectious contact exposures, exposure to wildlife, and exacerbation of underlying skin diseases after such disasters as the 2004 Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the 2010 Pakistan floods. This review attempts to provide a basic field manual of sorts to providers who are engaged in care after a flooding event, with particular focus on the infectious consequences. Bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are still common causes of skin infections after floods, with atypical bacteria also greatly increased. Vibrio vulnificus is classically associated with exposure to saltwater or brackish water. It may present as necrotizing fasciitis with hemorrhagic bullae, and treatment consists of doxycycline or a quinolone, plus a third-generation cephalosporin and surgical debridement. Atypical mycobacterial infections typically produce indolent cutaneous infections, possibly showing sporotrichoid spread. A unique nontuberculous infection called spam has recently been identified in Satowan Pacific Islanders; combination antibiotic therapy is recommended. Aeromonas infection is typically associated with freshwater exposure and, like Vibrio infections, immunocompromised or cirrhotic patients are at highest risk for severe disease, such as necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis. Various antibiotics can be used to treat Aeromonas infections. Melioidosis is seen mainly in Southeast Asia and Australia, particularly in rice farmers, and can remain latent for many years before presenting as the host's immunocompetence wanes. It can present with a variety of skin findings or as a nonspecific febrile illness, and preferred treatment consists of ceftazidime or a carbapenem with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for 2 weeks, then continuing TMP/SMX for at least 3 months. Leptospirosis is a waterborne zoonosis that is often prevalent after heavy rains or flooding. Different forms exist, including Fort Bragg fever, which produces a distinctive erythematous papular rash on the shins. Doxycycline is often sufficient; however, volume and potassium repletion may be necessary if renal involvement exists. Chromobacterium violaceum infection may occur after open skin is exposed to stagnant or muddy water. Cultured colonies produce a unique violacein pigment, and treatment typically consists of a carbapenem. Both typical and atypical fungal infections are increased in the flooding disaster scenario, such as dermatophytosis, chromoblastomycosis, blastomycosis, and mucormycosis. Appropriate antifungals should be used. In addition, land inundated with water expands the habitat for parasites and/or vectors, thus increased vigilance for regional parasitic infections is necessary after a flood. Lastly, noninfectious consequences of a flooding disaster are also common and include miliaria, immersion foot syndromes, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, traumatic wounds and animal bites, and arthropod assault, as well as exacerbation of existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and alopecia areata due to increased stress or nonavailability of daily medications.","['Bandino JP', 'Hang A', 'Norton SA']",2015,16,5,Am J Clin Dermatol,"Bandino JP, et al.

26146835,Comparison of Bacterial Burden and Cytokine Gene Expression in Golden Hamsters in Early Phase of Infection with Two Different Strains of Leptospira interrogans.,"Leptospirosis, a zoonotic infection with worldwide prevalence, is caused by pathogenic spirochaetes of Leptospira spp., and exhibits an extremely broad clinical spectrum in human patients. Although previous studies indicated that specific serovars or genotypes of Leptospira spp. were associated with severe leptospirosis or its outbreak, the mechanism underlying the difference in virulence of the various Leptospira serotypes or genotypes remains unclear. The present study addresses this question by measuring and comparing bacterial burden and cytokine gene expression in hamsters infected with strains of two L. interrogans serovars Manilae (highly virulent) and Hebdomadis (less virulent). The histopathology of kidney, liver, and lung tissues was also investigated in infected hamsters. A significantly higher bacterial burden was observed in liver tissues of hamsters infected with serovar Manilae than those infected with serovar Hebdomadis (p < 0.01). The average copy number of the leptospiral genome was 1,302 and 20,559 in blood and liver, respectively, of hamsters infected with serovar Manilae and 1,340 and 4,896, respectively, in hamsters infected with serovar Hebdomadis. The expression levels of mip1alpha in blood; tgfbeta, il1beta, mip1alpha, il10, tnfalpha and cox2 in liver; and tgfbeta, il6, tnfalpha and cox2 in lung tissue were significantly higher in hamsters infected with serovar Manilae than those infected with serovar Hebdomadis (p < 0.05). In addition, infection with serovar Manilae resulted in a significantly larger number of hamsters with tnfalpha upregulation (p = 0.04). Severe distortion of tubular cell arrangement and disruption of renal tubules in kidney tissues and hemorrhage in lung tissues were observed in Manilae-infected hamsters. These results demonstrate that serovar Manilae multiplied more efficiently in liver tissues and induced significantly higher expression of genes encoding pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines than serovar Hebdomadis even in tissues for which a significant difference in leptospiral load was not observed. In addition, our results suggest a serovar Manilae-specific mechanism responsible for inducing severe damage in kidneys and hemorrhage in lung.","['Fujita R', 'Koizumi N', 'Sugiyama H', 'Tomizawa R', 'Sato R', 'Ohnishi M']",2015,10,7,PLoS One,"Fujita R, et al.

26133202,"Medicinal Plants Used by the Nicobarese Inhabiting Little Nicobar Island of the Andaman and Nicobar Archipelago, India.","BACKGROUND: This study is an attempt to document the medicinal plants used by the tribal community of Little Nicobar Island. Despite modern healthcare facilities, tribals often consume medicinal herbs, with traditional knowledge practitioners (TKPs) serving as local medical experts.
OBJECTIVES: The aim is to conduct an ethnomedicinal survey among the Nicobarese, whose medicinal practices are yet to be documented.
METHODS: Field research was conducted in all five villages of Little Nicobar Island, situated in the southernmost part of the Andaman and Nicobar Archipelago, during 2012-2013. Seven TKPs were interviewed using a questionnaire-guided ethnomedicinal survey protocol. The data obtained were analyzed using the informant consensus factor (ICF) and use value. Voucher specimens of all the cited plant species were deposited at the Regional Medical Research Centre (Indian Council of Medical Research), Port Blair.
RESULTS: Uses of 34 medicinal plant species, belonging to 23 families encompassing 32 genera, were recorded during the survey. These 34 species are employed to treat a total of 16 ailments. The highest ICF (1.00) was obtained for respiratory diseases. The Euphorbiaceae family exhibited the highest number of citations, and plants with the highest use values were Glochidion calocarpum Kurz, Senna occidentalis (L.) Link, Ocimum tenuiflorum L., and Passiflora suberosa L. Of the medicinal plants reported, the most common growth form was herbs. Remedies were generally prepared using water. The medicinal plant preparations were administered topically or orally.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Traditional knowledge of herbal medicines is handed down orally through generations. These plants attained a significant role under the healthcare of the Nicobarese residing in Little Nicobar Island. Efforts to ensure their documentation are necessary in order to prevent its loss, either because of natural calamities or lack of interest among younger generations in carrying out their tradition.","['Chander MP', 'Kartick C', 'Vijayachari P']",2015,21,7,J Altern Complement Med,"Chander MP, et al.

26110604,Diagnostic Accuracy of Recombinant Immunoglobulin-like Protein A-Based IgM ELISA for the Early Diagnosis of Leptospirosis in the Philippines.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important but largely under-recognized public health problem in the tropics. Establishment of highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnosis is essential to reveal the magnitude of problem and to improve treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a recombinant LigA protein based IgM ELISA during outbreaks in the clinical-setting of a highly endemic country.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A prospective study was conducted from October 2011 to September 2013 at a national referral hospital for infectious diseases in Manila, Philippines. Patients who were hospitalized with clinically suspected leptospirosis were enrolled. Plasma and urine were collected on admission and/or at discharge and tested using the LigA-IgM ELISA and a whole cell-based IgM ELISA. Sensitivity and specificity of these tests were evaluated with cases diagnosed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), culture and LAMP as the composite reference standard and blood bank donors as healthy controls: the mean+3 standard deviation optical density value of healthy controls was used as the cut-off limit (0.062 for the LigA-IgM ELISA and 0.691 for the whole cell-based IgM ELISA). Of 304 patients enrolled in the study, 270 (89.1%) were male and the median age was 30.5 years; 167 (54.9%) were laboratory confirmed. The sensitivity and ROC curve AUC for the LigA-IgM ELISA was significantly greater than the whole cell-based IgM ELISA (69.5% vs. 54.3%, p<0.01; 0.90 vs. 0.82, p<0.01) on admission, but not at discharge. The specificity of LigA-IgM ELISA and whole cell-based IgM ELISA were not significantly different (98% vs. 97%). Among 158 MAT negative patients, 53 and 28 were positive by LigA- and whole cell-based IgM ELISA, respectively; if the laboratory confirmation was re-defined by LigA-IgM ELISA and LAMP, the clinical findings were more characteristic of leptospirosis than the diagnosis based on MAT/culture/LAMP.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The newly developed LigA-IgM ELISA is more sensitive than the whole cell-based IgM based ELISA. Although the final diagnosis must be validated by more specific tests, LigA-IgM ELISA could be a useful diagnostic test in a real clinical-setting, where diagnosis is needed in the early phase of infection.","['Kitashoji E', 'Koizumi N', 'Lacuesta TL', 'Usuda D', 'Ribo MR', 'Tria ES', 'Go WS', 'Kojiro M', 'Parry CM', 'Dimaano EM', 'Villarama JB', 'Ohnishi M', 'Suzuki M', 'Ariyoshi K']",2015,9,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Kitashoji E, et al.

26107896,[Regularities of the ubiquitous polyhostal microorganisms selection by the example of three taxa].,"The investigation of the bacterial populations' heterogeneity contributes to the control of natural foci, causative agents of nosocomial infections, to the analysis of the microbial evolution. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was employed for the analysis of the diversity and features of the distribution of polyhostal ubiquitous microorganisms of the genera Burkholderia, Leptospira, and Listeria, which belong to three bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Firmicutes. According to the bacterial samples analysis microbial genotypes prevalent and unique to Russia were identified; their occurrence in different Federal Regions was investigated; their similarity with global spread genotypes was appreciated. Obtained results allowed identifying common regularities of the selection of the microorganisms capable to cause the diseases of human and animals. The formation of genotypes that are most pathogenic for the host was demonstrated for all groups of bacteria. Leptospira spp. and Listeria monocytogenes strains with these genotypes have been circulating for a long time, being supported by natural foci. The formation of a wide variety of genotypes with different pathogenicity was demonstrated in the local geographic areas. In Russia, the zonal difference in all three groups of bacteria is most clearly traced to the Far Eastern Federal Region. The results are thought to contribute to analyzing the factors of selection and the phylogeny of the taxa under study.","['Voronina OL', 'Kunda MS', 'Ryzhova NN', 'Aksenova EI', 'Semenov AN', 'Kurnaeva MA', 'Ananyina YV', 'Lunin VG', 'Gintsburg AL']",2015,49,3,Mol Biol (Mosk),"Voronina OL, et al.

26100922,"Safety and efficacy of a new octavalent combined Erysipelas, Parvo and Leptospira vaccine in gilts against Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona associated disease and foetal death.","The safety and protective efficacy of a new octavalent combination vaccine containing inactivated Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Parvovirus, and Leptospira interrogans (sensu lato) serogroups Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Australis (Bratislava), Grippotyphosa, Pomona and Tarassovi - Porcilis(®) Ery+Parvo+Lepto - was evaluated in laboratory studies and under field conditions. The safety (2× overdose and repeated dose) was tested in 26 gilts. In this study, neither vaccine related temperature increase nor other systemic reactions were observed after intramuscular vaccination. No local reactions were observed except for one animal that had a small local reaction (2cm diameter) that lasted for 5 days after the third vaccination. Efficacy was tested in 40 gilts. A group of 20 gilts was vaccinated at 20 and 24 weeks of age with Porcilis(®) Ery+Parvo+Lepto and a group of 20 age- and source-matched animals served as the control group. The gilts were inseminated at 41 weeks or 66 weeks of age and were challenged with serovar Pomona 10 weeks after insemination, corresponding to 6 months (n=2×10) and 12 months (n=2×10) after the last vaccination. After both the 6- and 12-month challenges the control animals developed clinical signs (fever, lethargy and anorexia) and leptospiraemia as determined by positive blood culture. In addition, both the 6- and 12-month challenges resulted in death of 21% and 27% of the total number of foetuses in the control groups, respectively. Clinical signs and leptospiraemia were statistically significantly lower in vaccinated gilts after both the 6- and 12-month challenges. In addition, foetal death was statistically significantly lower (3% and 2%, respectively) in vaccinated gilts after both the 6- and 12 month challenges. The vaccine was tested further under field conditions on a Portuguese farm with a history of an increasing abortion rate associated with a Leptospira serovar Pomona infection (confirmed by PCR and serology). This study was designed as an observational-longitudinal field study. At the start of the study, all breeding sows and replacement gilts on the farm were vaccinated twice with Porcilis(®) Ery+Parvo+Lepto at an interval of 4 weeks. Starting six months after the primary vaccination schedule, the animals were re-vaccinated during the second week of every subsequent lactation. New replacement gilts were vaccinated using the same schedule. After vaccination, the abortion rate reduced rapidly from 12.6% in winter months of 2012 (December 2011 to March 2012) to 0.5% in winter months of 2013, a statistical significant decrease of 96%. The total number of abortions on the farm decreased from 55 in 2012 to 6 in 2013. Thereafter, the abortion rate remained stable and in the period December 2013 to April 2014 was still low (0.6%). In conclusion, the present studies demonstrate that the octavalent Porcilis(®) Ery+Parvo+Lepto vaccine can be safely used in gilts and sows and induces significant protection, for the duration of at least one year, against serovar Pomona induced clinical signs, leptospiraemia and foetal death. Protection against Pomona associated reproductive failure was confirmed under field conditions where a significant reduction in abortion rate was observed.","['Jacobs AA', 'Harks F', 'Hoeijmakers M', 'Collell M', 'Segers RP']",2015,33,32,Vaccine,"Jacobs AA, et al.

26100241,Phenotypic and Molecular Characterization of Leptospira interrogans Isolated from Canis familiaris in Southern Brazil.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic spirochetes from the genus Leptospira, which includes 20 species and more than 300 serovars. Canines are important hosts of pathogenic leptospires and can transmit the pathogen to humans via infected urine. Here, we report the phenotypic and molecular characterization of Leptospira interrogans isolated from Canis familiaris in Southern Brazil. The isolated strain was characterized by variable-number tandem-repeats analysis as L. interrogans, serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae. In addition, the isolate was recognized by antibodies from human and canine serum samples previously tested by microscopic agglutination test. Ultimately, the expression of membrane-associated antigens (LipL32 and leptospiral immunoglobulin-like proteins) from pathogenic leptospires using monoclonal antibodies was detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay. In conclusion, identification of new strains of Leptospira can help in the diagnosis and control of leptospirosis.","['Jorge S', 'Monte LG', 'De Oliveira NR', 'Collares TF', 'Roloff BC', 'Gomes CK', 'Hartwig DD', 'Dellagostin OA', 'Hartleben CP']",2015,71,4,Curr Microbiol,"Jorge S, et al.

METHODS: Febrile adults and children admitted to Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh, were investigated with Bact/Alert(®) blood cultures and real-time PCR to detect Salmonella enterica Typhi and Paratyphi A and assays for Rickettsia, leptospirosis and dengue fever. Acute serum samples were examined with the LifeAssay (LA) Test-it™ Typhoid IgM lateral flow assay detecting IgM antibodies against S. Typhi O antigen, CTKBiotech Onsite Typhoid IgG/IgM Combo Rapid-test cassette lateral flow assay detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against S. Typhi O and H antigens and SD Bioline line assay for IgG and IgM antibodies against S. Typhi proteins.
RESULTS: In 300 malaria smear-negative febrile patients [median (IQR) age of 13.5 (5-31) years], 34 (11.3%) had confirmed typhoid fever: 19 positive by blood culture for S. Typhi (three blood PCR positive) and 15 blood culture negative but PCR positive for S. Typhi in blood.

26091292,Efficient Detection of Pathogenic Leptospires Using 16S Ribosomal RNA.,"Pathogenic Leptospira species cause a prevalent yet neglected zoonotic disease with mild to life-threatening complications in a variety of susceptible animals and humans. Diagnosis of leptospirosis, which primarily relies on antiquated serotyping methods, is particularly challenging due to presentation of non-specific symptoms shared by other febrile illnesses, often leading to misdiagnosis. Initiation of antimicrobial therapy during early infection to prevent more serious complications of disseminated infection is often not performed because of a lack of efficient diagnostic tests. Here we report that specific regions of leptospiral 16S ribosomal RNA molecules constitute a novel and efficient diagnostic target for PCR-based detection of pathogenic Leptospira serovars. Our diagnostic test using spiked human blood was at least 100-fold more sensitive than corresponding leptospiral DNA-based quantitative PCR assays, targeting the same 16S nucleotide sequence in the RNA and DNA molecules. The sensitivity and specificity of our RNA assay against laboratory-confirmed human leptospirosis clinical samples were 64% and 100%, respectively, which was superior then an established parallel DNA detection assay. Remarkably, we discovered that 16S transcripts remain appreciably stable ex vivo, including untreated and stored human blood samples, further highlighting their use for clinical detection of L. interrogans. Together, these studies underscore a novel utility of RNA targets, specifically 16S rRNA, for development of PCR-based modalities for diagnosis of human leptospirosis, and also may serve as paradigm for detection of additional bacterial pathogens for which early diagnosis is warranted.","['Backstedt BT', 'Buyuktanir O', 'Lindow J', 'Wunder EA', 'Reis MG', 'Usmani-Brown S', 'Ledizet M', 'Ko A', 'Pal U']",2015,10,6,PLoS One,"Backstedt BT, et al.

26086800,"Diagnosis of Leptospirosis: Comparison between Microscopic Agglutination Test, IgM-ELISA and IgM Rapid Immunochromatography Test.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is diagnosed on clinical grounds, and confirmed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT). IgM-ELISA (Serion-Virion) and immunochromatography test (Leptocheck-WB) are two immunodiagnostic assays for leptospirosis. Their sensitivity, specificity and applicability in Sri Lanka have not been systematically evaluated.
METHODS: Clinically diagnosed leptospirosis patients (n = 919) were recruited from three hospitals in the Western Province of Sri Lanka, during June 2012 to December 2013. MAT, IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB were performed on all patient sera. MAT titer of ≥ 400 in single sample, four-fold rise or seroconversion ≥ 100 in paired samples were considered as positive for MAT. For diagnostic confirmation, MAT was performed during both acute and convalescent phases. Anti-leptospiral IgM ≥ 20 IU/ml and appearance of a band in the test window were considered as positive for IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB test respectively. Patients with an alternative diagnosis (n = 31) were excluded. Data analysis was performed using two methods, i) considering MAT as reference standard and ii) using Bayesian latent class model analysis (BLCM) which considers each test as imperfect.
RESULTS: MAT, IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB positivity were 39.8%, 45.8% and 38.7% respectively during the acute phase. Acute-phase MAT had specificity and sensitivity of 95.7% and 55.3% respectively, when compared to overall MAT positivity. IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB had similar diagnostic sensitivity when compared with acute-phase MAT as the gold standard, although IgM-ELISA showed higher specificity (84.5%) than Leptocheck-WB (73.3%). BLCM analysis showed that IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB had similar sensitivities (86.0% and 87.4%), while acute-phase MAT had the lowest sensitivity (77.4%). However, acute-phase MAT had high specificity (97.6%), while IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB showed similar but lower specificity (84.5% and 82.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Both IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB shows similar sensitivities and specificities. IgM-ELISA may be superior to MAT during the acute phase and suitable for early diagnosis of leptospirosis. Leptocheck-WB is suitable as a rapid immunodiagnostic screening test for resource limited settings.","['Niloofa R', 'Fernando N', 'de Silva NL', 'Karunanayake L', 'Wickramasinghe H', 'Dikmadugoda N', 'Premawansa G', 'Wickramasinghe R', 'de Silva HJ', 'Premawansa S', 'Rajapakse S', 'Handunnetti S']",2015,10,6,PLoS One,"Niloofa R, et al.

26076668,Genotyping of Leptospira directly in urine samples of cattle demonstrates a diversity of species and strains in Brazil.,"The aim of this study was to identify Leptospira in urine samples of cattle by direct sequencing of the secY gene. The validity of this approach was assessed using ten Leptospira strains obtained from cattle in Brazil and 77 DNA samples previously extracted from cattle urine, that were positive by PCR for the genus-specific lipL32 gene of Leptospira. Direct sequencing identified 24 (31·1%) interpretable secY sequences and these were identical to those obtained from direct DNA sequencing of the urine samples from which they were recovered. Phylogenetic analyses identified four species: L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii, L. noguchii, and L. santarosai with the most prevalent genotypes being associated with L. borgpetersenii. While direct sequencing cannot, as yet, replace culturing of leptospires, it is a valid additional tool for epidemiological studies. An unexpected finding from this study was the genetic diversity of Leptospira infecting Brazilian cattle.","['Hamond C', 'Pestana CP', 'Medeiros MA', 'Lilenbaum W']",2016,144,1,Epidemiol Infect,"Hamond C, et al.

26072306,"The emergence of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Arborea in Queensland, Australia, 2001 to 2013.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease, with increasing frequency and severity of outbreaks, changing epidemiology of populations at risk, and the emergence of new serovars. Environmental drivers of disease transmission include flooding, urbanisation, poor sanitation, changes in land use and agricultural practices, and socioeconomic factors. In Queensland, human infection with Leptosira borgpetersenii serovar Arborea was first reported in 2001. This study aims to report the emergence of serovar Arborea in Queensland from 2001 to 2013, and investigate potential risk factors for infection and drivers of emergence.
METHODS: Data on laboratory-confirmed cases of human leptospirosis in Queensland were obtained from the enhanced surveillance system at the WHO/FAO/OIE Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Leptospirosis in Brisbane, Australia. The changing epidemiology of serovar Arborea from 2001 to 2003 was described with respect to case numbers, proportion of leptospirosis cases attributed to the serovar, and geographic distribution. Differences in risk factors for the most common serovars were compared.
RESULTS: During this period, 1289 cases of leptospirosis were reported, including 233 cases attributed to serovar Arborea. Risk factors for infection include male gender (91 % of cases), occupation, and recreational exposure. Most common occupations recorded were banana workers (28.4 %), meat workers (7.2 %), dairy farmers (5.8 %), graziers/stockmen (5.5 %), 'other agricultural/rural workers' (16.4 %), and tourists or tourism operators (4.6 %). Time trend analysis showed that while non-Arborea cases decreased over the study period, Arborea cases increased by 3.4 cases per year. The proportion of annual cases attributed to Arborea peaked at 49 % in 2011 after unprecedented flooding in Queensland. Mapping of cases by residential location showed expansion of the geographic range of serovar Arborea, concentrating mostly around Brisbane, Cairns and Innisfail. Serovars varied significantly between ages and occupational groups, and serovar Arborea was most strongly associated with 'other agricultural/rural workers'.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Arborea has been emerging in Queensland since 2001, with increase in case numbers, the proportion of leptospirosis infections attributed to the serovar, as well as expansion of its geographic distribution. Reasons for this emergence are unknown, but climatic factors and environmental change are likely to have played important roles.","['Lau CL', 'Skelly C', 'Dohnt M', 'Smythe LD']",2015,15,,BMC Infect Dis,"Lau CL, et al.

The PCR-amplified 1053-bp ligB gene sequences from Leptospira borgpetersenii Hardjo serovar were cloned in pET 32 (a) vector at EcoRI and NotI sites and expressed in BL21 E. coli cells as fusion protein with thioredoxin (-57 kDa) and characterized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Out of 390 serum samples [cattle (n = 214), buffaloes (n = 176)] subjected to MAT, 115 samples showed reciprocal titre≥100 up to 1600 against one or more serovars. For recombinant LigB protein/antigen-based LAT, agglutination was observed in the positive sample, while no agglutination was observed in the negative sample. Similarly, heat-killed leptospiral antigen was prepared from and used in LAT for comparison with MAT. A two-sided contingency table was used for analysis of LAT using both the antigens separately against MAT for 390 serum samples. The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of recombinant LigB LAT were found to be 75.65, 91.27, 78.38 and 89.96 %, respectively, and that of heat-killed antigen-based LAT were 72.17, 89.82, 74.77 and 88.53 %, respectively, in comparison with MAT.

26061370,Progression of the load of waterborne and intestinal parasitic diseases in the State of Amazonas.,"In the State of Amazonas, Brazil, urban expansion together with precarious basic sanitation conditions and human settlement on river banks has contributed to the persistence of waterborne and intestinal parasitic diseases. Time series of the recorded cases of cholera, typhoid fever, hepatitis A and leptospirosis are described, using data from different levels of the surveillance systems. The sources for intestinal parasitosis prevalence data (non-compulsory reporting in Brazil) were Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Literatura Latino-Americana (LILACS) and the annals of major scientific meetings. Relevant papers and abstracts in all languages were accessed by two independent reviewers. The references cited by each relevant paper were scrutinized to locate additional papers. Despite its initial dissemination across the entire State of Amazonas, cholera was controlled in 1998. The magnitude of typhoid fever has decreased; however, a pattern characterized by eventual outbreaks still remains. Leptospirosis is an increasing cause of concern in association with the annual floods. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites is high regardless of the municipality and the characteristics of areas and populations. The incidence of hepatitis A has decreased over the past decade. A comparison of older and recent surveys shows that the prevalence of intestinal parasitic diseases has remained constant. The load of waterborne and intestinal parasitic diseases ranks high among the health problems present in the State of Amazonas. Interventions aiming at basic sanitation and vaccination for hepatitis A were formulated and implemented, but assessment of their effectiveness in the targeted populations is still needed.","['Martins M', 'Lacerda MV', 'Monteiro WM', 'Moura MA', 'Santos EC', 'Saraceni V', 'Saraiva MG']",2015,48 Suppl 1,,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,"Martins M, et al.

26061234,Molecular characterisation and disease severity of leptospirosis in Sri Lanka.,"Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease all over the world, important in tropical and subtropical areas. A majority of leptospirosis infected patients present as subclinical or mild disease while 5-10% may develop severe infection requiring hospitalisation and critical care. It is possible that several factors, such as the infecting serovar, level of leptospiraemia, host genetic factors and host immune response, may be important in predisposition towards severe disease. Different Leptospira strains circulate in different geographical regions contributing to variable disease severity. Therefore, it is important to investigate the circulating strains at geographical locations during each outbreak for epidemiological studies and to support the clinical management of the patients. In this study immunochromatography, microscopic agglutination test and polymerase chain reaction were used to diagnose leptospirosis. Further restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing methods were used to identify the circulating strains in two selected geographical regions of Sri Lanka. Leptospira interrogans, Leptospira borgpetersenii and Leptospira kirschneri strains were identified to be circulating in western and southern provinces. L. interrogans was the predominant species circulating in western and southern provinces in 2013 and its presence was mainly associated with renal failure.","['Bandara KK', 'Weerasekera M', 'Gunasekara CP', 'Ranasinghe N', 'Marasinghe C', 'Fernando N']",2015,110,4,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,"Bandara KK, et al.

26057675,Structural characterization of a novel subfamily of leucine-rich repeat proteins from the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans.,"Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the agents of leptospirosis, an emerging zoonotic disease. Analyses of Leptospira genomes have shown that the pathogenic leptospires (but not the saprophytes) possess a large number of genes encoding proteins containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. In other pathogenic bacteria, proteins with LRR domains have been shown to be involved in mediating host-cell attachment and invasion, but their functions remain unknown in Leptospira. To gain insight into the potential function of leptospiral LRR proteins, the crystal structures of four LRR proteins that represent a novel subfamily with consecutive stretches of a 23-amino-acid LRR repeat motif have been solved. The four proteins analyzed adopt the characteristic α/β-solenoid horseshoe fold. The exposed residues of the inner concave surfaces of the solenoid, which constitute a putative functional binding site, are not conserved. The various leptospiral LRR proteins could therefore recognize distinct structural motifs of different host proteins and thus serve separate and complementary functions in the physiology of these bacteria.","['Miras I', 'Saul F', 'Nowakowski M', 'Weber P', 'Haouz A', 'Shepard W', 'Picardeau M']",2015,71,Pt 6,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,"Miras I, et al.

Brucellosis is not endemic in this region. The index case was a 45-year-old goat farm owner presented with 3 weeks of fever, headache, severe lethargy, poor appetite, and excessive sweating. He claimed to have consumed unpasteurized goat's milk that he had also sold to the public. Tests were negative for tropical diseases (i.e., dengue fever, malaria, leptospirosis and scrub typhus) and blood culture showed no growth. Based on epidemiological clues, Brucella serology was ordered and returned positive. Over a period of 1 year, 79 patients who had consumed milk bought from the same farm were diagnosed with brucellosis. Two of these patients were workers on the farm. Four laboratory staff had also contracted the disease presumably through handling of the blood samples. The mean duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 53 days with a maximum duration of 210 days. A combination treatment of rifampin and doxycycline for 6 weeks was the first line of treatment in 90.5% of patients. One-third of the patients had sequelae after recovering and 21% had a relapse. We highlight the importance of Brucellosis as a differential diagnosis when a patient has unexplained chronic fever.","['Leong KN', 'Chow TS', 'Wong PS', 'Hamzah SH', 'Ahmad N', ""Ch'ng CC""]",2015,93,3,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Leong KN, et al.

26048204,Markers of endothelial cell activation and immune activation are increased in patients with severe leptospirosis and associated with disease severity.,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies concluded that haemorrhage is one of the most accurate prognostic factors of mortality in leptospirosis. Therefore, endothelial cell activation was investigated in relation to disease severity in severe leptospirosis.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study of severe leptospirosis patients. Plasma levels of sE-selectin and Von Willebrand factor (VWF) were determined. Consequently, an in vitro endothelial cell model was used to assess endothelial activation after exposure to virulent Leptospira. Finally, immune activation, as a potential contributing factor to endothelial cell activation, was determined by soluble IL2-receptor (sIL-2r) and soluble Fas-ligand (sFasL) levels.
RESULTS: Plasma levels of sE-selectin and VWF strongly increased in patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, sE-selectin was significantly elevated (203 ng/ml vs. 157 ng/ml, p < 0.05) in survivors compared to non-survivors. Endothelial cells exposed to virulent Leptospira showed increased VWF expression. E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression did not change. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of intracellular Leptospira and qPCR suggested replication. In vivo analysis showed that increased levels of sFasL and sIL-2r were both strongly associated with mortality. Furthermore sIL-2r levels were increased in patients that developed bleeding and significantly correlated to duration of hospital stay.
DISCUSSION: Markers of endothelial activation and immune activation were associated with disease severity in leptospirosis patients.","['Goeijenbier M', 'Gasem MH', 'Meijers JC', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Ahmed A', 'Goris MG', 'Isbandrio B', 'Schuller SS', 'Osterhaus AD', 'Martina BE', 'van Gorp EC', 'Nally JE', 'Wagenaar JF']",2015,71,4,J Infect,"Goeijenbier M, et al.

26047009,Patterns in Leptospira Shedding in Norway Rats (Rattus norvegicus) from Brazilian Slum Communities at High Risk of Disease Transmission.,"BACKGROUND: We address some critical but unknown parameters of individuals and populations of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) that influence leptospiral infection, maintenance and spirochetal loads shed in urine, which contaminates the environment ultimately leading to human infection.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our study, conducted in Salvador, Brazil, established the average load of leptospires in positive kidneys to be 5.9 x 10(6) per mL (range 3.1-8.2 x10(6)) genome equivalents (GEq), similar to the 6.1 x 10(6) per ml (range 2.2-9.4 x10(6)) average obtained from paired urines, with a significant positive correlation (R2=0.78) between the two. Based on bivariate and multivariate modeling, we found with both kidney and urine samples that leptospiral loads increased with the age of rats (based on the index of body length to mass), MAT titer and the presence of wounding/scars, and varied with site of capture. Some associations were modified by sex but trends were apparent. Combining with data on the demographic properties and prevalence of leptospiral carriage in rat populations in Salvador, we estimated that daily leptospiral loads shed in the urine of a population of 82 individuals exceeded 9.1 x 10(10) leptospires.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These factors directly influence the risk of leptospiral acquisition among humans and provide essential epidemiological information linking properties of rat populations with risk of human infection.","['Costa F', 'Wunder EA', 'De Oliveira D', 'Bisht V', 'Rodrigues G', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI', 'Begon M', 'Childs JE']",2015,9,6,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Costa F, et al.

26041951,Approach to clinical syndrome of jaundice and encephalopathy in tropics.,"A large number of patients present with jaundice and encephalopathy in tropical country like India and acute liver failure is the usual cause. Clinical presentation like ALF is also a complication of many tropical infections, and these conditions may mimic ALF but may have subtle differences from ALF. Moreover, what hepatologists see as acute liver failure in tropics is different from what is commonly described in Western Textbooks. Paracetamol overdose, which is possibly the commonest cause of ALF in UK and USA, is hardly ever seen in India. Most common etiology here is viral hepatitis (hepatitis E > hepatitis B> hepatitis A). Apart from ALF, one may also come across subacute hepatic failure (SAHF) as well as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) due to viral hepatitis. Interestingly, a host of other conditions can mimic ALF because clinical presentation in these conditions can be dominated by jaundice and encephalopathy. Malarial hepatopathy is possibly the best-known condition out of these and is not an uncommon manifestation of severe malaria. A similar presentation can also be seen in other common infections in tropics such as dengue fever, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, amoebic liver abscesses, tuberculosis and other bacterial and fungal infections with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related disease. In many of these conditions, liver failure may not be underlying pathophysiology. Some pregnancy related liver diseases could also present with jaundice and encephalopathy. This review summarizes the commonly seen presentations in tropical country like India, where jaundice and encephalopathy dominate the clinical picture.","['Anand AC', 'Garg HK']",2015,5,Suppl 1,J Clin Exp Hepatol,Anand AC and Garg HK.

26033024,Molecular Detection of Leptospira in Two Returned Travelers: Higher Bacterial Load in Cerebrospinal Fluid Versus Serum or Plasma.,"Leptospirosis is a potentially severe illness in returned travelers. Patients often present with fever, headache, and neck pain, which may lead to a workup for meningitis including the acquisition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although Leptospira DNA has been detected in CSF by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), little data exist regarding the utility of testing CSF in addition to serum or plasma obtained on presentation. In this report, we present two cases of leptospirosis in returned travelers presenting with fever and headache. Our first patient had neutrophilic meningitis, and Leptospira was detectable only in CSF obtained on admission. The second patient had a normal CSF profile, but Leptospira was detected in CSF at a bacterial load 5- to 10-fold higher than that in plasma. CSF is an important specimen for the diagnosis of Leptospira by molecular methods and may yield an actionable diagnosis in the absence of leptospiremia.","['Waggoner JJ', 'Soda EA', 'Seibert R', 'Grant P', 'Pinsky BA']",2015,93,2,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Waggoner JJ, et al.

26011315,Diagnostic validation of selected serological tests for detecting scrub typhus.,"Clinical diagnosis of scrub typhus is often difficult because the symptoms are very similar to those of other febrile illness such as dengue, leptospirosis, malaria and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Though better diagnostic tests are available for rickettsial diseases and scrub typhus elsewhere, the Weil-Felix test is still commonly used in India, mainly because microimmunofluorescence assays (M-IFA) were not available in India till recently and relevant staff had insufficient training. The present study was performed to investigate the performance of M-IFA, IgM ELISA, and Weil-Felix test on 546 non-repeated serum samples from subjects suspected of having scrub typhus. One hundred and forty-three of these 546 samples were positive by M-IFA; these cases were also confirmed clinically to have scrub typhus based on their dramatic responses to doxycycline therapy. IgM ELISA was positive in 122 of the 143 M-IFA positive cases and the Weil-Felix test in 96. Though the Weil-Felix test is a heterophile agglutination test, it was found in this study to have good specificity but far too little sensitivity to use as a routine diagnostic test. IgM ELISA can be a good substitute for M-IFA. Incorporation of multiple prototype antigens on M-IFA slides is likely one of the reasons for its superior performance. As newer and better diagnostic assays become available for scrub typhus diagnosis in developed countries, it will be imperative to also use such tests in other endemic countries to prevent over- or under-diagnosis of scrub typhus.","['Koraluru M', 'Bairy I', 'Varma M', 'Vidyasagar S']",2015,59,7,Microbiol Immunol,"Koraluru M, et al.

26003629,Waterborne Leptospirosis: Survival and Preservation of the Virulence of Pathogenic Leptospira spp. in Fresh Water.,"Many studies have implicated fresh water as a source of leptospirosis outbreaks. To estimate the survival and the preservation of the virulence of pathogenic Leptospira spp. maintained in water, we selected five still waters with various pH and mineral profiles. The water samples were artificially inoculated with a culture of a pathogenic strain belonging to serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae. Samples were stored for 20 months at 4, 20 or 30 °C. The survival and preservation of virulence of this pathogenic strain was estimated by subculturing these stored samples. After 14 and 20 months of storage, the strain Icterohaemorrhagiae was re-isolated, and its virulence was determined using an animal model. In these waters, the mean survival was 130 days for storage at 4 °C, 263 days at 20 °C, and 316 days at 30 °C. Unexpectedly, the mean survival was 344 days for a final pH < 7 and 129 days for pH ≥ 7. Moreover, the pathogenic strain remained fully virulent and was able to induce a lethal disease in gerbils even when the pH of the contaminated waters decreased to <6. These data showed that despite unfavourable storage conditions such as cold, nutrient-poor acidic waters, the survival and virulence of pathogenic Leptospira spp. was fully preserved over at least 20 months.","['Andre-Fontaine G', 'Aviat F', 'Thorin C']",2015,71,1,Curr Microbiol,"Andre-Fontaine G, et al.

25997883,Usage of Leptospira spp. local strains as antigens increases the sensitivity of the serodiagnosis of bovine leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that occurs worldwide, particularly in tropical countries. In livestock the agent is responsible for reproductive problems such as infertility and abortion. Serogroup Sejroe, particularly serovar Hardjo, prevails in cattle in several regions. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the current method for diagnosing leptospirosis. It has been proposed that the inclusion of local strains could detect a larger set of seroreactive animals. In that context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate if the usage of local strains as antigens increases the sensitivity of the serodiagnosis of bovine leptospirosis. Blood and urine samples were collected from 314 bovines from several herds randomly selected in a slaughterhouse in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Serological diagnosis was made with MAT using a 21 reference-strains panel (MAT21). Additionally, 12 local strains (MAT33) were included as antigens. PCR was performed with the urine samples and it was positive on 71 out of 222 samples (31.9%). MAT21 identified as seroreactive 173 (55.1%) out of the 314 animals studied, with Sejroe the most common (38.1%). In MAT33, 204 (65.0%) animals were seroreactive with a significant increase on seroreactivity (9.9%). In conclusion, MAT presented with a significant increase of sensitivity when local strains were used as antigens. Among the local strains, 2013_U152 (KP263062) (serogroup Shermani) and 2013_U280 (KP263069) (serogroup Grippotyphosa) showed to be more antigenic.","['Pinto PS', 'Loureiro AP', 'Penna B', 'Lilenbaum W']",2015,149,,Acta Trop,"Pinto PS, et al.

25993109,Molecular Typing of Pathogenic Leptospira Serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae Strains Circulating in China during the Past 50 Years.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is one of the most important neglected tropical infectious diseases worldwide. Icterohaemorrhagiae has been throughout recent history, and still is, the predominant serogroup of this pathogen in China. However, very little in detail is known about the serovars or genotypes of this serogroup.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, 120 epidemic strains from five geographically diverse regions in China collected over a 50 year period (1958~2008), and 8 international reference strains characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing and MLST analysis. 115, 11 and 2 strains were identified as L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii, and L. kirschneri, respectively. 17 different STs were identified including 69 ST1 strains, 18 ST17, 18 ST128, 9 ST143 and 2 ST209. The remaining 12 strains belonged to 12 different STs. eBURST analysis demonstrated that, among the clonal complexes isolated (CCs), CC1 accounted for 73.3% (88/120) strains representing three STs: ST1, ST128 and ST98. ST1 was the most likely ancestral strain of this CC, followed by singleton CC17 (17/120) and CC143 (11/120). Further analysis of adding 116 serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains in the MLST database and studies previously described using global eBURST analysis and MST dendrogram revealed relatively similar ST clustering patterns with five main CCs and 8 singletons among these 244 strains. CC17 was found to be the most prevalent clone of pathogenic Leptospira circulating worldwide. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that ST1 and ST17 strains were distributed among 4 distinct serovars, indicating a highly complicated relationship between serovars and STs.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our studies demonstrated a high level of genetic diversity in the serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae strains. Distinct from ST17 or ST37 circulating elsewhere, ST1 included in CC1, has over the past 50 years or so, proven to be the most prevalent ST of pathogenic leptospires isolated in China. Moreover, the complicated relationship between STs and serovars indicates an urgent need to develop an improved scheme for Leptospira serotyping.","['Zhang C', 'Yang H', 'Li X', 'Cao Z', 'Zhou H', 'Zeng L', 'Xu J', 'Xu Y', 'Chang YF', 'Guo X', 'Zhu Y', 'Jiang X']",2015,9,5,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Zhang C, et al.

25989174,Detection and genotyping of Leptospira spp. from the kidneys of a seemingly healthy pig slaughtered for human consumption.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp.  Leptospirosis is maintained in an environment due to chronic kidney infection of a wide variety of domestic, peridomestic and wild reservoir mammals. In this study the role of pigs in maintenance of leptospires on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts was investigated.
METHODOLOGY: The condemned kidneys of 60 pigs slaughtered at a St. Kitts abattoir were screened by a quantitative-PCR for the presence of Leptospira spp. Positive samples were genotyped using a six-gene based multilocus sequence typing scheme.
RESULTS: Leptospiral DNA was detected in the kidneys of one of the 60 pigs. Multilocus sequence typing identified the infecting species to be L. interrogans.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of this zoonotic pathogen in the kidneys of a seemingly healthy pig raises concerns regarding the subclinical carriers of the disease among the island's swine population.","['Verma A', 'Soto E', 'Illanes O', 'Ghosh S', 'Fuentealba C']",2015,9,5,J Infect Dev Ctries,"Verma A, et al.

25987479,Severe leptospirosis complicated by Epstein-Barr Virus reactivation.,"INTRODUCTION: Weil's disease is a severe, potentially fatal illness following Leptospira interrogans infection. The reported case of a patient suffering from acute renal failure, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, rhabdomyolysis and encephalitis syndrome highlights the clinical challenge in reference to Weil syndrome complicated by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of leptospirosis was performed using four different diagnostic methods. Sera were analyzed with an in-house IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA). Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was done using 17 reference strains comprising 14 serogroups and 17 serovars. Polyvalent EBV-IgG analysis, EBV-IgG/IgM/IgA western blot analysis as well as quantitative EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed.
RESULTS: Leptospira IHA showed an initial titer of 1:640 (cut-off 1:320), leptospiral IgG was negative, but IgM was positive. MAT was negative at that time for all 17 strains analyzed. One week later, leptospirosis IHA titer increased to 1:20,480. Leptospiral IgG was now positive, -IgM remained positive and urine was tested negative for leptospiral DNA. The MAT showed positive results for L. interrogans serovar Bataviae, serovar Copenhageni, serovar Pyrogenes and L. borgpetersenii serovar Serjoe. During follow-up examinations, both the leptospiral IgM and IgG remained positive and MAT showed positive results for L. interrogans of different serovars. EBV IgA immunoblot taken at admission was positive for VCA-p18, quantitative EBV-PCR showed an EBV viral load of 2.8E3 copies/ml indicating acute EBV-reactivation.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis represents a neglected and re-emerging disease which is difficult to diagnose since Leptospira-PCR from whole blood or urine is frequently negative in the case of early empiric antibiotic treatment. EBV-reactivation might represent a severe complication in Weil's disease which potentially aggravates clinical manifestations of leptospirosis including hepatitis, nephritis, and rhabdomyolysis. Thus, there might be a need for peripheral blood EBV-PCR and EBV blotting in patients suffering from complicated Weil syndrome, also in terms of the choice of antibiotic treatment.","['Karrasch M', 'Herfurth K', 'Kläver M', 'Miethke J', 'Mayer-Scholl A', 'Luge E', 'Straube E', 'Busch M']",2015,43,6,Infection,"Karrasch M, et al.

25980526,Factors associated with fetal losses in ewe lambs on a New Zealand sheep farm.,"CASE HISTORY: As part of a production study of ewe lambs on a large farm in the Waikato region of New Zealand in 2011, pregnancy diagnosis was undertaken twice by trans-abdominal ultrasonography at 68-103 and 97-132 days of gestation. At the second pregnancy diagnosis 257/3,790 (6.8%) ewe lambs had evidence of non-viable fetuses or absence of a pregnancy that was present at the previous pregnancy diagnosis (fetal loss).
LABORATORY FINDINGS: Serum antibody titres for Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona appeared generally higher in 10 ewe lambs with fetal loss compared with 10 that were still pregnant. Histopathological investigation was not able to confirm that fetal loss was associated with leptospial infection.
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION: In the 2012-born cohort of ewe lambs 443 were vaccinated with a bivalent leptospirosis vaccine and 882 unvaccinated. Serum was collected from 124 non-vaccinated ewe lambs between January and December 2013 for measurement of antibodies to Leptospira serovar Pomona and L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo-bovis using a microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Less than 5% of these ewe lambs were seropositive until May, but by August 85% and 48% of animals were seropositive to Leptospira serovars Hardjo-bovis and Pomona, respectively. Fetal loss in non-vaccinated ewe lambs was 78/882 (9%) compared with 23/443 (5%) in vaccinated ewe lambs. Combined data from the 2011- and 2012-born ewe lambs (n=5,115) were analysed using a logistic regression model and fetal loss as the dependent variable. In the final model fetal loss was associated with pre-mating bodyweight (p=0.003), weight change from pre-mating to initial pregnancy diagnosis (p<0.001), year born and leptospirosis vaccination status (p=0.013). Amongst the serologically monitored ewe lambs, there were associations between fetal loss and being seropositive to Leptospira serovar Pomona using titre cut-points of 1:48 and 1:768 (p<0.001).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Low pre-mating weight and/or low weight gain from mating to pregnancy diagnosis was associated with increased fetal loss, emphasising the importance of ewe lambs achieving target pre-mating weights and liveweight gains during pregnancy. Infection with Leptospira serovar Pomona was associated with fetal loss in the 2012-born cohort and the possibility of infection with this serovar should be considered when investigating cases of fetal loss.","['Ridler AL', 'Vallee E', 'Corner RA', 'Kenyon PR', 'Heuer C']",2015,63,6,N Z Vet J,"Ridler AL, et al.

25976319,Immunological and molecular characterization of Leptospira interrogans isolated from a bovine foetus.,"Cattle are commonly infected with pathogenic leptospires, and similarly to rodents, they excrete the bacteria in their urine and can transmit the pathogen from animal to animal or animal to human. Thus, surveillance and monitoring systems for detection of new Leptospira serovars are important for the control of leptospirosis. Here, we report the isolation of a spirochete from a stillborn bovine foetus and its characterization by immunological and molecular techniques. A variable number tandem repeat profile using seven discriminatory primers identified the spirochete as belonging to species Leptospira interrogans serogroup Australis serovar Muenchen. A phenotypic analysis using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against leptospiral membrane-associated proteins confirmed the expression of important virulence and pathogenicity factors (LipL32 and LigBrep). Out of 120 reference sera tested, 22 positive (36.66%) and 9 negative (15%) also reacted with the new isolate. Furthermore, the serovar Muenchen isolate was virulent in hamster model. The animal inoculated developed acute lethal infection characterized by hepatic, pulmonary and renal lesions. Local isolates exhibited unique characteristics that differed from those of reference strains; therefore, isolation of leptospires is useful in the surveillance of local pathogenic serovars. In conclusion, the data obtained from this study can contribute to the epidemiological understanding and control of leptospirosis in southern Brazil.","['Monte LG', 'Ridieri KF', 'Jorge S', 'Oliveira NR', 'Hartwig DD', 'Amaral MG', 'Hartleben CP', 'Dellagostin OA']",2015,40,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Monte LG, et al.

25973203,Cultural drivers and health-seeking behaviours that impact on the transmission of pig-associated zoonoses in Lao People's Democratic Republic.,"Pig rearing is an important income source in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), with many smallholder farmers using traditional free-range pig production systems. Despite the potentially significant health risks posed by pig production regarding pig-associated zoonoses, information on the sociocultural drivers of these zoonoses is significantly lacking. This review summarises the existing sociocultural knowledge on eight pig-associated zoonoses suspected to be endemic in Southeast Asia: brucellosis, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), trichinellosis, hepatitis E virus, leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis, Streptococcus suis and Taenia solium taeniasis-cysticercosis. It summarises current knowledge on these diseases grouped according to their clinical manifestations in humans to highlight the propensity for underreporting. A literature search was conducted across multiple databases for publications from 1990 to the present day related to the eight pig-associated zoonoses and the risk and impact connected with them, with Lao PDR as a case study. Many of these pig-associated zoonoses have similar presentations and are often diagnosed as clinical syndromes. Misdiagnosis and underreporting are, therefore, substantial and emphasise the need for more robust diagnostics and appropriate surveillance systems. While some reports exist in other countries in the region, information is significantly lacking in Lao PDR with existing information coming mainly from the capital, Vientiane. The disease burden imposed by these zoonoses is not only characterised by morbidity and mortality, but directly impacts on livelihoods through income reduction and production losses, and indirectly through treatment costs and lost work opportunities. Other factors crucial to understanding and controlling these diseases are the influence of ethnicity and culture on food-consumption practices, pig rearing and slaughter practices, hygiene and sanitation, health-seeking behaviours and, therefore, risk factors for disease transmission. Published information on the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of people regarding pig zoonoses and their risk factors is also extremely limited in Lao PDR and the broader Southeast Asian region. The need for more transdisciplinary research, using a One Health approach, in order to understand the underlining social determinants of health and their impacts on health-seeking behaviours, disease transmission and, ultimately, disease reporting, cannot be more emphasized.","['Burniston S', 'Okello AL', 'Khamlome B', 'Inthavong P', 'Gilbert J', 'Blacksell SD', 'Allen J', 'Welburn SC']",2015,4,,Infect Dis Poverty,"Burniston S, et al.

25966298,"Serological patterns, antibody half-life and shedding in urine of Leptospira spp. in naturally exposed sheep.","AIMS: To determine within-farm prevalence, longitudinal pattern of exposure measured by serology, antibody titre longevity and point prevalence of shedding in urine of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo and L. interrogans serovar Pomona in naturally infected sheep on a sample of commercial farms in New Zealand.
METHODS: On eight commercial sheep farms, between September 2011 and January 2014, blood samples were collected from 115-217 ewe lambs on each farm, at intervals of 2-11 months. They were analysed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibodies to L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo and L. interrogans serovar Pomona, using a titre cut-point of 48. Urine from 98 animals was tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The half-life of antibodies was estimated in 185 sheep for serovar Hardjo and 21 for Pomona, and the seroprevalence and mean titre of animals lost to follow-up was compared with those remaining in the study.
RESULTS: Within-flock seroprevalence for serovar Hardjo reached a maximum at 17-22 months of age, ranging from 79 to 100%. Seroprevalence for serovar Pomona rose above 10% on three farms and increased to 21-54% by 4-14 months. Seroconversions occurred mainly from late autumn to early summer at 7-15 months of age. Seroprevalences ranging from 3 to 76% for serovar Hardjo and 0.5 to 15% for serovar Pomona were observed up to 3 months of age, likely due to maternally derived immunity. The half-life of antibody in response to infection was estimated to be 6.7 (95% CI=5.8-7.9) months for serovar Hardjo and 6.3 (95% CI=4.8-9.0) months for Pomona. The prevalence of sheep with urine positive for leptospires on qPCR on each farm ranged from 11 to 88%. All but one of the qPCR-positive animals were seropositive for serovar Hardjo. On two farms where Pomona exposure was observed, animals that were lost to follow-up had a higher geometric mean titre for serovar Pomona than those remaining in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated seasonal exposure from autumn to early summer in young sheep, a wide range of within-flock serological and shedding prevalence, and gives an estimation of the half-life of MAT titres in sheep. More extensive data are needed to fully understand the epidemiology of leptospirosis in sheep flocks across New Zealand and, along with economic analysis, to justify and design cost-effective and efficient control measures to protect human and animal health.","['Vallée E', 'Heuer C', 'Collins-Emerson JM', 'Benschop J', 'Wilson PR']",2015,63,6,N Z Vet J,"Vallée E, et al.

25964152,Neglected bacterial zoonoses.,"Bacterial zoonoses comprise a group of diseases in humans or animals acquired by direct contact with or by oral consumption of contaminated animal materials, or via arthropod vectors. Among neglected infections, bacterial zoonoses are among the most neglected given emerging data on incidence and prevalence as causes of acute febrile illness, even in areas where recognized neglected tropical diseases occur frequently. Although many other bacterial infections could also be considered in this neglected category, five distinct infections stand out because they are globally distributed, are acute febrile diseases, have high rates of morbidity and case fatality, and are reported as commonly as malaria, typhoid or dengue virus infections in carefully designed studies in which broad-spectrum diagnoses are actively sought. This review will focus attention on leptospirosis, relapsing fever borreliosis and rickettsioses, including scrub typhus, murine typhus and spotted fever group rickettsiosis. Of greatest interest is the lack of distinguishing clinical features among these infections when in humans, which confounds diagnosis where laboratory confirmation is lacking, and in regions where clinical diagnosis is often attributed to one of several perceived more common threats. As diseases such as malaria come under improved control, the real impact of these common and under-recognized infections will become evident, as will the requirement for the strategies and allocation of resources for their control.","['Chikeka I', 'Dumler JS']",2015,21,5,Clin Microbiol Infect,Chikeka I and Dumler JS.

Pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Lung tissues from 26 dogs with LPHS, 5 dogs with pulmonary haemorrhage due to other causes and 6 healthy lungs were labelled for IgG (n=26), IgM (n=25) and leptospiral antigens (n=26). Three general staining patterns for IgG/IgM were observed in lungs of dogs with LPHS with most tissues showing more than one staining pattern: (1) alveolar septal wall staining, (2) staining favouring alveolar surfaces and (3) staining of intra-alveolar fluid. Healthy control lung showed no staining, whereas haemorrhagic lung from dogs not infected with Leptospira showed staining of intra-alveolar fluid and occasionally alveolar septa. Leptospiral antigens were not detected. We conclude that deposition of IgG/IgM is demonstrable in the majority of canine lungs with naturally occurring LPHS, similar to what has been described in other species. Our findings suggest involvement of the host humoral immunity in the pathogenesis of LPHS and provide further evidence to support the dog as a natural disease model for human LPHS.","['Schuller S', 'Callanan JJ', 'Worrall S', 'Francey T', 'Schweighauser A', 'Kohn B', 'Klopfleisch R', 'Posthaus H', 'Nally JE']",2015,40,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Schuller S, et al.

25962762,Coexistence and survival of pathogenic leptospires by formation of biofilm with Azospirillum.,"Pathogenic Leptospira spp. represent one cause of leptospirosis worldwide and have long been regarded as solitary organisms in soil and aquatic environments. However, in the present study, Leptospira interrogans was observed to be associated with environmental biofilms with 21 bacterial isolates belonging to 10 genera. All 21 isolates were examined for their coaggregation and biofilm-forming ability with leptospires in vitro. Among these, Azospirillum brasilense RMRCPB showed maximum interspecies coaggregation with leptospiral strains (>75%, visual score of +4). Other significant coaggregating isolates belonged to the genera Sphingomonas, Micrococcus, Brevundimonas, Acinetobacter and Paracoccus. Biofilms of leptospires in combination with A. brasilense RMRCPB showed high resistance to penicillin G, ampicillin and tetracycline (minimum bactericidal concentration ≥800 μg/mL) and tolerance to UV radiation and high temperature (up to 49°C). This study hypothesized that biofilm formation with A. brasilense protects the pathogenic Leptospira from adverse environmental conditions/stress. This coexistence of pathogenic Leptospira with other bacteria may be the key factor for its persistence and survival. However, the mechanism of biofilm formation by leptospires needs to be explored to help devise an appropriate control strategy and reduce transmission of leptospires.","['Kumar KV', 'Lall C', 'Raj RV', 'Vedhagiri K', 'Vijayachari P']",2015,91,6,FEMS Microbiol Ecol,"Kumar KV, et al.

25958184,Bacterial Zoonoses Transmitted by Household Pets: State-of-the-Art and Future Perspectives for Targeted Research and Policy Actions.,"The close contact between household pets and people offers favourable conditions for bacterial transmission. In this article, the aetiology, prevalence, transmission, impact on human health and preventative measures are summarized for selected bacterial zoonoses transmissible by household pets. Six zoonoses representing distinct transmission routes were selected arbitrarily based on the available information on incidence and severity of pet-associated disease caused by zoonotic bacteria: bite infections and cat scratch disease (physical injuries), psittacosis (inhalation), leptospirosis (contact with urine), and campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis (faecal-oral ingestion). Antimicrobial resistance was also included due to the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria of zoonotic potential in dogs and cats. There is a general lack of data on pathogen prevalence in the relevant pet population and on the incidence of human infections attributable to pets. In order to address these gaps in knowledge, and to minimize the risk of human infection, actions at several levels are recommended, including: (1) coordinated surveillance of zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in household pets, (2) studies to estimate the burden of human disease attributable to pets and to identify risk behaviours facilitating transmission, and (3) education of those in charge of pets, animal caretakers, veterinarians and human medical healthcare practitioners on the potential zoonotic risks associated with exposure to pets. Disease-specific recommendations include incentives to undertake research aimed at the development of new diagnostic tests, veterinary-specific antimicrobial products and vaccines, as well as initiatives to promote best practices in veterinary diagnostic laboratories and prudent antimicrobial usage.","['Damborg P', 'Broens EM', 'Chomel BB', 'Guenther S', 'Pasmans F', 'Wagenaar JA', 'Weese JS', 'Wieler LH', 'Windahl U', 'Vanrompay D', 'Guardabassi L']",2016,155,1 Suppl 1,J Comp Pathol,"Damborg P, et al.

25947044,Leptospirosis in the Tohoku region: re-emerging infectious disease.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic and disaster-related infectious disease. It is mainly endemic in subtropical or tropical countries and has not been reported since 2009 in the Tohoku region (northern Japan), including the Yamagata and Miyagi Prefectures. However, we experienced four patients with leptospirosis in the Tohoku region from 2012 to 2014; three patients (#1-3) live in the agricultural areas of the Yamagata Prefecture and one patient (#4) was a visitor to the Miyagi Prefecture. Patient 1 (81-year-old female) is a villager, with a rat bite, while Patient 2 (77-year-old male) and Patient 3 (84-year-old female) are farmers and were infected probably during agriculture work. Patient 4 (40-year-old male US citizen) was infected while traveling in Thailand. They had chief complaint of fever, headache, and myalgia and showed manifestations of hyperbilirubinemia (mean, 4.35 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI). All patients were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction using blood and/or urine samples and a microscopic agglutination test for the anti-Leptospira antibody. All the patients were treated with infused antibiotics, including minocycline. The patients underwent hemodialysis due to severe AKI (mean serum creatinine, 4.44 mg/dL), except for Patient 2 with the normal serum creatinine level (1.12 mg/dL). All the patients recovered and were discharged. The presence of the three patients in the Yamagata Prefecture implies that leptospirosis does re-emerge in the Tohoku region. Therefore, careful survey of the pathogen is necessary for febrile patients with AKI who engage in agriculture or have a recent history of travelling in subtropical or tropical countries.","['Saitoh H', 'Koizumi N', 'Seto J', 'Ajitsu S', 'Fujii A', 'Takasaki S', 'Yamakage S', 'Aoki S', 'Nakayama K', 'Ashino Y', 'Chagan-Yasutan H', 'Kiyomoto H', 'Hattori T']",2015,236,1,Tohoku J Exp Med,"Saitoh H, et al.

25914944,Interaction of spirochetes with the host fibrinolytic system and potential roles in pathogenesis.,"The pathogenic spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi, B. hermsii, B. recurrentis, Treponema denticola and Leptospira spp. are the etiologic agents of Lyme disease, relapsing fever, periodontitis and leptospirosis, respectively. Lyme borreliosis is a multi-systemic disorder and the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. Tick-borne relapsing fever is persistent in endemic areas worldwide, representing a significant burden in some African regions. Periodontal disease, a chronic inflammatory disorder that often leads to tooth loss, is caused by several potential pathogens found in the oral cavity including T. denticola. Leptospirosis is considered the most widespread zoonosis, and the predominant human disease in tropical, undeveloped regions. What these diseases have in common is that they are a significant burden to healthcare costs in the absence of prophylactic measures. This review addresses the interaction of these spirochetes with the fibrinolytic system, plasminogen (Plg) binding to the surface of bacteria and the generation of plasmin (Pla) on their surface. The consequences on host-pathogen interactions when the spirochetes are endowed with this proteolytic activity are discussed on the basis of the results reported in the literature. Spirochetes equipped with Pla activity have been shown to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components, in addition to digesting fibrin, facilitating bacterial invasion and dissemination. Pla generation triggers the induction of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in a cascade of events that enhances the proteolytic capacity of the spirochetes. These activities in concert with the interference exerted by the Plg/Pla on the complement system - helping the bacteria to evade the immune system - should illuminate our understanding of the mechanisms involved in host infection.","['Vieira ML', 'Nascimento AL']",2016,42,4,Crit Rev Microbiol,Vieira ML and Nascimento AL.

We reoptimized and validated this assay using PerfeCTa® qPCR ToughMix®, Low ROX™ (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). For optimization with the new mix, the final primer concentrations were increased from 0.5 μmol/L to 0.9 μmol/L compared to our previous assay, and the probe concentration increased from 0.1 μmol/L to 0.125 μmol/L.

25891653,Prognosis and impact of equine recurrent uveitis.,"REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a leading cause of vision loss in horses.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the prognosis and impact of ERU on affected horses and their owners by evaluating the signalment, treatment and outcome (including the loss of use, vision assessment and economic loss).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective impact study.
METHODS: Medical records of horses presenting to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Health Complex (NCSU-VHC) with ERU between 1999 and 2014 were reviewed. Signalment, clinical signs, ophthalmic examination findings, treatments and outcomes were evaluated. Owner questionnaires were completed regarding vision, job/role, monetary value, diagnostic and treatment costs, concurrent illness and outcomes.
RESULTS: Records of 224 horses (338 eyes) with ERU were reviewed. There was an overrepresentation of Appaloosas (54; 24.1%), Hanoverians (11; 4.9%) and other Warmbloods (13; 5.8%). Ninety-six eyes (28.4%) were diagnosed as blind and 38 eyes (11.2%) with glaucoma on initial evaluation. Leptospirosis titres of serum and/or aqueous humour were obtained in 88 horses and were positive in 40 horses (45.5%), with L. pomona being the most frequently isolated serovar. Globe loss at the NCSU-VHC occurred in 41 ERU eyes (12.1% of total). Owner questionnaires were evaluated in 194 horses (86.6%) and 91 horses (46.9%) were reported blind in the affected eye(s). Fifty-seven horses (29.4%) did not return to their previous role, while 61 (31.4%) performed at a reduced level. Equine recurrent uveitis decreased the monetary value of 164 horses. Twenty-nine horses (14.9%) were euthanised and 37 (19.1%) underwent change in ownership as a direct result of ERU.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of ERU is attributed to the high frequency of blindness, globe loss and loss of function. Euthanasia and change of ownership are common sequelae to the progressive nature of ERU. These factors, along with financial costs of the disease, have a significant impact on affected horses and their owners.","['Gerding JC', 'Gilger BC']",2016,48,3,Equine Vet J,Gerding JC and Gilger BC.

25888965,Isolation of Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjoprajitno from a calf with clinical leptospirosis in Chile.,"BACKGROUND: Although Leptospira isolation has been reported in Chilean cattle, only serological evidence of serovar Hardjo bovis infection has been routinely reported. The present report provides characterization of the pathological presentation and etiology of a clinical case of leptospirosis in a calf from the Los Rios Region in Chile.
CASE PRESENTATION: In a dairy herd in southern Chile, 11 of 130 calves died after presenting signs such as depression and red-tinged urine. One of these calves, a female of eight months, was necropsied, and all the pathological findings were consistent with Leptospira infection. A urine sample was submitted to conventional bacteriological analysis together with highly specific molecular biology typing tools, in order to unravel the specific Leptospira specie and serovar associated with this clinical case. A significant finding of this study was that the obtained isolate was confirmed by PCR as L. interrogans, its VNTR profile properly matching with L. interrogans Hardjoprajitno as well as its specific genomic identity revealed by secY gen.
CONCLUSION: Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjoprajitno was associated with the investigated calf clinical case. This information adds to the value of serologic results commonly reported, which encourage vaccination improvements to match circulating strains. In addition, this finding represents the first case report of this serovar in Chilean cattle.","['Salgado M', 'Otto B', 'Moroni M', 'Sandoval E', 'Reinhardt G', 'Boqvist S', 'Encina C', 'Muñoz-Zanzi C']",2015,11,,BMC Vet Res,"Salgado M, et al.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with ST segment depression in lateral leads which evolved in to rapid atrial fibrillation in the subsequent days. 2D echocardiogram showed dilated cardiac chambers with severe global hypokinesia and an ejection fraction of 20%. His renal and liver functions were within normal limits. He developed multi organ dysfunction syndrome and refractory shock, later in the course of illness. Leptospirosis was confirmed by positive leptospira IgM and negative IgG. Patient died on the fifth day of illness despite optimal medical treatment with intravenous penicillin, meropenem, levofloxacin, inotropes and supportive care in the intensive care unit.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a rare and unusual early complication of leptospirosis which has not been reported before. It is important to bear in mind that leptospirosis could present as myocarditis during the early phase of illness.","['Pushpakumara J', 'Prasath T', 'Samarajiwa G', 'Priyadarshani S', 'Perera N', 'Indrakumar J']",2015,8,,BMC Res Notes,"Pushpakumara J, et al.

25880871,"Seroepidemiology of leptospirosis in dogs from rural and slum communities of Los Rios Region, Chile.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance and often neglected as a public health problem due to lack of awareness, under-diagnosis and under-reporting. Animals serve as a source of transmission through the shedding of Leptospira in their urine. Because of their proximity to humans, dogs may play a role in human infections. In order to assess and mitigate leptospirosis in dogs and the risk of transmission to humans it is important to understand the epidemiology of leptospirosis under natural conditions. This study aimed to characterize leptospirosis in owned dogs from three distinct community types. Blood, dog and household data were collected from 265 dogs in 190 households from 12 communities representing farms, rural villages, and urban slums in the Los Rios region, Chile. Serologic profiles with a 20-serovar microagglutination test panel were obtained. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between spatial, ecological, socio-economic variables and overall seropositivity as well as seropositivity to serogroup Canicola.
RESULTS: Results from 247 dogs with no history of vaccination were used. Overall seroprevalence was 25.1% (62/247) with significant differences by community type: 10.9% (9/82) in dogs from farms, 22.3% (21/94) from rural villages, and 45.1% (32/71) from urban slums (p <0.001). This trend by community type was also observed for dogs with evidence of seropositivity to the Canicola serogroup. Factors associated with seropositive dogs included dog density and precipitation two-weeks prior to sampling. Presence of Leptospira positive puddles collected from the peri-domestic household environment was also associated with increased seropositivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that leptospirosis is actively maintained in the dog population in this study region with notably distinct patterns by community type. Dog populations from rural villages, and urban slums in particular, showed evidence of high levels of transmission probably as a result of the combined effects of dog living conditions as well as community-level ecological and environmental factors.","['Lelu M', 'Muñoz-Zanzi C', 'Higgins B', 'Galloway R']",2015,11,,BMC Vet Res,"Lelu M, et al.

25880767,Neglected tropical diseases among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): overview and update.,"The ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) constitute an economic powerhouse, yet these countries also harbor a mostly hidden burden of poverty and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Almost 200 million people live in extreme poverty in ASEAN countries, mostly in the low or lower middle-income countries of Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, Viet Nam, and Cambodia, and many of them are affected by at least one NTD. However, NTDs are prevalent even among upper middle-income ASEAN countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, especially among the indigenous populations. The three major intestinal helminth infections are the most common NTDs; each helminthiasis is associated with approximately 100 million infections in the region. In addition, more than 10 million people suffer from either liver or intestinal fluke infections, as well as schistosomiasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF). Intestinal protozoan infections are widespread, while leishmaniasis has emerged in Thailand, and zoonotic malaria (Plasmodium knowlesi infection) causes severe morbidity in Malaysia. Melioidosis has emerged as an important bacterial NTD, as have selected rickettsial infections, and leptospirosis. Leprosy, yaws, and trachoma are still endemic in focal areas. Almost 70 million cases of dengue fever occur annually in ASEAN countries, such that this arboviral infection is now one of the most common and economically important NTDs in the region. A number of other arboviral and zoonotic viral infections have also emerged, including Japanese encephalitis; tick-borne viral infections; Nipah virus, a zoonosis present in fruit bats; and enterovirus 71 infection. There are urgent needs to expand surveillance activities in ASEAN countries, as well as to ensure mass drug administration is provided to populations at risk for intestinal helminth and fluke infections, LF, trachoma, and yaws. An ASEAN Network for Drugs, Diagnostics, Vaccines, and Traditional Medicines Innovation provides a policy framework for the development of new control and elimination tools. Together with prominent research institutions and universities, the World Health Organization (WHO), and its regional offices, these organizations could implement important public health improvements through NTD control and elimination in the coming decade.","['Hotez PJ', 'Bottazzi ME', 'Strych U', 'Chang LY', 'Lim YA', 'Goodenow MM', 'AbuBakar S']",2015,9,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Hotez PJ, et al.

25875373,Evaluation of cell binding activities of Leptospira ECM adhesins.,"Pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira are the causative agents of leptospirosis, a zoonotic infection that occurs globally. The bacteria colonize the renal proximal tubules of many animals and are shed in the urine. Contact with the urine, or with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals can cause infection of new host animals, including humans. Mechanisms of colonization of the proximal tubule and other tissues are not known, but specific interactions between bacterial adhesins and host substrates are likely to be critical in this process. Several extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesins have been previously identified, but more recently, it has been shown that Leptospira bind more efficiently to cells than ECM. In this work, recombinant forms of five putative Leptospira ECM adhesins, namely LipL32, Loa22, OmpL1, p31/LipL45, and LenA were evaluated for binding to cells as well as an expanded variety of ECM components. Reproducible and significant adhesin activity was demonstrated only for OmpL1, which bound to both mammalian cell lines tested and to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). While determination of biologically significant bacterial adhesion activity will require generation of site-directed mutant strains, our results suggest that OmpL1 is a strong candidate for future evaluation regarding the roles of the adhesin activity of the protein during L. interrogans infection.","['Robbins GT', 'Hahn BL', 'Evangelista KV', 'Padmore L', 'Aranda PS', 'Coburn J']",2015,9,4,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Robbins GT, et al.

25874381,Has Madagascar lost its exceptional leptospirosis free-like status?,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a widespread but underreported cause of morbidity and mortality. It has rarely been reported in either humans or animals in Madagascar.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the inhabitants in Moramanga, Madagascar, in June 2011, to estimate the prevalence of human infection using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). This activity was carried out as part of a workshop implemented by the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, focusing on surveillance with a one week field study and targeting the health staff of the district level.
RESULTS: In total, we sampled 678 inhabitants from 263 households. The sex ratio (M/F) was 0.65 and the mean age 26.7 years. We obtained a value of 2.9% for the first recorded seroprevalence of this disease in the human community of Moramanga. Questionnaire responses revealed frequent contacts between humans and rodents in Moramanga. However, activities involving cattle were identified as a risk factor significantly associated with seropositivity (OR=3).
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis remains a neglected disease in Madagascar. This study highlights the need to quantify the public health impact of this neglected disease in a more large scale, in all the country and to establish point-of-care laboratories in remote areas.","['Ratsitorahina M', 'Rahelinirina S', 'Michault A', 'Rajerison M', 'Rajatonirina S', 'Richard V', '2011 Surveillance Workshop group']",2015,10,4,PLoS One,"Ratsitorahina M, et al.

25873099,"Leptospirosis in an urban setting: cases diagnosed at a private medical center of Western Colombia, 2008-2012.","INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis has reemerged as significant threat particularly in developing countries, including those in Latin America. Data from Colombia is still limited and there are no published studies in the Western area of the country.
METHODS: Data on suspected cases were collected over the study period (2008- 2012). Cases were diagnosed clinically and confirmed by ELISA IgG and microscopic agglutination test (MAT) (titers ≥1:400).
RESULTS: During the study period 264 suspected cases of leptospirosis were found. From those, 8.33% (22 cases) were microbiologically confirmed. Number of suspected cases increased in the period from 20 (2008) (40 cases/100,000 consultations) to 58 (2012) (120 cases/100,000 consultations). Regard sex distribution, 62.5% were males, 14% in the age group 21-30 y-old, from confirmed cases 95% live in urban areas of Pereira, 25.7% own dogs and 13.2% cats, 32.3% reporting rats at home as well 22.7% at work places. From confirmed cases 72.7% were hospitalized. Clinical findings found were: fever (60.2%), myalgias (47%), and headache (41.9%), among others. All the cases corresponded to Leptospira interrogans. Regard the serovars, in these patients 6 were identified: Australis (54.5%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (45.5%), Canicola (45.5%), Panama (45.5%), Pomona (36.3) and Grippotyphosa (1%). Thirty nine percent of the patients received antimicrobial therapy, 50% ceftriaxone. No deaths occurred.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease that has changed from an occupational disease of veterinarians, farmers, butchers, and other animal handlers to a cause of epidemics in poor and decayed urban communities in developing countries, including those in Latin America such as Colombia.","['Ramírez-Ramírez MM', 'León-Castañeda OM', 'Rodriguez-Morales AJ']",2015,10,1,Recent Pat Antiinfect Drug Discov,"Ramírez-Ramírez MM, et al.

25870752,Evaluation of New ELISA based on rLsa63 - rLipL32 antigens for serodiagnosis of Human Leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Timely diagnosis of leptospirosis is essential for an effective treatment. Large diversity of clinical symptoms has led leptospirosis diagnosis difficult. Researchers have conducted many tests with wide-range of sensitivity and specificity to achieve novel diagnostic procedures which have higher sensitivity and specificity compared with previous tests and which are more reliable and available to public laboratories. This study aimed to introduce Lsa63 and LipL32 proteins-based ELISA tests with more sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and convenience for public laboratories.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recombinant forms of Lsa63 and LipL32 proteins were first generated. After coating these proteins, IgM and IgG ELISA tests were performed. 220 patients with suspicion of leptospirosis infection were selected for serum collection. The sera tests were carried out using MAT, IgM and IgG ELISA tests. In order to assess the performance of ELISA, the results of this test were compared with MAT.
RESULTS: 30% of serum samples (n=65) in MAT were positive for leptospirosis infection, while ELISA tests including rLipL32- rLsa63-IgM and rLipL32-rLsa63-IgG showed 40.45% (n=89) and 38.63% (n=80) positive reaction, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that new ELISA tests based on mixing LipL32 and Lsa63 proteins, a novel mixture of recombinant antigens, are valuable to detect specific antibodies against pathogenic Leptospira in human serum and could be considered as helpful techniques in leptospirosis diagnosis.","['Alizadeh SA', 'Abdolahpour G', 'Pourmand MR', 'Naserpour T', 'Najafipour R', 'Eshraghi SS']",2014,6,3,Iran J Microbiol,"Alizadeh SA, et al.

25859456,To evaluate the different rapid screening tests for diagnosis of leptospirosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is an acute febrile disease, in tropical and sub-tropical regions of world. It has been under-reported in India, due to presence of non-specific symptoms and unavailability of appropriate laboratory diagnostic facilities in most part of the country. The diagnosis of leptospirosis is usually based on demonstration of antibodies by different serological tests.
AIM: The present study aims to evaluate and compare commercially available rapid test.
DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Case control study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three screening tests (Leptocheck WB, Latex agglutination test and SD leptospira) were compared by using 100 serum samples randomly obtained from clinical cases of Leptospirosis admitted in new civil hospital, Surat, Gujarat. All the patients with acute Leptospirosis were included in this 4-months pilot study from July 2011 to October 2011. All the results were compared with IgM ELISA and MAT for confirmation of diagnosis.
RESULTS: Leptocheck WB, Latex agglutination test and SD leptospira had sensitivities of 84.8%, 84.8% and 72.7% & specificities of 37.3%, 71.2% and 71.2% respectively as compared to MAT. Leptocheck WB, Latex agglutination test and SD leptospira had sensitivities of 90.7%, 89.7% and 53.7% & specificities of 93.4%, 90.9% and 60% respectively as compared to IgM ELISA.
CONCLUSION: Latex agglutination test kit and Leptocheck WB were found to be highly sensitive and specific. Neither of these tests require specialized equipment, and could be performed in peripheral laboratories with relatively little expertise.","['Panwala T', 'Rajdev S', 'Mulla S']",2015,9,2,J Clin Diagn Res,"Panwala T, et al.

25849456,Features of two new proteins with OmpA-like domains identified in the genome sequences of Leptospira interrogans.,"Leptospirosis is an acute febrile disease caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. It is considered an important re-emerging infectious disease that affects humans worldwide. The knowledge about the mechanisms by which pathogenic leptospires invade and colonize the host remains limited since very few virulence factors contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease have been identified. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two new leptospiral proteins with OmpA-like domains. The recombinant proteins, which exhibit extracellular matrix-binding properties, are called Lsa46 - LIC13479 and Lsa77 - LIC10050 (Leptospiral surface adhesins of 46 and 77 kDa, respectively). Attachment of Lsa46 and Lsa77 to laminin was specific, dose dependent and saturable, with KD values of 24.3 ± 17.0 and 53.0 ± 17.5 nM, respectively. Lsa46 and Lsa77 also bind plasma fibronectin, and both adhesins are plasminogen (PLG)-interacting proteins, capable of generating plasmin (PLA) and as such, increase the proteolytic ability of leptospires. The proteins corresponding to Lsa46 and Lsa77 are present in virulent L. interrogans L1-130 and in saprophyte L. biflexa Patoc 1 strains, as detected by immunofluorescence. The adhesins are recognized by human leptospirosis serum samples at the onset and convalescent phases of the disease, suggesting that they are expressed during infection. Taken together, our data could offer valuable information to the understanding of leptospiral pathogenesis.","['Teixeira AF', 'de Morais ZM', 'Kirchgatter K', 'Romero EC', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Nascimento AL']",2015,10,4,PLoS One,"Teixeira AF, et al.

A total of 308 from aborted females (202 ewes and 106 does) and 197 sera (97 ewes and 99 does), were tested for brucellosis, chlamydiosis, Q fever, toxoplasmosis, and for 9 major serovars of Leptospira. An average abortion rate of 12.10% was found in ewes and 10.26% in does. The serological analyses revealed the presence of all 5 abortive infections, both in sheep and in goats. Ten (43%) herds/flocks were positive to brucellosis, 21 (91%) to chlamydiosis, 17 (74%) to toxoplasmosis, 13 (57%) to Q fever, and 5 (22%) to leptospirosis. Leptospira spp. serovars Copenhageni and Grypothyphosa were found in a single sheep flock, while Tarassovi and Copenhageni were detected in 4 goat herds. Of the 23 investigated herds/flocks, 22 (96%) showed mixed infections.

25835103,Leptospirosis presenting as honeymoon fever.,"An increasing number of travelers from western countries visit tropical regions, questioning western physicians on the prophylaxis, the diagnosis and the therapeutic management of patients with travel-associated infection. In July 2014, a French couple stayed for an adventure-travel in Columbia without malaria prophylaxis. A week after their return the woman presented with fever, myalgia, and retro-orbital pain. Three days later, her husband presented similar symptoms. In both patients, testing for malaria, arboviruses and blood cultures remained negative. An empirical treatment with doxycycline and ceftriaxone was initiated for both patients. Serum collected from the female patient yielded positive IgM for leptospirosis but was negative for her husband. Positive Real-Time PCR were observed in blood and urine from both patients, confirming leptospirosis. Three lessons are noteworthy from this case report. First, after exclusion of malaria, as enteric fever, leptospirosis and rickettsial infection are the most prevalent travel-associated infections, empirical treatment with doxycycline and third generation cephalosporin should be considered. In addition, the diagnosis of leptospirosis requires both serology and PCR performed in both urine and blood samples. Finally, prophylaxis using doxycycline, also effective against leptospirosis, rickettsial infections or travellers' diarrhea should be recommended for adventure travelers in malaria endemic areas.","['de Sainte Marie B', 'Delord M', 'Dubourg G', 'Gautret P', 'Parola P', 'Brouqui P', 'Lagier JC']",2015,34,,Int J Infect Dis,"de Sainte Marie B, et al.

25834144,Leptospira interrogans reduces fibrin clot formation by modulating human thrombin activity via exosite I.,"Pathogenic bacteria of the genus Leptospira are the etiological agents of leptospirosis, a disease that affects humans and animals worldwide. Although there are an increasing number of studies on the biology of Leptospira, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are not yet understood. We report in this work that Leptospira interrogans FIOCRUZ L1-130 virulent, M20 culture attenuated and the saprophyte L. biflexa Patoc 1 strains do not bind prothrombin. Leptospiral binding to thrombin was detected with the virulent, followed by culture-attenuated M20, and practically none was observed with the saprophyte strain. The interaction of Leptospira with thrombin mostly occurs via exosite I, with a minor participation of catalytic site, as determined by employing the thrombin inhibitors hirugen, hirudin and argatroban. Leptospira interrogans binding to thrombin inhibits its catalytic activity reducing fibrin clot formation in thrombin-catalyzed reaction of fibrinogen. This inhibition was more efficient with the virulent FIOCRUZ L1-130 than with the M20 culture attenuated, while none was seen with the saprophyte strain, suggesting that this binding might be important for bacterial virulence. This is the first study reporting the binding of pathogenic Leptospira to thrombin promoting a decrease in fibrin clotting that could lead to hemorrhage, helping bacteria dissemination.","['Fernandes LG', 'de Morais ZM', 'Vasconcellos SA', 'Nascimento AL']",2015,73,4,Pathog Dis,"Fernandes LG, et al.

25818725,Comparative proteomic analysis of lung tissue from guinea pigs with leptospiral pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome (LPHS) reveals a decrease in abundance of host proteins involved in cytoskeletal and cellular organization.,"UNLABELLED: Leptospiral pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome (LPHS) is a particularly severe form of leptospirosis. LPHS is increasingly recognized in both humans and animals and is characterized by rapidly progressive intra-alveolar haemorrhage leading to high mortality. The pathogenic mechanisms of LPHS are poorly understood which hampers the application of effective treatment regimes. In this study a 2-D guinea pig proteome lung map was created and used to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of LPHS. Comparison of lung proteomes from infected and non-infected guinea pigs via differential in-gel electrophoresis revealed highly significant differences in abundance of proteins contained in 130 spots. Acute phase proteins were the largest functional group amongst proteins with increased abundance in LPHS lung tissue, and likely reflect a local and/or systemic host response to infection. The observed decrease in abundance of proteins involved in cytoskeletal and cellular organization in LPHS lung tissue further suggests that infection with pathogenic Leptospira induces changes in the abundance of host proteins involved in cellular architecture and adhesion contributing to the dramatically increased alveolar septal wall permeability seen in LPHS.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The recent completion of the complete genome sequence of the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) provides innovative opportunities to apply proteomic technologies to an important animal model of disease. In this study, the comparative proteomic analysis of lung tissue from experimentally infected guinea pigs with leptospiral pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome (LPHS) revealed a decrease in abundance of proteins involved in cellular architecture and adhesion, suggesting that loss or down-regulation of cytoskeletal and adhesion molecules plays an important role in the pathogenesis of LPHS. A publically available guinea pig lung proteome map was constructed to facilitate future pulmonary proteomics in this species.","['Schuller S', 'Sergeant K', 'Renaut J', 'Callanan JJ', 'Scaife C', 'Nally JE']",2015,122,,J Proteomics,"Schuller S, et al.

Serious and potentially life-threatening clinical manifestations of acute leptospirosis are caused by both direct tissue invasion by spirochaetes and by the host immune responses. In its severe form, leptospirosis can cause multi-organ dysfunction and death in a matter of days. Therefore it is critical to suspect and recognize the disease early, in order to initiate timely treatment. While the classical presentation of the disease is easily recognized by experienced clinicians practising in endemic regions, rarer manifestations can be easily missed. In this systematic review, we summarize the atypical manifestations reported in literature in patients with confirmed leptospirosis. Awareness of these unusual manifestations would hopefully guide clinicians towards early diagnosis.","['Rajapakse S', 'Rodrigo C', 'Balaji K', 'Fernando SD']",2015,109,5,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Rajapakse S, et al.

25810615,A rare case of leptospirosis with isolated lung involvement.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by a pathogenic spirochete ""leptospira interrogans."" Severe form of leprospira infection is usually associated with jaundice and renal involvement, leading to major hemorrhagic complications. Lung involvement can vary from subtle clinical features to deadly pulmonary hemorrhage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We recently managed a case of leptospirosis with isolated lung involvement as alveolar hemorrhage and ARDS. Our patient had acute febrile illness with respiratory symptoms associated with radiological picture of pulmonary hemorrhage. Patient was managed with noninvasive ventilation with high flow oxygen, antibiotic and pulse steroids therapy. In conclusion, leptospirosis can present with predominant pulmonary involvement, instead of the classical triad of Weil disease. High index of suspicion should be kept in acute febrile illness patients with respiratory symptoms and alveolar hemorrhage. Early diagnosis and management with oxygenation, antibiotics and immunosuppresents can prevent complications and mortality.","['Agrawal VK', 'Bansal A', 'Pujani M']",2015,19,3,Indian J Crit Care Med,"Agrawal VK, et al.

25809508,WWOSC 2014: research needs for better health resilience to weather hazards.,"The first World Weather Open Science Conference (WWOSC, held from 17-21 August 2014 in Montreal, Québec), provided an open forum where the experience and perspective of a variety of weather information providers and users was combined with the latest application advances in social sciences. A special session devoted to health focused on how best the most recent weather information and communication technologies (ICT) could improve the health emergency responses to disasters resulting from natural hazards. Speakers from a plenary presentation and its corresponding panel shared lessons learnt from different international multidisciplinary initiatives against weather-related epidemics, such as malaria, leptospirosis and meningitis and from public health responses to floods and heat waves such as in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Participants could bear witness to recent progress made in the use of forecasting tools and in the application of increased spatiotemporal resolutions in the management of weather related health risks through anticipative interventions, early alert and warning and early responses especially by vulnerable groups. There was an agreement that resilience to weather hazards is best developed based on evidence of their health impact and when, at local level, there is a close interaction between health care providers, epidemiologists, climate services, public health authorities and communities. Using near real time health data (such as hospital admission, disease incidence monitoring…) combined with weather information has been recommended to appraise the relevance of decisions and the effectiveness of interventions and to make adjustments when needed. It also helps appraising how people may be more or less vulnerable to a particular hazard depending on the resilience infrastructures and services. This session was mainly attended by climate, environment and social scientists from North American and European countries. Producing a commentary appears to be an effective way to share this session's conclusions to research institutions and public health experts worldwide. It also advocates for better linking operational research and decision making and for appraising the impact of ICT and public health interventions on health.","['Jancloes M', 'Anderson V', 'Gosselin P', 'Mee C', 'Chong NJ']",2015,12,3,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Jancloes M, et al.

25807009,Validation of a microsphere immunoassay for serological leptospirosis diagnosis in human serum by comparison to the current gold standard.,"A microsphere immunoassay (MIA) utilising Luminex xMap technology that is capable of determining leptospirosis IgG and IgM independently was developed. The MIA was validated using 200 human samples submitted for routine leptospirosis serology testing. The traditional microscopic agglutination (MAT) method (now 100 years old) suffers from a significant range of technical problems including a dependence on antisera which is difficult to source and produce, false positive reactions due to auto-agglutination and an inability to differentiate between IgG and IgM antibodies. A comparative validation method of the MIA against the MAT was performed and used to determine the ability of the MIA to detect leptospiral antibodies when compared with the MAT. The assay was able to determine samples in the reactive, equivocal and non-reactive ranges when compared to the MAT and was able to differentiate leptospiral IgG antibodies from leptospiral IgM antibodies. The MIA is more sensitive than the MAT and in true infections was able to detect low levels of antibody in the later stages of the acute phase as well as detect higher levels of IgM antibody earlier in the immune phase of the infection. The relatively low cost, high throughput platform and significantly reduced dependency on large volumes of rabbit antisera make this assay worthy of consideration for any microbiological assay that currently uses agglutination assays.","['Wynwood SJ', 'Burns MA', 'Graham GC', 'Weier SL', 'McKay DB', 'Craig SB']",2015,9,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Wynwood SJ, et al.

25804406,Prevalence and risk factors for Leptospira exposure in New Zealand veterinarians.,"This study assessed seroprevalence and risk factors for Leptospira (serovars Hardjo, Pomona, Ballum, Copenhageni, Tarassovi) exposure in New Zealand veterinarians. Veterinarians (n = 277) at one of two conferences were voluntarily enrolled and blood samples taken. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) titres ⩾48 were considered seropositive. Fourteen veterinarians (5·1%, 95% confidence interval 2·8-8·3) were seropositive to Leptospira. Home slaughter of cattle or pigs were significant risk factors for Leptospira exposure. There were no clear relationships between the animal species handled at work and serostatus. However, veterinarians spending a 'mid to high' proportion of their time (>50% to ⩽75%) with pets had higher odds of being seropositive than those not working with pets. A borderline positive association (P = 0·09) was observed between seropositivity and clinical influenza-like illness (⩾3 days off work) in the 18 months before the study. Assuming causality, this suggests that 8·3% of these cases may be attributed to Leptospira exposure.","['Sanhueza JM', 'Heuer C', 'Wilson PR', 'Benschop J', 'Collins-Emerson JM']",2015,143,10,Epidemiol Infect,"Sanhueza JM, et al.

One week later he left for France with the first British troops as an officer with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He spent most of the First World War attached to No. 1 Mobile Bacteriological Laboratory at the Remy Siding British-Canadian field hospital in Flanders. In April 1916, he was confronted with an outbreak of trench jaundice, also known as epidemic jaundice (Weil's disease). Conditions in the trenches contributed to the hundred cases identified by Stokes in a short period. In 1917, he was the first to publish (in The Lancet) the finding that the bacterium Spirochaeta icterohaemorrhagiae, the causative agent of epidemic jaundice, could be isolated from the kidneys of rats. A subsequent rat control campaign in the trenches successfully curbed the disease.",['Wever PC'],2015,159,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Wever PC. [Adrian Stokes and 'trench jaundice'].

25802431,Prevalence of Endemic Pig-Associated Zoonoses in Southeast Asia: A Review of Findings from the Lao People's Democratic Republic.,"The increasing intensification of pork production in southeast Asia necessitates an urgent requirement to better understand the dual impact of pig-associated zoonotic disease on both pig production and human health in the region. Sharing porous borders with five countries and representing many regional ethnicities and agricultural practices, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) appears well placed to gauge the levels of pig-associated zoonoses circulating in the wider region. Despite this, little is known about the true impact of zoonotic pathogens such as leptospirosis, Trichinella, hepatitis E virus (HEV), Japanese encephalitis (JE), and Taenia solium on human health and livestock production in the country. A comprehensive review of the published prevalences of these five pig-associated zoonoses in Lao PDR has demonstrated that although suspicion remains high of their existence in pig reservoirs across the country, epidemiological data are scarce; only 31 epidemiological studies have been undertaken on these diseases in the past 25 years. A greater understanding of the zoonoses prevalence and subsequent risks associated with pork production in the southeast Asian region could help focus public health and food safety interventions at key points along the value chain, benefiting both livestock producers and the broader animal and human health systems in the region.","['Okello AL', 'Burniston S', 'Conlan JV', 'Inthavong P', 'Khamlome B', 'Welburn SC', 'Gilbert J', 'Allen J', 'Blacksell SD']",2015,92,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Okello AL, et al.

Commonly used antimicrobial agents such as the penicillin G and ceftriaxone had relatively low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) while doxycycline displayed a relatively higher value but was still considered to be effective. While imipenem was the most effective with low MIC values in vitro, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim had the highest i.e. least effective. Based on these results, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of leptospirosis (penicillin G, penicillin-streptomycin, doxycycline and ceftriaxone) in both humans and animals in Trinidad appear to have similar MICs and MBCs in vitro when compared with published reports. The serovar of Leptospira spp. and in most cases the origin of the isolates did not significantly (P>0.05) influence their susceptibilities to the antimicrobial agents tested.","['Suepaul SM', 'Carrington C', 'Campbell M', 'Borde G', 'Adesiyun AA']",2015,32,1,Trop Biomed,"Suepaul SM, et al.

25793258,Proteomic analysis of urine exosomes reveals renal tubule response to leptospiral colonization in experimentally infected rats.,"BACKGROUND: Infectious Leptospira colonize the kidneys of reservoir (e.g. rats) and accidental hosts such as humans. The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonization model. Quantitative differences in infected male and female rat urine exosome proteins vs. uninfected controls suggest that urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function that may be of clinical and pathological significance.","['RamachandraRao SP', 'Matthias MA', 'Kokoy-Mondragon C', 'Aghania E', 'Park C', 'Kong C', 'Ishaya M', 'Madrigal A', 'Horng J', 'Khoshaba R', 'Bounkhoun A', 'Basilico F', 'De Palma A', 'Agresta AM', 'Awdishu L', 'Naviaux RK', 'Vinetz JM', 'Mauri P']",2015,9,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"RamachandraRao SP, et al.

25791930,Molecular epidemiology of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) migrating to Zambia from the Democratic Republic of Congo.,"The role played by bats as a potential source of transmission of Leptospira spp. to humans is poorly understood, despite various pathogenic Leptospira spp. being identified in these mammals. Here, we investigated the prevalence and diversity of pathogenic Leptospira spp. that infect the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum). We captured this bat species, which is widely distributed in Africa, in Zambia during 2008-2013. We detected the flagellin B gene (flaB) from pathogenic Leptospira spp. in kidney samples from 79 of 529 E. helvum (14.9%) bats. Phylogenetic analysis of 70 flaB fragments amplified from E. helvum samples and previously reported sequences, revealed that 12 of the fragments grouped with Leptospira borgpetersenii and Leptospira kirschneri; however, the remaining 58 flaB fragments appeared not to be associated with any reported species. Additionally, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rrs) amplified from 27 randomly chosen flaB-positive samples was compared with previously reported sequences, including bat-derived Leptospira spp. All 27 rrs fragments clustered into a pathogenic group. Eight fragments were located in unique branches, the other 19 fragments were closely related to Leptospira spp. detected in bats. These results show that rrs sequences in bats are genetically related to each other without regional variation, suggesting that Leptospira are evolutionarily well-adapted to bats and have uniquely evolved in the bat population. Our study indicates that pathogenic Leptospira spp. in E. helvum in Zambia have unique genotypes.","['Ogawa H', 'Koizumi N', 'Ohnuma A', 'Mutemwa A', ""Hang'ombe BM"", 'Mweene AS', 'Takada A', 'Sugimoto C', 'Suzuki Y', 'Kida H', 'Sawa H']",2015,32,,Infect Genet Evol,"Ogawa H, et al.

Synthetic data on the incidence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases in both animals and humans in European forests do not exist. It is therefore difficult to promote appropriate preventive measures among workers or people who come into direct or indirect contact with forest animals.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are to synthesise existing knowledge on the prevalence of the three predominant bacterial zoonotic diseases in Europe, i.e. Lyme borreliosis, tularemia and leptospirosis, in order to draw up recommendations for occupational or public health.
METHODS: 88 papers published between 1995-2013 (33 on Lyme borreliosis, 30 on tularemia and 25 on leptospirosis) were analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalences of these three zoonotic diseases are not negligible and information targeting the public is needed. Moreover, the results highlight the lack of standardised surveys among different European countries. It was also noted that epidemiological data on leptospirosis are very scarce.","['Richard S', 'Oppliger A']",2015,22,1,Ann Agric Environ Med,"Richard S and Oppliger A.

25778527,Spatio-temporal patterns of leptospirosis in Thailand: is flooding a risk factor?,"We studied the temporal and spatial patterns of leptospirosis, its association with flooding and animal census data in Thailand. Flood data from 2010 to 2012 were extracted from spatial information taken from satellite images. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used to determine the relationship between spatio-temporal flooding patterns and the number of human leptospirosis cases. In addition, the area of flood coverage, duration of waterlogging, time lags between flood events, and a number of potential animal reservoirs were considered in a sub-analysis. There was no significant temporal trend of leptospirosis over the study period. Statistical analysis showed an inconsistent relationship between IRR and flooding across years and regions. Spatially, leptospirosis occurred repeatedly and predominantly in northeastern Thailand. Our findings suggest that flooding is less influential in leptospirosis transmission than previously assumed. High incidence of the disease in the northeastern region is explained by the fact that agriculture and animal farming are important economic activities in this area. The periodic rise and fall of reported leptospirosis cases over time might be explained by seasonal exposure from rice farming activities performed during the rainy season when flood events often occur. We conclude that leptospirosis remains an occupational disease in Thailand.","['Suwanpakdee S', 'Kaewkungwal J', 'White LJ', 'Asensio N', 'Ratanakorn P', 'Singhasivanon P', 'Day NP', 'Pan-Ngum W']",2015,143,10,Epidemiol Infect,"Suwanpakdee S, et al.

25776612,Seroepidemiology of leptospirosis in dogs and rats in Trinidad.,"Stray dogs (n=207), suspected canine cases of leptospirosis (n=50) and rats (n=200) from the Caribbean island of Trinidad were subjected to the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) for leptospirosis. The seroprevalence in stray dogs was 15.5% (n=32), the predominant serogroup was Icterohaemorrhagiae (14.5%; n=30) with agglutinations to serovars Copenhageni at 5.8%, Icterohaemorrhagiae at 4.8%, Mankarso at 3.9%. The seroprevalence among suspected canine cases was 72% (n=36) with Icterohaemorrhagiae again being the predominant serogroup at 60% inclusive of serovars: Copenhageni, 44%; Mankarso, 14%; and Icterohaemorrhagiae 2%. A seroprevalence of 16.5% was determined in rats, all agglutinations were to the Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup (inclusive of serovars Copenhageni, 9.5%; Icterohaemorrhagiae, 5.5%; and Mankarso, 1.5%). Overall serovar Copenhageni was the most common serovar as 11.6% of all the animal species tested by the MAT were positive and may be an important zoonotic serovar in Trinidad. The titres of infecting serovars of Leptospira in suspected canine cases of leptospirosis were considerably higher than that found in stray dogs and in rats where the lowest titres were found. Age and sex were not significant risk factors except in the case of rats where age was significant, indicating that juvenile rats were at a significantly higher risk. There was no definite pattern of the distribution of positive animals or the serovars when using the MAT. Data obtained in the current study indicate that dogs and rats in Trinidad have the potential to be sources of leptospiral infections for humans. This potential has public health implications making it imperative to control rat and stray dog populations in the island to reduce the risk of human leptospirosis.","['Suepaul SM', 'Carrington CV', 'Campbell M', 'Borde G', 'Adesiyun AA']",2014,31,4,Trop Biomed,"Suepaul SM, et al.

25776541,Evaluation of three 5' exonuclease-based real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for detection of pathogenic Leptospira species in canine urine.,"Leptospirosis is caused by several pathogenic Leptospira species, and is an important infectious disease of dogs. Early detection of infection is crucial for an effective antibiotic treatment of the disease. Though different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been developed for detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp., thorough evaluation of the performance of these assays using dog urine samples has not been carried out. In the current study, the performance of 3 real-time PCR (qPCR) assays was assessed, 1 targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the other 2 targeting the lipL32 gene, a gene for the LipL32 outer membrane protein. With DNA extracted from laboratory-cultured pathogenic Leptospira spp., all 3 qPCR assays showed 100% specificity and had identical lower limits of detection. Compared to a conventional, gel-based PCR assay, all 3 qPCR assays were 100-fold more sensitive. There was a 100% agreement in the results of the 3 assays when tested on urine samples collected aseptically from 30 dogs suspected for leptospirosis. However, when tested on 30 urine samples that were collected by the free-catch method, the 16S rRNA-based assay falsely detected 13.3% of the samples as positive for pathogenic Leptospira spp. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified DNA fragments showed that the assay resulted in false positives because of unrelated bacteria. All urine samples collected from 100 apparently healthy dogs at a local animal shelter tested negative for pathogenic Leptospira spp. These results highlight the importance of sample-specific validation of PCR-based diagnostic assays and the application of appropriately validated assays for more reliable pathogen detection.","['Fink JM', 'Moore GE', 'Landau R', 'Vemulapalli R']",2015,27,2,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Fink JM, et al.

25773440,"An epidemiological comparative study on diagnosis of rodent leptospirosis in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran.","OBJECTIVES: Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by leptospires, in which transmission occurs through contact with contaminated biological fluids from infected animals. Rodents can act as a source of infection for humans and animals. The disease has a global distribution, mainly in humid, tropical and sub-tropical regions. The aim of this study was to compare culture assays, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and nested PCR (n-PCR), for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in rodents in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran.
METHODS: One hundred fifty-one rodents were trapped alive at 10 locations, and their urine and kidney samples were collected and used for the isolation of live Leptospira. The infecting serovars were identified and the antibody titres were measured by MAT, using a panel of 20 strains of live Leptospira species as antigens. The presence of leptospiral DNA was evaluated in urine and kidney samples using PCR and n-PCR.
RESULTS: No live leptospires were isolated from the kidney and urine samples of the rodents. Different detection rates of leptospirosis were observed with MAT (21.2%), PCR (11.3%), and n-PCR (3.3%). The dominant strain was Leptospira serjoehardjo (34.4%, p=0.28), although other serotypes were also found. The prevalence of positive leptospirosis tests in rodents was 15.9, 2.6, and 2.6% among Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus, and Apodemus sylvaticus, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis was prevalent in rodents in Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. MAT was able to detect leptospires more frequently than culture or PCR. The kidney was a more suitable site for identifying leptospiral DNA by n-PCR than urine. Culture was not found to be an appropriate technique for clinical diagnosis.","['Esfandiari B', 'Pourshafie MR', 'Gouya MM', 'Khaki P', 'Mostafavi E', 'Darvish J', 'Bidhendi SM', 'Hanifi H', 'Nahrevanian H']",2015,37,,Epidemiol Health,"Esfandiari B, et al.

Therefore, this study identifies the effects of leptospirosis on the risks of developing ACS with a nationwide retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: We identified adult patients aged ≥20 years who were newly diagnosed with leptospirosis. We also randomly selected a comparison cohort from the general population by using a propensity score matching method. We analyzed the risks of ACS by using Cox proportional hazard regression models.
RESULTS: Among the 23.74 million people in the cohort, 3690 patients with leptospirosis (68% men, mean age of 52.2 years) and 3690 controls were followed for 13,677 and 15,652 person-years, respectively. The overall incidence of ACS was higher in the leptospirosis cohort than in the nonleptospirosis cohort (4.68 vs 3.71 per 1000 person-years), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.12-2.56). Men exhibited a 1.88-fold greater HR of ACS than women did (95% CI=1.20-2.94). The risk of developing ACS was highest for leptospirosis patients aged ≥65 years (HR=7, 51% CI=4.35-12.9) compared with patients aged ≤49 years.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis is not a previously identified risk factor for ACS. The findings of this nationwide retrospective cohort study indicate that leptospirosis may become an independent risk factor for ACS. Future research to investigate the mechanism is warranted.","['Chung WS', 'Chu YH', 'Lin CL', 'Kao CH']",2015,184,,Int J Cardiol,"Chung WS, et al.

25764105,Using discrete choice modeling to evaluate the preferences and willingness to pay for leptospirosis vaccine.,"Leptospirosis is highly endemic in the Philippines and a serious concern to public health. Local research on candidate vaccine is moving through the development pipeline. The availability of vaccines alone does not guarantee acceptance because individuals' vaccination choice decision is influenced by several factors. This study assessed how vaccine attributes and socio-demographic factors affect the acceptability of leptospirosis vaccine; and estimated individuals' willingness to pay for leptospirosis vaccine. A discrete choice experiment was conducted among leptospirosis and non-leptospirosis case respondents (n = 342) living in Metro Manila. Random Parameters Logit model was used to estimate the relative importance of vaccine attributes and socio-demographic variables on respondents' leptospirosis vaccination choice decision. The estimated model coefficients were used to derive implicit prices and willingness to pay for leptospirosis vaccine. Both case respondents preferred leptospirosis vaccine with 70-100% efficacy, mild to moderate risk of side-effects, given in a single shot, and at a lower price. Non-leptospirosis case respondents preferred a vaccine with 7 to 10 y of protection, while leptospirosis case respondents preferred a vaccine with 10 y protection. The probability of leptospirosis vaccination acceptance was affected by respondents' age, education, family size and income, proximity of home to rivers and sewers, and leptospirosis awareness level. Respondents' willingness to pay for leptospirosis vaccine (US$ 31.14-US$ 65.89) was higher than the Japanese retail price (US$ 21.60-US$ 24.00). Our findings indicated significant potential for introducing leptospirosis vaccine in the Philippine vaccine market. Delivery strategies to ensure equitable access to future leptospirosis vaccine are recommended.","['Arbiol J', 'Yabe M', 'Nomura H', 'Borja M', 'Gloriani N', 'Yoshida S']",2015,11,4,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Arbiol J, et al.

25763200,Corticosteroid in the treatment of moderate to severe thrombocytopenia due to leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is associated with a bad prognosis in Leptospirosis.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effect of corticosteroids to improve thrombocytopenia due to leptospirosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a clinical trial, all patients admitted with leptospirosis in Razi Hospital of Ghaemshahr, north of Iran were enrolled in a 2-year study. Totally, 56 patients with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia were randomized to control and treatment groups. The treatment group received corticosteroid (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for maximum one week) in addition to the standard antibiotic therapy.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference regarding age and gender between the two groups (P = 0.254, P = 0.789, respectively). The mean duration to improve thrombocytopenia was 4.41 ± 0.197 days in the treatment group and 5.72 ± 0.318 days in the control group, which was significantly different (P = 0.003). Duration of hospitalization in the treatment group was 5.24 ± 0.244 days and 6.23 ± 0.329 days in the control group, which was significantly different (P = 0.028). The two groups had no significant difference regarding mortality, intubation, level of platelet, duration of ICU admission and pulmonary, renal or hepatic involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy decreased the length of hospitalization only in severe subgroup thrombocytopenia, but not in the moderate subgroup.","['Alian S', 'Asghari H', 'Najafi N', 'Davoudi A', 'Yazdani J']",2014,16,10,Iran Red Crescent Med J,"Alian S, et al.

Hamsters were infected with an intraperitoneal injection of 2 × 10(8) bacteria, resulting in severe histopathological organ damages consistent with tissue lesions previously observed with other strains. Hamsters were also injected with 1 × 10(8) or 5 × 10(7) bacteria and animals that recovered showed renal carriage of leptospires in concentrations similar to the bacterial load quantified in mouse kidneys, with urinary shedding of bacteria up to 4 weeks postinfection. The serogroup Ballum is increasingly reported in human leptospirosis, and these results highlight the use of the B3-13S isolate for the development of models resulting in either severe acute or chronic forms of the infection, allowing for better characterization of its pathogenesis.","['Matsui M', 'Roche L', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Roudier M', 'Moniquet V', 'Goarant C']",2015,92,5,Am J Trop Med Hyg,"Matsui M, et al.

25740183,[Leptospirosis].,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. Leptospira infection can range from subclinical to life-threatening disease. Renal failure and severe respiratory symptoms may occur and are associated with a high mortality rate. It is important to realise that renal failure and other symptoms can occur in the absence of icterus. Leptospiraemia occurs mostly during the first week of acute illness, so blood cultures should be taken as soon as possible. Most cases of leptospirosis are diagnosed by serology. Antibodies are detectable in the blood approximately 5 to 7 days after onset of symptoms. Early recognition and treatment with either cephalosporins or penicillin may shorten the duration and severity of multi-organ failure and is therefore mandatory.","['van de Weyer RW', 'Ramakers BP', 'Pickkers P']",2015,159,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"van de Weyer RW, et al.

25736478,Detection of urinary biomarkers in reservoir hosts of leptospirosis by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry.,"PURPOSE: Pathogenic leptospires colonize the renal tubules of reservoir hosts of infection and are excreted via urine into the environment. Asymptomatic reservoir hosts include a wide range of domestic and wild animal species and include cattle, dogs, and rats that can persistently excrete large numbers of pathogenic leptospires over many months. A similar presentation has been observed in humans categorized as ""long-term asymptomatic individuals"" as they excreted leptospires in the absence of any clinical symptoms or positive serology.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the current study, the urine of experimentally infected rats, which showed no clinical signs or positive serology, was analyzed by CE-MS to identify urinary biomarkers of chronic infection.
RESULTS: A discriminating peptide pattern of 43 polypeptides provided a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 83%, and an accuracy of 90% for the identification of urine from chronically infected rats (p < 0.05, AUC > 90%). The majority of discriminating peptides were decreased in abundance in urine of chronically infected rats, including a peptide derived from neprilysin, a membrane metalloendopeptidase, the expression of which has previously been shown to be diminished in infected urine.

25723956,Health impact assessment of cyclone Bejisa in Reunion Island (France) using syndromic surveillance.,"INTRODUCTION: On January 2, 2014, Cyclone Bejisa struck Reunion Island (France). This storm led to major material damages, such as power outages, disturbance of drinking water systems, road closures, and the evacuation of residents. In this context, the Regional Office of French Institute for Public Health Surveillance in Indian Ocean (Cire OI) set up an epidemiological surveillance in order to describe short-term health effects of the cyclone.
METHODS: The assessment of the health impact was based mainly on a syndromic surveillance system, including the activity of all emergency departments (EDs) and the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) of the island. From these data, several health indicators were collected and analyzed daily and weekly. To complete this assessment, all medical charts recorded in the EDs of Reunion Island from January 2, 2014 through January 5, 2014 were reviewed in order to identify visits directly and indirectly related to the cyclone, and to determine mechanisms of injuries.
RESULTS: The number of calls to the EMS peaked the day of the cyclone, and the number of ED visits increased markedly over the next two days. At the same time, a significant increase in visits for trauma, burns, and carbon monoxide poisoning was detected in all EDs. Among 1,748 medical records reviewed, eight visits were directly related to the cyclone and 208 were indirectly related. For trauma, the main mechanisms of injury were falls and injuries by machinery or tools during the clean-up and repair works. Due to prolonged power outages, several patients were hospitalized: some to assure continuity of care, others to take care of an exacerbation of a chronic disease. An increase in leptospirosis cases linked to post-cyclone clean-up was observed two weeks after the cyclone.
CONCLUSION: Information based on the syndromic surveillance system allowed the authors to assess rapidly the health impact of Cyclone Bejisa in Reunion Island; however, an underestimation of this impact was still possible. In the near future, several lines of work will be planned by the authors in order to improve the assessment.","['Vilain P', 'Pagès F', 'Combes X', 'Marianne Dit Cassou PJ', 'Mougin-Damour K', 'Jacques-Antoine Y', 'Filleul L']",2015,30,2,Prehosp Disaster Med,"Vilain P, et al.

25721925,Herd factors associated with dairy cow mortality.,"Summary studies of dairy cow removal indicate increasing levels of mortality over the past several decades. This poses a serious problem for the US dairy industry. The objective of this project was to evaluate associations between facilities, herd management practices, disease occurrence and death rates on US dairy operations through an analysis of the National Animal Health Monitoring System's Dairy 2007 survey. The survey included farms in 17 states that represented 79.5% of US dairy operations and 82.5% of the US dairy cow population. During the first phase of the study operations were randomly selected from a sampling list maintained by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Only farms that participated in phase I and had 30 or more dairy cows were eligible to participate in phase II. In total, 459 farms had complete data for all selected variables and were included in this analysis. Univariable associations between dairy cow mortality and 162 a priori identified operation-level management practices or characteristics were evaluated. Sixty of the 162 management factors explored in the univariate analysis met initial screening criteria and were further evaluated in a multivariable model exploring more complex relationships. The final weighted, negative binomial regression model included six variables. Based on the incidence rate ratio, this model predicted 32.0% less mortality for operations that vaccinated heifers for at least one of the following: bovine viral diarrhea, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, parainfluenza 3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Haemophilus somnus, leptospirosis, Salmonella, Escherichia coli or clostridia. The final multivariable model also predicted a 27.0% increase in mortality for operations from which a bulk tank milk sample tested ELISA positive for bovine leukosis virus. Additionally, an 18.0% higher mortality was predicted for operations that used necropsies to determine the cause of death for some proportion of dead dairy cows. The final model also predicted that increased proportions of dairy cows with clinical mastitis and infertility problems were associated with increased mortality. Finally, an increase in mortality was predicted to be associated with an increase in the proportion of lame or injured permanently removed dairy cows. In general terms, this model identified that mortality was associated with reproductive problems, non-infectious postpartum disease, infectious disease and infectious disease prevention, and information derived from postmortem evaluations. Ultimately, addressing excessive mortality levels requires a concerted effort that recognizes and appropriately manages the numerous and diverse underlying risks.","['McConnel C', 'Lombard J', 'Wagner B', 'Kopral C', 'Garry F']",2015,9,8,Animal,"McConnel C, et al.

The production effects associated with exposure to each of these pathogens in study herds were defined under 3 categories: (1) milk production effects, (2) reproduction effects (including culling), and (3) mortality effects. The production effects associated with exposure to Salmonella, N. caninum, and L. hardjo were incorporated into the Moorepark Dairy Systems Model. In the analysis, herds negative for exposure to Salmonella, N. caninum, and L. hardjo were assumed baseline herds, with all results presented relative to this base. In simulations examining the effect of vaccination for Salmonella and L. hardjo on farm profitability, vaccinated herds (vaccination costs included) were considered as baseline herds and results were presented relative to this base. Total annual profits in unvaccinated herds were reduced by €77.31, €94.71, and €112.11 per cow at milk prices of €0.24, €0.29, and €0.34/L, respectively, as a result of exposure to Salmonella. In the current study, herds positive for exposure to Salmonella recorded a 316-kg reduction in milk yield, whereas no association was detected between exposure to N. caninum or L. hardjo and milk production. Exposure to both N. caninum and L. hardjo was associated with compromised reproductive performance. Herds positive for exposure to N. caninum and Salmonella had greater rates of adult cow mortality and calf mortality, respectively. Vaccination for both Salmonella and L. hardjo was associated with improved performance in study herds. Exposure to N. caninum resulted in a reduction in annual farm profits of €11.55, €12, and €12.44 per cow at each milk price, whereas exposure to L. hardjo resulted in a reduction in annual farm profits of €13.83, €13.78, and €13.72 per cow at each milk price. Herds that tested positive for exposure to Salmonella and L. hardjo were compared with herds vaccinated for the respective pathogens. Herds vaccinated for Salmonella generated €67.09, €84.48, and €101.89 per cow more profit at each milk price compared with herds positive for exposure. Similarly, herds vaccinated for L. hardjo generated €9.74, €9.69, and €9.63 per cow more profit compared with unvaccinated exposed herds. However, herds that tested negative for exposure to Salmonella and L. hardjo generated additional profits of €10.22 and €4.09 per cow, respectively, compared with vaccinated baseline herds.","[""O' Doherty E"", 'Sayers R', ""O' Grady L"", 'Shalloo L']",2015,98,4,J Dairy Sci,"O' Doherty E, et al.

25704650,Scrub typhus in rural Rajasthan and a review of other Indian studies.,"BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness which has been reported from various parts of India with Rajasthan recently joining the list of affected states.
AIM: To report a series of paediatric scrub typhus cases from rural Rajasthan.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of children with scrub typhus admitted to the wards and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary-care hospital.
METHODS: The study was undertaken over an 8-month period from May to December 2013. All patients with a clinical presentation and/or serological confirmation of scrub typhus who tested negative for malaria, enteric fever, dengue, leptospirosis and urinary tract infection (UTI) were included. A range of investigations were undertaken including IgM-ELISA for scrub typhus, followed by appropriate medical management.
RESULTS: Thirty patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. The mean (SD, range) age of the patients was 8·56 (3·43, 3-16) years. The most common clinical features were fever (n = 30, 100%), headache (n = 20, 66%), myalgia (n = 15, 50%), hepatosplenomegaly (n = 18, 60%) and pallor (n = 5, 16%). Typical features such as eschar and rash were observed in only one (3·3%) and three (10%) patients, respectively; none had generalised lymphadenopathy or conjunctival congestion. IgM-ELISA for scrub typhus was positive in 28 patients (93·3%) and 27 responded to doxycycline within 24-72 hours. One of the three patients who required PICU support responded to intravenous chloramphenicol and, of the other two (6·6%), one died of acute respiratory distress syndrome and the other owing to acute renal failure.
CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion is essential for early diagnosis and prevention of complications in scrub typhus together with prompt referral from rural areas to a higher centre. Awareness of the disease manifestations may further help to prevent excessive investigations in patients presenting with non-specific febrile illness and reduce the economic burden to the family and society in resource-constrained settings.","['Masand R', 'Yadav R', 'Purohit A', 'Tomar BS']",2016,36,2,Paediatr Int Child Health,"Masand R, et al.

25687815,"Antibodies to Leptospira interrogans in goats and risk factors of the disease in Santa Catarina (West side), Brazil.","Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira spp. In goats, the productive impact of leptospirosis is not well known and totally unknown in Santa Catarina (SC), Brazil. This study aimed to investigate leptospirosis seroprevalence and its risk factors in goats in the west side of SC. A total of 654 blood samples were analyzed using the microscopic agglutination technique and 35.47% (232) of the animals were seropositives. Except for serogroup Autumnalis, positive samples for all other serogroups were found as follows: Sejroe (Hardjo, Wolffi), Grippotyphosa (Grippotyphosa), Canicola (Canicola), Icterohaemorrhagiae (Icterohaemorrhagiae, Copenhageni), Australis (Australis, Bratislava) and Pomona (Pomona). The contact among sheep and goats, and the addition of concentrate as food supplement were found to be risk factors for leptospirosis. Based on these results, we conclude that there is a high occurrence of anti-Leptospira antibodies in goats in the Western part of Santa Catarina State.","['Topazio J', 'Tonin AA', 'Machado G', 'Noll JC', 'Ribeiro A', 'Moura AB', 'Carmo GM', 'Grosskopf HM', 'Martins JL', 'Badke MR', 'Stefani LM', 'Lopes LS', 'Da Silva AS']",2015,99,,Res Vet Sci,"Topazio J, et al.

25685991,Comparison of polymerase chain reaction and Warthin-Starry techniques to detect Leptospira spp. in kidneys of slaughtered cattle.,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease that is caused by Gram-negative spirochaetes, Leptospira species. Affected animals excrete the organism in the urine into the environment and act as a source of infection. Cattle are maintenance hosts for some serovars of leptospirosis and are important in the transmission of the infection to humans. At post mortem examination, affected cattle show white spots in their kidneys but these are not specific for leptospirosis. Sometimes it is necessary that leptospirosis be diagnosed in the carcass. Different direct methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Warthin-Starry silver stain (WS), immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used in order to diagnose leptospirosis in the affected tissues, such as kidney. The main advantage of the WS technique is direct visualisation of the bacteria in the tissue samples. Silver staining is useful for retrospective studies on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples but little information is available on the sensitivity and specificity of the technique. The present study aimed to find a simple and inexpensive method that can be used in any laboratory and that also, if clinical samples are not available, can detect Leptospira in tissue samples post mortem. This study was performed on 19 paraffin-embedded kidneys of slaughtered cows that grossly had focal to multifocal white spots. Leptospirosis was confirmed in these samples with PCR based on the LipL32 gene. Out of 19 PCR positive kidneys, Leptospira was identified in 13 stained samples by WS. The kidneys revealed different grades of interstitial nephritis. No relationship was found between severity of lesions and presence of leptospires in the kidneys. The PCR results on the urine and blood were consistent with matching WS stained kidneys. Out of 13 kidneys that were positive with silver staining, 7 matching blood and 10 matching urine samples were confirmed positive for leptospirosis with PCR. In this study, the WS technique provided fewer positive results than PCR. This may be as a result of a low burden of Leptospira in the kidney, but the sensitivity of WS staining needs more investigation.","['Azizi S', 'Kheirandish R', 'Rahimi E']",2014,81,1,Onderstepoort J Vet Res,"Azizi S, et al.

We generated a library of random transposon mutants of the pathogen L. interrogans, which included a mutant with insertion in the first gene of an operon containing the chemotaxis genes cheA, cheW, cheD, cheB, cheY and mcp. The disrupted gene encodes a putative histidine kinase (HK). The HK mutant was motile and virulent, but swarm plate and capillary assays suggested that chemotaxis was reduced in this mutant. Further analysis of bacterial trajectories by videomicroscopy showed that the ability of this mutant to reverse was significantly impaired in comparison to wild-type strain. Our data therefore show that this operon is required for full chemotaxis of Leptospira spp.","['Lambert A', 'Wong Ng J', 'Picardeau M']",2015,362,3,FEMS Microbiol Lett,"Lambert A, et al.

METHODS: 289 kidney samples from 69 wild, domestic and peri-domestic species in northern Botswana were screened for the presence of Leptospira sp.
RESULTS: Renal carriage was widespread among mammals (31.4%, n=11/35 species), birds (27.8%, n=5/18 species) and reptiles (6.3%, n=1/16 species), including several novel species.
CONCLUSION: Leptospiral surveillance is often limited to the usual suspects: rodents and domestic animals. We identify Leptospira in a wide range of African wildlife, suggesting that leptospirosis transmission and persistence may also involve hosts not normally considered.","['Jobbins SE', 'Alexander KA']",2015,109,5,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,Jobbins SE and Alexander KA.

25657956,"Level of awareness regarding some zoonotic diseases, among dog owners of ithaca, new york.","OBJECTIVES: Worldwide, dogs and cats are the two most common household companion animals. Because of this, they can be direct or indirect source of many human infections. Fortunately, most of these zoonotic infections can be clinically prevented by appropriate prophylactic interventions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Present kind of cross-sectional study, for the first time, was conducted in city of Ithaca, New York. People visiting local animal hospitals, dog parks, library and shoppers at Walmart supermarket were personally interviewed and a pre-tested questionnaire was got filled from every individual. The collected data were analyzed for percentage proportions using Microsoft Excel(®) and the results had been presented in graphical as well as tabulated forms.
RESULTS: Out of 100 participants responding to the request for participation, gender-wise, 45% of the participants were male while 55% of the participants were females. Demographically, 50% participants lived in rural, 35% in urban while 15% participants lived in suburban areas. Educational background of the participants ranged from High school pass-outs to Graduates.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants were aware about the zoonotic potential of leptospirosis, giardiasis, rabies, hookworms, coccidiosis, lyme disease, roundworms, toxoplasma, leishmaniasis, salmonellosis and ringworm disease. Knowledge gaps in the sampled population, in terms of lack of awareness about zoonotic diseases vectored by mosquitoes, ticks and fleas; practice of not doing regular deworming and prophylactic control of fleas and ticks on pet dogs; and lack of practice among physicians to discuss zoonotic canine diseases with their clients were revealed by this study.","['Sandhu GK', 'Singh D']",2014,3,4,J Family Med Prim Care,"Sandhu GK and Singh D.

25653945,Dengue and Typhoid Co-infection- Study from a Government Hospital in North Delhi.,"BACKGROUND: Concurrent infection with two agents can result in an illness having overlapping symptoms creating a diagnostic dilemma for the treating physician. The symptoms of dengue may mimic other diseases such as leptospirosis, influenza A, Salmonella Typhi, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya and malaria. There is paucity of data regarding dengue and typhoid co- infection both in the developed and developing countries. This study attempts to find the current co- infection rates in North Delhi.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was done between August and November 2013. Medical records of 659 patients exhibiting febrile illness who visited Kasturba Hospital were studied. Dengue specific IgM antibodies were detected by Dengue IgM antibody capture ELISA test. Serodiagnosis of Salmonella infection was conducted by Widal test in the hospital.
RESULTS: Of the 659 febrile sera samples tested here, 141 (21.39%) tested positive for dengue. Of these 91 were females and 50 males. Of the dengue cases, eleven were co-infected with enteric fever (11/141= 7.8%). Maximum number of dengue positive cases seen in age group 0-10 y. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) was zero. Age groups of patients co-infected with dengue and typhoid were as follows: 0-10 y: 5, 11-20 y: 3, 21-30 y: 2, >60 y: 1.
CONCLUSION: Co-infection should always be kept in mind while dealing with cases of dengue or enteric fever with or without atypical features. In order to reduce the burden of disease, along with improvement of sanitation and personal hygiene, emphasis should be given on vaccination against typhoid.","['Sharma Y', 'Arya V', 'Jain S', 'Kumar M', 'Deka L', 'Mathur A']",2014,8,12,J Clin Diagn Res,"Sharma Y, et al.

25648561,Co-existent facial palsy and myocarditis in a 50-year old farmer diagnosed with probable leptospirosis: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. This is a case report on a patient with probable leptospirosis, who developed lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy during the recovery phase of this illness. Leptospirosis is endemic in Sri Lanka and this complication has been reported earlier in other countries but not in Sri Lanka to the best of our knowledge.
CASE PRESENTATION: A previously well 50 year old Sinhalese farmer in Sri Lanka was admitted to a tertiary care hospital with five day history of fever, headache, prostration, severe myalgia especially in the calves and yellowish discoloration of the eyes. He was febrile, icteric and had suffusion of both conjunctivae. His pulse rate and blood pressure was 98/min and 90/50 mmHg respectively. The initial laboratory examinations showed neutrophil leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Antibodies test for leptospirosis was done and IgM was positive. Because of this evidence the probable diagnosis of leptospirosis was made and antibiotic therapy initialed with intravenous cefotaxime 1 g 8 hourly and crystalline penicillin 2 mu 6 hourly. On the eighth day he developed chest pain associated with shortness of breath with a heart rate of 120/min. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evidence suggested myocarditis, and troponin I titer was positive. Supportive care was provided and antibiotics were continued. On the 13(th) day of illness he developed lower motor type facial nerve palsy of the left side with positive Bell's phenomenon. But rest of the neurological examination was normal. He was discharged on a step-down course of prednisolone and physiotherapy. He fully recovered from cardiac involvement before discharge but recovery from facial nerve palsy took place only six months later.
CONCLUSION: Our case emphasizes cardiac and facial nerve involvement in leptospirosis. This is the first published report in Sri Lanka of facial nerve palsy occurring in leptospirosis possibly due to immunological damage. Further literature survey revealed that this is the first case in the world with simultaneous occurrence of myocarditis and facial nerve palsy in leptospirosis. The pathogenesis of this occurrence is yet to be fully understood.","['Kumarihamy KW', 'Ralapanawa DM', 'Jayalath WA']",2015,8,,BMC Res Notes,"Kumarihamy KW, et al.

25644948,Mannose-binding lectin impairs Leptospira activity through the inhibitory effect on the motility of cell.,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays key role in lectin pathway of innate immunity, and shows the ability of triggering opsonization intermediately. Substantial increase in the serum level of MBL has been confirmed during leptospirosis, which caused by a pathogenic spirochete, Leptospira. Leptospira has a fascinating locomotion pattern, which simultaneously gyrating and swimming forward, such motility enables that Leptospira is difficult to be captured by immune cells if without any assistance. In this study, the effect of mannose-binding lectin to Leptospira was quantitatively investigated by measuring some kinematic parameters, to discover the mechanism behind MBL-mediated immune responses during leptospiral infection. The results showed that mannose-binding lectin is capable of inhibiting the motility of Leptospira by transforming free swimming cells to tumbled rotating cells, resulted in the increase number of rotating cells. Otherwise, decrease in rotation rate of rotating cell has been observed. However, the swimming speed of swimming Leptospira cells showed no observable change under the effect of MBL. The inhibitory effect were only valid in a relatively short period, Leptospira cells regained their original motility after 2 h. This raises an interesting topic that Leptospira is somehow able to escape from the inhibitory effect of MBL by dragging such unfavorable molecules toward to the cell end and eventually throwing it out. The inhibitory effect of MBL on the motility of Leptospira is expected to provide a new insight into lectin pathway.","['Xu J', 'Guo Y', 'Nakamura S', 'Islam MS', 'Tomioka R', 'Yoneyama H', 'Isogai E']",2015,171,,Microbiol Res,"Xu J, et al.

25629781,How important are rats as vectors of leptospirosis in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam?,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis known to be endemic in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, even though clinical reports are uncommon. We investigated leptospira infection in rats purchased in food markets during the rainy season (October) (n=150), as well as those trapped during the dry season (February-March) (n=125) in the region using RT-PCR for the lipL32 gene, confirmed by 16S rRNA, as well as by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Results were compared with the serovar distribution of human cases referred from Ho Chi Minh City hospitals (2004-2012) confirmed by MAT (n=45). The MAT seroprevalence among rats was 18.3%. The highest MAT seroprevalence corresponded, in decreasing order, to: Rattus norvegicus (33.0%), Bandicota indica (26.5%), Rattus tanezumi (24.6%), Rattus exulans (14.3%), and Rattus argentiventer (7.1%). The most prevalent serovars were, in descending order: Javanica (4.6% rats), Lousiana (4.2%), Copenageni (4.2%), Cynopterie (3.7%), Pomona (2.9%), and Icterohaemorrhagiae (2.5%). A total of 16 rats (5.8%) tested positive by RT-PCR. Overall, larger rats tended to have a higher prevalence of detection. There was considerable agreement between MAT and PCR (kappa=0.28 [0.07-0.49]), although significantly more rats were positive by MAT (McNemar 29.9 (p<0.001). MAT prevalence was higher among rats during the rainy season compared with rats in the dry season. There are no current available data on leptospira serovars in humans in the Mekong Delta, although existing studies suggest limited overlapping between human and rat serovars.

Many of these pathogens, including Rickettsia typhi, Bartonella spp., and Seoul hantavirus (SEOV), are thought to be endemic in rat populations worldwide; however, past field research has found these organisms to be absent in certain rat populations. Rats (Rattus spp.) from an inner city neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada, were tested for exposure to and/or infection with SEOV and R. typhi (using serology and PCR), as well as Bartonella spp. (using culture and sequencing). Approximately 25% of 404 rats tested were infected with Bartonella tribocorum, which demonstrated significant geographic clustering within the study area. Infection was associated with both season and sexual maturity. Seroreactivity against R. typhi and SEOV was observed in 0.36% and 1.45% of 553 rats tested, respectively, although PCR screening results for these pathogens were negative, suggesting that they are not endemic in the study population. Overall, these results suggest that the geographic distribution of rat-associated zoonoses, including R. typhi, SEOV, and Bartonella spp., is less ubiquitous than previously appreciated, and is likely dependent on patterns of dispersion and establishment of the rat reservoir host. Further study on global and local Rattus spp. population structures may help to elucidate the ecology of zoonotic organisms in these species.","['Himsworth CG', 'Bai Y', 'Kosoy MY', 'Wood H', 'DiBernardo A', 'Lindsay R', 'Bidulka J', 'Tang P', 'Jardine C', 'Patrick D']",2015,15,1,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Himsworth CG, et al.

Membrane proteins of Leptospira are capable of causing endothelial damage in vitro, but there have been no studies in humans evaluating endothelial glycocalyx damage and its correlation with acute kidney injury (AKI). We performed a cohort study in an outbreak of leptospirosis among military personnel. AKI was diagnosed in 14 of 46 (30.4%) patients. Leptospirosis was associated with higher levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; 483.1 ± 31.7 versus 234.9 ± 24.4 mg/L, P < 0.001) and syndecan-1 (73.7 ± 15.9 versus 21.2 ± 7.9 ng/mL, P < 0.001) compared with exposed controls. Patients with leptospirosis-associated AKI had increased level of syndecan-1 (112.1 ± 45.4 versus 41.5 ± 11.7 ng/mL, P = 0.021) and ICAM-1 (576.9 ± 70.4 versus 434.9 ± 35.3, P = 0.034) compared with leptospirosis patients with no AKI. Association was verified between syndecan-1 and ICAM-1 with serum creatinine elevation and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels.

25617190,"Orientia, rickettsia, and leptospira pathogens as causes of CNS infections in Laos: a prospective study.","BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus (caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (caused by Rickettsia typhi), and leptospirosis are common causes of febrile illness in Asia; meningitis and meningoencephalitis are severe complications. However, scarce data exist for the burden of these pathogens in patients with CNS disease in endemic countries. Laos is representative of vast economically poor rural areas in Asia with little medical information to guide public health policy. We assessed whether these pathogens are important causes of CNS infections in Laos.
METHODS: Between Jan 10, 2003, and Nov 25, 2011, we enrolled 1112 consecutive patients of all ages admitted with CNS symptoms or signs requiring a lumbar puncture at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos. Microbiological examinations (culture, PCR, and serology) targeted so-called conventional bacterial infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, S suis) and O tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia typhi/Rickettsia spp, and Leptospira spp infections in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We analysed and compared causes and clinical and CSF characteristics between patient groups.
FINDINGS: 1051 (95%) of 1112 patients who presented had CSF available for analysis, of whom 254 (24%) had a CNS infection attributable to a bacterial or fungal pathogen. 90 (35%) of these 254 infections were caused by O tsutsugamushi, R typhi/Rickettsia spp, or Leptospira spp. These pathogens were significantly more frequent than conventional bacterial infections (90/1051 [9%] vs 42/1051 [4%]; p<0·0001) by use of conservative diagnostic definitions. CNS infections had a high mortality (236/876 [27%]), with 18% (13/71) for R typhi/Rickettsia spp, O tsutsugamushi, and Leptospira spp combined, and 33% (13/39) for conventional bacterial infections (p=0·076).
INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that R typhi/Rickettsia spp, O tsutsugamushi, and Leptospira spp infections are important causes of CNS infections in Laos. Antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, needed for the treatment of murine typhus and scrub typhus, are not routinely advised for empirical treatment of CNS infections. These severely neglected infections represent a potentially large proportion of treatable CNS disease burden across vast endemic areas and need more attention.

25605653,Characterization of Leptospira infection in suckling and weaning rat pups.,"Rats are known to be the most important reservoirs of Leptospira spp. However, the leptospiral dose and age at which rats become resistant to Leptospira infection are not yet well elucidated. Aimed to characterize leptospirosis in rat pups, we found that suckling pups (4-, 7-, and 14-day old) are susceptible to leptospires and resistance starts from the weaning age (23-day old). Susceptibility of rat pups was also affected by the infecting dose of the organisms. Jaundice, decrease in body weight, and neurological symptoms prior to moribundity was evident in infected suckling pups. However, 23-day-old infected pups did not manifest any pathological changes and were able to survive the infection similar to adult rats. Based on these results, we propose the suckling rat pup as a novel animal model of human leptospirosis to investigate pathogenesis, development of host resistance, and the mechanisms involved in rats becoming maintenance hosts for leptospires.","['Muslich LT', 'Villanueva SY', 'Amran MY', 'Segawa T', 'Saito M', 'Yoshida S']",2015,38,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Muslich LT, et al.

25600318,Seroprevalence and risk factors associated with within-flock transmission of Leptospira interrogans in transhumant farming systems in Mexico.,"A number of recent reports emphasize the risk of zoonotic diseases and the high degree of prevalence of asymptomatic animals infected with Leptospira interrogans. This report sought to assess the prevalence of antibodies to certain serovars of L. interrogans, and to describe the association between seropositivity and risk factors associated with within-flock transmission in a mountainous region of Mexico. Overall seroprevalence to L. interrogans was 54·5% (95% confidence interval 48·3-60·7); the most frequent serovar was Icterohaemorrhagiae. The accumulation of placentas and fetuses at a site close to lambing paddocks can play a significant role as a risk factor for within-flock transmission of L. interrogans in transhumant farming systems in the municipality of Xalatlaco. The high prevalence of L. interrogans antibodies supports the hypothesis that natural foci of this zoonosis are present in sheep flocks in this area. These findings emphasize the need for planning and implementation of control programmes for ovine leptospirosis in Mexico and elsewhere.","['Arteaga-Troncoso G', 'Jiménez-Estrada JM', 'Montes De Oca-Jimenez R', 'López-Hurtado M', 'Luna-Alvarez M', 'Hernandez-Andrade L', 'Moreno-Alfaro A', 'Galan-Herrera JF', 'Guerra-Infante FM']",2015,143,13,Epidemiol Infect,"Arteaga-Troncoso G, et al.

25594609,"Glomerular filtration rate, urine production, and fractional clearance of electrolytes in acute kidney injury in dogs and their association with survival.","BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in dogs. Few studies have assessed sequential changes in indices of kidney function in dogs with naturally occurring AKI.
OBJECTIVE: To document sequential changes of conventional indices of renal function, to better define the course of AKI, and to identify a candidate marker for recovery.
ANIMALS: Ten dogs with AKI.
METHODS: Dogs were prospectively enrolled and divided into surviving and nonsurviving dogs. Urine production was measured with a closed system for 7 days. One and 24-hour urinary clearances were performed daily to estimate solute excretion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Solute excretion was calculated as an excretion ratio (ER) and fractional clearance (FC) based on both the 1- and 24-hour urine collections.
RESULTS: Four dogs survived and 6 died. At presentation, GFR was not significantly different between the outcome groups, but significantly (P = .03) increased over time in the surviving, but not in the nonsurviving dogs. Fractional clearance of Na decreased significantly over time (20.2-9.4%, P < .0001) in the surviving, but not in the nonsurviving dogs. The ER and FC of solutes were highly correlated (r, 0.70-0.95).
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPACT: Excretion ratio might be used in the clinical setting as a surrogate marker to follow trends in solute excretion. Increased GFR, urine production, and decreased FC of Na were markers of renal recovery. The FC of Na is a simple, noninvasive, and cost-effective method that can be used to evaluate recovery of renal function.","['Brown N', 'Segev G', 'Francey T', 'Kass P', 'Cowgill LD']",2015,29,1,J Vet Intern Med,"Brown N, et al.

25591623,"Current immunological and molecular tools for leptospirosis: diagnostics, vaccine design, and biomarkers for predicting severity.","Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochaetal illness that is endemic in many tropical countries. The research base on leptospirosis is not as strong as other tropical infections such as malaria. However, it is a lethal infection that can attack many vital organs in its severe form, leading to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and death. There are many gaps in knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of leptospirosis and the role of host immunity in causing symptoms. This hinders essential steps in combating disease, such as developing a potential vaccine. Another major problem with leptospirosis is the lack of an easy to perform, accurate diagnostic tests. Many clinicians in resource limited settings resort to clinical judgment in diagnosing leptospirosis. This is unfortunate, as many other diseases such as dengue, hanta virus, rickettsial infections, and even severe bacterial sepsis, can mimic leptospirosis. Another interesting problem is the prediction of disease severity at the onset of the illness. The majority of patients recover from leptospirosis with only a mild febrile illness, while a few others have severe illness with multi-organ failure. Clinical features are poor predictors of potential severity of infection, and therefore the search is on for potential biomarkers that can serve as early warnings for severe disease. This review concentrates on these three important aspects of this neglected tropical disease: diagnostics, developing a vaccine, and potential biomarkers to predict disease severity.","['Rajapakse S', 'Rodrigo C', 'Handunnetti SM', 'Fernando SD']",2015,14,,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,"Rajapakse S, et al.

25580582,Leptospira and paramyxovirus infection dynamics in a bat maternity enlightens pathogen maintenance in wildlife.,"Bats are reservoirs for several zoonotic pathogens of medical importance; however, infection dynamics of pathogens in wild bat populations remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the influence of host crowding and population age structure on pathogen transmission and diversity in bat populations. Focusing on two pathogen taxa of medical importance, Leptospira bacteria and paramyxoviruses, we monitored host population and pathogen shedding dynamics within a maternity colony of the tropical bat species Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Réunion Island. Our data reveal astonishingly similar infection dynamics for Leptospira and paramyxoviruses, with infection peaks during late pregnancy and 2 months after the initial birth pulse. Furthermore, although co-infection occurs frequently during the peaks of transmission, the patterns do not suggest any interaction between the two pathogens. Partial sequencing reveals a unique bat-specific Leptospira strain contrasting with the co-circulation of four separate paramyxovirus lineages along the whole breeding period. Patterns of infection highlight the importance of host crowding in pathogen transmission and suggest that most bats developed immune response and stop excreting pathogens. Our results support that bat maternity colonies may represent hot spots of transmission for bacterial and viral infectious agents, and highlight how seasonality can be an important determinant of host-parasite interactions and disease emergence.","['Dietrich M', 'Wilkinson DA', 'Benlali A', 'Lagadec E', 'Ramasindrazana B', 'Dellagi K', 'Tortosa P']",2015,17,11,Environ Microbiol,"Dietrich M, et al.

25572609,Diseases of livestock in the Pacific Islands region: setting priorities for food animal biosecurity.,"Most Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) have developing economies and face a critical shortage of veterinarians with limited financial resources allocated to their animal disease surveillance programmes. Thus, animal health authorities have to set priorities for better focusing their scarce resources. The main objective of this study was to identify animal diseases perceived to be of importance by decision makers within selected PICTs, at the regional and national levels, to ensure better targeting of animal health resources. A second objective was to investigate whether the targeted surveillance programmes resulting from this rationalized approach would also benefit the local communities engaged in livestock production. A multi-criteria prioritization process was developed, involving local experts, to score and rank 132 animal diseases based on their priority at the regional and national levels for four PICTs: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, which form part of a regional Food Animal Biosecurity Network. In parallel interviews with farmers and field animal health and production workers were conducted to assess their perception of animal diseases. The list of the top-twenty ranked diseases for the Pacific Islands region shows a mix of endemic zoonotic diseases (such as leptospirosis ranked first; brucellosis third; tuberculosis sixth; and endoparasites and ectoparasites, respectively eleventh and thirteenth) with exotic diseases (such as HPAI ranked second, FMD fifth, and rabies ninth). There were different disease ranking lists for each of the four targeted PICTs, confirming different strategies of disease prevention and control may be required for each country, rather than a regional approach. Interviewed animal health and production workers were unfamiliar with most of the prioritized diseases and a majority acknowledged that they would not be able to recognize clinical signs if outbreaks were to occur in their area. Leptospirosis, which is endemic and identified as the top priority disease at the regional level, was never mentioned by any interviewed farmer. Farmers did not name any emerging infectious diseases as priorities. Instead, they identified endemic diseases (parasites, flu, coccidiosis, and scabies) as the most important. While animal disease priorities appear to differ widely between the targeted regions and countries, it also varies significantly between experts and farmers. Better targeted surveillance programmes may thus result in more rational and transparent allocation of resources, and thus enhanced food security, but may not directly match the needs of the local communities.","['Brioudes A', 'Warner J', 'Hedlefs R', 'Gummow B']",2015,143,,Acta Trop,"Brioudes A, et al.

25560004,Seroprevalence of Scrub typhus at a tertiary care hospital in Andhra Pradesh.,"INTRODUCTION: Scrub typhus is a rickettsial infection which is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted by the bite of the chigger of a mite. Delay in diagnosis can be fatal otherwise the treatment is simple, doxycycline being the drug of choice. Indirect immunoflurescence is considered gold standard but it is not used in India as it is costly and also not available. There is need for rapid, economic and simple test for the diagnosis of scrub typhus. This study was taken up to study the seroprevalence of scrub typhus in Andhra Pradesh and to compare two commonly used serological methods; rapid test and IgM ELISA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study in which 100 serum samples from clinically suspected cases collected over a period of 3 months were processed for the detection of IgM antibodies for scrub typhus by ELISA and Rapid test. Samples were also tested for leptospirosis and dengue fever which the other common causes of fever prevalent in this region.
RESULTS: Total number of samples processed was 100 of which 52 were males and 48 females. Among the hundred samples 39 were seropositive. Positivity was higher in the age group of patients between 16 and 30 yrs of age. There was 97% correlation between ELISA and rapid method. Of the 100 samples only three samples positive by ELISA were negative by rapid method. Fever was the most common manifestation and there was no eschar and no mortality reported.
CONCLUSION: Scrub typhus should be included in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin along with dengue, malaria and leptospirosis which are the other common endemic infections in this part of the country.","['Ramyasree A', 'Kalawat U', 'Rani ND', 'Chaudhury A']",2015,33,1,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Ramyasree A, et al.

In spite of the availability of modern medicines, Karens preferred herbal remedies provided by the Traditional Knowledge Practitioners (TKPs), who served as their healers. Hence, the aim of this study was to collect information from TKPs and determine the significance of plants utilized for medicinal purposes. The informant consensus factor (ICF) in relation to medicinal plants used was also estimated and analysed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Field research was conducted in three villages of Middle Andaman, inhabited by Karens, during October 2010 - February 2013. TKPs were interviewed with a questionnaire-guided ethno-medical survey protocol. The data obtained were analysed using the informant consensus factor (ICF) and use value (UV). Voucher specimens of all the cited plants were deposited at Regional Medical Research Centre (ICMR), Port Blair.
RESULTS: Use of 78 medicinal plant species belonging to 71 genera encompassing 48 families was recorded during the survey. These plants were used to treat 38 different ailments, and divided into ten categories of use. The highest ICF value (0.79) was observed for infections and infestations. The Zingiberaceae and Fabaceae families exhibited the highest number of species, and the plants with the highest use values were Typha angustifolia L., Millingtonia hortensis L. f. and Piper betle L. The most common growth form observed were herbs (42%). Among the several plant parts used, leaves were mostly preferred for preparation of medicines. Water was the main excipient used for mixing the herbs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the use of medicinal plants by Karens of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

25547715,The bovine model for elucidating the role of γδ T cells in controlling infectious diseases of importance to cattle and humans.,"There are several instances of co-investigation and related discoveries and achievements in bovine and human immunology; perhaps most interesting is the development of the BCG vaccine, the tuberculin skin test and the more recent interferon-gamma test that were developed first in cattle to prevent and diagnosis bovine tuberculosis and then applied to humans. There are also a number of immune-physiological traits that ruminant share with humans including the development of their immune systems in utero which increases the utility of cattle as a model for human immunology. These are reviewed here with a particular focus on the use of cattle to unravel γδ T cell biology. Based on the sheer number of γδ T cells in this γδ T cell high species, it is reasonable to expect γδ T cells to play an important role in protective immune responses. For that reason alone cattle may provide good models for elucidating at least some of the roles γδ T cells play in protective immunity in all species. This includes fundamental research on γδ T cells as well as the responses of ruminant γδ T cells to a variety of infectious disease situations including to protozoan and bacterial pathogens. The role that pattern recognition receptors (PRR) play in the activation of γδ T cells may be unique relative to αβ T cells. Here we focus on that of the γδ T cell specific family of molecules known as WC1 or T19 in ruminants, which are part of the CD163 scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR) family that includes SCART1 and SCART2 expressed on murine γδ T cells. We review the evidence for WC1 being a PRR as well as an activating co-receptor and the role that γδ T cells bearing these receptors play in immunity to leptospirosis and tuberculosis. This includes the generation of memory responses to vaccines, thereby continuing the tradition of co-discovery between cattle and humans.","['Baldwin CL', 'Telfer JC']",2015,66,1,Mol Immunol,Baldwin CL and Telfer JC.

25520373,Risk factors for new infection with Leptospira in meat workers in New Zealand.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate risk factors for new infection with Leptospira interrogans sv Pomona and Leptospira borgpetersenii sv Hardjo in meat workers.
METHODS: Sera were collected twice approximately 12 months apart from 592 workers from eight abattoirs slaughtering sheep, cattle or deer and tested by microscopic agglutination for Pomona and Hardjo. Information on potential risk factors were recorded and analysed by multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Forty-nine (8.3%) participants, either seroconverted or had at least a titre increase by two dilutions against either serovar. While in sheep meat workers, the annual infection risk was 11.3% (95% CI 8.5% to 14.8%), in deer meat workers it was 0% (95% CI 0.0% to 10.9%) and in those processing beef cattle, 1.2% (95% CI 0.2% to 4.6%). Risk factors for new infection in sheep abattoirs were worker position, abattoir and time worked in the meat industry. The new infection risk was highest at the beginning of the slaughter line (stunning and hide removal; relative risk, RR 7.5, 95% CI 2.5 to 22.4), followed by positions on the line involving the removal of high-risk material (bladder, and kidneys; RR 5.2, 95% CI 1.7 to 16.0). Risk was lower in the offal/pet food area (RR 4.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 16.4), and lowest in the boning room or office. Wearing personal protective equipment did not reduce the risk of new infection.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated ongoing exposure to leptospires in meat workers and risk factors for challenge. We recommend measures such as improvement of personal protective equipment use, changes in slaughter procedure or vaccination of sheep against Leptospira to reduce the risk.","['Dreyfus A', 'Wilson P', 'Collins-Emerson J', 'Benschop J', 'Moore S', 'Heuer C']",2015,72,3,Occup Environ Med,"Dreyfus A, et al.

25519057,Prevalence of Leptospira antibodies in wild boars (Sus scrofa) from Northern Portugal: risk factor analysis.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of worldwide distribution, caused by infection with pathogenic spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira. The wild boar (Sus scrofa), an important hunting species in Europe, seems to play a significant role in the epidemiological cycle of leptospirosis. A total of 101 serum samples from wild boar hunted in Northern Portugal were analysed for leptospiral antibodies detection by microscopic agglutination test. Sera were collected during hunting seasons (2011-2013) and tested with 17 different pathogenic serovars of Leptospira. Antibodies against nine serovars were detected in 66 (65·4%) of these sera. Serovars Tarassovi and Altodouro exhibited the highest seroreactivity rates (23·8% and 16·8%, respectively), followed by Autumnalis (7·9%) and Bratislava (6·9%). Age and district of origin were found to be risk factors for the presence of leptospiral antibodies in contrast to gender. From a One Health perspective, this study revealed that wild boar should be considered as a potential source of leptospirosis dissemination for humans and animal species (domestic and wild) in shared environments, particularly in the Trás-os-Montes region.","['Vale-Gonçalves HM', 'Cabral JA', 'Faria MC', 'Nunes-Pereira M', 'Faria AS', 'Veloso O', 'Vieira ML', 'Paiva-Cardoso MN']",2015,143,10,Epidemiol Infect,"Vale-Gonçalves HM, et al.

25518910,Widespread detection of antibodies to Leptospira in feral swine in the United States.,"As feral swine continue to expand their geographical range and distribution across the United States, their involvement in crop damage, livestock predation, and pathogen transmission is likely to increase. Despite the relatively recent discovery of feral swine involvement in the aetiology of a variety of pathogens, their propensity to transmit and carry a wide variety of pathogens is disconcerting. We examined sera from 2055 feral swine for antibody presence to six serovars of Leptospira that can also infect humans, livestock or domestic animals. About 13% of all samples tested positive for at least one serovar, suggesting that Leptospira infection is common in feral swine. Further studies to identify the proportion of actively infected animals are needed to more fully understand the risk they pose.","['Pedersen K', 'Pabilonia KL', 'Anderson TD', 'Bevins SN', 'Hicks CR', 'Kloft JM', 'Deliberto TJ']",2015,143,10,Epidemiol Infect,"Pedersen K, et al.

The present study aims to identify the potential risk factors (infectious/noninfectious) for stillborn piglets in two commercial swine farms situated in midwestern region of Brazil. The potential risk factors were included in a multivariable logistic model, and the dependent variable was defined as the presence of at least one stillborn piglet in a given litter (yes or no). In the best fit model, two variables from the multivariable analysis, total litter size (p = 0.01), and average birth weight (p = 0.03) were significantly associated with the presence of stillborn piglets at the farms examined in this study. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was detected in 29.1 % of the litters. Neither parvovirus (PPV) nor leptospirosis infections were identified in this study, suggesting that they have a minor impact on reproductive disease.","['Silva GS', 'da Costa Lana MV', 'Dias GB', 'da Cruz RA', 'Lopes LL', 'Machado G', 'Corbellini LG', 'Gava D', 'Souza MA', 'Pescador CA']",2015,47,2,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Silva GS, et al.

25504132,[Genotyping and evaluation of infection dynamics in a Colombian isolate of Leptospira santarosai in hamster as an experimental model].,"INTRODUCTION: Is necessary to develop models for the study of leptospirosis.
OBJECTIVE: To genotype a Colombian strain of Leptospira isolated from a human with Weil´s syndrome and to evaluate its infection dynamics in the hamster experimental model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genotyping was performed by amplification and sequence analysis of the rrs 16S and lipL32 genes. The median lethal dose was determined in intraperitoneally inoculated hamsters. The patterns of clinical chemistry, the duration of leptospiremia, leptospiruria and pathological findings were studied and compared in the same animal model infected with L. interrogans (Fiocruz L1-130).
RESULTS: Molecular typing revealed that the isolate corresponded to the pathogenic species L. santarosai, which was recovered from hamsters´ kidneys and lungs and detected by lipL32 PCR from day 3 post-infection in these organs. There was a marked increase of C-reactive protein in animals at day 5 post-infection (3.25 mg/dl; normal value: 0.3 mg/dl) with decreases by day 18 (2.60 mg/dl: normal value: 0.8 mg/dl). Biomarkers of urea showed changes consistent with possible renal acute failure (day 5 post-infection: 49.01 mg/dl and day 18 post-infection: 53.71 mg/dl). Histopathological changes included interstitial pneumonia with varying degrees of hemorrhage and interstitial nephritis.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenic species L. santarosai was identified in Colombia. Its pathogenicity as determined by tropism to lung and kidney was comparable to that of L. interrogans Fiocruz L1-130, well known for its virulence and pulmonar tropism. The biological aspects studied here had never before been evaluated in an autochthonous isolate.","['Agudelo-Flórez P', 'Durango H', 'Aranzazu D', 'Rodas JD', 'Travi B']",2014,34,3,Biomedica,"Agudelo-Flórez P, et al.

It has recently been described in dogs fed chicken jerky treats from China, a new differential diagnosis to the classical inciting infectious diseases (e.g. leptospirosis, pyelonephritis) and toxins. A dog fed exclusively chicken jerky treats purchased in Switzerland was presented to our clinic with severe polyuria, polydipsia and profound electrolyte and acid base disturbances. Other inciting causes of Fanconi syndrome were ruled out. The requirement of a very intensive supportive treatment in this dog stands in contrast to treatment of chronic forms of Fanconi syndrome as described in the Basenji. This intensive therapy and the associated monitoring can be a real challenge and a limiting factor for the prognosis of acquired Fanconi syndrome. Veterinarians should be aware of the risk of excessive feeding of chicken jerky treats.","['Major A', 'Schweighauser A', 'Hinden SE', 'Francey T']",2014,156,12,Schweiz Arch Tierheilkd,"Major A, et al.

25483025,A cluster of Rickettsia rickettsii infection at an animal shelter in an urban area of Brazil.,"Rickettsia rickettsii infection is being increasingly recognized as an important cause of fatal acute illness in Brazil, where this tick-borne disease is designated Brazilian spotted fever (BSF). In this study we report five fatal cases of BSF in employees of an animal shelter in an urban area in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in southeast Brazil after a natural disaster on 11 January 2011. Four of the cases occurred from 27 January to 11 April 2011, while the fifth fatal case was identified in April 2012. Three cases were confirmed by molecular analysis and two by epidemiological linkage. An investigation of BSF was performed in the animal shelter, and blood samples were collected from 115 employees and 117 randomly selected dogs. The presence of high levels (1024-4096) of antibodies against spotted fever group rickettsiae was found in three (2·6%) employees and 114 (97·5%) dogs. These findings emphasize the need to consider BSF as a possible cause of undifferentiated febrile illness, especially dengue and leptospirosis, in patients occupationally exposed to dogs heavily infested by ticks, mainly working at kennels and animal shelters that have inadequate space for the animals housed and frequently providing an environment conducive to exposure to pathogens such as R. rickettsii.","['Rozental T', 'Ferreira MS', 'Gomes R', 'Costa CM', 'Barbosa PR', 'Bezerra IO', 'Garcia MH', 'Oliveira E Cruz DM', 'Galliez R', 'Oliveira S', 'Brasil P', 'Rezende T', 'De Lemos ER']",2015,143,11,Epidemiol Infect,"Rozental T, et al.

Both were added of aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Experimental bacterins were tested with the hamster potency test in order to assess protection provided against the disease and against the establishment of kidney infection. Controls were polyvalent commercial vaccine produced with Leptospira strains isolated outside Brazil, which included a representative of Pomona serovar, or Sorensen solution added of aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. The challenge was performed with cross-strains of serogroup Pomona tested in accordance with international standards established for the potency test. After 21 days of the challenge, survivors were killed to evaluate the condition of Leptospira renal carrier. Experimental bacterins protected hamsters against homologous and heterologous strains, demonstrating the existence of cross-protection. The commercial vaccine protected the hamsters challenged with both strains, but there was a high proportion of animals diagnosed as renal carriers when the challenge was performed with strain GR6, isolated from pigs in Brazil.","['Dib CC', 'Gonçales AP', 'de Morais ZM', 'de Souza GO', 'Miraglia F', 'Abreu PA', 'Vasconcellos SA']",2014,45,3,Braz J Microbiol,"Dib CC, et al.

25474719,Live imaging of bioluminescent leptospira interrogans in mice reveals renal colonization as a stealth escape from the blood defenses and antibiotics.,"Leptospira (L.) interrogans are bacteria responsible for a worldwide reemerging zoonosis. Some animals asymptomatically carry L. interrogans in their kidneys and excrete bacteria in their urine, which contaminates the environment. Humans are infected through skin contact with leptospires and develop mild to severe leptospirosis. Previous attempts to construct fluorescent or bioluminescent leptospires, which would permit in vivo visualization and investigation of host defense mechanisms during infection, have been unsuccessful. Using a firefly luciferase cassette and random transposition tools, we constructed bioluminescent chromosomal transformants in saprophytic and pathogenic leptospires. The kinetics of leptospiral dissemination in mice, after intraperitoneal inoculation with a pathogenic transformant, was tracked by bioluminescence using live imaging. For infective doses of 106 to 107 bacteria, we observed dissemination and exponential growth of leptospires in the blood, followed by apparent clearance of bacteria. However, with 2×108 bacteria, the septicemia led to the death of mice within 3 days post-infection. In surviving mice, one week after infection, pathogenic leptospires reemerged only in the kidneys, where they multiplied and reached a steady state, leading to a sustained chronic renal infection. These experiments reveal that a fraction of the leptospiral population escapes the potent blood defense, and colonizes a defined number of niches in the kidneys, proportional to the infective dose. Antibiotic treatments failed to eradicate leptospires that colonized the kidneys, although they were effective against L. interrogans if administered before or early after infection. To conclude, mice infected with bioluminescent L. interrogans proved to be a novel model to study both acute and chronic leptospirosis, and revealed that, in the kidneys, leptospires are protected from antibiotics. These bioluminescent leptospires represent a powerful new tool to challenge mice treated with drugs or vaccines, and test the survival, dissemination, and transmission of leptospires between environment and hosts.","['Ratet G', 'Veyrier FJ', ""Fanton d'Andon M"", 'Kammerscheit X', 'Nicola MA', 'Picardeau M', 'Boneca IG', 'Werts C']",2014,8,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Ratet G, et al.

25474580,Influence of household rat infestation on leptospira transmission in the urban slum environment.,"BACKGROUND: The Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) is the principal reservoir for leptospirosis in many urban settings. Few studies have identified markers for rat infestation in slum environments while none have evaluated the association between household rat infestation and Leptospira infection in humans or the use of infestation markers as a predictive model to stratify risk for leptospirosis.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We enrolled a cohort of 2,003 urban slum residents from Salvador, Brazil in 2004, and followed the cohort during four annual serosurveys to identify serologic evidence for Leptospira infection. In 2007, we performed rodent infestation and environmental surveys of 80 case households, in which resided at least one individual with Leptospira infection, and 109 control households. In the case-control study, signs of rodent infestation were identified in 78% and 42% of the households, respectively. Regression modeling identified the presence of R. norvegicus feces (OR, 4.95; 95% CI, 2.13-11.47), rodent burrows (2.80; 1.06-7.36), access to water (2.79; 1.28-6.09), and un-plastered walls (2.71; 1.21-6.04) as independent risk factors associated with Leptospira infection in a household. We developed a predictive model for infection, based on assigning scores to each of the rodent infestation risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found that the prediction score produced a good/excellent fit based on an area under the curve of 0.78 (0.71-0.84).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study found that a high proportion of slum households were infested with R. norvegicus and that rat infestation was significantly associated with the risk of Leptospira infection, indicating that high level transmission occurs among slum households. We developed an easily applicable prediction score based on rat infestation markers, which identified households with highest infection risk. The use of the prediction score in community-based screening may therefore be an effective risk stratification strategy for targeting control measures in slum settings of high leptospirosis transmission.","['Costa F', 'Ribeiro GS', 'Felzemburgh RD', 'Santos N', 'Reis RB', 'Santos AC', 'Fraga DB', 'Araujo WN', 'Santana C', 'Childs JE', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI']",2014,8,12,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Costa F, et al.

25467300,[Leptospirosis and thrombocytopenia].,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by the spirochete Leptospira interrogans. The spectrum of symptoms reported in leptospirosis is extremely broad. Thrombocytopenia is common during the acute phase of leptospirosis but its pathophysiological mechanism remains not well defined.
CASE REPORT: We report a 56-year-old man hospitalized for severe sepsis with acute kidney injury and liver failure. Because of the recent flood of his house, we suspected leptospirosis. The diagnosis was rapidly confirmed. Blood tests revealed thrombocytopenia at 9 G/L associated with hyperferritinemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Cytological examination of bone marrow showed abundance of megakaryocytes and hemophagocytosis which confirmed the diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome. Clinical symptoms resolved and blood tests returned to normal values in the same time.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that hemophogocytosis is a possible mechanism of thrombocytopenia in leptospirosis and that examination of bone marrow should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.","['Issa N', 'Guisset O', 'Mourissoux G', 'Gabinski C', 'Camou F']",2015,36,8,Rev Med Interne,"Issa N, et al.

25466383,Identification of immunodominant antigens in canine leptospirosis by Multi-Antigen Print ImmunoAssay (MAPIA).,"BACKGROUND: The microscopic agglutination test (MAT), the standard method for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis, may present limitations regarding its sensitivity. Current studies suggest that Leptospira immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins and LipL32 are of particular interest as serodiagnostic markers since they are present only in pathogenic species of the Leptospira genus. The purpose of this study was to identify leptospiral immunodominant proteins that are recognized by canine sera from diseased dogs.
RESULTS: A total of 109 dogs were studied, including seroreactive dogs (MAT ≥800) and dogs with no seroreactivity detectable by MAT. Eight recombinant fragments (31-70 kDa) of pathogenic Leptospira were tested for their use as diagnostic markers for canine leptospirosis using the Multi-antigen Print Immunoassay (MAPIA) platform: LigB [582-947aa] from L. interrogans serovar Pomona, L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni and L. kirschneri serovar Gryppotyphosa, LigB [131-649aa] from L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, L. interrogans serovar Canicola and L. kirschneri serovar Gryppotyphosa, LigA [625-1224aa] L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni and LipL32 from L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni. The data were analyzed and ROC curves were generated. Altogether, LigB [131-649aa] L. interrogans Canicola, LigB [131-649aa] L. kirschneri Gryppotyphosa and LipL32 L. interrogans Copenhageni showed best accuracy (AUC = 0.826 to 0.869), with 70% specificity and sensitivity ranging from 89% to 95%.

25463388,Evolution of the RNase P RNA structural domain in Leptospira spp.,"We have employed the RNase P RNA (RPR) gene, which is present as single copy in chromosome I of Leptospira spp. to investigate the phylogeny of structural domains present in the RNA subunit of the tRNA processing enzyme, RNase P. RPR gene sequences of 150 strains derived from NCBI database along with sequences determined from 8 reference strains were examined to fathom strain specific structural differences present in leptospiral RPR. Sequence variations in the RPR gene impacted on the configuration of loops, stems and bulges found in the RPR highlighting species and strain specific structural motifs. In vitro transcribed leptospiral RPR ribozymes are demonstrated to process pre-tRNA into mature tRNA in consonance with the positioning of Leptospira in the taxonomic domain of bacteria.

Five leptospirosis cases were evaluated, all of which contracted the disease after exposure to fresh water in Southeast Asian countries. All of the cases had fevers, headaches, conjunctival injections, and relative bradycardia. The pertinent laboratory findings included elevated C-reactive protein levels, elevated creatinine levels, and sterile pyuria. All 5 cases had serum MAT titers that increased by ≥ 4 times in the interval between specimens taken during the acute phase and those taken during the convalescence phase, and leptospiral DNA was detected in plasma and/or urine specimens in 4 cases. Leptospira interrogans was isolated from one patient's blood sample. Patients were treated with penicillin G, minocycline, or doxycycline. One case was cured without antibiotics.

25453027,Pathogenic Landscape of Transboundary Zoonotic Diseases in the Mexico-US Border Along the Rio Grande.,"Transboundary zoonotic diseases, several of which are vector borne, can maintain a dynamic focus and have pathogens circulating in geographic regions encircling multiple geopolitical boundaries. Global change is intensifying transboundary problems, including the spatial variation of the risk and incidence of zoonotic diseases. The complexity of these challenges can be greater in areas where rivers delineate international boundaries and encompass transitions between ecozones. The Rio Grande serves as a natural border between the US State of Texas and the Mexican States of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. Not only do millions of people live in this transboundary region, but also a substantial amount of goods and people pass through it everyday. Moreover, it occurs over a region that functions as a corridor for animal migrations, and thus links the Neotropic and Nearctic biogeographic zones, with the latter being a known foci of zoonotic diseases. However, the pathogenic landscape of important zoonotic diseases in the south Texas-Mexico transboundary region remains to be fully understood. An international perspective on the interplay between disease systems, ecosystem processes, land use, and human behaviors is applied here to analyze landscape and spatial features of Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Hantavirus disease, Lyme Borreliosis, Leptospirosis, Bartonellosis, Chagas disease, human Babesiosis, and Leishmaniasis. Surveillance systems following the One Health approach with a regional perspective will help identifying opportunities to mitigate the health burden of those diseases on human and animal populations. It is proposed that the Mexico-US border along the Rio Grande region be viewed as a continuum landscape where zoonotic pathogens circulate regardless of national borders.","['Esteve-Gassent MD', 'Pérez de León AA', 'Romero-Salas D', 'Feria-Arroyo TP', 'Patino R', 'Castro-Arellano I', 'Gordillo-Pérez G', 'Auclair A', 'Goolsby J', 'Rodriguez-Vivas RI', 'Estrada-Franco JG']",2014,2,,Front Public Health,"Esteve-Gassent MD, et al.

25450882,"Efficacy of cefepime, ertapenem and norfloxacin against leptospirosis and for the clearance of pathogens in a hamster model.","Animals and humans with severe leptospirosis may require empirical treatment. Although many antibiotics are active against multiple leptospira serovars in vitro, their efficacy in vivo is limited. We evaluated the efficacy of cefepime (daily dose: 2, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), ertapenem (daily dose: 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) and norfloxacin (daily dose: 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) for the treatment of leptospirosis and the ability to clear leptospira in target organs (liver, kidney, lung, heart, and spleen) in a lethal hamster model using Leptospira interrogans serovar Autumnalis. The histopathology of infected kidney, lung and liver was also evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E stain). All untreated animals, serving as a negative control, died with leptospira existing in the target organs between the 5th and 7th day after infection. All of the treated groups displayed improved survival compared to the untreated group and demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in the presence of leptospira in the target organs. Cefepime showed survival benefit comparable to the standard treatment, doxycycline. We conclude that all of the antibiotics tested in vivo produce a statistically significant survival advantage, alleviate tissue injury and decrease the abundance of leptospira in target organs.","['Zhang W', 'Zhang N', 'Wang W', 'Wang F', 'Gong Y', 'Jiang H', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu X', 'Song X', 'Wang T', 'Ding Z', 'Cao Y']",2014,77,,Microb Pathog,"Zhang W, et al.

25449998,Iron metabolism in hamsters experimentally infected with Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona: influence on disease pathogenesis.,"The aim of this study was to analyze the classic iron markers associated to the storage process in hamsters experimentally infected by Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. Four groups with six hamsters each were used; two were negative controls (C7 and C14) and two were composed by infected animals (T7 and T14). Blood samples were collected on the seventh (C7 and T7) and fourteenth days (C14 and T14) post-inoculation. Iron availability was determined in sera samples through the assessment of iron, ferritin, transferrin, and iron binding capacity, whereas the bone marrow was also evaluated for the presence of iron by Pearl's reaction. Additionally, the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidant status (TOS) were assessed, along with hepcidin and IL-6 levels. Based on the results, it was possible to observe the onset of an anemic profile, predominantly hemolytic and regenerative. Also, The other parameters showed an increase in seric iron (P<0.01) and ferritin (P<0.01), and a positive Pearl's reaction in T7 and T14, when compared with the control groups. Transferrin levels decreased (P<0.05) in animals of T14 with saturation index. TAC was increased in both periods (P<0.01), while TOS was increased only on T14 (P<0.05). Hepcidin and IL-6 were increased on T7 and T14 (P<0.01). Therefore, it was observed that the serum profile from infected animals showed a strong hemolytic pattern, with some demonstration of ferric tissue sequestration when the infection tended to become chronic. The results show that iron metabolism is activated in hamsters infected by L. interrogans serovar Pomona.","['Sobroza ÂO', 'Tonin AA', 'Da Silva AS', 'Dornelles GL', 'Wolkmer P', 'Duarte MM', 'Hausen BS', 'Sangoi MB', 'Moresco RN', 'Stefani LM', 'Mazzantti CM', 'Lopes ST', 'Leal ML']",2014,37,5-6,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Sobroza ÂO, et al.

Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis especially in countries with tropical and subtropical climates. Recently, the number of patients with leptospirosis dramatically decreased in Japan because public hygiene has greatly improved, the mechanization of agriculture was introduced, and farmers started using rubber boots and gloves while working in the field. The opportunities for percutaneous infection with Leptospira was reduced, but have not been totally eliminated in Japan.We previously reported a novel combination of five antimicrobial agents for selective isolation of Leptospira from contaminated samples. This cocktail, after being incorporated into Leptospira growth medium, inhibited the growth of contaminants and allowed successful detection of leptospires in environmental samples. We collected soil and environmental water and cultured them using this selective medium. It was revealed that not only saprophytic Leptospira but also pathogenic Leptospira are widely living in the environment. We hypothesized that soil serves as reservoir for Leptospira and infectious source for leptospirosis. In this review, we also discuss the Leptospira-rat-human relationship in the Philippines, natural defense of host against oral and percutaneous infection by Leptospira, the mechanism of jaundice in leptospirosis, and the development of immunochromatography-based methods for detection of leptospiral antigen in urine.","['Saito M', 'Y A M Villanueva S', 'Masuzawa T', 'Yanagihara Y', 'Yoshida S']",2014,69,4,Nihon Saikingaku Zasshi,"Saito M, et al.

25437801,Leptospiral pathogenomics.,"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira, is a zoonosis with important impacts on human and animal health worldwide. Research on the mechanisms of Leptospira pathogenesis has been hindered due to slow growth of infectious strains, poor transformability, and a paucity of genetic tools. As a result of second generation sequencing technologies, there has been an acceleration of leptospiral genome sequencing efforts in the past decade, which has enabled a concomitant increase in functional genomics analyses of Leptospira pathogenesis. A pathogenomics approach, by coupling of pan-genomic analysis of multiple isolates with sequencing of experimentally attenuated highly pathogenic Leptospira, has resulted in the functional inference of virulence factors. The global Leptospira Genome Project supported by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to which key scientific contributions have been made from the international leptospirosis research community has provided a new roadmap for comprehensive studies of Leptospira and leptospirosis well into the future. This review describes functional genomics approaches to apply the data generated by the Leptospira Genome Project towards deepening our knowledge of virulence factors of Leptospira using the emerging discipline of pathogenomics.","['Lehmann JS', 'Matthias MA', 'Vinetz JM', 'Fouts DE']",2014,3,2,Pathogens,"Lehmann JS, et al.

28663802,Clinical spectrum of severe leptospirosis in the UK.,"INTRODUCTION: Human leptospirosis is a global zoonotic infection with a characteristic biphasic illness and protean clinical manifestations. The majority are mild flu-like infections. The severe forms cause multiorgan damage with a greater predilection to hepatorenal failure.
CASE PRESENTATION: We attempted to analyse the clinical presentation of severe leptospirosis and decipher the clinical spectrum within this group by reviewing a series of 15 patients with leptospirosis requiring intensive care support for their management. We noticed complications becoming apparent before antibodies became detectable in the blood in a significant number of patients. This appears to belie the biphasic nature of leptospirosis and raises the question of whether the complications occur during the leptospiraemic phase or the immune phase of the infection. The presence of leptospiral DNA in the blood at this time as detected by a molecular assay strengthened this suspicion. Among the 15 patients with severe leptospirosis, only 3 (20 %) had an overseas travel history and the remaining 12 patients acquired their infection within the UK. Fourteen of the 15 patients had hepatorenal dysfunction, with seven requiring dialysis. Eight of the 15 patients received intravenous ceftriaxone with very good outcomes. Three showed significant clinical improvement after the administration of steroids.
CONCLUSION: Many patients with severe leptospirosis will have complications on presentation. Molecular testing is now available for early diagnosis, facilitating early interventions. Ceftriaxone has been effective in treating severe leptospirosis. This study reminds clinicians to consider leptospirosis in the differential diagnosis of similar clinical spectra and offers tools for appropriate management.","['Sivaprakasam V', 'Zochowski WJ', 'Palmer MF']",2014,1,4,JMM Case Rep,"Sivaprakasam V, et al.

25413923,Severity markers in severe leptospirosis: a cohort study.,"We aimed to evaluate parameters for their value as severity markers in hospitalized leptospirosis patients. We recruited 47 informed adult consenting patients and assessed a number of clinical, hematological, biochemical, and biological variables. Patients were sorted according to severity based on fatality or the requirement of mechanical ventilation or dialysis; the parameters studied were compared between groups on inclusion and the next day. Beside septic shock presentation or a high severity score (Simplified Acute Physiology Score; SAPS II), increased lactate, total bilirubin, lipase, and AST/ALT ratio or a decreased cytokines IL-10/TNF-α ratio were all significantly associated with severity. The gene expression of the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra, IL-1α, and the long pentraxin PTX-3 were also transcribed at higher levels in most severe cases. Patients could rapidly improve or deteriorate, highlighting the need for a new assessment the next day. Our results add to the limited body of knowledge about severity markers in leptospirosis. They also suggest that patients should be reassessed the next day before being possibly discharged from the hospital. Further studies are needed in order to confirm relevant and reliable prognostic parameters in leptospirosis that would be helpful for the purpose of triage.","['Mikulski M', 'Boisier P', 'Lacassin F', 'Soupé-Gilbert ME', 'Mauron C', 'Bruyere-Ostells L', 'Bonte D', 'Barguil Y', 'Gourinat AC', 'Matsui M', 'Vernel-Pauillac F', 'Goarant C']",2015,34,4,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"Mikulski M, et al.

25411782,Kinetics of Leptospira interrogans infection in hamsters after intradermal and subcutaneous challenge.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by highly motile, helically shaped bacteria that penetrate the skin and mucous membranes through lesions or abrasions, and rapidly disseminate throughout the body. Although the intraperitoneal route of infection is widely used to experimentally inoculate hamsters, this challenge route does not represent a natural route of infection.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe the kinetics of disease and infection in hamster model of leptospirosis after subcutaneous and intradermal inoculation of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni, strain Fiocruz L1-130. Histopathologic changes in and around the kidney, including glomerular and tubular damage and interstitial inflammatory changes, began on day 5, and preceded deterioration in renal function as measured by serum creatinine. Weight loss, hemoconcentration, increased absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in the blood and hepatic dysfunction were first noted on day 6. Vascular endothelial growth factor, a serum marker of sepsis severity, became elevated during the later stages of infection. The burden of infection, as measured by quantitative PCR, was highest in the kidney and peaked on day 5 after intradermal challenge and on day 6 after subcutaneous challenge. Compared to subcutaneous challenge, intradermal challenge resulted in a lower burden of infection in both the kidney and liver on day 6, lower ANC and less weight loss on day 7.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The intradermal and subcutaneous challenge routes result in significant differences in the kinetics of dissemination and disease after challenge with L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 at an experimental dose of 2×106 leptospires. These results provide new information regarding infection kinetics in the hamster model of leptospirosis.","['Coutinho ML', 'Matsunaga J', 'Wang LC', 'de la Peña Moctezuma A', 'Lewis MS', 'Babbitt JT', 'Aleixo JA', 'Haake DA']",2014,8,11,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Coutinho ML, et al.

25399108,Multilocus sequence typing (MLST): markers for the traceability of pathogenic Leptospira strains.,"Leptospirosis is a major zoonosis with worldwide distribution. Conventional serological typing is arduous and time consuming. Genotyping is increasingly applied for the typing and identification of leptospires and contributes to genetic and virulence divergence and molecular epidemiological characteristics such as host versus leptospires population interactions and dynamics. Presently, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is the most robust approach. In this chapter, we describe the practical steps of two major multilocus sequence typing methods for leptospires. The first method (denoted as the 6 L scheme) is based on genotyping by phylogeny using concatenated sequences derived from six loci, including genes that encode outer membrane proteins and rrs and can be used for typing pathogenic species and strains of intermediate species. The second method (referred to as the 7 L scheme) uses seven loci on housekeeping genes and allows the analysis of seven major Leptospira pathogenic species. The 7 L scheme is web based and includes the option to analyze sequence types (STs).","['Ahmed A', 'Ferreira AS', 'Hartskeerl RA']",2015,1247,,Methods Mol Biol,"Ahmed A, et al.

25398140,Direct detection and differentiation of pathogenic Leptospira species using a multi-gene targeted real time PCR approach.,"Leptospirosis is a growing public and veterinary health concern caused by pathogenic species of Leptospira. Rapid and reliable laboratory tests for the direct detection of leptospiral infections in animals are in high demand not only to improve diagnosis but also for understanding the epidemiology of the disease. In this work we describe a novel and simple TaqMan-based multi-gene targeted real-time PCR approach able to detect and differentiate Leptospira interrogans, L. kirschneri, L. borgpeteresenii and L. noguchii, which constitute the veterinary most relevant pathogenic species of Leptospira. The method uses sets of species-specific probes, and respective flanking primers, designed from ompL1 and secY gene sequences. To monitor the presence of inhibitors, a duplex amplification assay targeting both the mammal β-actin and the leptospiral lipL32 genes was implemented. The analytical sensitivity of all primer and probe sets was estimated to be <10 genome equivalents (GE) in the reaction mixture. Application of the amplification reactions on genomic DNA from a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira strains and other non-related bacteria revealed a 100% analytical specificity. Additionally, pathogenic leptospires were successfully detected in five out of 29 tissue samples from animals (Mus spp., Rattus spp., Dolichotis patagonum and Sus domesticus). Two samples were infected with L. borgpetersenii, two with L. interrogans and one with L. kirschneri. The possibility to detect and identify these pathogenic agents to the species level in domestic and wildlife animals reinforces the diagnostic information and will enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of leptopirosis.","['Ferreira AS', 'Costa P', 'Rocha T', 'Amaro A', 'Vieira ML', 'Ahmed A', 'Thompson G', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Inácio J']",2014,9,11,PLoS One,"Ferreira AS, et al.

25393620,Association between footwear use and neglected tropical diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has primarily focused on preventive chemotherapy and case management. Less attention has been placed on the role of ensuring access to adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene and personal preventive measures in reducing exposure to infection. Our aim was to assess whether footwear use was associated with a lower risk of selected NTDs.
METHODOLOGY: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between footwear use and infection or disease for those NTDs for which the route of transmission or occurrence may be through the feet. We included Buruli ulcer, cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), leptospirosis, mycetoma, myiasis, podoconiosis, snakebite, tungiasis, and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, particularly hookworm infection and strongyloidiasis. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and Popline databases, contacted experts, and hand-searched reference lists for eligible studies. The search was conducted in English without language, publication status, or date restrictions up to January 2014. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported a measure of the association between footwear use and the risk of each NTD. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Descriptive study characteristics and methodological quality of the included studies were summarized. For each study outcome, both outcome and exposure data were abstracted and crude and adjusted effect estimates presented. Individual and summary odds ratio (OR) estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as a measure of intervention effect, using random effects meta-analyses.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among the 427 studies screened, 53 met our inclusion criteria. Footwear use was significantly associated with a lower odds of infection of Buruli ulcer (OR=0.15; 95% CI: 0.08-0.29), CLM (OR=0.24; 95% CI: 0.06-0.96), tungiasis (OR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.26-0.70), hookworm infection (OR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.37-0.61), any STH infection (OR=0.57; 95% CI: 0.39-0.84), strongyloidiasis (OR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.38-0.83), and leptospirosis (OR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.37-0.94). No significant association between footwear use and podoconiosis (OR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.38-1.05) was found and no data were available for mycetoma, myiasis, and snakebite. The main limitations were evidence of heterogeneity and poor study quality inherent to the observational studies included.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that footwear use was associated with a lower odds of several different NTDs. Access to footwear should be prioritized alongside existing NTD interventions to ensure a lasting reduction of multiple NTDs and to accelerate their control and elimination.

25388139,The role of leptospirosis reference laboratories.,"The general goal of reference centres is to support the community, from diagnostic laboratories to research institutions, in the execution of their work by providing reference strains and reagents and giving instructions and recommendations to individual colleagues and national and international organisations on a wide variety of issues. There are different levels of reference centres, from local to international, with an increasing package of tasks and responsibilities. Local reference centres might limit activities to diagnostic confirmation by applying standard testing, while international reference centres cover a wider range of activities from design, validation and harmonisation of diagnostic and reference technologies to international monitoring associated with recommendations on the global burden and distribution of leptospirosis and its prevention and control to national and international health decision makers. This chapter focusses on four major pillars constituting reference tasks in addition to the obvious provision of reference substances, i.e. Research and training, Diagnosis, Identification of Leptospira and Surveillance. Due to financial and organisational constraints, reference centres are restricted in their capacity for basic research and consequently focus on applied research into various aspects of leptospirosis. They offer training, either individually or groupwise, that might vary from standard technologies to novel sophisticated methodologies, depending on the need and requests of the trainee. Most reference centres are involved in the confirmation of preliminary diagnosis obtained at peripheral levels, such as local hospitals and health centres, while other major activities involve the design and validation of diagnostics, their international harmonisation and quality assurance. Identification of causative Leptospira strains (or serovars) is key to the identification of infection sources and is critical for surveillance. Hence, reference centres also focus on the development, application and provision of methods that are required for unambiguous characterisation of new and recognised Leptospira strains and the maintenance of the integrity of strain collections. In line with their central role, reference centres are frequently associated with local, national and/or international surveillance activities linked to an advisory role and the production of guidelines. Such surveillance activities usually comprise collation of morbidity and mortality data, signalling of outbreaks and the investigation of infection sources and risks.","['Hartskeerl RA', 'Smythe LD']",2015,387,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Hartskeerl RA and Smythe LD.

25388138,Vaccines against leptospirosis.,"Vaccines against leptospirosis followed within a year of the first isolation of Leptospira, with the first use of a killed whole cell bacterin vaccine in guinea pigs published in 1916. Since then, bacterin vaccines have been used in humans, cattle, swine, and dogs and remain the only vaccines licensed at the present time. The immunity elicited is restricted to serovars with related lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen. Likewise, vaccines based on LPS antigens have clearly demonstrated protection in animal models, which is also at best serogroup specific. The advent of leptospiral genome sequences has allowed a reverse vaccinology approach for vaccine development. However, the use of inadequate challenge doses and inappropriate statistical analysis invalidates many of the claims of protection with recombinant proteins.",['Adler B'],2015,387,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Adler B.

25388137,Host response to leptospira infection.,"Pathogenic Leptospira has the capacity to infect a broad range of mammalian hosts. Leptospirosis may appear as an acute, potentially fatal infection in accidental hosts, or progress into a chronic, largely asymptomatic infection in natural maintenance hosts. The course that Leptospira infection follows is dependent upon poorly understood factors, but is heavily influenced by both the host species and bacterial serovar involved in infection. Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by a variety of host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activates the host immune system. The outcome of this response may result in bacterial clearance, limited bacterial colonization of a few target organs, principally the kidney, or induction of sepsis as the host succumbs to infection and dies. This chapter describes current knowledge of how the host recognizes Leptospira and responds to infection using innate and acquired immune responses. Aspects of immune-mediated pathology and pathogen strategies to evade the host immune response are also addressed.",['Zuerner RL'],2015,387,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Zuerner RL. Host response to leptospira infection. Host response to leptospira infection. 2015; 387:223-50. doi: 10.1007/978-3-662-45059-8_9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25388137/
25388135,The molecular basis of leptospiral pathogenesis.,"The mechanisms of disease pathogenesis in leptospirosis are poorly defined. Recent developments in the application of genetic tools in the study of Leptospira have advanced our understanding by allowing the assessment of mutants in animal models. As a result, a small number of essential virulence factors have been identified, though most do not have a clearly defined function. Significant advances have also been made in the in vitro characterization of leptospiral interaction with host structures, including extracellular matrix proteins (such as laminin, elastin, fibronectin, collagens), proteins related to hemostasis (fibrinogen, plasmin), and soluble mediators of complement resistance (factor H, C4b-binding protein), although none of these in vitro findings has been translated to the host animal. Binding to host structures may permit colonization of the host, prevention of blood clotting may contribute to hemorrhage, while interaction with complement resistance mediators may contribute to survival in serum. While not a classical intracellular pathogen, the interaction of leptospires and phagocytic cells appears complex, with bacteria surviving uptake and promoting apoptosis; mutants relating to these processes (such as cell invasion and oxidative stress resistance) are attenuated in vivo. Another feature of leptospiral biology is the high degree of functional redundancy and the surprising lack of attenuation of mutants in what appear to be certain virulence factors, such as LipL32 and LigB. While many advances have been made, there remains a lack of understanding of how Leptospira causes tissue pathology. It is likely that leptospires have many novel pathogenesis mechanisms that are yet to be identified.",['Murray GL'],2015,387,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Murray GL.

25388134,Animal leptospirosis.,"Leptospirosis is a global disease of animals, which can have a major economic impact on livestock industries and is an important zoonosis. The current knowledge base is heavily biased towards the developed agricultural economies. The disease situation in the developing economies presents a major challenge as humans and animals frequently live in close association. The severity of disease varies with the infecting serovar and the affected species, but there are many common aspects across the species; for example, the acute phase of infection is mostly sub-clinical and the greatest economic losses arise from chronic infection causing reproductive wastage. The principles of, and tests for, diagnosis, treatment, control and surveillance are applicable across the species.",['Ellis WA'],2015,387,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Ellis WA. Animal leptospirosis.

25388133,Leptospirosis in humans.,"Leptospirosis is a widespread and potentially fatal zoonosis that is endemic in many tropical regions and causes large epidemics after heavy rainfall and flooding. Infection results from direct or indirect exposure to infected reservoir host animals that carry the pathogen in their renal tubules and shed pathogenic leptospires in their urine. Although many wild and domestic animals can serve as reservoir hosts, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) is the most important source of human infections. Individuals living in urban slum environments characterized by inadequate sanitation and poor housing are at high risk of rat exposure and leptospirosis. The global burden of leptospirosis is expected to rise with demographic shifts that favor increases in the number of urban poor in tropical regions subject to worsening storms and urban flooding due to climate change. Data emerging from prospective surveillance studies suggest that most human leptospiral infections in endemic areas are mild or asymptomatic. Development of more severe outcomes likely depends on three factors: epidemiological conditions, host susceptibility, and pathogen virulence (Fig. 1). Mortality increases with age, particularly in patients older than 60 years of age. High levels of bacteremia are associated with poor clinical outcomes and, based on animal model and in vitro studies, are related in part to poor recognition of leptospiral LPS by human TLR4. Patients with severe leptospirosis experience a cytokine storm characterized by high levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10. Patients with the HLA DQ6 allele are at higher risk of disease, suggesting a role for lymphocyte stimulation by a leptospiral superantigen. Leptospirosis typically presents as a nonspecific, acute febrile illness characterized by fever, myalgia, and headache and may be confused with other entities such as influenza and dengue fever. Newer diagnostic methods facilitate early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment. Patients progressing to multisystem organ failure have widespread hematogenous dissemination of pathogens. Nonoliguric (high output) renal dysfunction should be supported with fluids and electrolytes. When oliguric renal failure occurs, prompt initiation of dialysis can be life saving. Elevated bilirubin levels are due to hepatocellular damage and disruption of intercellular junctions between hepatocytes, resulting in leaking of bilirubin out of bile caniliculi. Hemorrhagic complications are common and are associated with coagulation abnormalities. Severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome due to extensive alveolar hemorrhage has a fatality rate of >50 %.

25388129,History of leptospirosis and leptospira.,"Leptospira was isolated and identified as the causative agent of the severe human syndrome Weil's disease about 100 years ago almost simultaneously, but independently, by workers in Japan and Europe. Since that time leptospires have been isolated from almost all mammalian species on every continent except Antarctica, with leptospirosis now recognized as the most widespread zoonosis worldwide and also a major cause of disease in many domestic animal species. Recent advances in molecular taxonomy have facilitated the development of a rational classification system, while the availability of genome sequences and the development of mutagenesis systems have begun to shed light on mechanisms of pathogenesis that appear to be unique to Leptospira.",['Adler B'],2015,387,,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Adler B.

25380365,Risk factors associated with prevalence of antibodies to Leptospira interrogans in a metapopulation of black-tailed prairie dogs in Mexico.,"Interest in the study of infectious diseases of wildlife has grown in recent decades and now focuses on understanding host-parasite dynamics and factors involved in disease occurrence. The black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) is a useful species for this type of investigation because it lives in heterogeneous landscapes where human activities take place, and its populations are structured as a metapopulation. Our goal was to determine if colony area, density, and proximity to human settlements are associated with prevalence of antibodies to Leptospira interrogans in black-tailed prairie dogs of northwestern Chihuahua State, Mexico. We captured 266 prairie dogs in 11 colonies in 2009 and analyzed 248 serum samples with the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibody to any of the 12 pathogenic serovars of L. interrogans. Serologically positive test results for only serovars Bratislava, Canicola, Celledoni, and Tarassovi were considered for statistical analysis. Almost 80% of sera were positive for at least one pathogenic serovar (MAT titer ≥1∶80). The highest recorded antibody prevalences were to serovars Bratislava and Canicola. Correlation analysis showed a negative relationship between L. interrogans antibody prevalence and colony area (r = -0.125, P<0.005), suggesting that animals living in larger colonies were at a lower risk than those in smaller colonies. The correlation between the serovar Canicola and distance was negative (r = -0.171, P<0.007), and this relationship may be explained by the presence of domestic dogs associated with human dwellings. This is the first study of Leptospira spp. antibody prevalence in prairie dogs, and it provides valuable insights into the dynamics of leptospirosis in threatened wildlife species. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of Leptospira serovars in metapopulations of prairie dogs and other domestic and wild mammals in grassland communities.","['Montiel-Arteaga A', 'Atilano D', 'Ayanegui A', 'Ceballos G', 'Suzán G']",2015,51,1,J Wildl Dis,"Montiel-Arteaga A, et al.

25379890,Sensitive real-time PCR detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. and a comparison of nucleic acid amplification methods for the diagnosis of leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND: Bacteria of the genus Leptospira, the causative agents of leptospirosis, are categorized into pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. However, the benefit of using a clinical diagnostic that is specific for pathogenic species remains unclear. In this study, we present the development of a real-time PCR (rtPCR) for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira (the pathogenic rtPCR), and we perform a comparison of the pathogenic rtPCR with a published assay that detects all Leptospira species [the undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) assay] and a reference 16S Leptospira rtPCR, which was originally designed to detect pathogenic species.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For the pathogenic rtPCR, a new hydrolysis probe was designed for use with primers from the UFI assay, which targets the 16S gene. The pathogenic rtPCR detected Leptospira DNA in 37/37 cultured isolates from 5 pathogenic and one intermediate species. Two strains of the non-pathogenic L. biflexa produced no signal. Clinical samples from 65 patients with suspected leptospirosis were then tested using the pathogenic rtPCR and a reference Leptospira 16S rtPCR. All 65 samples had tested positive for Leptospira using the UFI assay; 62 (95.4%) samples tested positive using the pathogenic rtPCR (p = 0.24). Only 24 (36.9%) samples tested positive in the reference 16S rtPCR (p<0.0001 for comparison with the pathogenic rtPCR and UFI assays). Amplicon sequencing confirmed the detection of pathogenic Leptospira species in 49/50 cases, including 3 cases that were only detected using the UFI assay.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The pathogenic rtPCR displayed similar sensitivity to the UFI assay when testing clinical specimens with no difference in specificity. Both assays proved significantly more sensitive than a real-time molecular test used for comparison. Future studies are needed to investigate the clinical and epidemiologic significance of more sensitive Leptospira detection using these tests.","['Waggoner JJ', 'Balassiano I', 'Abeynayake J', 'Sahoo MK', 'Mohamed-Hadley A', 'Liu Y', 'Vital-Brazil JM', 'Pinsky BA']",2014,9,11,PLoS One,"Waggoner JJ, et al.

25369218,Recognition and management of rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks after heavy rainfall and flooding.,"Climatic events, especially heavy rains and flooding following periods of relative drought, have precipitated both arthropod-borne and rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks. Heavy rainfall encourages excessive wild grass seed production that supports increased outdoor rodent populations, and flooding forces rodents from their burrows near water sources into the built environment and closer to humans. The objectives of this review are to alert clinicians to the climatic conditions common to hurricane-prone regions, such as Louisiana, that can precipitate outbreaks of the two rodent-borne diseases most often associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding, leptospirosis (LS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). It will also describe the epidemiology, presenting clinical manifestations and outcomes of these rodent-borne infectious diseases, and recommend both prophylactic therapies and effective control and prevention strategies for rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks. Healthcare providers should maintain high levels of suspicion for LS in patients developing febrile illnesses after contaminated freshwater exposures during flooding or recreational events, and for HPS in patients with febrile illnesses that progress rapidly to respiratory failure following rodent exposures in enclosed spaces. Public health educational strategies should encourage limiting human contact with all wild and peridomestic rats and mice, avoiding all contact with rodent excreta, safely disposing of all rodent excreta, and modifying the built environment to deter rodents from colonizing households and workplaces.",['Diaz JH'],2014,166,5,J La State Med Soc,Diaz JH.

OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to identify potential risks for leptospirosis among rice farmers in Khuzestan province, Iran.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Khuzestan, South west Iran, from October to December, 2012. Randomly selected participants were placed in two groups: Rice farmers as cases, and non-farmers as controls. Blood samples obtained from the participants were tested for IgM anti-leptospira antibodies using Serion ELISA classic ESR 125M. The assays were performed and interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions. A questionnaire including variables related to Leptospira spp. exposure was administered to each participant. SPSS software version 16 was employed; Chi square and Fisher's exact tests were used to analyze data.
RESULTS: Of the total 288 samples, 65 (22.5%) were positive for IgM anti-leptospira antibodies. Among the positive samples, 52 (36.1%) were from the case (rice farmer) and 14 (9.7%) from the control groups. There was a significant difference between the case and control groups regarding leptospiral infection (P < 0.0001). Mean age in male and female in the case and control groups were 44.2, 41.9 and 43.5, 41.2 years, respectively (P > 0.05). In the case group, males and those more than 35 years were at a higher risk of infection.

Poor prognostic factors are older age; oliguria; elevated potassium, creatinine and/or bilirubin levels; and altered mental status. We conducted this retrospective study to analyse the predictors of mortality among Indian patients with leptospirosis.
METHODS: Clinical, biochemical, demographic and treatment related data (time between onset of symptoms and commencement of leptospira specific antibiotics) of 101 leptospirosis patients were reviewed. Predictors identified by univariate analysis were analysed by multivariable Cox regression for survival analysis.
RESULTS: Prominent clinical features were: fever (101/101, 100%), jaundice (62, 62.4%), vomiting (42, 41.6%), oliguria (35, 34.7%), cough (18, 17.8%) and dyspnoea (10, 10.0%).

His symptoms improved after antibiotic treatment with penicillin for 14 days. However, recurrent chest pain and progressive dyspnea upon exertion developed 2 months later. A newly developed left ventricular outflow tract pseudoaneurysm was identified by cardiac sonography and multi-detector computed tomography of the heart. A subsequent coronary arteriogram demonstrated an left ventricular (LV) pseudoaneurysm causing compression to both the left circumflex coronary artery and the left anterior descending coronary artery with significant stenosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a LV pseudoaneurysm developing after a clinical course of suspected leptospirosis-related myocardit is causing dynamic compression of the left coronary artery.

25358092,Proteomic features predict seroreactivity against leptospiral antigens in leptospirosis patients.,"With increasing efficiency, accuracy, and speed we can access complete genome sequences from thousands of infectious microorganisms; however, the ability to predict antigenic targets of the immune system based on amino acid sequence alone is still needed. Here we use a Leptospira interrogans microarray expressing 91% (3359) of all leptospiral predicted ORFs (3667) and make an empirical accounting of all antibody reactive antigens recognized in sera from naturally infected humans; 191 antigens elicited an IgM or IgG response, representing 5% of the whole proteome. We classified the reactive antigens into 26 annotated COGs (clusters of orthologous groups), 26 JCVI Mainrole annotations, and 11 computationally predicted proteomic features. Altogether, 14 significantly enriched categories were identified, which are associated with immune recognition including mass spectrometry evidence of in vitro expression and in vivo mRNA up-regulation. Together, this group of 14 enriched categories accounts for just 25% of the leptospiral proteome but contains 50% of the immunoreactive antigens. These findings are consistent with our previous studies of other Gram-negative bacteria. This genome-wide approach provides an empirical basis to predict and classify antibody reactive antigens based on structural, physical-chemical, and functional proteomic features and a framework for understanding the breadth and specificity of the immune response to L. interrogans.","['Lessa-Aquino C', 'Wunder EA', 'Lindow JC', 'Rodrigues CB', 'Pablo J', 'Nakajima R', 'Jasinskas A', 'Liang L', 'Reis MG', 'Ko AI', 'Medeiros MA', 'Felgner PL']",2015,14,1,J Proteome Res,"Lessa-Aquino C, et al.

25356675,Post-translational modification of LipL32 during Leptospira interrogans infection.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a re-emerging disease of global importance caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., is considered the world's most widespread zoonotic disease. Rats serve as asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic Leptospira and are critical for disease spread. In such reservoir hosts, leptospires colonize the kidney, are shed in the urine, persist in fresh water and gain access to a new mammalian host through breaches in the skin.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Previous studies have provided evidence for post-translational modification (PTM) of leptospiral proteins. In the current study, we used proteomic analyses to determine the presence of PTMs on the highly abundant leptospiral protein, LipL32, from rat urine-isolated L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni compared to in vitro-grown organisms. We observed either acetylation or tri-methylation of lysine residues within multiple LipL32 peptides, including peptides corresponding to regions of LipL32 previously identified as epitopes. Intriguingly, the PTMs were unique to the LipL32 peptides originating from in vivo relative to in vitro grown leptospires. The identity of each modified lysine residue was confirmed by fragmentation pattern analysis of the peptide mass spectra. A synthetic peptide containing an identified tri-methylated lysine, which corresponds to a previously identified LipL32 epitope, demonstrated significantly reduced immunoreactivity with serum collected from leptospirosis patients compared to the peptide version lacking the tri-methylation. Further, a subset of the identified PTMs are in close proximity to the established calcium-binding and putative collagen-binding sites that have been identified within LipL32.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The exclusive detection of PTMs on lysine residues within LipL32 from in vivo-isolated L. interrogans implies that infection-generated modification of leptospiral proteins may have a biologically relevant function during the course of infection. Although definitive determination of the role of these PTMs must await further investigations, the reduced immune recognition of a modified LipL32 epitope suggests the intriguing possibility that LipL32 modification represents a novel mechanism of immune evasion within Leptospira.","['Witchell TD', 'Eshghi A', 'Nally JE', 'Hof R', 'Boulanger MJ', 'Wunder EA', 'Ko AI', 'Haake DA', 'Cameron CE']",2014,8,10,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Witchell TD, et al.

25348115,Leptospirosis from water sources.,"Leptospirosis outbreaks have been associated with many common water events including water consumption, water sports, environmental disasters, and occupational exposure. The ability of leptospires to survive in moist environments makes them a high-risk agent for infection following contact with any contaminated water source. Water treatment processes reduce the likelihood of leptospirosis or other microbial agents causing infection provided that they do not malfunction and the distribution networks are maintained. Notably, there are many differences in water treatment systems around the world, particularly between developing and developed countries. Detection of leptospirosis in water samples is uncommonly performed by molecular methods.","['Wynwood SJ', 'Graham GC', 'Weier SL', 'Collet TA', 'McKay DB', 'Craig SB']",2014,108,7,Pathog Glob Health,"Wynwood SJ, et al.

25338815,In-house ELISA screening using a locally-isolated Leptospira in Malaysia: determination of its cut-off points.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira species and is distributed globally. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the serological 'gold standard' for diagnosis of leptospirosis but it is time-consuming and labour-intensive. An alternative serological method that is rapid, sensitive and specific is important for early treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. The use of local Leptospira isolation may improve the sensitivity and specificity of the test because it may varies from one geographical region to another region. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity and cut-off points for an in-house Immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a locally isolated Leptospiral strain IMR/175 as the antigen for the detection of anti-Leptospiral IgM.
METHODS: Serum samples from 270 patients with clinical symptoms of leptospirosis were subjected to the in-house IgM ELISA, MAT and Leptospirosis rapid test. The optimal cut-off values for positivity and negativity of the IgM ELISA were determined by Receiver Operating Characteristic curves and mean ± 2 standard deviation (SD) analyses of the ELISA values.
RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) which indicates the diagnostic performance of the in-house IgM ELISA was 0.953 (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.928, 0.978). The sensitivity and specificity of 90.38% and 87.72% respectively were obtained with the cut-off point of 0.55. A higher sensitivity (96.15%) was obtained when the cut-off point was set at 0.45.
CONCLUSIONS: The in-house IgM ELISA assay using local Leptospira isolation was shown to be sensitive and may be suitable to use for the serological diagnosis of leptospirosis for our local hospital setting.","['Tan XT', 'Amran F', 'Chee Cheong K', 'Ahmad N']",2014,14,,BMC Infect Dis,"Tan XT, et al.

25328621,"Training and service in public health, Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training, 2008 - 2014.","The health workforce is one of the key building blocks for strengthening health systems. There is an alarming shortage of curative and preventive health care workers in developing countries many of which are in Africa. Africa resultantly records appalling health indices as a consequence of endemic and emerging health issues that are exacerbated by a lack of a public health workforce. In low-income countries, efforts to build public health surveillance and response systems have stalled, due in part, to the lack of epidemiologists and well-trained laboratorians. To strengthen public health systems in Africa, especially for disease surveillance and response, a number of countries have adopted a competency-based approach of training - Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP). The Nigeria FELTP was established in October 2008 as an inservice training program in field epidemiology, veterinary epidemiology and public health laboratory epidemiology and management. The first cohort of NFELTP residents began their training on 20th October 2008 and completed their training in December 2010. The program was scaled up in 2011 and it admitted 39 residents in its third cohort. The program has admitted residents in six annual cohorts since its inception admitting a total of 207 residents as of 2014 covering all the States. In addition the program has trained 595 health care workers in short courses. Since its inception, the program has responded to 133 suspected outbreaks ranging from environmental related outbreaks, vaccine preventable diseases, water and food borne, zoonoses, (including suspected viral hemorrhagic fevers) as well as neglected tropical diseases. With its emphasis on one health approach of solving public health issues the program has recruited physicians, veterinarians and laboratorians to work jointly on human, animal and environmental health issues. Residents have worked to identify risk factors of disease at the human animal interface for influenza, brucellosis, tick-borne relapsing fever, rabies, leptospirosis and zoonotic helminthic infections. The program has been involved in polio eradication efforts through its National Stop Transmission of Polio (NSTOP). The commencement of NFELTP was a novel approach to building sustainable epidemiological capacity to strengthen public health systems especially surveillance and response systems in Nigeria. Training and capacity building efforts should be tied to specific system strengthening and not viewed as an end to them. The approach of linking training and service provision may be an innovative approach towards addressing the numerous health challenges.","['Nguku P', 'Oyemakinde A', 'Sabitu K', 'Olayinka A', 'Ajayi I', 'Fawole O', 'Babirye R', 'Gitta S', 'Mukanga D', 'Waziri N', 'Gidado S', 'Biya O', 'Gana C', 'Ajumobi O', 'Abubakar A', 'Sani-Gwarzo N', 'Ngobua S', 'Oleribe O', 'Poggensee G', 'Nsubuga P', 'Nyager J', 'Nasidi A']",2014,18 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,Pan Afr Med J,"Nguku P, et al.

The data on leptospirosis reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) countries/sovereign territories from 2005-2011 were mapped, showing a wide distribution of outbreaks in the region. Tropical terrestrial biomes are the predominate ecosystems showing reports of outbreaks. Climatic and ecological factors were relevant to the occurrence of epidemic outbreaks. The available scientific information from 2002-2014 was summarized to obtain a general overview and identify key issues related to the One Health approach. The primary serological test used for diagnosis and for conducting surveys was the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Reports regarding the isolation and typing of leptospires were scattered and limited to data from a few countries, but their results revealed considerable biodiversity at the species and serovar levels. A total of six out of 11 currently named pathogenic species were found in the region. There was also high diversity of animal species showing evidence of infection by leptospires, including rodents, pets, livestock and wild animals. Prevention and control measures for leptospirosis should consider issues of animal and human health in the context of ecosystems, the territorial land borders of countries and trade.","['Petrakovsky J', 'Bianchi A', 'Fisun H', 'Nájera-Aguilar P', 'Pereira MM']",2014,11,10,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Petrakovsky J, et al.

25325317,Risk factors associated with leptospirosis in dogs from Northern California: 2001-2010.,"The present study was performed to identify risk factors for canine leptospirosis at a tertiary referral institution in northern California from 2001 through 2010 and to describe case characteristics. In this retrospective case-control study, 67 dogs with leptospirosis and 271 controls were evaluated at the William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (Davis, CA) from March, 2001 , through November, 2010. Medical records of cases and controls were analyzed to identify signalment, exposure history, and clinical signs that increased the risk for a diagnosis of leptospirosis. Among cases, most were vomiting and lethargic and had leukocytosis and azotemia. Total white cell count, neutrophil count, and monocyte count were higher in dogs with leptospirosis, whereas the platelet count was lower. Serum concentrations of urea nitrogen, creatinine, and bilirubin were elevated in dogs with leptospirosis as well. On average, case dogs were hospitalized for 11 days and had hospital bills exceeding $5000. Mortality was 13% of case dogs, with the predominant serovar being Pomona. Dogs with leptospirosis were more likely to reside in the central or south coast (odds ratio [OR]=7.33), Sierra Nevada foothills (OR=4.50), San Francisco Bay area (OR=4.2), and north coast (OR=2.85) of California when compared with controls. Dogs 5-10 years old (OR=3.22) or over 10 years old (OR=2.76) and herding (OR=3.1) or hound breed (OR=4.6) dogs were more likely to have leptospirosis than the control group. Leptospirosis was associated with acute renal failure in older, undervaccinated dogs. The regional distribution, large breed predisposition, and finding of predominantly Pomona serovar suggest wildlife or other contacts as an important route of exposure. Knowledge of risk factors, vaccination history, and clinical signs can increase an index of suspicion for leptospirosis and contribute to improved strategies for prevention of leptospirosis in dogs, understanding of the ecology of the disease for all species, and protection of human health.","['Hennebelle JH', 'Sykes JE', 'Foley J']",2014,14,10,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Hennebelle JH, et al.

It occurs almost worldwide but its pattern of transmission varies depending where it happens. Climate change may increase the number of cases, especially in developing countries, like Brazil. Spatial analysis studies of leptospirosis have highlighted the importance of socioeconomic and environmental context. Hence, the choice of the geographical scale and unit of analysis used in the studies is pivotal, because it restricts the indicators available for the analysis and may bias the results. In this study, we evaluated which environmental and socioeconomic factors, typically used to characterize the risks of leptospirosis transmission, are more relevant at different geographical scales (i.e., regional, municipal, and local). Geographic Information Systems were used for data analysis. Correlations between leptospirosis incidence and several socioeconomic and environmental indicators were calculated at different geographical scales. At the regional scale, the strongest correlations were observed between leptospirosis incidence and the amount of people living in slums, or the percent of the area densely urbanized. At the municipal scale, there were no significant correlations. At the local level, the percent of the area prone to flooding best correlated with leptospirosis incidence.","['Gracie R', 'Barcellos C', 'Magalhães M', 'Souza-Santos R', 'Barrocas PR']",2014,11,10,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Gracie R, et al.

Inspite of the availability of modern healthcare facilities tribal people often take herbal medicines and Traditional Knowledge Practitioners (TKPs) serve as the local medical experts in Car Nicobar Island.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was to conduct an ethnomedicinal survey among the TKPs of Nicobarese tribe of the inhabitants of Car Nicobar Island, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Field research was conducted in 15 villages of Car Nicobar Island during March 2011-February 2012. TKPs were interviewed with a questionnaire-guided ethnomedical survey protocol. The data obtained were quantitatively analysed using the informant consensus factor (ICF) and use value (UV). Voucher specimens of all cited plants were collected and deposited at Regional Medical Research Centre (ICMR), Port Blair.
RESULTS: Use of 150 medicinal plant species, belonging to 122 genera encompassing 59 families were recorded during the survey. These 150 species are employed to treat 47 different medicinal uses, divided into nine categories of use. The highest ICF (0.68) was obtained for the gastrointestinal system. The Euphorbiaceae family exhibited the highest number of citations, and the species with the highest UVs were Morinda citrifolia L., Tabernaemontana crispa Roxb. and Colubrina asiatica (L.) Brongn. Of the medicinal plants reported, the most common growth form was shrubs (28%). Among several parts of individual plant species which are used, leaves constitute the major portion in preparation of medicines. Remedies were generally prepared using water as the excipient.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is an attempt to document the use of medicinal plants from the Car Nicobar Island of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Samples were sourced from 399 sheep and 146 beef cattle from a local abattoir. Interlaboratory agreement for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results on urine samples was almost perfect (kappa = 0.90), despite the use of different amplification targets (DNA gyrase subunit B gene vs. 16s ribosomal RNA gene), chemistries (SYTO9 vs. TaqMan probe), and pre-PCR processing. Interlaboratory agreement for microscopic agglutination test (MAT) positivity was almost perfect (kappa = 0.93) for Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo subtype Hardjobovis (Hardjobovis) but moderate (kappa = 0.53) for Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona (Pomona). Among animals that had different titers recorded, higher Hardjobovis and lower Pomona titers were reported by the commercial laboratory than by the research laboratory (P < 0.005). These interlaboratory comparisons can assist researchers and diagnosticians in interpreting the sometimes discrepant test results. Within the research laboratory, the comparison of qPCR results on urine and kidney showed almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.84), suggesting that the qPCR on these 2 specimens can be used interchangeably. The agreement between MAT positivity and urine and kidney qPCR results was fair (kappa = 0.32 and kappa = 0.33, respectively). However, the prevalence ratio of urine and kidney qPCR positivity in Hardjobovis-seropositive versus Hardjobovis-seronegative sheep indicated that Hardjobovis seropositivity found in sheep may be able to predict shedding or renal carriage.","['Fang F', 'Collins-Emerson JM', 'Heuer C', 'Hill FI', 'Tisdall DJ', 'Wilson PR', 'Benschop J']",2014,26,6,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Fang F, et al.

25290923,[Travel-associated pneumonias].,"Respiratory infections are responsible for up to 11% of febrile infections in travellers or immigrants from tropical and subtropical regions. The main pathogens are the same as in temperate climate zones: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, influenza viruses, Legionella pneumophila. However, some pulmonary diseases can be attributed to bacterial, parasitic, viral or fungal pathogens that are endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. The most commonly imported infections are malaria, dengue, and tuberculosis. Pulmonary symptoms and eosinophilia in returning travellers and migrants may be caused by several parasitic infections such as Katayama syndrome, Loeffler syndrome, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, amebiasis, paragonimiasis, echinococcosis, and toxocariasis. In Asia, Tsutsugamushi fever is transmitted by chiggers, spotted fever rickettsiae are transmitted by ticks. Transmission of zoonotic diseases occurs mainly via contact with infected animals or their excretions, human-to-human transmission is generally rare: MERS-CoA (dromedary camels), pulmonary hantavirus infection (rodents), tularemia (rabbits and hares), leptospirosis (rats), Q-fever (sheep and goats), very rarely anthrax (hides of ruminants) and pest (infected rats and wildlife). Inhalation of contaminated dust can cause infections with dimorphic fungi: histoplasmosis (bat guano) and coccidioidomycosis in America and parts of Africa, blastomycosis in America. Some infections can cause symptoms years after a stay in tropical or subtropical regions (melioidosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary hypertension). Noninfectious respiratory diseases caused by inhalation of high amounts of air pollution or toxic dusts may also be considered.",['Geerdes-Fenge HF'],2014,68,10,Pneumologie,Geerdes-Fenge HF.

25276806,The characteristics of ubiquitous and unique Leptospira strains from the collection of Russian centre for leptospirosis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Leptospira, the causal agent of leptospirosis, has been isolated from the environment, patients, and wide spectrum of animals in Russia. However, the genetic diversity of Leptospira in natural and anthropurgic foci was not clearly defined.
METHODS: The recent MLST scheme was used for the analysis of seven pathogenic species. 454 pyrosequencing technology was the base of the whole genome sequencing (WGS).
RESULTS: The most wide spread and prevalent Leptospira species in Russia were L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and L. borgpetersenii. Five STs, common for Russian strains: 37, 17, 199, 110, and 146, were identified as having a longtime and ubiquitous distribution in various geographic areas. Unexpected properties were revealed for the environmental Leptospira strain Bairam-Ali. WGS of this strain genome suggested that it combined the features of the pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains and may be a reservoir of the natural resistance genes. Results of the comparative analysis of rrs and rpoB genes and MLST loci for different Leptospira species strains and phenotypic and serological properties of the strain Bairam-Ali suggested that it represented separate Leptospira species.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the natural and anthropurgic foci supported ubiquitous Leptospira species and the pool of genes important for bacterial adaptivity to various conditions.","['Voronina OL', 'Kunda MS', 'Aksenova EI', 'Ryzhova NN', 'Semenov AN', 'Petrov EM', 'Didenko LV', 'Lunin VG', 'Ananyina YV', 'Gintsburg AL']",2014,2014,,Biomed Res Int,"Voronina OL, et al.

25275630,Identification of cell-binding adhesins of Leptospira interrogans.,"Leptospirosis is a globally distributed bacterial infectious disease caused by pathogenic members of the genus Leptospira. Infection can lead to illness ranging from mild and non-specific to severe, with jaundice, kidney and liver dysfunction, and widespread endothelial damage. The adhesion of pathogenic Leptospira species (spp.), the causative agent of leptospirosis, to host tissue components is necessary for infection and pathogenesis. While it is well-established that extracellular matrix (ECM) components play a role in the interaction of the pathogen with host molecules, we have shown that pathogenic Leptospira interrogans binds to host cells more efficiently than to ECM components. Using in vitro phage display to select for phage clones that bind to EA.hy926 endothelial cells, we identified the putative lipoproteins LIC10508 and LIC13411, and the conserved hypothetical proteins LIC12341 and LIC11574, as candidate L. interrogans sv. Copenhageni st. Fiocruz L1-130 adhesins. Recombinant LIC11574, but not its L. biflexa homologue LBF1629, exhibited dose-dependent binding to both endothelial and epithelial cells. In addition, LIC11574 and LIC13411 bind to VE-cadherin, an endothelial cell receptor for L. interrogans. Extraction of bacteria with the non-ionic detergent Triton X-114 resulted in partitioning of the candidate adhesins to the detergent fraction, a likely indication that these proteins are outer membrane localized. All candidate adhesins were recognized by sera obtained from leptospirosis patients but not by sera from healthy individuals as assessed by western blot. This work has identified bacterial adhesins that are potentially involved in L. interrogans infection of the mammalian host, and through cadherin binding, may contribute to dissemination and vascular damage. Our findings may be of value in leptospirosis control and prevention, with the bacterial adhesins potentially serving as targets for development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.","['Evangelista KV', 'Hahn B', 'Wunder EA', 'Ko AI', 'Haake DA', 'Coburn J']",2014,8,10,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Evangelista KV, et al.

25274745,Diagnostic features in 10 naturally occurring cases of acute fatal canine leptospirosis.,"The current report describes the diagnostic features in 10 cases of acute fatal canine leptospirosis with minimal renal and hepatic changes that may present a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist. Most affected dogs were less than 6 months of age and had a biochemical profile consistent with hepatorenal dysfunction. Clinical signs consisted of vomiting, depression, icterus, dehydration, diarrhea, and anorexia. All dogs died or were humanely euthanized within 3-7 days after the onset of clinical disease. Necropsy findings included pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, icterus, renal and hepatic pallor and swelling, and gastric edema with hemorrhage. Despite severe azotemia, histological changes in the kidneys were subtle in all dogs, and included mild renal tubular simplification, with single-cell necrosis and attenuation, along with minimal interstitial lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, edema, and hemorrhage. Hepatic lesions included scattered hepatocellular single-cell necrosis and hepatocellular dissociation. Prominent extrarenal lesions typically associated with uremia including vascular fibrinoid necrosis in multiple organs, pulmonary mineralization with occasional fibrinosuppurative exudation, and gastric mineralization were also present. Postmortem diagnostic confirmation was based on the detection of leptospiral antigen on fresh renal samples by fluorescent antibody test and on the demonstration of intact spirochetes in sections of kidneys using immunohistochemical staining. Acute fatal canine leptospirosis occurred as a fulminant hepatorenal disease affecting mainly young dogs, and the diagnosis was dependent on the recognition of the subtle renal changes with confirmation via fluorescent antibody testing or immunohistochemical staining.","['Rissi DR', 'Brown CA']",2014,26,6,J Vet Diagn Invest,Rissi DR and Brown CA.

25274622,"Risk factors to incidental leptospirosis and its role on the reproduction of ewes and goats of Espírito Santo state, Brazil.","Ovine and caprine stockbreeding have been gaining attention in developing countries as an attractive investment. On these animals, infectious diseases of the reproductive tract, such as leptospirosis, can compromise the production leading to economic losses. The present study aimed to determine the risk factors associated with incidental leptospirosis and its influence on the reproductive parameters of ewes and goats of Espírito Santo state, Brazil. A total of 737 animals distributed on 24 herds/flocks were studied, and an overall prevalence of 10.9% seroreactive animals was observed. Serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae was the most frequent in goats (97.0%) as well as in ewes (78.3%). Regarding risk factors related to leptospirosis, the presence of waterholes and the semi-intensive breeding system were the most important associated to seroreactivity. Besides, there was an observed association between seroreactivity and reproductive failures (P < 0.05). Moreover, seroreactive ewes (relative risk (RR) = 1.3) and goats (RR = 1.9) presented more chances to have abortions than seronegative animals. Furthermore, seroreactive ewes presented 11.6 more chances of having premature births when compared to the seronegative ones. It can be concluded that Leptospira infection, mainly those caused incidental strains (such as Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup), is a significant factor to reduce the productivity of small ruminants' herds/flocks in the studied region, and environmental measures must be considered on control programs.","['Cortizo P', 'Loureiro AP', 'Martins G', 'do Rodrigues PR', 'Faria BP', 'Lilenbaum W', 'Deminicis BB']",2015,47,1,Trop Anim Health Prod,"Cortizo P, et al.

27175139,Molecular detection of Leptospira spp. in the urine of cattle in northern Iran.,"Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of worldwide distribution, caused by Leptospira interrogans and is considered as an emerging global public health problem. Transmission usually results from direct or indirect exposure to the urine or other body fluids of leptospiruric animals which may become a source of infection for human or other animals. Having a humid climate with plenty of annual rainfall, Guilan province is a suitable environment for maintaining Leptospira spp. Hence, early detection of Leptospira spp. in the host prompts control and protection, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a suitable method. The present report aimed to demonstrate the PCR analysis of bovine urine for detection of leptospiral DNA. A total of 98 urine samples were randomly collected from cattle bladder in Rasht abattoir of Iran and the presence of leptospiral DNA was assayed by PCR amplification of rrs (16S rRNA) gene and the results confirmed by nested PCR. Out of 98 urine samples in 42 samples leptospires DNA was identified with the frequency of 43%. The high presence of the organism in the urine of carriers is a serious threat to the dairy farms and to the public health which requires an effective control measure in the north provinces of Iran.","['Shafighi T', 'Zahraei Salehi T', 'Abdollahpour G', 'Asadpour L', 'Akbarein H', 'Salehzadeh A']",2014,15,4,Iran J Vet Res,"Shafighi T, et al.

25266477,High dose corticosteroids in severe leptospirosis: a systematic review.,"The role of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe leptospirosis is unclear. The rationale for their use is that, in severe leptospirosis, there is a severe immunological response that is harmful to the host resulting in multi-organ dysfunction, which is potentially offset by the nonspecific immunosuppression of high dose steroids. We conducted a systematic review of studies that have assessed the use of high dose corticosteroids in patients with severe leptospirosis by searching MEDLINE and Scopus SciVerse without any language or time restrictions. We identified five studies, including one open randomized clinical trial, which had assessed the use of high dose steroids in severe leptospirosis. Four studies demonstrated a benefit of corticosteroids in treating severe disease with pulmonary involvement when administered early in the course of the disease, but these studies had several methodological constraints as highlighted in the text. Only the randomized controlled trial study showed that corticosteroids are ineffective and may increase the risk of nosocomial infections. There is no robust evidence to suggest that high dose corticosteroids are effective in severe leptospirosis, and a well-designed randomized clinical trial is needed to resolve this.","['Rodrigo C', 'Lakshitha de Silva N', 'Goonaratne R', 'Samarasekara K', 'Wijesinghe I', 'Parththipan B', 'Rajapakse S']",2014,108,12,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,"Rodrigo C, et al.

25265888,"Murine lung injury caused by Leptospira interrogans glycolipoprotein, a specific Na/K-ATPase inhibitor.","BACKGROUND: Leptospiral glycolipoprotein (GLP) is a potent and specific Na/K-ATPase inhibitor. Severe pulmonary form of leptospirosis is characterized by edema, inflammation and intra-alveolar hemorrhage having a dismal prognosis. Resolution of edema and inflammation determines the outcome of lung injury. Na/K-ATPase activity is responsible for edema clearance. This enzyme works as a cell receptor that triggers activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling pathway. Therefore, injection of GLP into lungs induces injury by triggering inflammation.
METHODS: We injected GLP and ouabain, into mice lungs and compared their effects. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for cell and lipid body counting and measurement of protein and lipid mediators (PGE2 and LTB4). The levels of the IL-6, TNFα, IL-1B and MIP-1α were also quantified. Lung images illustrate the injury and whole-body plethysmography was performed to assay lung function. We used Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout mice to evaluate leptospiral GLP-induced lung injury. Na/K-ATPase activity was determined in lung cells by nonradioactive rubidium incorporation. We analyzed MAPK p38 activation in lung and in epithelial and endothelial cells.
RESULTS: Leptospiral GLP and ouabain induced lung edema, cell migration and activation, production of lipid mediators and cytokines and hemorrhage. They induced lung function alterations and inhibited rubidium incorporation. Using TLR4 knockout mice, we showed that the GLP action was not dependent on TLR4 activation. GLP activated of p38 and enhanced cytokine production in cell cultures which was reversed by a selective p38 inhibitor.
CONCLUSIONS: GLP and ouabain induced lung injury, as evidenced by increased lung inflammation and hemorrhage. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing GLP induces lung injury. GLP and ouabain are Na/K-ATPase targets, triggering intracellular signaling pathways. We showed p38 activation by GLP-induced lung injury, which was may be linked to Na/K-ATPase inhibition. Lung inflammation induced by GLP was not dependent on TLR4 activation.","['Gonçalves-de-Albuquerque CF', 'Burth P', 'Silva AR', 'de Moraes IM', 'Oliveira FM', 'Santelli RE', 'Freire AS', 'de Lima GS', 'da Silva ED', 'da Silva CI', 'Morandi V', 'Bozza PT', 'Younes-Ibrahim M', 'de Castro Faria Neto HC', 'de Castro Faria MV']",2014,15,1,Respir Res,"Gonçalves-de-Albuquerque CF, et al.

To identify the causes of this outbreak, a panel of different methods, including traditional pathological, biopathological and parasitological analyses combined with recently developed molecular methods, was used. These novel molecular methods included a multiplex real-time PCR assay to screen for the presence of the most important tick-borne pathogens (piroplasms and anaplasmas), followed by a second species-specific multiplex real-time PCR assay for the identification of Anaplasma-positive samples. The identification of piroplasm-positive samples was carried out by a multiplexed microsphere-based suspension array using a Luminex(®) xMAP technology-based procedure. Anaplasmas and/or piroplasms were detected in 7/10 lambs and 11/13 ewes, with Babesia ovis being detected in 12 of the 23 animals, Theileria ovis in 6 and Anaplasma ovis in 4, both as single and mixed infections. Most of the animals infected with B. ovis had a marked decrease in the values of the red blood cell parameters. Ticks collected from the animals were identified as Riphicephalus bursa, recognised vector of B. ovis. Other haemolytic pathologies (clostridial disease, copper poisoning and leptospirosis) were ruled out and, considering all clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data, babesiosis by B. ovis was diagnosed.

25255143,"Human leptospirosis: seroreactivity and genetic susceptibility in the population of São Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal).","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic and recognized neglected infectious disease. It has been observed that only a proportion of individuals exposed to pathogenic species of Leptospira become infected and develop clinically evident disease. Moreover, little information is available in subsequent reinfections. In the present study, we determine if a first infection with leptospirosis protects against subsequent reinfection, and investigate which of the host genetic factors are involved in the susceptibility and resistance to leptospirosis.
METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: We conducted, in 2011, a retrospective hospital-based case-control study in the São Miguel Island population (Azores archipelago). In order to determine the seropositivity against pathogenic Leptospira after the first episode of leptospirosis, we performed a serological evaluation in 97 unrelated participants diagnosed with leptospirosis between 1992 and 2011. The results revealed that 46.4% of the 97 participants have circulating anti-Leptospira antibodies, and from these participants 35.6% maintained the seroprevalence for the same serogroup. Moreover, three of them were reinfected with unrelated Leptospira serovars. The genetic study was carried out by adding a control group composed of 470 unrelated healthy blood donors, also from São Miguel Island. Twenty five SNPs among twelve innate immune genes - IL1α, IL1β, IL6, IL10, IL12RB1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, CD14, CISH, LTA and TNF - were genotyped, as well as HLA class I (-A and -B) genes. Association analysis indicates that genotypes -511GG (OR=1.6, 95%CI 1.01-2.56, p=0.04) in IL1β, +1196CG (OR=2.0, 95%CI 1.26-3.27, p=0.003) in IL12RB1, -292TA (OR=1.8, 95% CI 1.06-2.1, p=0.03) and +3415CG (OR=1.8, 95% CI 1.08-3.08, p=0.02), both in CISH confer susceptibility to pathogenic Leptospira.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggests some degree of long-term protection against leptospires with an attenuation of symptoms in case of reinfection. Moreover, our data supports the genetic influence of IL1β, IL12RB1 and CISH genes and the susceptibility to leptospirosis infection.","['Esteves LM', 'Bulhões SM', 'Branco CC', 'Mota FM', 'Paiva C', 'Cabral R', 'Vieira ML', 'Mota-Vieira L']",2014,9,9,PLoS One,"Esteves LM, et al.

25252618,"Evaluation of pre-induction temperature, cell growth at induction and IPTG concentration on the expression of a leptospiral protein in E. coli using shaking flasks and microbioreactor.","BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonose that is increasingly endemic in built-up areas, especially where there are communities living in precarious housing with poor or non-existent sanitation infrastructure. Leptospirosis can kill, for its symptoms are easily confused with those of other diseases. As such, a rapid diagnosis is required so it can be treated effectively. A test for leptospirosis diagnosis using Leptospira Immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins is currently at final validation at Fiocruz.
RESULTS: In this work, the process for expression of LigB (131-645aa) in E. coli BL21 (DE3)Star™/pAE was evaluated. No significant difference was found for the experiments at two different pre-induction temperatures (28 °C and 37 °C). Then, the strain was cultivated at 37 °C until IPTG addition, followed by induction at 28°C, thereby reducing the overall process time. Under this condition, expression was assessed using central composite design for two variables: cell growth at which LigB (131-645aa) was induced (absorbance at 600 nm between 0.75 and 2.0) and inducer concentration (0.1 mM to 1 mM IPTG). Both variables influenced cell growth and protein expression. Induction at the final exponential growth phase in shaking flasks with Abs(ind) = 2.0 yielded higher cell concentrations and LigB (131-645aa) productivities. IPTG concentration had a negative effect and could be ten-fold lower than the concentration commonly used in molecular biology (1 mM), while keeping expression at similar levels and inducing less damage to cell growth. The expression of LigB (131-645aa) was associated with cell growth. The induction at the end of the exponential phase using 0.1 mM IPTG at 28 °C for 4 h was also performed in microbioreactors, reaching higher cell densities and 970 mg/L protein. LigB (131-645aa) was purified by nickel affinity chromatography with 91% homogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to assess the effects and interactions of the induction variables on the expression of soluble LigB (131-645aa) using experimental design, with a view to improving process productivity and reducing the production costs of a rapid test for leptospirosis diagnosis.","['Larentis AL', 'Nicolau JF', 'Esteves Gdos S', 'Vareschini DT', 'de Almeida FV', 'dos Reis MG', 'Galler R', 'Medeiros MA']",2014,7,,BMC Res Notes,"Larentis AL, et al.

25249563,"Leptospira mayottensis sp. nov., a pathogenic species of the genus Leptospira isolated from humans.","A group of strains representing species of the genus Leptospira, isolated from patients with leptospirosis in Mayotte (Indian Ocean), were previously found to be considerably divergent from other known species of the genus Leptospira. This was inferred from sequence analysis of rrs (16S rRNA) and other genetic loci and suggests that they belong to a novel species. Two strains from each serogroup currently identified within this novel species were studied. Spirochaete, aerobic, motile, helix-shaped strains grew well at 30-37 °C, but not at 13 °C or in the presence of 8-azaguanine. Draft genomes of the strains were also analysed to study the DNA relatedness with other species of the genus Leptospira. The new isolates formed a distinct clade, which was most closely related to Leptospira borgpetersenii, in multilocus sequence analysis using concatenated sequences of the genes rpoB, recA, fusA, gyrB, leuS and sucA. Analysis of average nucleotide identity and genome-to-genome distances, which have recently been proposed as reliable substitutes for classical DNA-DNA hybridization, further confirmed that these isolates should be classified as representatives of a novel species. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 39.5 mol%. These isolates are considered to represent a novel species, for which the name Leptospira mayottensis sp. nov. is proposed, with 200901116(T) ( = CIP 110703(T) = DSM 28999(T)) as the type strain.","['Bourhy P', 'Collet L', 'Brisse S', 'Picardeau M']",2014,64,Pt 12,Int J Syst Evol Microbiol,"Bourhy P, et al.

A total of 183 samples comprised 113 sera from leptospirosis patients, and 70 sera from other infections and healthy controls were used. The leptospirosis sera were grouped into 2 serum panels, i.e., Group I (MAT+, PCR+) and Group II (MAT+). When inconclusive results were interpreted as positives, both tests showed lower diagnostic sensitivities (≤ 34%) with Group I sera, as compared to Group II sera (Leptorapide®, 93%; VISITECT®-LEPTO, 40%). When inconclusive results were interpreted as negatives, the 2 tests showed ~20% sensitivity with both serum panels. The diagnostic specificity of VISITECT®-LEPTO (94%) was superior to Leptorapide® (69%). Since both tests had misdiagnosed a large proportion of Group I patients and showed many inconclusive results among Group II patients, they have limited diagnostic value in detecting acute leptospirosis.","['Chang CH', 'Riazi M', 'Yunus MH', 'Osman S', 'Noordin R']",2014,80,4,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"Chang CH, et al.

25239730,Does leptospirosis behave adversely in cirrhosis of the liver?,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Leptospirosis, endemic in India, is complicated by jaundice and renal failure. Whether leptospirosis could result in a worsening of preexisting chronic liver disease (CLD) is not known. Aim of the study was to analyze the clinical profile and natural course of leptospirosis in decompensated CLD in comparison to those acquiring the infection in an otherwise healthy individual.
METHODS: Cases were patients with liver cirrhosis who presented with fever and/or jaundice and were screened and found positive for leptospirosis. Controls were patients diagnosed to have leptospirosis during the same period, but in the absence of liver disease. Both cases and controls were followed up until recovery or death.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients had cirrhosis of the liver, and 91 controls had leptospirosis. Significantly more number of cirrhotics had jaundice (87.1 % vs. 16.5 %; p = 0.001), elevated blood urea (41.9 % vs. 18.7 %; p = 0.01), and serum creatinine (41.9 % vs. 19.8 %; p = 0.03) compared to the controls. There were four deaths due to hepatorenal dysfunction and coagulopathy in cirrhotics and no deaths in the control group (4 vs. 0; p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis should be considered as yet another important cause of acute-on-chronic liver failure in endemic areas associated with poor outcome. Death is often due to hepatorenal dysfunction.","['Somasundaram A', 'Loganathan N', 'Varghese J', 'Shivakumar S', 'Jayanthi V']",2014,33,6,Indian J Gastroenterol,"Somasundaram A, et al.

25239006,"Escalating chronic kidney diseases of multi-factorial origin in Sri Lanka: causes, solutions, and recommendations.","During the last two decades, Sri Lanka, located close to the equator, has experienced an escalating incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown aetiology (CKDue) in dry zonal areas. Similar incidences of unusual CKDs have been reported in the dry zonal, agricultural areas of several other equatorial countries. In Sri Lanka, the incidence of CKDue is highest in the North Central Province (NCP), where approximately 45 % of the country's paddy fields are located. However, in recent years, the disease has spread into areas adjacent to as well as distant from the NCP. The cause of CKD in Sri Lanka is unknown, and may likely due to interactions of different potential agents; thus, CKD is of multi-factorial origin (CKD-mfo). These factors include, the negative effects from overuse of agrochemicals. Nevertheless, the potential interactions and synergism between probable agents have not been studied. This systematic review discusses the proposed hypotheses and causes of CKD-mfo in Sri Lanka, and ways to decrease the incidence of this disease and to eradicate it, and provide some recommendations. During the past decade, a number of groups have investigated this disorder using different methodologies and reported various correlations, but failed to find a cause. Research has focussed on the contamination of water with heavy metals, agrochemicals, hard water, algae, ionicity, climate change, and so forth. Nevertheless, the levels of any of the pollutants or conditions reported in water in NPC are inconsistent not correlated with the prevalence of the disease, and are too low to be the sole cause of CKD-mfo. Meanwhile, several nephrotoxins prevalent in the region, including medications, leptospirosis, toxic herbs, illicit alcohol, locally grown tobacco, and petrochemicals, as well as the effects of changed habits occured over the past four decades have not been studied to date. Taken together, the geographical distribution and overall findings indicate that combinations of factors and/or their interactions are likely to precipitate CKD-mfo, which kills more than 5,000 people annually in Sri Lanka; most victims are middle-aged male farmers. Much anecdotal evidence from this region suggests that consumption of contaminated water is the most likely source of this deadly disease. Although the aetiology is unknown, prevention of this ""environmentally acquired"" disease seems relatively straightforward. Solutions include (a) preventing environmental pollution, (b) stopping the irresponsible use and decreasing the usage of agrochemicals, and encouraging the use of environmentally friendly agricultural methods, (c) taking proper precautions when using agrochemicals and safe disposal of their containers, (d) changing the risky behaviour of farmers and educating them to preserve the environment, and (e) providing clean potable water to all affected regions. Implementing a well-coordinated, in-depth, region-wide, broad-based research study together with a long-term effective surveillance programme across the country is essential to curbing this disease. Unless firm actions are taken promptly, more than three million healthy people in the country, live in agricultural regions, are at risk for contracting CKD-mfo and succumb to premature deaths, which are preventable.",['Wimalawansa SJ'],2014,19,6,Environ Health Prev Med,"Wimalawansa SJ.

We report the molecular cloning of a gene encoding a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (LinAhpC) from this bacterium. After bioinformatic analysis we found that LinAhpC contains the characteristic GGIG and YF motifs present in peroxiredoxins that are sensitive to overoxidation (mainly eukaryotic proteins). These motifs are absent in insensitive prokaryotic enzymes. Recombinant LinAhpC showed activity as a thioredoxin peroxidase with sensitivity to overoxidation by H2O2 (Chyp 1% ~30 µM at pH 7.0 and 30°C). So far, Anabaena 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, Helicobacter pylori AhpC, and LinAhpC are the only prokaryotic enzymes studied with these characteristics. The properties determined for LinAhpC suggest that the protein could be critical for the antioxidant defense capacity in L. interrogans.","['Arias DG', 'Reinoso A', 'Sasoni N', 'Hartman MD', 'Iglesias AA', 'Guerrero SA']",2014,77,,Free Radic Biol Med,"Arias DG, et al.

New primers were designed for PCR optimization and evaluation in artificially-infected paraffin-embedded tissues. PCR was then applied to post-mortem, paraffin-embedded samples, followed by amplicon sequencing. The PCR was more efficient than the reported protocol, allowing the amplification of expected DNA fragment from the artificially infected samples and from 44% of the post-mortem samples. The sequences of PCR amplicons from different patients showed >99% homology with pathogenic leptospires DNA sequences. The applicability of a highly sensitive and specific tool to screen histological specimens for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. would facilitate a better assessment of the prevalence and epidemiology of leptospirosis, which constitutes a health problem in many countries.","['Noda AA', 'Rodríguez I', 'Rodríguez Y', 'Govín A', 'Fernández C', 'Obregón AM']",2014,56,5,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,"Noda AA, et al.

25207155,A leptospirosis case presenting with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. While the majority of leptospirosis cases occur in the tropics, some cases are also observed in temperate regions of developing countries. The disease has various clinical presentations ranging from a mild influenza-like form to a severe potentially fatal illness accompanied by multi-organ failure. However, atypical presentations of leptospirosis have occasionally been described. Here, a case of leptospirosis presenting as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is reported.
CASE REPORT: A 58-years-old male presented with fever, oliguria, darkening of urine, and visual hallucinations. Laboratory investigations revealed anaemia, severe thrombocytopaenia, elevated total bilirubin with indirect predominance, high lactate dehydrogenase, and increased urea (293 mg/dL) and creatinine (7.6 mg/dL) levels. He was diagnosed with TTP. Patient was thought leptospirosis due to atypical clinical manifestations. Leptospirosis was confirmed by strongly positive Microscopic Agglutination Test. Patient recovered completely with antibiotics and plasmapheresis.
CONCLUSION: Leptospirosis may be accompanied by thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in particular subtropic regions.","['Sükran K', 'Tatar B', 'Ersan G', 'Topaloğlu S']",2013,30,4,Balkan Med J,"Sükran K, et al.

25201075,Comparative subproteome analysis of three representative Leptospira interrogans vaccine strains reveals cross-reactive antigens and novel virulence determinants.,"UNLABELLED: Pathogenic Leptospira spp. causes leptospirosis in China and throughout the world. Here, we have sequenced two L. interrogans moderately virulent vaccine strains JDL03 (serovar Canicola) and JDL10 (serovar Hebdomadis) used in China. We selected a subproteomic approach to identify surface-exposed proteins including OMPs and extracellular proteins of these two strains plus a highly virulent vaccine strain 56601 (serovar Lai). Comparative surface-exposed proteome among the three strains indicated 81 cores, 61 dispensable and 122 unique surface-exposed proteins. Finally, the 10 highly conserved surface-exposed or subsurface proteins included two known cross-reactive antigens (LipL32 and LA_3469) and another two novel antigens (LA_0136 and LA_0505) displaying conserved immunoreactivity among 15 Chinese epidemic serovars. Furthermore, many potential virulence factors were detected in these identified surface-exposed proteins, such as Loa22, LipL32, LenC, LenF and OmpL37. Interestingly, LipL45, ClpA and ClpB, exhibiting obvious amino acid mutations among str.56601, str.JDL03 and JDL10, might contribute to virulence differences observed among these strains. Additionally, specific surface-exposed proteins in virulent str.56601 were considered to be key virulence determinants, such as Zn-dependent protease, cholesterol oxidase precursor, and so on. In all, we had relatively complete surface-exposed subproteomes of L. interrogans, which will enhance our understanding of leptospiral pathogenesis and key virulence determinants.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present work demonstrates the use of genomic sequencing and subproteomic studies for the identification of potential vaccine and diagnostic antigen candidates against leptospirosis. The data show the conserved surface-exposed proteins to be novel potentially vaccine/diagnostic candidates. Furthermore, the data also show that LipL45, ClpA, ClpB and a lipoprotein from these three strains plus another highly virulent strain Fiocruz L1-130 contain specific amino acid mutations in strains JDL03 and JDL10. The surface-exposed subproteome of pathogenic L. interrogans could provide valuable information to gain a more complete understanding of leptospiral pathogenesis and virulence determinants.","['Zeng LB', 'Zhuang XR', 'Huang LL', 'Zhang YY', 'Chen CY', 'Dong K', 'Zhang Y', 'Cui ZL', 'Ding XL', 'Chang YF', 'Guo XK', 'Zhu YZ']",2015,112,,J Proteomics,"Zeng LB, et al.

Early year ST34 isolates did not appear to have a significant fitness advantage over non-ST34, however, this may have been because a majority of the isolates survived to the termination of the study, with the exception being at high temperature (37°C) and/or basic pH (8.65). Failure to detect a significant fitness advantage of ST34 may be a result of the length of the study or the small sample size.

25198525,Serosurvey for zoonotic viral and bacterial pathogens among slaughtered livestock in Egypt.,"INTRODUCTION: Zoonotic diseases are an important cause of human morbidity and mortality. Animal populations at locations with high risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens offer an opportunity to study viral and bacterial pathogens of veterinary and public health concern.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from domestic and imported livestock slaughtered at the Muneeb abattoir in central Egypt in 2009. Samples were collected from cattle (n=161), buffalo (n=153), sheep (n=174), and camels (n=10). Samples were tested for antibodies against Leptospira spp. by a microscopy agglutination test, Coxiella burnetii by enzyme immunoassay, Brucella spp. by standard tube agglutination, and Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), and sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Antibodies against Leptospira spp. were identified in 64 (40%) cattle, 45 (29%) buffalo, 71 (41%) sheep, and five (50%) camels; antibodies against C. burnetii in six (4%) buffalo, 14 (8%) sheep, and seven (70%) camels; and antibodies against Brucella spp. in 12 (8%) cattle, one (1%) buffalo, seven (4%) sheep, and one (10%) camel. Antibodies against RVFV were detected in two (1%) cattle and five (3%) buffalo, and antibodies against CCHFV in one (1%) cow. No antibodies against SFSV or SFNV were detected in any species.
DISCUSSION: RESULTS indicate that livestock have been exposed to a number of pathogens, although care must be taken with interpretation. It is not possible to determine whether antibodies against Leptospira spp. and RVFV in cattle and buffalo are due to prior vaccination or natural exposure. Similarly, antibodies identified in animals less than 6 months of age may be maternal antibodies transferred through colostrum rather than evidence of prior exposure. RESULTS provide baseline evidence to indicate that surveillance within animal populations may be a useful tool to monitor the circulation of pathogens of veterinary and public health concern in Egypt.","['Horton KC', 'Wasfy M', 'Samaha H', 'Abdel-Rahman B', 'Safwat S', 'Abdel Fadeel M', 'Mohareb E', 'Dueger E']",2014,14,9,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,"Horton KC, et al.

25197035,Leptospirosis in Sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic infection worldwide, possibly due to climate change and demographic shifts. It is regarded as endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa; however, for most countries scarce epidemiological data, if any, exist. The primary objectives were to describe the prevalence of leptospirosis in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to develop options for prevention and control in the future.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to determine the prevalence of leptospirosis in Sub-Saharan Africa; the PRISMA guidelines were followed. Medline/PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, the African Index Medicus, AJOL, and Google Scholar were searched.
RESULTS: Information about the prevalence and incidence of leptospirosis in humans is available, but remains scarce for many countries. Data are unavailable or outdated for many countries, particularly those in Central Africa. Most data are available from animals, probably due to the economic losses caused by leptospirosis in livestock. In humans, leptospirosis is an important cause of febrile illness in Sub-Saharan Africa. It concerns numerous serogroups, harboured by many different animal carriers.
DISCUSSION: A wide variety of data was identified. Prevalence rates vary throughout the continent and more research, especially in humans, is needed to reliably gauge the extent of the problem. Preventive measures need to be reconsidered to control outbreaks in the future.","['de Vries SG', 'Visser BJ', 'Nagel IM', 'Goris MG', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Grobusch MP']",2014,28,,Int J Infect Dis,"de Vries SG, et al.

25185756,First isolation of Leptospira noguchii serogroups Panama and Autumnalis from cattle.,"Prevention and control of leptospirosis are based on the knowledge of locally circulating strains. Thus, efforts to obtain local isolates are paramount to the epidemiological understanding of leptospirosis. We report and discuss here the first isolation of members of serogroups Autumnalis and Panama from cattle, both belonging to Leptospira noguchii species. Urine samples (n = 167) were collected directly by puncture of the bladder from randomly selected cows from a slaughterhouse in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for bacteriological culture. Isolates were characterized by serogrouping and sequencing (rrs and secY genes). Overall, 10/167 positive urine samples (6%) were obtained. Sequencing of amplicons targeting for both rrs and secY genes identified two of them (2013_U73 and 2013_U232) as L. noguchii. Serogrouping of those strains indicated that 2013_U73 belonged to the Panama serogroup (titre 1600), and 2013_U232 to the Autumnalis serogroup (titre 12800). Both Panama and Autumnalis are known agents of incidental leptospirosis in cattle. This group of leptospires could be particularly important in tropical countries. This is the first report of members of serogroups Autumnalis and Panama belonging to L. noguchii species from cattle. Although related to previously reported strains, these isolates have been shown to be genetically diverse from them.","['Martins G', 'Loureiro AP', 'Hamond C', 'Pinna MH', 'Bremont S', 'Bourhy P', 'Lilenbaum W']",2015,143,7,Epidemiol Infect,"Martins G, et al.

It involves an analytical ecological study conducted in the city of Rio de Janeiro in the 2007-2012 period. The variable for the outcome was the number of leptospirosis cases per month, and the independent variable was the average monthly rainfall recorded by the 32 monitoring stations per year. It was decided to model the relationship between cases of leptospirosis and the effects of rain by building a generalized linear model using negative binomial distribution. The rainfall-lag per month was found to be a strong explanatory factor for the number of cases of leptospirosis. This study indicates that the average monthly rainfall may constitute an indicator that enables the execution of actions in order to prepare the health sector for the probable increase in cases of this disease. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the interaction between the work of epidemiological surveillance, especially by situation rooms in periods of crisis, and the risk management teams of environmental surveillance, to increase the response capacity to natural disasters in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro.","['Guimarães RM', 'Cruz OG', 'Parreira VG', 'Mazoto ML', 'Vieira JD', 'Asmus CI']",2014,19,9,Cien Saude Colet,"Guimarães RM, et al.

25183074,Interpretation of microscopic agglutination test for leptospirosis diagnosis and seroprevalence.,"Determination of antibody titer by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) has been used as a tool for leptospirosis diagnosis. Four fold or greater rise in antibody titers between acute and convalescent sera suggests recent Leptospira infection. In addition, results obtained by MAT have been used to predict infecting serovars.

25182718,Seroprevalence of bovine leptospiral antibodies by microscopic agglutination test in Southeast of Iran.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate serological findings of bovine leptospirosis which is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution caused by Leptospira interrogans.
METHODS: One hundred and sixty seven sera were collected from 9 commercial dairy herds in jiroft suburbs, from July to October 2011. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was used to evaluates serological findings of bovine leptospirosis in Jiroft suburb dairy farms, Kerman province, Iran.
RESULTS: Antibodies were found by MAT at least against one serovar of Leptospira interrogans in 29 samples (17.36%) among 167 sera at a dilution 1:100 or higher, and Leptospira pomona was the most prevalent serovar. Positive titers against more than one serovar were detected in 6 sera of the positive samples.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first report of leptospirosis in Southeast Iran and showed that Leptospira pomona was the most and Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae the least prevalent serovars in Southeast Iran.","['Khalili M', 'Sakhaee E', 'Aflatoonian MR', 'Abdollahpour G', 'Tabrizi SS', 'Damaneh EM', 'Hossini-Nasab S']",2014,4,5,Asian Pac J Trop Biomed,"Khalili M, et al.

25172869,"PCR and culture identification of pathogenic Leptospira spp. from coastal soil in Leyte, Philippines, after a storm surge during Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda).","Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. Most of the outbreaks of leptospirosis occur after floods caused by heavy rain in countries where Leptospira spp. are endemic. It has been believed that the overflow of seawater rarely causes outbreaks of leptospirosis because the leptospires are killed by salt water. On 8 November 2013, a storm surge caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) inundated the entire coastal areas of Tacloban and Palo in Leyte, Philippines. The present study was carried out in order to determine whether the environmental leptospires in soil were able to survive after the storm surge in the affected areas. We collected 23 wet soil samples along the coastal areas of Tacloban and Palo 2 months after the storm surge. The samples were suspended in HEPES buffer, and the supernatants were cultured in liquid or semisolid Korthof's medium supplemented with five antimicrobial agents to inhibit the growth of contaminants. Leptospires were isolated from primary cultures of 22 out of 23 samples. The DNA of pathogenic Leptospira species was detected in 11 samples (47.8%) by analysis of flaB by nested PCR. Eventually, two pathogenic Leptospira strains were isolated and showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Leptospira kmetyi. When these isolates were experimentally mixed with soil, they were found to survive in seawater for 4 days. These results show the possibility that leptospires living in soil survived after the storm surge. Our findings may serve as a warning that when seawater inundates the land during a storm surge or a tsunami, an outbreak of leptospirosis could occur in the disaster-stricken area.","['Saito M', 'Miyahara S', 'Villanueva SY', 'Aramaki N', 'Ikejiri M', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Guevarra JP', 'Masuzawa T', 'Gloriani NG', 'Yanagihara Y', 'Yoshida S']",2014,80,22,Appl Environ Microbiol,"Saito M, et al.

Of 641 participants, 600 received doxycycline while 41 did not. Twenty two participants were infected with Leptospira and six developed leptospirosis. Having a laceration wound was significantly associated with leptospiral infection (odds ratio [OR] = 37.20; P < 0.001) and leptospirosis (OR = 18.24; P = 0.003) whereas exposure to flood more than 3 h per day was associated with only leptospiral infection (OR = 3.70; P = 0.038). Seventeen participants who received doxycycline and five who did not, were infected with Leptospira, resulting a protective efficacy of 76.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 34.3%-92.0%). Four who received doxycycline and two who did not, developed leptospirosis, resulting a protective efficacy of 86.3% (CI = -9.8%-98.2%).

25153777,Leptospira interrogans induces uterine inflammatory responses and abnormal expression of extracellular matrix proteins in dogs.,"Leptospira interrogans (L. interrogans), a worldwide zoonosis, infect humans and animals. In dogs, four syndromes caused by leptospirosis have been identified: icteric, hemorrhagic, uremic (Stuttgart disease) and reproductive (abortion and premature or weak pups), and also it caused inflammation. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex mixture of matrix molecules that is crucial to the reproduction. Both inflammatory response and ECM are closed relative to reproductive. The aim of this study was to clarify how L. interrogans affected the uterus of dogs, by focusing on the inflammatory responses, and ECM expression in dogs uterine tissue infected by L. interrogans. In the present study, 27 dogs were divided into 3 groups, intrauterine infusion with L. interrogans, to make uterine infection, sterile EMJH, and normal saline as a control, respectively. The uteruses were removed by surgical operation in 10, 20, and 30 days, respectively. The methods of histopathological analysis, ELISA, Western blot and qPCR were used. The results showed that L. interrogans induced significantly inflammatory responses, which were characterized by inflammatory cellular infiltration and high expression levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in uterine tissue of these dogs. Furthermore, L. interrogans strongly down-regulated the expression of ECM (collagens (CL) IV, fibronectins (FN) and laminins (LN)) in mRNA and protein levels. These data indicated that strongly inflammatory responses, and abnormal regulation of ECM might contribute to the proliferation of dogs infected by L. interrogans.","['Wang W', 'Gao X', 'Guo M', 'Zhang W', 'Song X', 'Wang T', 'Zhang Z', 'Jiang H', 'Cao Y', 'Zhang N']",2014,75,,Microb Pathog,"Wang W, et al.

It is influenced by environmental and socioeconomic factors that affect the occurrence of outbreaks and the incidence of the disease. Critical areas and potential drivers for leptospirosis outbreaks have been identified in Nicaragua, where several conditions converge and create an appropriate scenario for the development of leptospirosis. The objectives of this study were to explore possible socioeconomic variables related to leptospirosis critical areas and to construct and validate a vulnerability index based on municipal socioeconomic indicators. Municipalities with lower socioeconomic status (greater unsatisfied basic needs for quality of the household and for sanitary services, and higher extreme poverty and illiteracy rates) were identified with the highest leptospirosis rates. The municipalities with highest local vulnerability index should be the priority for intervention. A distinction between risk given by environmental factors and vulnerability to risk given by socioeconomic conditions was shown as important, which also applies to the ""causes of outbreaks"" and ""causes of cases"".","['Bacallao J', 'Schneider MC', 'Najera P', 'Aldighieri S', 'Soto A', 'Marquiño W', 'Sáenz C', 'Jiménez E', 'Moreno G', 'Chávez O', 'Galan DI', 'Espinal MA']",2014,11,8,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Bacallao J, et al.

25145397,"HemR is an OmpR/PhoB-like response regulator from Leptospira, which simultaneously effects transcriptional activation and repression of key haem metabolism genes.","Several Leptospira species cause leptospirosis, the most extended zoonosis worldwide. In bacteria, two-component systems constitute key signalling pathways, some of which are involved in pathogenesis. The physiological roles of two-component systems in Leptospira are largely unknown, despite identifying several dozens within their genomes. Biochemical confirmation of an operative phosphorelaying two-component system has been obtained so far only for the Hklep/Rrlep pair. It is known that hklep/rrlep knockout strains of Leptospira biflexa result in haem auxotrophy, although their de novo biosynthesis machinery remains fully functional. Haem is essential for Leptospira, but information about Hklep/Rrlep effector function(s) and target(s) is still lacking. We are now reporting a thorough molecular characterization of this system, which we rename HemK/HemR. The DNA HemR-binding motif was determined, and found within the genomes of saprophyte and pathogenic Leptospira. In this way, putative HemR-regulated genes were pinpointed, including haem catabolism-related (hmuO - haem oxygenase) and biosynthesis-related (the hemA/C/D/B/L/E/N/G operon). Specific HemR binding to these two promoters was quantified, and a dual function was observed in vivo, inversely repressing the hmuO, while activating the hemA operon transcription. The crystal structure of HemR receiver domain was determined, leading to a mechanistic model for its dual regulatory role.","['Morero NR', 'Botti H', 'Nitta KR', 'Carrión F', 'Obal G', 'Picardeau M', 'Buschiazzo A']",2014,94,2,Mol Microbiol,"Morero NR, et al.

Leptospirosis is caused by infection with a spirochete while HFRS is the result of an infection with certain hantaviruses. Both diseases are relatively rare in the Netherlands. Increased incidence of HFRS has been observed since 2007 in countries that border the Netherlands. Since a similar rise in incidence has not been registered in the Netherlands, we hypothesise that due to overlapping clinical manifestations, hantavirus infections may be confused with leptospirosis, leading to underdiagnosis. Therefore, we tested a cohort of non-travelling Dutch patients with symptoms compatible with leptospirosis, but with a negative diagnosis, during 2010 and from April to November 2011. Sera were screened with pan-hantavirus IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Sera with IgM reactivity were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). ELISA (IgM positive) and IFA results were confirmed using focus reduction neutralisation tests (FRNTs).

25135465,Leptospirosis in cattle: a challenging scenario for the understanding of the epidemiology.,"All over the world, leptospirosis has been reported as one of the major causes of reproductive failure in cattle and other ruminants, determining abortions, stillbirth, weak newborns and decrease in their growth rate and milk production. Nevertheless, despite its importance, it is still a challenging disease, from what scarce information about epidemiology, prophylaxis and control is available nowadays. During the last decades of the last century, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in several countries, mainly based on serology. According to those studies, a seroepidemiological scenario has been stated for different regions, where different serovars were reported for cattle. Nevertheless, a huge problem is that, when efforts are made in order to increase the collection of local strains (isolates), it has been demonstrated that the scenario that emerges from those studies contrasts with those previously determined by serology. Despite the large number of serological studies worldwide, the number of isolates is scarce. Isolation technique is a very delicate procedure that needs no contamination, fast processing and long delay to produce a positive result, what may corroborate to the lack of information for the comparison between serology versus bacteriological data, mainly in developing countries. It is noteworthy that the epidemiological scenario now acknowledged may not represent what really occurs in many parts of the world, particularly on those tropical regions where the disease is endemic. Consequently, the current knowledge about epidemiology and control, as well as the available diagnostic tools and the commercial vaccines, may not be adequate for those regions, what leads to a frustrating scenario of endemicity and difficulties on the control of the disease. Without a huge effort in the culturing of local strains, besides the advances on molecular typing, leptospirosis will not be defeated and will probably remain endemic in the developing countries, leading to important economic hazards in animal production and risks to public health in those regions.","['Lilenbaum W', 'Martins G']",2014,61 Suppl 1,,Transbound Emerg Dis,Lilenbaum W and Martins G.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October and November of 2010 on a sample of 254 farmers from eleven irrigation committees in the Alto Mayo Valley. A blood sample was collected as well as sociodemographic, household and labor characteristics in the form of a questionnaire. The presence of antibodies against leptospira was determined using the microscopic agglutination test and the IgM ELISA.
RESULTS: The seroprevalence by agglutination was 64.6% (95% CI: 58.6-70.6). The IgM ELISA test was reactive in 15,0% (95% CI: 10.5-19.5). The most frequent serovar were Icterohaemorrhagiae, Autumnalis, Australis, Panama and Grippotyphosa.

25114040,Development of a real-time PCR for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in California sea lions.,"Several real-time PCR assays are currently used for detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp.; however, few methods have been described for the successful evaluation of clinical urine samples. This study reports a rapid assay for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in California sea lions Zalophus californianus using real-time PCR with primers and a probe targeting the lipL32 gene. The PCR assay had high analytic sensitivity-the limit of detection was 3 genome copies per PCR volume using L. interrogans serovar Pomona DNA and 100% analytic specificity; it detected all pathogenic leptospiral serovars tested and none of the non-pathogenic Leptospira species (L. biflexa and L. meyeri serovar Semaranga), the intermediate species L. inadai, or the non-Leptospira pathogens tested. Our assay had an amplification efficiency of 1.00. Comparisons between the real-time PCR assay and culture isolation for detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in urine and kidney tissue samples from California sea lions showed that samples were more often positive by real-time PCR than by culture methods. Inclusion of an internal amplification control in the real-time PCR assay showed no inhibitory effects in PCR negative samples. These studies indicated that our real-time PCR assay has high analytic sensitivity and specificity for the rapid detection of pathogenic Leptospira species in urine and kidney tissue samples.","['Wu Q', 'Prager KC', 'Goldstein T', 'Alt DP', 'Galloway RL', 'Zuerner RL', 'Lloyd-Smith JO', 'Schwacke L']",2014,110,3,Dis Aquat Organ,"Wu Q, et al.

25112368,Globalization of leptospirosis through travel and migration.,"Leptospirosis remains the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world, commonly found in tropical or temperate climates. While previous studies have offered insight into intra-national and intra-regional transmission, few have analyzed transmission across international borders. Our review aimed at examining the impact of human travel and migration on the re-emergence of Leptospirosis. Results suggest that alongside regional environmental and occupational exposure, international travel now constitute a major independent risk factor for disease acquisition. Contribution of travel associated leptospirosis to total caseload is as high as 41.7% in some countries. In countries where longitudinal data is available, a clear increase of proportion of travel-associated leptospirosis over the time is noted. Reporting patterns is clearly showing a gross underestimation of this disease due to lack of diagnostic facilities. The rise in global travel and eco-tourism has led to dramatic changes in the epidemiology of Leptospirosis. We explore the obstacles to prevention, screening and diagnosis of Leptopirosis in health systems of endemic countries and of the returning migrant or traveler. We highlight the need for developing guidelines and preventive strategies of Leptospirosis related to travel and migration, including enhancing awareness of the disease among health professionals in high-income countries.","['Bandara M', 'Ananda M', 'Wickramage K', 'Berger E', 'Agampodi S']",2014,10,,Global Health,"Bandara M, et al.

25110682,Induction of boosted immune response in mice by leptospiral surface proteins expressed in fusion with DnaK.,"Leptospirosis is an important global disease of human and veterinary concern. Caused by pathogenic Leptospira, the illness was recently classified as an emerging infectious disease. Currently available veterinarian vaccines do not induce long-term protection against infection and do not provide cross-protective immunity. Several studies have suggested the use of DnaK as an antigen in vaccine formulation, due to an exceptional degree of immunogenicity. We focused on four surface proteins: rLIC10368 (Lsa21), rLIC10494, rLIC12690 (Lp95), and rLIC12730, previously shown to be involved in host-pathogen interactions. Our goal was to evaluate the immunogenicity of the proteins genetically fused with DnaK in animal model. The chosen genes were amplified by PCR methodology and cloned into pAE, an E. coli vector. The recombinant proteins were expressed alone or in fusion with DnaK at the N-terminus. Our results demonstrate that leptospiral proteins fused with DnaK have elicited an enhanced immune response in mice when compared to the effect promoted by the individual proteins. The boosted immune effect was demonstrated by the production of total IgG, lymphocyte proliferation, and significant amounts of IL-10 in supernatant of splenocyte cell cultures. We believe that this approach could be employed in vaccines to enhance presentation of antigens of Leptospira to professional immune cells.","['Atzingen MV', 'Rodriguez D', 'Siqueira GH', 'Leite LC', 'Nascimento AL']",2014,2014,,Biomed Res Int,"Atzingen MV, et al.

Humans and other animals become infected when they come in contact with urine from infected animals, either directly or through urine-contaminated surface water. In this study, we screened environmental water on the island of St. Kitts by using a TaqMan based real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting a pathogen specific leptospiral gene, lipl32.

25071771,The Cross-Talk between Spirochetal Lipoproteins and Immunity.,"Spirochetal diseases such as syphilis, Lyme disease, and leptospirosis are major threats to public health. However, the immunopathogenesis of these diseases has not been fully elucidated. Spirochetes interact with the host through various structural components such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), surface lipoproteins, and glycolipids. Although spirochetal antigens such as LPS and glycolipids may contribute to the inflammatory response during spirochetal infections, spirochetes such as Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi lack LPS. Lipoproteins are most abundant proteins that are expressed in all spirochetes and often determine how spirochetes interact with their environment. Lipoproteins are pro-inflammatory, may regulate responses from both innate and adaptive immunity and enable the spirochetes to adhere to the host or the tick midgut or to evade the immune system. However, most of the spirochetal lipoproteins have unknown function. Herein, the immunomodulatory effects of spirochetal lipoproteins are reviewed and are grouped into two main categories: effects related to immune evasion and effects related to immune activation. Understanding lipoprotein-induced immunomodulation will aid in elucidating innate immunopathogenesis processes and subsequent adaptive mechanisms potentially relevant to spirochetal disease vaccine development and to inflammatory events associated with spirochetal diseases.",['Kelesidis T'],2014,5,,Front Immunol,Kelesidis T.

We used NMR spectroscopy to solve the solution structure of the twelfth immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) repeat domain from LigB (LigB-12). The fold is similar to that of other bacterial Ig-like domains and comprised mainly of β-strands that form a β-sandwich based on a Greek-key folding arrangement. Based on sequence analysis and conservation of structurally important residues, homology models for the other LigB Ig-like domains were generated. The set of LigB models illustrates the electrostatic differences between the domains as well as the possible interactions between neighboring domains. Understanding the structure of the extracellular portion of LigB and related proteins is important for developing diagnostic methods and new therapeutics directed toward leptospirosis.","['Ptak CP', 'Hsieh CL', 'Lin YP', 'Maltsev AS', 'Raman R', 'Sharma Y', 'Oswald RE', 'Chang YF']",2014,53,32,Biochemistry,"Ptak CP, et al.

25065690,Preliminary Investigations on the Distribution of Leptospira Serovars in Domestic Animals in North-west Morocco.,"Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis of global importance with a complex epidemiology that affects humans, domestic and wild mammals. However, due to the diversity of clinical signs and difficulties of establishing a confirmatory laboratory diagnosis, the disease remains poorly investigated, particularly in the developing world. In Morocco, a descriptive study of the seroprevalence of Leptospira infection in animals has never been undertaken. To fill this gap, the current study was conducted on a subset of animals in north-west Morocco as a preliminary step towards understanding the epidemiological patterns of animal leptospirosis in the country. The study was conducted on 289 serum samples collected between January and April 2012 from dogs, cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys in the areas of Rabat-Temara, Sidi Kacem and Oulmes. All serum samples were tested by the MAT with 14 reference strains of the most prevalent pathogenic serovars of Leptospira and two serovars of non-pathogenic Leptospira. The overall seroprevalence of Leptospira in cattle, sheep, goats, dogs and donkeys was 15%, 18%, 20%, 21% and 20%, respectively. The most prevalent serogroups found in each species were Ballum, Sejroe, and Australis in cattle, Ballum, Australis and Sejroe in sheep, Australis and Ballum in goats, Javanica and Australis in donkey and Australis, Ballum and Canicola in dogs. Of all the serogroups tested in this study, Icterohaemorrhagiae, the only serogroup which has been previously reported in humans in Morocco, was rarely reactive. The majority of reactive sera were collected from low land areas. A large number of sera samples classified as seronegative when tested against pathogenic leptospires were positive when tested against non-pathogenic leptospires; this is suggestive of possible novel, as yet unclassified, Leptospira serovars in Morocco. Eleven of thirteen sheep urine samples were positive by real-time PCR confirming their role as Leptospira carriers in Morocco.","['Benkirane A', 'Noury S', 'Hartskeerl RA', 'Goris MG', 'Ahmed A', 'Nally JE']",2016,63,2,Transbound Emerg Dis,"Benkirane A, et al.

25062275,Leptospira spp. in rodents and shrews in Germany.,"Leptospirosis is an acute, febrile disease occurring in humans and animals worldwide. Leptospira spp. are usually transmitted through direct or indirect contact with the urine of infected reservoir animals. Among wildlife species, rodents act as the most important reservoir for both human and animal infection. To gain a better understanding of the occurrence and distribution of pathogenic leptospires in rodent and shrew populations in Germany, kidney specimens of 2973 animals from 11 of the 16 federal states were examined by PCR. Rodent species captured included five murine species (family Muridae), six vole species (family Cricetidae) and six shrew species (family Soricidae). The most abundantly trapped animals were representatives of the rodent species Apodemus flavicollis, Clethrionomys glareolus and Microtus agrestis. Leptospiral DNA was amplified in 10% of all animals originating from eight of the 11 federal states. The highest carrier rate was found in Microtus spp. (13%), followed by Apodemus spp. (11%) and Clethrionomys spp. (6%). The most common Leptospira genomospecies determined by duplex PCR was L. kirschneri, followed by L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii; all identified by single locus sequence typing (SLST). Representatives of the shrew species were also carriers of Leptospira spp. In 20% of Crocidura spp. and 6% of the Sorex spp. leptospiral DNA was detected. Here, only the pathogenic genomospecies L. kirschneri was identified.","['Mayer-Scholl A', 'Hammerl JA', 'Schmidt S', 'Ulrich RG', 'Pfeffer M', 'Woll D', 'Scholz HC', 'Thomas A', 'Nöckler K']",2014,11,8,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Mayer-Scholl A, et al.

25061933,Leptospira and leptospirosis in China.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we introduce the epidemiological features, clinical types, laboratory diagnosis, and routine surveillance of leptospirosis in China.
RECENT FINDINGS: Leptospirosis has been prevalent sporadically in China in recent years, but its incidence has decreased, probably due to the lower leptospire-carrying rate in pigs. Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae serovar Lai is the most common pathogen in Chinese leptospirosis patients and Apodemus agrarius is its major animal host. At least 75% of Chinese leptospirosis patients suffer from the mild influenza-like type of leptospirosis that is caused by any serovars of L. interrogans. However, leptospirosis patients with the pulmonary diffuse hemorrhagic type have a high mortality (40-60%). L. interrogans serovar Lai is the causative agent in 75% of the pulmonary diffuse hemorrhagic leptospirosis patients. Several outer membrane protein antigens exist in all the L. interrogans serovars prevailing in China and predominant T- and B-cell combined epitopes in the outer membrane protein antigens have been identified that can be used for developing novel universal leptospirosis vaccines.
SUMMARY: Leptospirosis cases in the Chinese population have gradually decreased in recent years, but it is still an important zoonotic infectious disease. The development of universal vaccines is critical for the prevention and control of leptospirosis.","['Hu W', 'Lin X', 'Yan J']",2014,27,5,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"Hu W, et al.

25058149,Unsuspected leptospirosis is a cause of acute febrile illness in Nicaragua.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemic severe leptospirosis was recognized in Nicaragua in 1995, but unrecognized epidemic and endemic disease remains unstudied.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the burden of and risk factors associated with symptomatic leptospirosis in Nicaragua, we prospectively studied patients presenting with fever at a large teaching hospital. Epidemiologic and clinical features were systematically recorded, and paired sera tested by IgM-ELISA to identify patients with probable and possible acute leptospirosis. Microscopic Agglutination Test and PCR were used to confirm acute leptospirosis. Among 704 patients with paired sera tested by MAT, 44 had acute leptospirosis. Patients with acute leptospirosis were more likely to present during rainy months and to report rural residence and fresh water exposure. The sensitivity of clinical impression and acute-phase IgM detected by ELISA were poor.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospirosis is a common (6.3%) but unrecognized cause of acute febrile illness in Nicaragua. Rapid point-of-care tests to support early diagnosis and treatment as well as tests to support population-based studies to delineate the epidemiology, incidence, and clinical spectrum of leptospirosis, both ideally pathogen-based, are needed.","['Reller ME', 'Wunder EA', 'Miles JJ', 'Flom JE', 'Mayorga O', 'Woods CW', 'Ko AI', 'Dumler JS', 'Matute AJ']",2014,8,7,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"Reller ME, et al.

25051187,Legal aspects of public health: difficulties in controlling vector-borne and zoonotic diseases in Brazil.,"In recent years, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases have become a major challenge for public health. Dengue fever and leptospirosis are the most important communicable diseases in Brazil based on their prevalence and the healthy life years lost from disability. The primary strategy for preventing human exposure to these diseases is effective insect and rodent control in and around the home. However, health authorities have difficulties in controlling vector-borne and zoonotic diseases because residents often refuse access to their homes. This study discusses aspects related to the activities performed by Brazilian health authorities to combat vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, particularly difficulties in relation to the legal aspect, which often impede the quick and effective actions of these professionals. How might it be possible to reconcile the need to preserve public health and the rule on the inviolability of the home, especially in the case of abandoned properties or illegal residents and the refusal of residents to allow the health authority access? Do residents have the right to hinder the performance of health workers even in the face of a significant and visible focus of disease transmission? This paper argues that a comprehensive legal plan aimed at the control of invasive vector-borne and zoonotic diseases including synanthropic animals of public health importance should be considered. In addition, this paper aims to bridge the gap between lawyers and public health professionals and to facilitate communication between them.","['Mendes MS', 'de Moraes J']",2014,139,,Acta Trop,Mendes MS and de Moraes J.

Animal studies were conducted from 24 rodents captured form the market place of the Vellore municipality. In the ZET (Zonal Entomological Team, Vellore) Laboratory the sera were examined by macroscopic slide agglutination test (MSAT). In the MAST, totally 10 positive leptospiral cases from human beings and 10 positive leptospiral cases from rats (Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus) were found out. Then both positive cases of leptospiral vials were labeled, sealed, and sent to the Leptospirosis Research Laboratory, Madhavaram, Chennai, for further serovars examination. Among the various serovars identified autumnalis was more prevalent. Our findings showed that the age groups between 15 and 55 years showed more susceptibility.
