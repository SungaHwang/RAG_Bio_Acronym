37832273,"The Impact of Depression, Anxiety and Personality Disorders on the Outcome of Patients with Functional Limb Weakness - Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.","OBJECTIVE: Psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and personality disorders are common in patients with functional limb weakness/paresis (FND-par). The impact of these conditions on the prognosis of FND-par has not been systematically reviewed. The aim of this study was to identify a potential prognostic effect of comorbid depression, anxiety, and/or personality disorder on prognosis in patients with FND-par.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify studies that reported measures of baseline depression, anxiety, and/or personality disorder, and physical disability. An individual patient data meta-analysis was subsequently performed.
RESULTS: Eight studies comprising 348 individuals were included (7 prospective cohorts; 1 case-control study). There was heterogeneity in sample size, follow-up duration, and treatment modality. Depression and anxiety were present in 51.4% and 53.0% of FND-par patients, respectively. In individuals whose FND-par improved, there was no significant difference between those with versus without depression (52.6% vs 47.4%, p = 0.69) or those with versus without anxiety (50.3% vs 49.7%, p = 0.38). Meta-analysis showed no clear impact of baseline depression or anxiety per se [pooled OR for depression 0.85 (95%CI 0.50-1.45; p = 0.40) and anxiety 0.84 (95%CI 0.51-1.38; p = 0.91)]; and of depression or anxiety severity [pooled OR for depression 1.23 (95%CI 0.63-2.39; p = 0.91) and anxiety 1.40 (95%CI 0.70-2.78; p = 0.58)] on FND-par outcome. Insufficient data were available to assess the impact of personality disorders.
CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that depression or anxiety influenced outcome in FND-par. Large-scale, prospective studies in FND-par, and other FND subtypes, are needed to fully contextualize the impact of concurrent mental health concerns on outcomes.","['Calma AD', 'Heffernan J', 'Farrell N', 'Gelauff J', ""O'Connell N"", 'Perez DL', 'Perriman D', 'Smyth L', 'Stone J', 'Lueck CJ']",2023,175,,J Psychosom Res,"Calma AD, et al.

37807866,Factitious disorder comorbid with borderline personality disorder and dysthymia: from medically unexplained physical symptoms to functional neurological disorder.,"INTRODUCTION: In this study, we introduce the concept of comorbidity between factitious disorder (FD), borderline personality disorder (BPD), dysthymia (DY), medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) characterising patients who may tend to exaggerate physical or psychiatric symptoms of presentation to a general or psychiatric hospital with a constellation of signs that do not receive confirmation from further clinical and instrumental assessments. The similarities between these syndromes and the constant presence of borderline personality in the psychopathology make it the possible link between all these syndromes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors captured the typical appearance and characterisation of FD-BPD-DY-MUPS-FND (Com-1) syndrome in adult and non-forensic acute psychiatric hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK) and adjacent liaison psychiatric teams through case vignettes. Each case vignette merged similar clinical cases and was cross-analysed using information from various mental health and medical professionals and bridging primary and secondary carers' records.
RESULTS: The findings suggest striking similarities between the syndromes making borderline personality the bridge pathology for FD, MUPS and FND. The complexity of the diagnosis of these cases is discussed in the study, together with prototypical presentations.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving the management of these often-occurring diseases requires multidisciplinary coordination across psychiatry, general care, neurology and surgery departments.","['Lazzari C', 'Shoka A', 'Rabottini M']",2023,58,5,Riv Psichiatr,"Lazzari C, et al.

37807390,B - 13 A Written Stutter: a Case Study of Functional Neurologic Disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: Functional neurologic disorder (FND) is a broad diagnostic construct that encompasses many heterogeneous conditions. The defining characteristic of FND is that the affected individual experiences symptoms for which there is no known biological mechanism. Often the symptoms are attributed to psychological factors. FND remains poorly understood, despite increased efforts to elucidate neural and neuropsychological correlates. To date, there have been only a few case studies published on acute onset of dysfluent writing that does not result in dysgraphia and is not associated with a major neurological event (i.e., stroke, or traumatic brain injury).
METHODS: A 17-year-old, right-handed, White, cis-gender boy was referred to an outpatient neuropsychology private practice with a complaint of acute onset and progressive dysfluent and effortful writing without dysgraphia. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation was undertaken, and the patient's mother served as a collateral informant.
RESULTS: Performance was grossly within normal limits with mild impairment in fine motor coordination. The patient evidenced a slowed, effortful writing style marked by initial hesitation followed by a smooth fluid motion. Clinical interview and measures of psychological functioning did not reveal any psychiatric conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Parallels are drawn between this dysfluent writing style, which does not cause functional impairment, and a stutter. Neuroanatomical mechanisms are explored.","['Gramling L', ""O'Connell EI"", 'Peery S']",2023,,,Arch Clin Neuropsychol,"Gramling L, et al.

37807211,A - 80 The Role of Adverse Childhood Events and Personality Traits Among Individuals with Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FND).,"OBJECTIVE: There is an established link between early life trauma and avoidant and anxious attachment in patients with FND.1,2,3 These attachment styles are linked to histrionic (HPD), avoidant (APD), borderline (BPD), and dependent personality disorders (DPD)0.5 The current study seeks to explore the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and personality characteristics among individuals diagnosed with FND.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with FND who completed neuropsychological evaluation was conducted. The outcome measures include the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACES) and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, 3rd Edition (MMPI-3). Composite scores for the ACES and BPD, HPD, APD, and DPD were obtained by calculating equally weighted sum of predetermined component scores on the MMPI-3 based on the DSM-5.6 Spearman correlations were calculated to determine the association between ACES and PD composites.
RESULTS: Analysis was conducted with 21 patients, 86% were female, 71% identified as white, and mean sample age was 41.59 years (SD = 12.48). 57.14% had elevated ACES score. Mean composite PD scores were BPD - 55.97 (SD = 7.58), HPD - 53.93 (SD = 9.17), APD - 59.26 (SD = 9.71), and DPD - 59.75 (SD = 10.80). The correlations were positive and statistically significant (p < =0.05) across all four PD for ACES Q1 (emotional abuse) and Q4 (unsupportive environment).
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight that the ACES can be beneficial in identifying patients with FND who may have, or are at risk, of developing PD. These results also provide targets for treatment including maladaptive attachment styles.","['Carns D', 'Orr S', 'Jain R', 'Israel A', 'Rupert P']",2023,,,Arch Clin Neuropsychol,"Carns D, et al.

37800641,Functional neurological disorder: A qualitative study exploring individuals' experiences of psychological services.,"OBJECTIVES: Individuals with a diagnosis of FND report experiencing stigma in medical settings, however, there is a paucity of research exploring their experiences in psychological services. The aim of this research was to explore experiences of accessing UK psychological services, from the perspective of those with FND.
METHODS: This study utilised a qualitative approach with data collected from semi-structured interviews (n = 15) and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: One superordinate theme, 'the stigmatised self within the therapeutic relationship', and five interrelated subthemes were identified: 'internalised stigma and self-doubt', 'selective disclosure to professionals', 'perceptions of psychological explanations', 'having to educate the professionals' and 'attunement and trust within the therapeutic relationship'. Positive therapeutic relationships were perceived to mitigate the impact of these perceived barriers. The conceptualisation of FND and the perception of how this was responded to by services and professionals was a central tenet throughout the related themes.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-personal, interpersonal and organisational stigma impact access and engagement to psychological treatment. The findings of this study highlight the need for increased training provision for practitioners with a focus on actively challenging FND stigma within services at both an individual and systemic level.","['Staton A', 'Dawson D', 'Merdian H', 'Tickle A', 'Walker T']",2023,,,Psychol Psychother,"Staton A, et al.

37794883,Myths and facts about functional neurological disorders: a cross-sectional study of knowledge and awareness among medical students and healthcare professionals in Iraq.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a complex condition with neurological symptoms but no clear structural or biochemical explanation. Myths and misconceptions about FND can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. This study aimed to assess knowledge and common myths about FND among medical students and practitioners.
METHODS: Data were collected from 324 participants using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire included demographics, general information about FND and myths about FND. Data were analysed using non-parametric tests and Spearman's r for correlations.
RESULTS: The majority of participants were clinical-years medical students (65.1%) and female (59.6%). Overall, knowledge about FND was limited, with a mean score of 42.3% of correct answers. Common myths included the belief that FND is a psychological disorder and that patients feign symptoms. Knowledge scores differed significantly among different grades/experience levels, with postgraduate practitioners having the highest scores. There was a positive correlation between knowledge scores and confidence in managing FND.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prevalence of myths and misconceptions about FND among medical students and practitioners, emphasising the need for accurate education to improve diagnosis and management. Healthcare professionals should take a biopsychosocial approach to FND, considering the complex interplay between biological, psychological and social factors. Efforts to increase awareness and reduce stigma associated with FND are crucial for promoting better care. Targeted educational interventions may be beneficial to improve the understanding and management of FND among medical professionals.","['Al-Sibahee EM', 'Hashim A', 'Al-Badri S', 'Al-Fatlawi N']",2023,5,2,BMJ Neurol Open,"Al-Sibahee EM, et al.

However, significant clinical complexities remain. ""Rule in"" signs - while critical for making a positive diagnosis - do not equate to a personalized treatment plan in many instances. Here, we propose that the neuropsychiatric assessment and real-time development of a work-in-progress biopsychosocial clinical formulation aids the development of a patient-centered outpatient treatment plan. This precision medicine approach is based on the literature, expert opinions and our clinical experience working in an interdisciplinary FND service.","['Perez DL', 'Finkelstein S', 'Adams C', 'Saxena A']",2023,41,4,Neurol Clin,"Perez DL, et al.

37724767,Objective and subjective neurocognitive functioning in functional motor symptoms and functional seizures: preliminary findings.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to provide a preliminary assessment of objective and subjective neurocognitive functioning in individuals with functional motor symptoms (FMS) and/or functional seizures (FS). We tested the hypotheses that the FMS/FS group would display poorer objective attentional and executive functioning, altered social cognition, and reduced metacognitive accuracy.
METHOD: Individuals with FMS/FS (n = 16) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 17) completed an abbreviated CANTAB battery, and measures of intellectual functioning, subjective cognitive complaints, performance validity, and comorbid symptoms. Subjective performance ratings were obtained to assess local metacognitive accuracy.
RESULTS: The groups were comparable in age (p = 0.45), sex (p = 0.62), IQ (p = 0.57), and performance validity (p-values = 0.10-0.91). We observed no impairment on any CANTAB test in this FMS/FS sample compared to HCs, although the FMS/FS group displayed shorter reaction times on the Emotional Bias task (anger) (p = 0.01, np2 = 0.20). The groups did not differ in subjective performance ratings (p-values 0.15). Whilst CANTAB attentional set-shifting performance (total trials/errors) correlated with subjective performance ratings in HCs (p-values<0.005, r
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a discordance between objective and subjective neurocognitive functioning in this FMS/FS sample, reflecting intact test performance alongside poorer subjective cognitive functioning.

37717461,Functional neurological seizures and migraine: A systematic review and case series.,"BACKGROUND: The seizure subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND-seizures) is a common neuropsychiatric condition manifesting with episodic epilepsy-like events. Despite the common belief that FND-seizures are precipitated by psychological stressors, neurological disorders may also be triggers. In 1890, Babinski described four cases of FND symptoms associated with migraine attacks. Despite the passing of more than 130 years since this first clinical observation, the relationship between FND-seizures and migraine is not fully elucidated.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To complete a systematic review of the literature that investigated potential associations between FND-seizures and migraine and the response of FND seizures to treatment with migraine prophylactic medications (2). To undertake a retrospective study of patients with FND-seizures and migraine, including response to migraine prophylaxis.
METHODS: (1) Using PRISMA methods, we completed a systematic review of EMBASE and Scopus databases from inception to March 31, 2021, for literature on FND-seizures and migraine. (2) Our multi-disciplinary team, including subspecialists in psychosomatic medicine, epilepsy, and headache disorders, reviewed consecutive patients diagnosed with FND-seizures and migraine to assess potential causal associations and responses to standard migraine prophylactic medications.
RESULTS: (1) The search yielded seven studies from 126 screened manuscripts (N = 1,186 patients with FND-seizures; mean age 38.7 years; 72.6% female). They varied substantially in design, population, diagnostic measures, and outcomes. Nevertheless, all studies found associations between FND-seizures and migraine, which were stronger than those between epileptic seizures and migraine in comparative investigations, but provided limited information on treatment response. (2) In our case series, investigators reached unanimous consensus that migraine attacks triggered FND-seizures in 28/43 (65.1%) patients reviewed (mean age, 38.8 years; 74% female). In 19/26 (73%) patients with adequate follow-up data, treatment with migraine prophylactic medications alone (no behavioral interventions) concomitantly reduced FND-seizure and headache frequency by >50%.
CONCLUSION: Our systematic review and case series indicate that migraine attacks may trigger FND-seizures, perhaps more often that currently understood, and suggest that migraine prophylaxis may reduce FND-seizure frequency in such cases. To validate these observations, fully powered prospective investigations are required.","['Duque L', 'Garza I', 'Cascino GD', 'Staab JP']",2023,147,,Epilepsy Behav,"Duque L, et al.

37697728,Healthcare employment as a risk factor for functional neurological disorder: A case-control study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Female gender, younger age and stressful life events are known predisposing factors for functional neurological disorders (FNDs). Employment in a healthcare profession has also been suggested to be a predisposing factor. We set out to conduct a large-scale case-control study to estimate the rate employment in a healthcare profession among people with FND.
METHODS: We included 200 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of FND, referred to our clinic at University Hospital Bern Switzerland between October 1, 2016, and August 1, 2019. In addition, we included a control group of 200 patients with a confirmed neurological disorder, matched for age and gender, seen during the same period. The primary endpoint was to compare the prevalence of healthcare professionals between the groups. We also describe the clinical manifestations and concomitant psychiatric diagnoses in the FND cohort.
RESULTS: Female gender was predominant (70%), and the participants' mean age was 37 years. The proportion of healthcare professionals in the FND patients was 18% (33/186), which was significantly higher than in the control group, in which it was 10.6% (17/189; p = 0.019, 95% confidence interval odds ratio 1.168-4.074). Most healthcare professionals in both cohorts were nurses (21/33 among FND patients, 10/17 among controls). Among FND patients, 140 (70%) had motor symptoms and 65 (32.5%) had a concomitant psychiatric diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: This case-control study confirmed a higher rate of employment in healthcare professions in patients with FND, suggesting two potential mechanisms of FND: exposure to models/specific knowledge about neurological symptoms or stress-related professional factors. This warrants further studies on underlying mechanisms and prevention.","['Vanini G', 'Bühler J', 'Weber S', 'Steinauer M', 'Aybek S']",2023,,,Eur J Neurol,"Vanini G, et al.

37695443,The Financial Burden of Functional Neurological Disorders.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common and severely debilitating condition lacking clinical ownership, existing between neurology and psychiatry. This article reports the findings of recent research investigating the economic costs of FND diagnosis and management. We define what the costs are, why they exist, and suggest actionable steps to reduce them.
RECENT FINDINGS: The financial burden of FND exists across the globe characterized by high healthcare utilization resulting in exorbitant direct and indirect costs for the patient, healthcare system, and society. Inadequate medical education and stigmatization of the disorder prolong the time to diagnosis, during which cyclical utilization of inpatient and emergency department services drive up costs. Despite being cost-effective, lack of accessible treatment compounds the issue, leaving patients without a reliable exit. Recent findings support an increased awareness and the need for a cultural shift to overcome the financial burden associated with this underserved population.","['Watson M', 'Woodward J', 'Strom LA']",2023,23,10,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,"Watson M, et al.

These factors may increase the risk of developing functional neurologic disorder (FND). If the risk of FND is increased in TGNC youth, then identifying which youth are at increased risk, and the particular times when risk is increased, may allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment of FND. Better awareness of functional symptoms among clinicians who care for TGNC youth may prevent disruption of gender-affirming care if FND symptoms emerge. Patients diagnosed with FND who are TGNC may require different forms of intervention than other youth with FND. We present 4 cases from our multidisciplinary pediatric FND program of TGNC youth who developed FND. In all individuals for whom follow-up information was available, access to gender-affirming health care was associated with marked improvement or resolution of FND symptoms.","['Wilkinson-Smith A', 'Lerario MP', 'Klindt KN', 'Waugh JL']",2023,,,J Child Neurol,"Wilkinson-Smith A, et al.

37649944,Functional Neurological Disorder Overlapping Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia Confirmed by Genetic Diagnosis.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) may mimic various kinds of neurologic diseases and may coexist with other neurologic disorders. In cases overlapped by FND, it might be challenging to distinguish symptoms induced by FND and those induced by other underlying neurological disorders, especially when patients show no positive signs indicative of FND. Here, we present the case of a patient who was genetically diagnosed with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD). However, most of the patient's symptoms were considered to indicate FND. To our knowledge, there are no reports of FND overlapping PKD. This case illustrates the possibility that FND can coexist with and mimic symptoms of other diseases. It is necessary to rule out coexisting FND symptoms that may modify clinical presentations that cannot simply be explained by a recognized neurological disease.","['Ohira M', 'Osada T', 'Kimura H', 'Sano T', 'Takao M']",2023,15,7,Cureus,"Ohira M, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the occurrence of FND in a population with persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) and the associations between FND and depression as well as anxiety in participants with PPCS.
METHODS: Sixty-three individuals with PPCS presenting to a specialized brain injury clinic completed the following questionnaires: screening for somatoform disorder conversion disorder subscale (SOM-CD), Rivermead post-concussion symptom questionnaire (RPQ), patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire- 7 (GAD-7). Both multiple linear regression and logistic regression were conducted to evaluate the relationship between questionnaires and adjust for covariates.
RESULTS: We found that total RPQ score (βˆ= 0.27; 95% CI = [0.16, 0.38]), GAD-7 score (βˆ= 0.71; 95% CI = [0.50, 0.92]) and PHQ-9 score (βˆ= 0.54; 95% CI = [0.32, 0.76]) were positively associated with SOM-CD score individually, after consideration of other covariates. Participants meeting the criteria for severe FND symptoms were 4.87 times more likely to have high PPCS symptom burden (95% CI = [1.57, 22.84]), 8.95 times more likely to have severe anxiety (95% CI = [3.31, 35.03]) and 4.11 times more likely to have severe depression symptom burden (95% CI = [1.77, 11.53]).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate an association between FND and post-concussion symptoms as well as an association between FND and symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with PPCS. Patients with PPCS should be screened for FND to provide a more targeted treatment approach that includes somatic-focused interventions.","['Jobin K', 'Wang M', 'du Plessis S', 'Silverberg ND', 'Debert CT']",2023,53,2,NeuroRehabilitation,"Jobin K, et al.

37599546,Speech and language therapy: A treatment case series of 20 patients with functional speech disorder.,"BACKGROUND: While expert consensus recommendations support the use of speech and language therapy (SLT) for patients with functional speech disorder (FND-speech), there are limited published data on clinical outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively report the treatment outcomes and clinical characteristics of patients with FND-speech that attended outpatient SLT as part of a multidisciplinary program for functional neurological disorder (FND).
METHODS: In this case series, we included adult patients with FND-speech that consecutively participated in outpatient SLT at our institution between October 2014 and September 2021. Baseline demographic and neuropsychiatric characteristics were extracted from the medical records, along with data on FND-speech phenotypes, number of treatment sessions received, and clinician-determined outcomes. Only descriptive statistics were used to report findings.
RESULTS: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria; ages ranged from 21-77, with a mean of 51.6±16.2 years. 85% of the cohort presented with mixed FND-speech symptoms. Patients attended a range of 2-37 visits, with an average of 9.2±8.0 visits over 4.4±3.5 months. At the last treatment session, 3 patients were asymptomatic, 15 had improved, and 2 had not improved; 8 individuals that improved received video telehealth interventions.
CONCLUSION: This case series lends additional support for outpatient SLT in the assessment and management of individuals with FND-speech, and may help clarify patient and provider treatment expectations. Additional prospective research is needed to investigate baseline predictors of treatment response and further define the optimal frequency, intensity, duration, and clinical setting for SLT delivery in this population.","['Goldstein AN', 'Paredes-Echeverri S', 'Finkelstein SA', 'Guthrie AJ', 'Perez DL', 'Freeburn JL']",2023,53,2,NeuroRehabilitation,"Goldstein AN, et al.

37593273,Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder: A Continuing Conundrum for the Perioperative Physician.,"Functional neurological symptom disorder (FNSD) or functional neurological disorder (FND) or conversion disorder, is a syndrome of neurological complications unexplained by neuropathology. The term FNSD or FND is now preferred, as conversion disorder is not an etiologically neutral term and is thus falling from use by researchers and clinicians in the field. We report a case of new-onset postoperative neurological deficit in a patient who had undergone uneventful general anesthesia for a urology procedure. Postoperatively, in the post-anesthesia care unit, the patient was found to be unable to move her upper and lower limbs. Organic pathology was excluded and a diagnosis of FNSD was made. Four weeks after the surgery, the patient was only able to ambulate with the help of a mechanical walker device. It is now suggested that procedures involving anesthesia are relatively common triggers for the development of FNSD. The occurrence of FNSD in the postoperative period is increasingly being attributed to the effects of anesthesia, the hypothesis being that it arises from the abreactive or dissociative effects of anesthetic agents. Another theory is the vulnerability of the anesthetized state which may evoke previous traumatic experiences. Psychiatric co-morbidities such as anxiety and depression may be seen in these patients. Preoperative psychological assessment may help identify patients at risk for FNSD. If postoperative neurological deficit occurs, detailed neurological, metabolic, and psychiatric assessments should be done with FNSD being a diagnosis of exclusion. We present this case to increase awareness regarding this uncommon condition which can cause significant distress to the patient and healthcare team. Management should comprise honest disclosure, reassurance of recovery, and reinforcement of alternative coping strategies. The development of preoperative screening tools may help identify patients at risk for this disorder.","['Chin P', 'Kumaraswami S']",2023,15,7,Cureus,Chin P and Kumaraswami S.

37520227,Psychiatrists' attitudes towards functional neurological disorders: results from a national survey.,"INTRODUCTION: Functional neurological disorder (FND) presents motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms characterized by clinical signs incongruent with known neurological disease. Together with other health professionals, like neurologists, psychiatrists can play an essential role in diagnosing and managing these disorders. Hence, understanding their opinion and clinical experience with FND is of utmost importance to catch potential educational needs and improve healthcare services for patients. This study aims at assessing the knowledge, opinion, and clinical approach of Italian psychiatrists to FND.
METHODS: Members of the Italian Society of Psychiatry completed a 14-item web-based survey investigating their approach to FND. Results. Overall, 174 questionnaires were completed. Our main findings suggest that Italian psychiatrists have a psychogenetic conceptualization of FND. ""Conversion disorders"", in fact, is the term most frequently used by Italian psychiatrists to refer to FND, thus implying a psychological etiology of these disorders. Congruently with this view, psychotherapy associated with pharmacological therapy is considered the most appropriate treatment by psychiatrists, while physiotherapy is an under-recognized treatment option for FND.
DISCUSSION: The present study highlights that a psychogenetic view of FND dominates among Italian psychiatrists. This could be due to out-of-date knowledge about the pathophysiology of this group of disorders. Promoting education about novel approaches to FND would be of crucial importance to improving care for patients suffering from this condition.","['Marotta A', 'Lasalvia A', 'Fiorio M', 'Zanalda E', 'Di Sciascio G', 'Palumbo C', 'Papola D', 'Barbui C', 'Tinazzi M']",2023,14,,Front Psychiatry,"Marotta A, et al.

37516011,Interoception in functional motor symptoms and functional seizures: Preliminary evidence of intact accuracy alongside reduced insight and altered sensibility.,"Altered interoception may be a pathophysiological mechanism in functional neurological disorder (FND). However, findings have been inconsistent across interoceptive dimensions in FND including functional motor symptoms (FMS) and seizures (FS). Here, individuals with FMS/FS (n = 17) and healthy controls (HC, n = 17) completed measures of interoceptive accuracy and insight (adapted heartbeat tracking task [HTT] with confidence ratings), a time estimation control task (TET) and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness-2 (MAIA-2) to assess interoceptive sensibility. The groups did not differ in interoceptive accuracy (p = 1.00, g = 0.00) or confidence (p = .99, g = 0.004), although the FMS/FS group displayed lower scores on the ""Not-Distracting"" (p < .001, g = 1.42) and ""Trusting"" (p = .005, g = 1.17) MAIA-2 subscales, relative to HCs. The groups did not differ in TET performance (p = .82, g = 0.08). There was a positive relationship between HTT accuracy and confidence (insight) in HCs (r = .61, p = .016) but not in FMS/FS (r = 0.11, p = .69). HTT confidence was positively correlated with MAIA-2 ""Self-Regulation"" (r = 0.77, p = .002) and negatively correlated with FND symptom severity (r = -0.84, p < .001) and impact (r = -0.86, p < .001) in FMS/FS. Impaired interoceptive accuracy may not be a core feature in FMS/FS, but reduced insight and altered sensibility may be relevant. Reduced certainty in self-evaluations of bodily experiences may contribute to the pathogenesis of FND symptoms.","['Millman LSM', 'Short E', 'Stanton B', 'Winston JS', 'Nicholson TR', 'Mehta MA', 'Reinders AATS', 'Edwards MJ', 'Goldstein LH', 'David AS', 'Hotopf M', 'Chalder T', 'Pick S']",2023,168,,Behav Res Ther,"Millman LSM, et al.

37505203,Functional neurological disorder: A common reason for a neurology inpatient referral.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In 2021, the European Academy of Neurology's training requirements were updated to include functional neurological disorder (FND) as a core topic for the first time. To reinforce these changes, we aimed to understand the proportion of inpatients (in non-neurology settings) who are diagnosed with FND.
METHODS: We prospectively collected data on diagnoses made after inpatient ward reviews from neurology trainees at three tertiary neurology centres in Scotland from April to September 2021. We assessed healthcare utilization data for patients with a diagnosis of FND, epilepsy and epileptic seizures, or a neuroinflammatory disorder over the preceding 12 months.
RESULTS: There were 437 inpatient reviews for 424 patients by 13 trainees. The largest single diagnosis was FND (n = 80, 18%), followed by epilepsy (n = 64, 14%), primary headache disorder (n = 40, 9%) and neuroinflammatory disorders (n = 28, 6%). There was an uncertain diagnosis for 48 reviews (11%). Compared to patients with epilepsy or neuroinflammatory disorders, patients with FND had a similar number of admissions (2 vs. 2 vs. 1) and brain/spine imaging studies (2 vs. 1 vs. 2).
CONCLUSIONS: In Scotland, FND was the most common diagnosis made after a request for an inpatient review by a neurologist from another department in the hospital. Patients with FND have similar health resource needs to those with other common neurological disorders when they present to hospitals with tertiary neurology centres. This data supports the inclusion of FND as a core curriculum topic in neurology training.","['Ramsay N', 'Stone J', 'Fadiloglu K', 'Baxter M', 'Hutchison C', 'Bennett K', 'Moullaali T', 'Mathur J', 'Bridson J', 'Hoeritzauer I']",2023,,,Eur J Neurol,"Ramsay N, et al.

37457838,White Matter Structural Connectivity and Its Impact on Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures: An Evidence-Based Review.,"Psychiatric non-epileptic seizure (PNES), also known as a form of functional neurological disorders (FND), is a common but still underrecognized disorder presenting seizure-like symptoms and no electrophysiological abnormality. Despite the significant burden of this disorder, the neurobiological mechanisms are not clearly understood, which hinders the development of better diagnosis and treatment. In the recent neuroimaging research on PNES, brain network analysis has become a relevant topic beyond conventional methodologies. The human brain is a highly intricate system of interconnected regions that collaborate to facilitate a wide range of cognitive and behavioral functions. White matter tracts, which are comprised of bundles of axonal fibers, are the primary means by which information is transmitted between different brain regions. As such, comprehending the organization and structure of the brain's white matter network is critical for gaining insight into its functional architecture. This review article aims to provide an overview of the brain mechanisms underlying PNES, with a special focus on analyzing brain networks.",['Sone D'],2023,19,,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,Sone D.

37434321,Anomalies in the review process and interpretation of the evidence in the NICE guideline for chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a disabling long-term condition of unknown cause. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published a guideline in 2021 that highlighted the seriousness of the condition, but also recommended that graded exercise therapy (GET) should not be used and cognitive-behavioural therapy should only be used to manage symptoms and reduce distress, not to aid recovery. This U-turn in recommendations from the previous 2007 guideline is controversial.We suggest that the controversy stems from anomalies in both processing and interpretation of the evidence by the NICE committee. The committee: (1) created a new definition of CFS/ME, which 'downgraded' the certainty of trial evidence; (2) omitted data from standard trial end points used to assess efficacy; (3) discounted trial data when assessing treatment harm in favour of lower quality surveys and qualitative studies; (4) minimised the importance of fatigue as an outcome; (5) did not use accepted practices to synthesise trial evidence adequately using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations trial evidence); (6) interpreted GET as mandating fixed increments of change when trials defined it as collaborative, negotiated and symptom dependent; (7) deviated from NICE recommendations of rehabilitation for related conditions, such as chronic primary pain and (8) recommended an energy management approach in the absence of supportive research evidence.We conclude that the dissonance between this and the previous guideline was the result of deviating from usual scientific standards of the NICE process. The consequences of this are that patients may be denied helpful treatments and therefore risk persistent ill health and disability.","['White P', 'Abbey S', 'Angus B', 'Ball HA', 'Buchwald DS', 'Burness C', 'Carson AJ', 'Chalder T', 'Clauw DJ', 'Coebergh J', 'David AS', 'Dworetzky BA', 'Edwards MJ', 'Espay AJ', 'Etherington J', 'Fink P', 'Flottorp S', 'Garcin B', 'Garner P', 'Glasziou P', 'Hamilton W', 'Henningsen P', 'Hoeritzauer I', 'Husain M', 'Huys AML', 'Knoop H', 'Kroenke K', 'Lehn A', 'Levenson JL', 'Little P', 'Lloyd A', 'Madan I', 'van der Meer JWM', 'Miller A', 'Murphy M', 'Nazareth I', 'Perez DL', 'Phillips W', 'Reuber M', 'Rief W', 'Santhouse A', 'Serranova T', 'Sharpe M', 'Stanton B', 'Stewart DE', 'Stone J', 'Tinazzi M', 'Wade DT', 'Wessely SC', 'Wyller V', 'Zeman A']",2023,,,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"White P, et al.

37416857,Costs of adult functional neurological disorders at a tertiary hospital in central South Africa.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorders (FND) lead to increased care requirements and costs, negatively impacting healthcare budgets. Healthcare expenditure in FND has escalated beyond other neurologic disorders during the past decade.
OBJECTIVES: To assess inpatient costs in adults admitted to the neurology ward at Universitas Academic Hospital (UAH) in central South Africa.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study with a comparative component was conducted on patients admitted during 2018 and 2019. All FND cases (
RESULTS: FND patients accounted for 5.5% of 530 admissions in the neurology ward during the study period. No significant differences regarding daily median cost, age categories, gender or medical comorbidity were observed between FND and the comparison group. However, the length of stay was significantly shorter for the FND patients (median of four versus eight days), translating to approximately half the total costs of patients admitted for other neurological disorders.
CONCLUSION: The daily median cost was similar for FND and other neurology-related admissions. The lower overall inpatient costs for FND patients were only related to significantly shorter durations of stay, which may reflect new diagnostic approaches resulting from changes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria. The prevalence of FND was similar to those reported in previous studies conducted at neurology clinics.
CONTRIBUTION: The study contributes towards better understanding the prevalence and cost of FND in local neurology inpatient care settings.","['Christopher LLC', 'Pretorius PJ', 'Moodley A', 'Joubert G', 'Arendse T']",2023,29,,S Afr J Psychiatr,"Christopher LLC, et al.

37414721,Overall comorbidities in functional neurological disorder: A narrative review.,"INTRODUCTION: The importance to assess and include the frequent comorbidities in the personalised care management plan of patients with functional neurological disorders (FND) has arisen through the years. FND patients are not only complaining from motor and/or sensory symptoms. They also report some non-specific symptoms that participate to the burden of FND. In this narrative review, we aim to better describe these comorbidities in terms of prevalence, clinical characteristics and their variability depending on the subtype of FND.
METHODS: The literature was searched for on Medline and PubMed. The search was narrowed to articles between 2000 and 2022.
RESULTS: Fatigue is the most common symptom reported in relation to FND (from 47 to 93%), followed by cognitive symptoms (from 80 to 85%). Psychiatric disorders are reported in 40 to 100% FND patients, depending on the FND subtype (functional motor disorder [FMD], functional dissociative seizures [FDS]…) but also on the type of psychiatric disorder (anxiety disorders being the most frequent, followed by mood disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders). Stress factors such as childhood trauma exposure (emotional neglect and physical abuse predominantly) have also been identified in up to 75% of FND patients, along with maladaptive coping strategies. Organic disorders are commonly reported in FND, such as neurological disorders (including epilepsy in FDS [20%] and FMD in Parkinson's Disease [7%]). Somatic symptom disorders including chronic pain syndromes are frequently associated to FND (about 50%). To be noted, recent data also suggest a high comorbidity between FND and hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (about 55%).
CONCLUSION: Put together, this narrative review highlights the high burden of FND patients, not only due to somatosensory alterations but also by considering the frequent comorbidities reported. Thus, such comorbidities must be taken into consideration when defining the FND personalised care management strategy for the patients.","['Carle-Toulemonde G', 'Goutte J', 'Do-Quang-Cantagrel N', 'Mouchabac S', 'Joly C', 'Garcin B']",2023,49,4S,Encephale,"Carle-Toulemonde G, et al.

37400337,"[Diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and assessment of patients with functional neurological disorders].","Functional neurological disorders (FND) are symptoms that can affect a variety of functions including motor, sensory and cognitive. These symptoms are genuinely experienced by the patient and are related to a functional disorder rather than a structural one. There is little epidemiological data on these disorders, but their frequency is well established in clinical practice, it is the second most frequent reason for consultation in Neurology. Despite of the frequency of the disorder, general practitioners and specialists are insufficiently trained in the disease, and patients often suffer from stigmatization and/or unnecessary investigations. It is therefore important to be aware of the diagnostic approach to FND, which mostly relies on positive clinical signs. Psychiatric evaluation can help with the characterization of predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors of the symptoms (according to the 3P biopsychosocial model related to FND), and guide their management. Finally, diagnosis explanation is a crucial step in the management of the disease, which can in itself have a therapeutic effect, and allow the patient to adhere to the treatments.","['Garcin B', 'Roze E', 'Daubigney A', 'Carle-Toulemonde G', 'Degos B', 'Hingray C']",2023,49,4S,Encephale,"Garcin B, et al.

We therefore cover the following themes: the initial contact with a patient with FND, the diagnostic process in favor of a positive diagnosis, the physiological, neural and psychological basis of FND, the diagnostic announcement (and its intangibles), the therapeutic patient education in FND, the general principles of therapeutic management through a personalized and multidisciplinary care program, and the validated therapeutic tools available according to the symptoms identified. This article is designed to be of broad interest on FND, supported by tables and figures showing the key points of all these steps, to keep an educational purpose at most.

37400335,[Functional neurological disorders and forensic medicine: Clinical and practical characteristics].,"Functional neurological disorders (FND) have long been a challenge for medicine, both on clinical and psychodynamic point of view. The medico-legal issue is often relegated to the background in medicine, and FND patients also suffer from such neglected topic. Nonetheless, despite the difficulty to properly diagnose FND and the numerous associated organic and/or psychiatric comorbidities, FND patients report a significant level of deficiency and a high alteration of quality of life when compared to other well-recognized chronic disorders such as Parkinson's disease or epilepsy. Whether it is for the estimation of a personal injury, a prejudice, after-effects following a medical accident or certain legal contexts requiring the elimination of a factitious disorder or a simulation, the uncertainty and imprecision in the medico-legal assessment can imply notable consequences on the patient. In this article, we propose to define the different medico-legal contexts in which FND can occur that of the legal expert, that of the consulting physician, that of the so-called recourse physician and finally that of the attending physician who can provide detailed medical files to the patient in order to help him/her in his/her procedures. We then explain how to use standardized objective evaluation tools validated by the learned societies and how to encourage multidisciplinary cross-evaluation. Finally, we specify how to differentiate FND from historically FND-associated disorders (factitious and simulated disorders), through the clinical criteria, considering the difficulties linked to the uncertainty in the clinical examination of these disorders in a medico-legal context. In addition to the rigorous completion of expertise missions, we aim to reduce two damaging consequences characterizing FND: diagnostic delay and the patients' suffering through stigma.","['Mouchabac S', 'Lacambre M', 'Carle-Toulemonde G', 'Drapier D']",2023,49,4S,Encephale,"Mouchabac S, et al.

37400332,[Validated care programs for patients with functional neurological disorders].,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common cause of persistent and disabling neurological symptoms. Diagnostic delay may lead to no treatment, inappropriate treatment or even iatrogenic symptoms. Yet, several treatments significantly reduce physical symptoms and improve functioning in FND patients even though not all patients respond to the currently available treatments. This review aims to describe the range of evidence-based rehabilitative and/or psychological therapeutic approaches available for FND patients. The most effective treatments are multidisciplinary and coordinated; using an outpatient or inpatient setting. Building a network of FND-trained healthcare professionals around the patient is an essential aspect of optimal patient management. Indeed, a supportive environment coupled with a collaborative therapeutic relationship improves understanding of FND and appears to help patients engage in appropriate treatments. Patients need to be invested in their own care and have to understand that recovery may depend on their commitment. The conventional treatment combines psychoeducation, physical rehabilitation and psychotherapy (cognitive and behavioral therapy, hypnosis, psychodynamic interpersonal therapy). Early referral of patients to physical therapy is recommended; however, the optimal parameters of treatment, duration and intensity are unknown and seem to vary with the severity and chronicity of symptoms. The goal is to minimize self-awareness by diverting attention or by stimulating automatically generated movements with non-specific and gradual exercises. The use of compensatory technical aids should be avoided as much as possible. Psychotherapeutic management should encourage self-evaluation of cognitive distortions, emotional reactions and maladaptive behaviors while empowering the patient in managing symptoms. Symptom management can use anchoring strategies to fight against dissociation. The aim is to connect to the immediate environment and to enrich one's sensoriality. The psychological interventions should then be adapted to the individual psychopathology, cognitive style and personality functioning of each patient. There is currently no known curative pharmacological treatment for FND. The pharmacological approach rather consists of progressively discontinuing medication that was introduced by default and that could lead to undesirable side effects. Finally, neurostimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation) can be effective on motor FND.","['Rauline G', 'Hingray C', 'Carle-Toulemonde G', 'Hubsch C', 'El Hage W', 'Conejero I', 'Samalin L', 'Garcin B', 'Gharib A']",2023,49,4S,Encephale,"Rauline G, et al.

37394954,Principles for delivering improved care of people with functional seizures: Closing the treatment gap.,"Patients diagnosed with functional (psychogenic nonepileptic) seizures have similar or greater levels of disability, morbidity and mortality than people with epilepsy, but there are far fewer treatment services. In contrast to epilepsy, the current understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms and the development of evidence-based treatments for functional seizures is rudimentary. This leads to high direct healthcare costs and high indirect costs to the patient, family and wider society. There are many patient, clinician and system-level barriers to improving outcomes for functional seizures. At a patient level, these include the heterogeneity of symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, family factors and difficulty in perceiving psychological aspects of illness and potential benefits of treatment. Clinician-level barriers include sub-specialism, poor knowledge, skills and attitudes and stigma. System-level barriers include the siloed nature of healthcare, the high prevalence of functional seizures and funding models relying on individual medical practitioners. Through the examination of international examples and expert recommendations, several themes emerge that may address some of these barriers. These include (1) stepped care with low-level, brief generalised interventions, proceeding to higher level, extended and individualised treatments; (2) active triage of complexity, acuity and treatment readiness; (3) integrated interdisciplinary teams that individualise formulation, triage, and treatment planning and (4) shared care with primary, emergency and community providers and secondary consultation. Consideration of the application of these principles to the Australian and New Zealand context is proposed as a significant opportunity to meet an urgent need.","['Winton-Brown T', 'Wilson SJ', 'Felmingham K', 'Rayner G', ""O'Brien TJ"", ""O'Brien P"", 'Mohan A', 'Velakoulis D', 'Kanaan R']",2023,,,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,"Winton-Brown T, et al.

37379722,Biopsychosocial complexity in functional neurological disorder.,"BACKGROUND: Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is considered a biopsychosocial disorder nowadays, with chronicity in >50% of cases. The INTERMED Self-Assessment Questionnaire (IMSA) assesses the various domains and indicates biopsychosocial complexity.
OBJECTIVE: FND patients were compared with a sample of psychosomatic (PSM) patients as well as post-stroke patients.
METHODS: The three samples (N = 287 altogether) were largely in inpatient and day clinic psychotherapeutic treatment or inpatient neurological rehabilitation. The IMSA covers all three biopsychosocial domains as well as health care utilisation in the time frame of the past, the present and the future. In addition, affective burden (GAD-7, PHQ-9), somatoform symptoms (PHQ-15), dissociation (FDS) and quality of life (SF-12) were evaluated.
RESULTS: FND and PSM patients scored highly in the IMSA, with ≥70% regarded as complex, compared to 15% of post-stroke patients. Affective, somatoform and dissociation scores were high in FND and PSM patients. Mental and somatic quality of life were lower in these groups compared to post-stroke patients.
DISCUSSION: FND patients showed high biopsychosocial strain, similar to a typical sample of inpatient and day clinic, i.e. severely affected, PSM patients, and they were more affected than post-stroke patients. These data emphasize that FND should be evaluated with a biopsychosocial perspective. The IMSA likely represents a valuable tool, which has to be assessed by further longitudinal studies.","['Joos A', 'Herrmann C', 'Lahmann C', 'Flottman M', 'Jansen T', 'Schede C', 'Maner P', 'Schörner K', 'von Husen DK', 'Jöbges M', 'Hartmann A']",2023,84,,Gen Hosp Psychiatry,"Joos A, et al.

37378010,"Case report: Improvement in refractory functional seizures, depression, and quality of life with ketamine-assisted therapy.","Functional seizures, a primary subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND), are a known cause of serious neurological disability with an increasing awareness of their impact amongst the neuroscience community. Situated at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry, FND is characterized by a range of alterations in motor, sensory or cognitive performance, such as abnormal movements, limb weakness, and dissociative, seizure-like episodes. Functional seizures are known, in part, to have psychological underpinnings; however, the lack of effective and consistent treatment options requires research and novel approaches to better understand the etiology, diagnosis and what constitutes a successful intervention. Ketamine, a selective blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, has a well-established safety and efficacy profile. In recent years, ketamine-assisted therapy has shown increasing potential for treating a broad range of psychiatric conditions, building on its demonstrated rapid-acting antidepressant effects. Here we present a 51-year-old female with refractory daily functional seizures leading to significant disability and a medical history significant for major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After unsuccessful treatment attempts, the patient underwent a novel protocol with ketamine-assisted therapy. After 3 weeks of ketamine-assisted therapy followed by 20 weeks of intermittent ketamine treatment and ongoing integrative psychotherapy, the patient's seizures were significantly reduced in frequency and severity. She experienced significant improvements in depressive symptoms and functional ability scores. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case describing improvement in functional seizures following ketamine-assisted therapy. While rigorous studies are needed, this case report encourages further investigation of ketamine-assisted therapy for functional seizures and other functional neurological symptoms.","['Argento E', 'Omene E', 'Jaeger AH', 'Kertes A', 'Mitchell KA', 'Necyk C', 'Thielking P', 'Lewis EC']",2023,17,,Front Neurosci,"Argento E, et al.

37339887,Economic Cost of Functional Neurologic Disorders: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Functional neurologic disorder (FND) represents genuine involuntary neurologic symptoms and signs including seizures, weakness, and sensory disturbance, which have characteristic clinical features, and represent a problem of voluntary control and perception despite normal basic structure of the nervous system. The historical view of FND as a diagnosis of exclusion can lead to unnecessary health care resource utilization and high direct and indirect economic costs. A systematic review was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to assess these economic costs and to assess for any cost-effective treatments.
METHODS: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database of the University of York) for original, primary research publications between inception of the databases and April 8, 2022. A hand search of conference abstracts was also conducted. Key search terms included ""functional neurologic disorder,"" ""conversion disorder,"" and ""functional seizures."" Reviews, case reports, case series, and qualitative studies were excluded. We performed a descriptive and qualitative thematic analysis of the resulting studies.
RESULTS: The search resulted in a total of 3,244 studies. Sixteen studies were included after screening and exclusion of duplicates. These included the following: cost-of-illness (COI) studies that were conducted alongside cohort studies without intervention and those that included a comparator group, for example, another neurologic disorder (n = 4); COI studies that were conducted alongside cohort studies without intervention and those that did not include a comparator group (n = 4); economic evaluations of interventions that were either pre-post cohort studies (n = 6) or randomized controlled trials (n = 2). Of these, 5 studies assessed active interventions, and 3 studies assessed costs before and after a definitive diagnosis of FND. Studies showed an excess annual cost associated with FND (range $4,964-$86,722 2021 US dollars), which consisted of both direct and large indirect costs. Studies showed promise that interventions, including provision of a definitive diagnosis, could reduce this cost (range 9%-90.7%). No cost-effective treatments were identified. Study comparison was limited by study design and location heterogeneity.
DISCUSSION: FND is associated with a significant use of health care resources, resulting in economic costs to both the patient and the taxpayer and intangible losses. Interventions, including accurate diagnosis, seem to offer an avenue toward reducing these costs.","[""O'Mahony B"", 'Nielsen G', 'Baxendale S', 'Edwards MJ', 'Yogarajah M']",2023,101,2,Neurology,"O'Mahony B, et al.

37339055,Inpatient rehabilitation for acute presentations of motor functional neurological disorder (FND): A retrospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) involving the motor system (e.g., functional weakness, functional gait) may acutely present to the hospital for new-onset symptoms. For some, symptoms may remain severe enough at the time of hospital discharge to qualify for an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) stay.
DESIGN: Data were extracted via retrospective chart review on FND patients (n = 22) admitted to an IRF between September 2019 and May 2022. Demographic and clinical data, including admission and discharge physical and occupational therapy measurements on the IRF-Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI), were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: Symptom duration was less than one week for nearly two-thirds of the cohort. Following an approximately two-week length of stay, patients showed statistically significant changes in admission to discharge measures of self-care, transfers, ambulation, and balance. More than 95% of patients were able to be discharged home. The presence or absence of comorbid depression, anxiety, or PTSD did not impact outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: For a subset of patients with persistent motor symptoms following an acute hospital admission for a new diagnosis of FND, a relatively short IRF stay was associated with significant clinical gains.","['Polich G', 'Zalanowski S', 'Lewis JM', 'Sugarman S', 'Christopulos K', 'Hebb C', 'Perez DL', 'Baslet G', 'Shah P', 'Herman S']",2023,,,Am J Phys Med Rehabil,"Polich G, et al.

37332646,Outcomes of an Integrated Multidisciplinary Clinic for People with Functional Neurological Disorder.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a disabling condition which has poor prognosis without treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an outpatient integrated multidisciplinary intervention for the condition.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the outcomes of a pilot integrated multidisciplinary treatment clinic for FND with motor symptoms.
METHODS: Patients were seen simultaneously by a neurology doctor, a physiotherapist, a clinical psychologist, and sometimes a psychiatrist. The primary endpoint was change in quality of life measured by Short Form-36 (SF-36). Secondary outcomes were change in work and social participation measured by the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), ability to participate in full-time or part-time employment, self-rated understanding of FND, and self-rated agreement with the diagnosis of FND. Over the year, 13 patients were recruited to the clinic, and 11 agreed to participate in the outcome study.
RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in quality of life were seen across seven out of eight domains of the SF-36, with improvements in individual domains of between 23 and 39 points (of a possible 100). Mean Work and Social Adjustment Scale score halved from 26 to 13 (worst possible is 40). Of the 12 patients treated, one began to work again after complete unemployment, and two who had been working reduced hours due to disability resumed full time work. No patients had worsened occupational status.
CONCLUSIONS: This intervention is associated with substantial improvements in quality of life and function, and may be more amenable to delivery at non-specialist centers than other described interventions for FND.","['Palmer DDG', 'Gamble M', 'Higgins M', 'Maley J', 'Watson E']",2023,10,6,Mov Disord Clin Pract,"Palmer DDG, et al.

37329664,Identifying misconceptions and knowledge gaps in functional neurological disorders among emergency care providers.,"BACKGROUND: Functional Neurologic Disorders (FND) are a common but heterogeneous group of disabling conditions. The Emergency Department (ED) is an important venue for care and referral as it is often the first point of contact when patients with FND are faced with a crisis or exacerbation of symptoms.
METHODS: ED providers (n = 273) practicing in the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Northeast Ohio network were invited to participate through secure web application electronic surveys. Data were collected on practice profiles, knowledge, attitudes, management of FND, and awareness of available resources for FND.
RESULTS: Sixty providers completed the survey (22% response rate; n = 50 ED physicians, 10 advanced care providers) with 95.0% (n = 57) reporting a lack of understanding about FND. The terms Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures and stress induced/stress related disease were used by 60.0% (n = 36) and 58.3% (n = 35) respectively. Ninety percent (n = 53) rated their experience with managing FND patients as at least more difficult. Eighty- five percent (n = 51) agreed with ""rule out others"" and 60% (n = 36) agreed with ""caused by psych stress"". Eighty six percent (n = 50) believe that there is a difference between FND from malingering. Only one respondent was familiar with any FND resources and 79% (n = 47) reported the need for FND specific educational materials.
CONCLUSION: This survey revealed major gaps in knowledge, inaccurate perceptions, and management that differs from the current standard of care among ED providers caring for patients with FND. Educational opportunities are needed to guide diagnosis and evidence-based treatment to optimize management of patients with FND.","['Yu JRT', 'Shuaib U', 'Mate KKV', 'Kaur H', 'Sonneborn C', 'Hogue O', 'Morrison J', 'Yu XX']",2023,114,,J Clin Neurosci,"Yu JRT, et al.

37270188,MODIFI: protocol for randomised feasibility study of eye-movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) for functional neurological disorder (FND).,"INTRODUCTION: Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to an involuntary loss of control over and/or aberrant perception of the body. Common presenting symptoms are functional (non-epileptic) seizures, and functional motor disorder, for example, walking difficulties, weakness or tremor. Greater access to effective treatments would lead to reduced distress and disability; and reduce unnecessary healthcare costs.This study will examine eye-movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy (EMDR) as a treatment for FND. EMDR is an evidence-based treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but its use for other conditions is growing. An FND-specific EMDR protocol will be tested, and if the intervention proves feasible with promising clinical outcomes, progression to a substantive study could take place.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Fifty adult patients diagnosed with FND will be recruited. It will be a single-blind randomised controlled trial with two arms: EMDR (plus standard neuropsychiatric care; NPC) and standard NPC. The two groups will be compared at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2) and 9 months (T3). Measures of feasibility include safety, recruitment, retention, treatment adherence and acceptability. Clinical outcome measures will assess health-related functioning/quality of life, ratings of FND symptoms and severity, depression, anxiety, PTSD, dissociation, service utilisation and other costs. Improvement and satisfaction ratings will also be assessed. Feasibility outcomes will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Exploratory analyses using (linear/logistic) mixed-effect models will examine the rate of change in the groups' clinical outcome measures across the four time-points.After the intervention period, a sample of participants, and clinicians, will be invited to attend semistructured interviews. The interviews will be analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the NHS West Midlands-Edgbaston Research Ethics Committee. Study findings will be published in open access peer-reviewed journals, presented at conferences, and communicated to participants and other relevant stakeholders.

37227931,Functional neurological disorder is common in patients attending chronic pain clinics.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronic pain is a common comorbidity in those with functional neurological disorder (FND); however, the prevalence and characteristics of FND in those with chronic pain is unknown.
METHODS: A retrospective electronic records review was made of consecutive new patients attending a chronic pain clinic of a regional service. Clinical features, medication for and outcome of chronic pain, any lifetime diagnoses of functional disorders, FND, and psychiatric disorders, and undiagnosed neurological symptoms were recorded.
RESULTS: Of 190 patients attending the chronic pain clinic, 32 (17%) had a lifetime diagnosis of FND and an additional 11 (6%) had undiagnosed neurological symptoms. Pain patients with comorbid FND were more likely to have chronic primary pain (88% with FND, 44% without FND, p < 0.0001), widespread chronic primary pain (53%, 15%, p < 0.00001), and depression (84%, 52%, p < 0.005) and less likely to have a pain-precipitating event (19% vs. 56%, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference between these patients in opiate prescription, benzodiazepine prescription, or pain outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: This first study of FND in a chronic pain patient population found a remarkably high prevalence of FND (17%) and is possibly an underestimation. The size of the overlap indicates that FND and chronic pain research fields are likely to have a lot to learn from each other.","['Mason I', 'Renée J', 'Marples I', 'McWhirter L', 'Carson A', 'Stone J', 'Hoeritzauer I']",2023,30,9,Eur J Neurol,"Mason I, et al.

37205237,How Is Functional Neurological Disorder Managed in Australian Hospitals? A Multi-Site Study Conducted on Acute Inpatient and Inpatient Rehabilitation Wards.,"BACKGROUND: Successful management for functional neurological disorder (FND) requires multidisciplinary involvement starting with providing a definitive diagnosis.
OBJECTIVES: To observe clinical management of patients with FND during hospital admission.
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted over six Australian hospitals over a 4-month period. Data collected included patient demographics, communication of the diagnosis of FND, access to the multidisciplinary team, hospital length of stay (LOS), and emergency department (ED) presentations.
RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were included. Median LOS was 6 (interquartile range, 3-14) days. Thirty-five (31%) presented to ED with 9 (8%) re-presenting two or more times after hospital discharge. Total hospital utilization cost was AUD$3.5million. A new diagnosis was made in 82 (73%) patients. Inpatient referrals were made to neurology (81, 72%), psychology (29, 26%), psychiatry (27, 24%), and physiotherapy (100, 88%). Forty-four (54%) were not told of the diagnosis. Twenty (24%) did not have their diagnosis documented in their medical record. Of the 19 (23%) not reviewed by neurology on non-neurosciences wards, 17 (89%) did not have their diagnosis communicated and 11 (58%) did not have it documented. Twenty-five (42%) referred to neurology were not provided with a diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Current gaps in service provision during inpatient hospital admissions in Australia include low rates of communication of a diagnosis, particularly when patients are not located on a neurosciences ward, and limited and variable access to inpatient multidisciplinary teams. Specialized services are needed to improve education, clinical pathways, communication, and health outcomes while reducing healthcare system costs.","['Petrie D', 'Lehn A', 'Barratt J', 'Hughes A', 'Roberts K', 'Fitzhenry S', 'Gane E']",2023,10,5,Mov Disord Clin Pract,"Petrie D, et al.

37046395,[What do medical students think about functional neurological disorders?].,"INTRODUCTION: Functional neurological disorders (FND) are a frequent reason for visits in neurology. However, specific training on these disorders during undergraduate and residency training is limited. This study assesses the knowledge, attitude and exposure of medical students to FNDs before completing their medical degree.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a 15-item survey to explore understanding, exposure and attitudes towards FNDs among sixth-year medical students at four Spanish universities.
RESULTS: A total of 118 students (mean age 23.6 ± 1.2 years; 71.2% female) returned the survey. Of these, 88 (74.6%) were aware of the concept of FNDs and 78 (66.1%) had studied them in psychiatry classes. The term 'psychosomatic' was chosen by 54.1% of the students as the most appropriate term to refer to these disorders, and 111 (94.1%) believed that a history of sexual or physical abuse was common among FND patients. Fifty-seven students (48.3%) assumed that the diagnosis of FND was mostly a clinical diagnosis of exclusion and 63 (53.4%) indicated that it is managed only by psychiatry. One hundred and one students (85.6%) considered that adequate training on FNDs is an important aspect of their medical training.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical students are aware of the existence of FNDs, but their preferred terminology, as well as the perceived aetiological factors, reflect that the historical view of these disorders is still deeply rooted. Medical students feel that they should receive adequate education on FNDs from specialists in neurology and psychiatry as part of their training.","['Escribano-Paredes JB', 'Natera-Villalba E', 'Porta-Etessam J', 'Vela L', 'García-Ruiz Espiga P', 'Alonso-Cánovas A', 'López-Sendón J', 'Pérez-Torre P', 'Fanjul S', 'Lledó L', 'Martínez-Castrillo JC', 'Pareés I']",2023,76,8,Rev Neurol,"Escribano-Paredes JB, et al.

37009111,"Functional Neurologic Disorders, disorders to be managed by neurologists, or are neurologists wandering in a dangerous field with inadequate resources?","In recent years, some neurologists reconsidered their approach to Medically Unexplained Symptoms and proposed Functional Neurologic Disorders (FND) as a new entity, claiming that neurology could offer alternative treatment options to the psychotherapies provided in psychiatry settings. FNDs, for this purpose, should include only the disorders listed as Conversion from the Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders (SSRD) group. The present review analyzes the rationale of this position and challenges the arguments provided for its support. The review also discusses the systematization of these disorders as provided by public health systems. It outlines risks stemming from economic support and public funding uncertainty, given their negligible epidemiological dimensions resulting from the parcellation of SSRD. The review underlines the unresolved issue of Factitious Disorders, which are in the same SSRD category of the international classification but are, nonetheless, overlooked by the theoretical proponents of the FND entity. Comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders is also analyzed. We propose a model that supports the continuum between different SSRD conditions, including Factitious Disorders. The model is based on the emergence of feigned death reflex and deception from frontal lobe dysfunction. Finally, the paper summarizes the wealth of historical psychiatric and psychodynamic approaches and critical reviews. The study also puts in context the categorization and interpretation efforts provided by the most eminent researchers of the past century.","['Onofrj M', 'Ajdinaj P', 'Digiovanni A', 'Malek N', 'Martinotti G', 'Ferro FM', 'Russo M', 'Thomas A', 'Sensi SL']",2023,14,,Front Psychiatry,"Onofrj M, et al.

36992491,Neurological Dysfunction in Long COVID Should Not Be Labelled as Functional Neurological Disorder.,"There have been suggestions that Long COVID might be purely functional (meaning psychological) in origin. Labelling patients with neurological dysfunction in Long COVID as having functional neurological disorder (FND) in the absence of proper testing may be symptomatic of that line of thought. This practice is problematic for Long COVID patients, as motor and balance symptoms have been reported to occur in Long COVID frequently. FND is characterized by the presentation of symptoms that seem neurological but lack compatibility of the symptom with a neurological substrate. Although diagnostic classification according to the ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR is dependent predominantly on the exclusion of any other medical condition that could account for the symptoms, current neurological practice of FND classification allows for such comorbidity. As a consequence, Long COVID patients with motor and balance symptoms mislabeled as FND have no longer access to Long COVID care, whereas treatment for FND is seldom provided and is ineffective. Research into underlying mechanisms and diagnostic methods should explore how to determine whether motor and balance symptoms currently diagnosed as FND should be considered one part of Long COVID symptoms, in other words, one component of symptomatology, and in which cases they correctly represent FND. Research into rehabilitation models, treatment and integrated care are needed, which should take into account biological underpinnings as well as possible psychological mechanisms and the patient perspective.","['Van der Feltz-Cornelis CM', 'Moriarty AS', 'Strain WD']",2023,15,3,Viruses,"Van der Feltz-Cornelis CM, et al.

36977553,Functional neurological disorder is a feminist issue.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common and disabling disorder, often misunderstood by clinicians. Although viewed sceptically by some, FND is a diagnosis that can be made accurately, based on positive clinical signs, with clinical features that have remained stable for over 100 years. Despite some progress in the last decade, people with FND continue to suffer subtle and overt forms of discrimination by clinicians, researchers and the public.

We outline the reasons why FND is a feminist issue, incorporating historical and contemporary clinical, research and social perspectives.

36933399,Clinician-rated outcomes of patients with functional neurological disorders treated in an outpatient clinic.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) have historically been difficult to treat. Outcomes have been studied in research trials, documenting improvements; however, limited information is available from a community-treated FND cohort.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine clinical outcomes in outpatients with FND treated with the Neuro-Behavioral Therapy (NBT) approach. These uncontrolled setting treatment data could complement more structured clinical studies results.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients diagnosed with FND, ages 17 to 75, who were treated with the NBT workbook at the Rhode Island Hospital Behavioral Health clinic between 2014 and 2022. NBT consisted of 45-minute, individual, outpatient sessions, in clinic or via telehealth with one clinician. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) -Severity, and -Improvement were scored for every appointment.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics are available for 107 patients. Mean age at FND symptom onset was 37 years. Patients had a mix of FND semiologies, which included Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (71%), Functional Movement Disorder (24.3%), Functional Sensory Disorder (14%), Functional Weakness (6.5%), and Functional Speech Disorder (5.6%). Clinical evaluation scores revealed improvements over time.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a well-characterized sample of patients with various and mixed FND semiologies, who received manualized therapy, NBT, in an outpatient clinic. Patients had similar psychosocial profiles to those in clinical studies and displayed improvement in clinical measures. These results demonstrate the practicability of NBT for motor FND semiologies and for PNES, in a ""real-world"" outpatient practice, extending care beyond structured clinical trials.","['LaFrance WC', 'Tedesco R', 'Baird GL', 'Wincze J', 'Tocco K', 'Anderson J']",2023,107,,Seizure,"LaFrance WC, et al.

This paper aimed to further examine the therapeutic effects of a 3-session course of this treatment focusing on its potential to maintain reduced healthcare utility within a group of patients with complex difficulties, across an extended time period, post-therapy. The original study followed a mixed methods case series design and recruited 18 patients from secondary adult mental health care and specialist neurology services. Seventeen participants completed the intervention and attendance rates were very high (95%). In this follow-up study, which was solely focused on the utilization of healthcare resources, results showed decreases when comparing 12 months prior and 12 months post three sessions of ISTDP. The results provide further support for the use of ISTDP in this group of participants with complex clinical presentations, specifically, its capacity to reduce healthcare usage over 12 months post-therapy. Further evidence from controlled and randomized studies with larger sample sizes is warranted.","['Malda-Castillo J', 'Howell B', 'Russell L', 'Town J', 'Abbass A', 'Perez-Algorta G', 'Valavanis S']",2023,141,,Epilepsy Behav,"Malda-Castillo J, et al.

36884038,Evidence-Based Mind-Body Interventions for Children and Adolescents with Functional Neurological Disorder.,"LEARNING OBJECTIVES: • Develop and implement treatment plans for children and adolescents with functional neurological disorder (FND)• Outline a plan to increase awareness and standardize the care for patients with FND using evidence-based interventions.
ABSTRACT: Functional neurological disorder (FND) in children and adolescents involves the biological embedding of lived experience in the body and brain. This embedding culminates in stress-system activation or dysregulation and in aberrant changes in neural network function. In pediatric neurology clinics, FND represents up to one-fifth of patients. Current research shows good outcomes with prompt diagnosis and treatment using a biopsychosocial, stepped-care approach. At present, however-and worldwide-FND services are scarce, the result of long-standing stigma and ingrained belief that patients with FND do not suffer from a real (""organic"") disorder and that they therefore do not require, or even deserve, treatment. Since 1994, the Mind-Body Program for children and adolescents with FND at The Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney, Australia-run by a consultation-liaison team-has delivered inpatient care to hundreds of patients with FND and outpatient care to hundreds of others. For less-disabled patients, the program enables community-based clinicians to implement biopsychosocial interventions locally by providing a positive diagnosis (by a neurologist or pediatrician), a biopsychosocial assessment and formulation (by clinicians from the consultation-liaison team), a physical therapy assessment, and clinical support (from the consultation-liaison team and the physiotherapist). In this Perspective we describe the elements of a biopsychosocial mind-body program intervention capable of providing, as needed, effective treatment to children and adolescents with FND. Our aim is to communicate to clinicians and institutions around the world what is needed to establish effective community treatment programs, as well as hospital inpatient and outpatient interventions, in their own health care settings.","['Kozlowska K', 'Chudleigh C', 'Savage B', 'Hawkes C', 'Scher S', 'Nunn KP']",2023,31,2,Harv Rev Psychiatry,"Kozlowska K, et al.

36871491,Functional neurological disorder: Clinical manifestations and comorbidities; an online survey.,"Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is common and is often accompanied by multiple comorbid symptoms and conditions. There have been no large-scale studies exploring the change of its clinical manifestations and comorbidities. We used an online survey to assess FND patient characteristics, changes to fatigue, sleep and pain and comorbid symptoms and diagnoses, as well as treatment strategies. The survey was shared via the charities FND Action and FND Hope. 527 participants were included in the analysis. Most (97.3%) reported experiencing more than one core FND symptom. Many respondents reported associated pain (78.1%), fatigue (78.0%) and sleep disturbances (46.7%) before FND diagnosis which often increased thereafter. Rates of obesity were higher (36.9%) than in the general population. Obesity was associated with increased pain, fatigue and sleep difficulties. There was frequent weight gain after diagnosis. 50.0% of participants reported having other diagnoses prior to FND, while in 43.3% new comorbidities arise after FND diagnosis. Many respondents reported being dissatisfied with their care, expressing a wish for further follow-up from mental health (32.7%) and/or neurological services (44.3%). This large online survey further supports the phenotypic complexity of FND. High rates of pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance exist before diagnosis but monitoring for change is worthwhile. Our study identified major gaps in service provision; we highlight the importance of an open mind regarding change in symptoms; this could aid the early identification and management of co-morbidities, including obesity and migraine, which possibly have a negative impact on FND.","['Ducroizet A', 'Zimianti I', 'Golder D', 'Hearne K', 'Edwards M', 'Nielsen G', 'Coebergh J']",2023,110,,J Clin Neurosci,"Ducroizet A, et al.

36868109,"Diagnostic accuracy of clinical signs and investigations for functional weakness, sensory and movement disorders: A systematic review.","INTRODUCTION: Patients with functional neurological disorders (FND) present with weakness, sensory or movement disorder without corresponding brain pathology. The current classificatory systems suggest an inclusionary approach to diagnose FND. Hence, there is a need to systematically evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical signs and electrophysiological investigations in view of the lack of gold standard tests to diagnose FND.
METHODS: PubMed and SCOPUS databases were searched for studies published from Jan 1950 to Jan 2022 which reported the diagnostic accuracy of clinical signs and electrophysiological investigations in patients with FND. The Newcastle Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of the studies.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (727 cases and 932 controls), of which 16 reported clinical signs and, five reported electrophysiological investigations, were included in the review. Two studies were of good quality, 17 of moderate quality, and two of poor quality. We identified 46 clinical signs (24 in weakness, 3 in sensory, and 19 in movement disorders) and 17 investigations (all in movement disorders). Specificity values for signs and investigations were comparatively high compared to the wide variance in sensitivity values.
CONCLUSION: Electrophysiological investigations appear to have a promising role in diagnosing FND, particularly functional movement disorders. The combined use of individual clinical signs and electrophysiological investigations may support and improve diagnostic certainty of FND. Future research can focus on improving the methodology and validating the existing clinical signs and electrophysiological investigations to enhance the validity of the composite diagnostic criterias for FND diagnosis.","['Patwal R', 'Jolly AJ', 'Kumar A', 'Yadav R', 'Desai G', 'Thippeswamy H']",2023,168,,J Psychosom Res,"Patwal R, et al.

36807974,Prevalence of autistic traits in functional neurological disorder and relationship to alexithymia and psychiatric comorbidity.,"INTRODUCTION: In a cohort of adults with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), we aim to: METHODS: 91 patients participating in a FND 5-week outpatient program completed baseline self-report questionnaires for total phobia, somatic symptom severity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Patients were grouped by Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10) score of <6 or ≥ 6 and compared for significant differences in tested variables. This analysis was repeated with patients grouped by alexithymia status. Simple effects were tested using pairwise comparisons. Multistep regression models tested direct relationships between autistic traits and psychiatric comorbidity scores, and mediation by alexithymia.
RESULTS: 36 patients (40%) were AQ-10 positive (scoring ≥6 on AQ-10). A further 36 patients (across AQ-10 positive and AQ-10 negative groups) (40%) screened positive for alexithymia. AQ-10 positive patients scored significantly higher for alexithymia, depression, generalised anxiety, social phobia, ADHD, and dyslexia. Alexithymia positive patients scored significantly higher for generalised anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms severity, social phobia, and dyslexia. Alexithymia score was found to mediate the relationship between autistic trait and depression scores.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a high proportion of autistic and alexithymic traits, in adults with FND. A higher prevalence of autistic traits may highlight a need for specialised communication approaches in FND management. Mechanistic conclusions are limited. Future research could explore links with interoceptive data.","['Cole RH', 'Elmalem MS', 'Petrochilos P']",2023,446,,J Neurol Sci,"Cole RH, et al.

36797425,Why functional neurological disorder is not feigning or malingering.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is one of the commonest reasons that people seek help from a neurologist and is for many people a lifelong cause of disability and impaired quality of life. Although the evidence base regarding FND pathophysiology, treatment and service development has grown substantially in recent years, a persistent ambivalence remains amongst health professionals and others as to the veracity of symptom reporting in those with FND and whether the symptoms are not, in the end, just the same as feigned symptoms or malingering. Here, we provide our perspective on the range of evidence available, which in our view provides a clear separation between FND and feigning and malingering. We hope this will provide a further important step forward in the clinical and academic approach to people with FND, leading to improved attitudes, knowledge, treatments, care pathways and outcomes.","['Edwards MJ', 'Yogarajah M', 'Stone J']",2023,19,4,Nat Rev Neurol,"Edwards MJ, et al.

METHOD: Children diagnosed with FND at a regional children's hospital were prospectively recruited by weekly active surveillance for 36 months. Demographic, clinical, and follow-up data were retrospectively extracted by review of electronic records. Descriptive statistical analyses were used.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven children (age range 5-15 years) met the case definition of FND (annual incidence 18.3 per 100 000 children).

36719069,Functional neurological disorder in people with long COVID: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute health events, including infections, can trigger the onset of functional neurological disorder (FND). It was hypothesized that a proportion of people with long COVID might be experiencing functional symptoms.
METHODS: A systematic review of studies containing original data on long COVID was performed. The frequency and characteristics of neurological symptoms were reviewed, looking for positive evidence suggesting an underlying functional disorder and the hypothesized causes of long COVID.
RESULTS: In all, 102 studies were included in our narrative synthesis. The most consistently reported neurological symptoms were cognitive difficulties, headaches, pain, dizziness, fatigue, sleep-related symptoms and ageusia/anosmia. Overall, no evidence was found that any authors had systematically looked for positive features of FND. An exception was three studies describing temporal inconsistency. In general, the neurological symptoms were insufficiently characterized to support or refute a diagnosis of FND. Moreover, only 13 studies specifically focused on long COVID after mild infection, where the impact of confounders from the general effects of severe illness would be mitigated. Only one study hypothesized that some people with long COVID might have a functional disorder, and another eight studies a chronic-fatigue-syndrome-like response.
DISCUSSION: Neurological symptoms are prevalent in long COVID, but poorly characterized. The similarities between some manifestations of long COVID and functional disorders triggered by acute illnesses are striking. Unfortunately, the current literature is plagued by confounders, including the mixing of patients with initial mild infection with those with severe acute medical complications. The hypothesis that long COVID might in part correspond to a functional disorder remains untested.","['Teodoro T', 'Chen J', 'Gelauff J', 'Edwards MJ']",2023,30,5,Eur J Neurol,"Teodoro T, et al.

The concept and our understanding of functional neurological disorders have changed over the past years, and new etiologic models and treatment plans have been explored. Knowledge about FND in the pediatric population, however, is lacking. The aim of this review is to provide an update on pediatric functional neurological disorder. We conducted a literature search of PubMed and SCOPUS databases and reviewed a total of 85 articles to gain insight into the current understanding of FND etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in children and adolescents. Functional and high resolution MRI revealed abnormal connectivity and structural changes in patients with functional symptoms. The diagnostic criteria no longer require the presence of a psychological factor and instead focus on a rule-in diagnosis. Treatment of FND includes a clear communication of the diagnosis and the support of a multidisciplinary team. Although FND typically has a poor prognosis, better outcomes appear to have been achieved in children and young adults. We conclude that pediatric functional neurological disorder is a prevalent pathology and that this patient population has additional specific needs compared to the adult population.","['Perjoc RS', 'Roza E', 'Vladacenco OA', 'Teleanu DM', 'Neacsu R', 'Teleanu RI']",2023,20,2,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Perjoc RS, et al.

36626907,Clinicians' implicit and explicit attitudes about the legitimacy of functional neurological disorders correlate with referral decisions.,"OBJECTIVES: Uncertainty regarding the legitimacy of functional neurological disorder (FND) remains among some health care professionals. Despite treatment guidelines and consensus recommendations, variability in clinical practice referral decisions persists. Evidence from other conditions suggests such clinical decision making is impacted by practitioners' implicit and explicit attitudes. We aimed to identify whether health care professionals hold implicit and/or explicit attitudes about the legitimacy of FND and whether these attitudes are associated with referral decision making.
DESIGN/METHODS: We included 66 health care professionals who work with people with neurological conditions: n = 37 medical doctors, mainly neurologists (n = 18) and psychiatrists (n = 10), and n = 29 doctoral level practitioner psychologists. Participants completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT), Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP), a referral decision-making vignette task and self-report measures of explicit attitudes on FND-legitimacy, therapeutic optimism and clinician confidence. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) was used as a comparator condition.
RESULTS: Participants self-reported strong explicit FND-legitimate and MS-legitimate attitudes but demonstrated an implicit FND-illegitimate/MS-legitimate bias. Deeper examination provided by the IRAP data indicated pro-FND-legitimate attitudes, but no bias for or against FND-illegitimate-contrasting the pro-MS-legitimate, anti-MS-illegitimate attitudes for the comparator condition. Attitudes about FND-illegitimacy were negatively associated with likelihood of referral to physical interventions such as physiotherapy. Medical doctors had lower treatment optimism and stronger explicit attitudes that FND is illegitimate than psychologists.
CONCLUSIONS: At an implicit level, clinicians are uncertain about the illegitimacy of FND, and such attitudes are associated with lower likelihood of referral to physiotherapy in particular. Improved education on FND among health care professionals is indicated.","['Begley R', 'Farrell L', 'Lyttle N', 'Alty J', 'Curran D', 'Williams S', 'Graham CD']",2023,28,2,Br J Health Psychol,"Begley R, et al.

AIM: To provide a narrative review of the current literature on FGD.
METHODS: A narrative overview of published literature was undertaken, based on a systematic search of relevant databases, authoritative texts and citation tracking.
RESULTS: FGD is multidimensional and disabling, with numerous phenotypes described in the literature, including 'knee buckling,' 'astasia-abasia' and 'excessive slowness.' Motor symptoms such as weakness or tremor, and non-motor symptoms, such as pain and fatigue may contribute to the disability and distress in FGD. Phenotypic features and clinical signs are seen in FGD that demonstrate inconsistency and incongruity with structural disease. A limited number of treatment studies have specifically focussed on FGD, however, reporting of outcomes from motor-FND cohorts has demonstrated short and long-term improvements in walking ability through multidisciplinary rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS: The relative contribution of motor and non-motor symptoms in FGD remains unknown, but it is likely that non-motor symptoms increase the illness burden and should be considered during assessment and treatment.

The study aimed to assess the self-reported autistic traits via a standardized questionnaire and the prevalence of previously diagnosed ASD among people with FND and their 1st-degree relatives. We performed a survey of members of the patient organization FNDHope, using a self-completed questionnaire for screening for autistic traits and ASD: the adult autism subthreshold spectrum (AdAS spectrum). There were 344 respondents diagnosed with FND with a mean age of 39.8 ± 11.6 years (female sex 90%). Eight per cent of respondents volunteered a previous diagnosis of ASD, and 24% reported a 1st-degree relative with a formal diagnosis of ASD, mostly their children. We found that 69% of respondents had scores in the AdAS spectrum indicating a clinically significant ASD and 21% indicating autistic traits. Further studies are needed to provide more evidence regarding the prevalence of ASD in people with FND and how this may influence the aetiology, treatment selection and prognosis.","['González-Herrero B', 'Morgante F', 'Pagonabarraga J', 'Stanton B', 'Edwards MJ']",2022,12,1,J Clin Med,"González-Herrero B, et al.

This case-control study documents the experience of 61 young people with past or current functional neurological disorder (FND) in relation to the COVID-19 vaccination program in Australia.
METHODS: Information about the young person's/parent's choice and response pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination was collected as part of routine clinical care or FND research program follow-up.
RESULTS: 61 young people treated for FND (47 females, mean age = 16.22 years) and 46 healthy controls (34 females, mean age = 16.37 years) were included in the study. Vaccination rates were high: 58/61 (95.1%) in the FND group and 45/46 (97.8%) in the control group. In the FND group, 2 young people (2/61, 3.3%) presented with new-onset FND following COVID-19 vaccination; two young people with resolved FND reported an FND relapse (2/36, 5.56%); and two young people with unresolved FND (2/20, 10.0%) reported an FND exacerbation. In the control group no FND symptoms were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute-onset FND symptoms following COVID-19 vaccination are uncommon in the general population.

METHODS: Four databases were searched, and a consultation exercise was conducted to retrieve relevant records dated from September 2010 to September 2020. Articles documenting diagnostic methods, treatments or interventions, or the experiences and perspectives of patients and healthcare workers in the clinical management of FND were included.
RESULTS: In total, 2756 records were retrieved, with 162 included in this review. The diagnostic methods reported predominantly included positive clinical signs, v-EEG and EEG. Psychological treatments and medication were the most reported treatments. Mixed findings of the effectiveness of CBT were found. Haloperidol, physiotherapy and scripted diagnosis were found to be effective in reducing FND symptoms. Several facilitators and barriers for patients accessing treatment for FND were reported.
CONCLUSION: The literature describing the clinical management for FND has increased considerably in recent times. A wide variety of diagnostic tools and treatments and interventions were found, with more focus being placed on tests that confirm a diagnosis than 'rule-out' tests. The main treatment type found in this review was medication. This review revealed that there is a lack of high-quality evidence and reflects the need for official clinical guidelines for FND, providing healthcare workers and patients the support needed to navigate the process to diagnose and manage FND.","['Varley D', 'Sweetman J', 'Brabyn S', 'Lagos D', 'van der Feltz-Cornelis C']",2023,165,,J Psychosom Res,"Varley D, et al.

36547718,The natural history of terms describing functional (neurological) disorders in the medical literature of the last 60 years.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorders (FND), a subtype of functional disorders (FD), are a frequent motive for neurology referrals. The various presentations and the unknown physiopathology of FD have led to the multiplication of terms describing these disorders over the years.
METHODS: We examined the FD-related articles published from 1960 to 2020 in PubMed and PsycINFO databases. We searched for: psychogenic, somatization, somatoform, medically unexplained symptoms, hysteria, conversion disorder, dissociative, functional neurological disorder, and functional disorder. Use rates in the title, abstract, keyword, or MeSH fields were collected over successive 5-year periods. After correcting for off-topic results, we examined proportional distribution over time, term associations, and disciplinary fields (neurology and psychiatry). Term impact was estimated via H-index and number of citations.
RESULTS: We found that none of the terms is prevailing in the recent medical literature. We observed three trends in the use rates: stability, increase, and decrease of use over time. While most of the terms were present in a stable proportion of the publications, hysteria and psychogenic lost popularity over time. We found a differential preference for terminology between disciplines. Functional neurological disorder showed the highest citation impact, yielding 10% of highly cited publications.
CONCLUSION: We found a dynamic and evolving use of the different terms describing FD in the last 60 years. Despite the tendency to use the term functional in the recent highly cited publications, its low prevalence and coexistence with several other terms suggest that a precise, explanatory and non-offensive term remains yet to be found.","['Bratanov C', 'Hot P', 'Vercueil L']",2023,270,4,J Neurol,"Bratanov C, et al.

36519449,A meta-ethnographic synthesis of the experiences of stigma amongst people with functional neurological disorder.,"PURPOSE: Functional neurological disorder (FND) causes many neurological symptoms and significant disability. It is often misunderstood by medical professionals and the public meaning stigma is regularly reported. The aim of this review was to synthesise the qualitative findings in the literature to develop a more in-depth understanding of how people with FND experience stigma to inform future interventions.
METHOD: This review used a meta-ethnography approach. Five databases were searched (PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) in February 2021 and updated in July 2022 for qualitative papers in FND. Included papers were critically assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) checklist. Data were analysed and synthesised utilising meta-ethnography.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Sixteen papers were included in the final synthesis. Four major themes emerged: stigmatized by delegitimization; stigmatized by social exclusion and rejection; coping with stigma; and stigma and identity. The results identified negative, stigmatizing attitudes towards people experiencing FND symptoms in a variety of contexts including healthcare and other social institutions. The effects of stigma led to further exclusion for participants and appeared to trigger coping styles that led to additional difficulty. Stigma is a key part of the illness experience of FND and needs to be addressed.","['Foley C', 'Kirkby A', 'Eccles FJR']",2022,,,Disabil Rehabil,"Foley C, et al.

36458126,Toward a possible trauma subtype of functional neurological disorder: Impact on symptom severity and physical health.,"BACKGROUND: As a group, individuals with functional neurological disorder (FND) report an approximately 3-fold increase in adverse life experiences (ALEs) compared to healthy controls. In patients with FND, studies have identified a positive correlation between symptom severity and the magnitude of ALEs. While not all individuals with FND report ALEs, such findings raise the possibility of a trauma-subtype of FND.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated if patients with FND, with or without probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or significant childhood maltreatment, differed in their symptom severity and physical health.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with FND were recruited (functional seizures, 
RESULTS: Patients with FND and probable PTSD (
CONCLUSION: This study provides support for a possible trauma-subtype of FND. Future research should investigate the neurobiological and treatment relevance of a FND trauma-subtype, as well as continuing to delineate clinical characteristics and mechanisms in individuals with FND that lack a history of ALEs.","['Paredes-Echeverri S', 'Guthrie AJ', 'Perez DL']",2022,13,,Front Psychiatry,"Paredes-Echeverri S, et al.

36451595,Dissociation and its biological and clinical associations in functional neurological disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have reported elevated rates of dissociative symptoms and comorbid dissociative disorders in functional neurological disorder (FND); however, a comprehensive review is lacking.
AIMS: To systematically review the severity of dissociative symptoms and prevalence of comorbid dissociative disorders in FND and summarise their biological and clinical associations.
METHOD: We searched Embase, PsycInfo and MEDLINE up to June 2021, combining terms for FND and dissociation. Studies were eligible if reporting dissociative symptom scores or rates of comorbid dissociative disorder in FND samples. Risk of bias was appraised using modified Newcastle-Ottawa criteria. The findings were synthesised qualitatively and dissociative symptom scores were included in a meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42020173263).
RESULTS: Seventy-five studies were eligible (FND 
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potential clinical utility of assessing patients with FND for dissociative symptomatology. However, fewer studies investigated FND samples with motor symptoms and heterogeneity between studies and risk of bias were high. Rigorous investigation of the prevalence, features and mechanistic relevance of dissociation in FND is needed.","['Campbell MC', 'Smakowski A', 'Rojas-Aguiluz M', 'Goldstein LH', 'Cardeña E', 'Nicholson TR', 'Reinders AATS', 'Pick S']",2022,9,1,BJPsych Open,"Campbell MC, et al.

Outcome related factors are not well known. With objective to study short-term outcome of FND, prospective, longitudinal, nine months follow-up study of 6-16 years was planned. Socioeconomic, clinical variables, I.Q. and personality traits at baseline and new psychiatric/physical illness, psychosocial factors and comorbidities during follow-up were assessed. Out of 68 children, scholastic (64.7%) and family problems (23.5%) were common psychosocial factors. After nine months,73% achieved remission. Reasons for non-remission were persistence of psychosocial factors and psychiatric comorbidities.

36362696,Diagnosis and Management of Functional Tic-Like Phenomena.,"Over the past 3 years, a global phenomenon has emerged characterized by the sudden onset and frequently rapid escalation of tics and tic-like movements and phonations. These symptoms have occurred not only in youth known to have tics or Tourette syndrome (TS), but also, and more notably, in youth with no prior history of tics. The Tourette Association of America (TAA) convened an international, multidisciplinary working group to better understand this apparent presentation of functional neurological disorder (FND) and its relationship to TS. Here, we review and summarize the literature relevant to distinguish the two, with recommendations to clinicians for diagnosis and management. Finally, we highlight areas for future emphasis and research.","['Malaty IA', 'Anderson S', 'Bennett SM', 'Budman CL', 'Coffey BJ', 'Coffman KA', 'Greenberg E', 'McGuire JF', 'Müller-Vahl KR', 'Okun MS', 'Quezada J', 'Robichaux-Viehoever A', 'Black KJ']",2022,11,21,J Clin Med,"Malaty IA, et al.

36311548,"Challenges to the Diagnosis of Functional Neurological Disorder: Feigning, Intentionality, and Responsibility.","The diagnosis of Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) requires differentiation from other neurologic diseases/syndromes, and from the comparatively rare diagnosis of feigning (Malingering and Factitious Disorder). Analyzing the process of diagnosing FND reveals a necessary element of presumption, which I propose underlies some of the uncertainty, discomfort, and stigma associated with this diagnosis. A conflict between the neurologist's natural social cognition and professional judgement (cognitive dissonance) can be understood by applying a framework originally designed for the determination of moral responsibility. Understanding the source of this cognitive dissonance may effect its alleviation, and in turn, allow more compassionate treatment of patients with FND.",['Mason XL'],2023,16,1,Neuroethics,"Mason XL.

36205929,Compassion-Focused Therapy for an Older Adult with Motor Functional Neurological Disorder: A Case Study.,"OBJECTIVES: Motor functional neurological disorder (mFND) is a condition where individuals may experience difficulties such as tremors, gait impairments, and paralysis which are not explained by identified structural damage to the brain. Studies on chronic conditions have suggested that psychological interventions such as compassion-focused therapy (CFT) may be effective in improving well-being in people with mFND. However, no evidence is currently available on psychotherapy for older people with mFND.
METHODS: A 12-session CFT intervention was delivered to an 81-year-old British male with mFND. Standardized measures were administered at baseline and post-intervention.
RESULTS: At post-intervention, a 30% decrease in perceived psychological impact of mFND was found, along with clinically significant changes in anxiety and depression. Good levels of feasibility and acceptability were also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of CFT for psychological difficulties linked with mFND, as well as the first evidence for any psychotherapy with an older adult with mFND.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: CFT shows the potential to be effective, feasible, and acceptable for treating difficulties linked with mFND in older people. However, further high-quality investigations based on experimental designs are needed to build on the present preliminary findings.","['Zarotti N', 'Poz R', 'Fisher P']",2023,46,3,Clin Gerontol,"Zarotti N, et al.

It is recognized that FND may present at onset or during the course of other neurological diseases (functional comorbidity).
CASES: We report a clinical series of three patients who initially presented positive signs of a functional movement disorder (FMD) and were later diagnosed with a Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). All patients presented with unilateral functional tremor, two patients also had functional limb weakness. All patients progressed to an asymmetric corticobasal syndrome, fulfilling clinical criteria of CJD. They had a rapid progression and died within 2-3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: FND may be the initial clinical presentation of neurodegenerative diseases reflecting a dysfunction across brain circuits that are involved in the pathophysiology of FND. A positive diagnosis of FND is essential as it is an adequate examination and a close follow-up of these patients in neurology clinics.","['Gómez-Mayordomo V', 'Kojović M', 'López-Valdés E', 'Alonso-Frech F', 'Horga A', 'Fernández-Rodríguez R', 'Pareés I']",2023,270,2,J Neurol,"Gómez-Mayordomo V, et al.

36172265,Management of Functional Seizures and Functional Movement Disorder: A Cross-Sectional Comparative Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Functional neurological disorders (FND) are conditions that cause to alterations in nervous system functions. They are disabling and impair the quality of life of patients but that are potentially reversible provided they have specific management. Functional seizures (FS) and functional movement disorder (FMD) are among the most common subtypes. Studies suggest a strong overlap between FS and FMD; however, there are still no cross-sectional studies that compare the management between these two conditions. Thus, our focus was to carry out a research that compares how these two subtypes of FND are being managed, in addition to assessing rates of understanding and acceptance of a diagnosis of FND.
METHODS: It is a cross-sectional study with data collected from medical records and interviews with two patients' groups (FS and FMD) treated from a FND clinic of the public health system of Brazil.
RESULTS: From 105 medical records of patients with FND analyzed, 60 participants were eligible and agreed to participate in this research, being FS (n = 31) and FMD (n = 29). Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found in the use of antiseizure (FS > FMD), opioids (FMD > FS), multi-professional follow-up (FMD > FS) and rates of understanding and acceptance of an FND diagnosis (FMD > FS). Similarities were found in sociodemographic profiles, medical follow-up, psychiatric comorbidities and use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers between two conditions.
CONCLUSION: More similarities than differences in management were found between FS and FMD. Similarities may be related to overlaps in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Differences may be related to specific issues of each patient and condition. Regardless of the group, patients who perform psychotherapeutic follow-up have higher rates of understanding and acceptance of an FND diagnosis.","['Dal Pasquale BG', 'Teive HAG', 'von der Heyde MD', 'Dal Pasquale LFA']",2022,18,,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,"Dal Pasquale BG, et al.

36135345,The borderland of multiple sclerosis and functional neurological disorder: A call for clinical research and vigilance.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) have attracted much attention from the neurological medical community over the last decades as new developments in neurosciences have reduced stigma around these by showing brain network dysfunctions. An overlap with other neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) is well known by clinicians but there is a lack of clinical and fundamental research in this field to better define diagnosis and therapeutic decisions, as well as a lack of deep understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.
AIM: We aimed to provide a critical commentary on the state of knowledge about the borderland between FNDs and MS.
METHODS: We based our commentary on a joint point of view between an FND specialist and an MS expert.
RESULTS: A brief review of the previous literature and relevant new studies covering the overlap between FNDs and MS is presented, along with suggestions for future research directions.
CONCLUSION: There are clear diagnostic criteria for both FNDs and MS and a strict application of these will help better diagnosis and prevent unnecessary treatment escalation in MS or absence of referral to multimodal therapy in FND. Better teaching of younger neurologists is needed as well as prospective research focusing on pathophysiology.","['Aybek S', 'Chan A']",2023,30,1,Eur J Neurol,Aybek S and Chan A.

36075980,Functional neurological disorder and placebo and nocebo effects: shared mechanisms.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is characterized by neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a structural neurological cause. Among the different aetiological models that have been proposed for FND, of note is the Bayesian predictive coding model, which posits that perception relies on top-down cortical predictions (priors) to infer the source of incoming sensory information. This model can also apply to non-pathological experiences, such as placebo and nocebo effects, wherein sensory information is shaped by prior expectations and learning. To date, most studies of the relationship between placebo and nocebo effects and FND have focused on the use of placebos for diagnosis and treatment of FND. Here, we propose that this relationship might go beyond diagnosis and therapy. We develop a framework in which shared cognitive, personality and neuroanatomical factors justify the consideration of a deeper link between FND and placebo and nocebo effects. This new perspective might offer guidance for clarification of the pathogenesis of FND and for the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","['Fiorio M', 'Braga M', 'Marotta A', 'Villa-Sánchez B', 'Edwards MJ', 'Tinazzi M', 'Barbiani D']",2022,18,10,Nat Rev Neurol,"Fiorio M, et al.

The disease arises from aberrant neural computation, and its diagnosis is made upon positive clinical features. FND has emerged as a challenge to healthcare, as clinicians often have limited instructions in assessing it during their career, mainly when there are preexisting organic entities. Here we discuss an inmate whose diagnosis of zolpidem withdrawal seizure is delayed due to co-existing functional mimics and eventually led to an unfavorable outcome. We also review and summarize the current consensus on FND diagnosis and management.

36002964,Altered resting-state neural networks in children and adolescents with functional neurological disorder.,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies with adults suggest that aberrant communication between neural networks underpins functional neurological disorder (FND). The current study adopts a data-driven approach to investigate the extent that functional resting-state networks are disrupted in a pediatric mixed-FND cohort.
METHODS: 31 children with mixed FND and 33 age- and sex-matched healthy controls completed resting-state fMRI scans. Whole-brain independent component analysis (pFWE < 0.05) was then used to identify group differences in resting-state connectivity. Self-report measures included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Early Life Stress Questionnaire (ELSQ). Resting-state heart rate (HR) and cortisol-awakening response (CAR) were available in a subset.
RESULTS: Children with FND showed wide-ranging connectivity changes in eight independent components corresponding to eight resting-state neural networks: language networks (IC6 and IC1), visual network, frontoparietal network, salience network, dorsal attention network, cerebellar network, and sensorimotor network. Children whose clinical presentation included functional seizures (vs children with other FND symptoms) showed greater connectivity decreases in the frontoparietal and dorsal attentional networks. Subjective distress (total DASS score), autonomic arousal (indexed by HR), and HPA dysregulation (attenuated/reversed CAR) contributed to changes in neural network connectivity. Children with FND (vs controls) reported more subjective distress (total DASS score) and more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) across their lifespan.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with FND demonstrate changes in resting-state connectivity. Identified network alterations underpin a broad range of functions typically disrupted in children with FND. This study complements the adult literature by suggesting that FND in children and adolescents emerges in the context of their lived experience and that it reflects aberrant communication across neural networks.","['Rai S', 'Foster S', 'Griffiths KR', 'Breukelaar IA', 'Kozlowska K', 'Korgaonkar MS']",2022,35,,Neuroimage Clin,"Rai S, et al.

35989570,Higher Health Service Costs Associated With Delayed Diagnosis of Functional Neurological Disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is frequently encountered in clinical practice but commonly misdiagnosed, which might lead to higher direct costs for the health care system. The investigators analyzed the direct costs associated with the diagnosis of FND compared with costs associated with other neurological conditions and explored possible cost trends related to the clinical and demographic features of FND.
METHODS: Consecutive patients attending a general neurology clinic were recruited and underwent a structured assessment aimed to collect information pertaining to their demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as data regarding their prior diagnostic processes (e.g., the number of consulted specialists, number and type of investigations, emergency department visits, etc.). The costs were hence calculated and compared between the study groups.
RESULTS: A total of 155 consecutive patients were recruited; of these, 18.6% had FND, 55.84% had one or more other neurological disorder (OND), and 27.10% presented with comorbid FND and OND. The total prediagnostic costs (in euros [€]) were higher in the FND group compared with the OND group (median=€289, interquartile range [IQR] €385 vs. median=€98, IQR €216; Mann-Whitney U=879.5, p=0.04). There was a higher diagnostic delay in the FND group compared with the OND group (median=48 months, IQR 60 months vs. median=12 months, IQR 6 months; Mann-Whitney U=162.00, p<0.01). Diagnostic delay significantly correlated with the total costs in the entire study sample (Spearman's ρ=0.25, p=0.003) but more strongly in the FND group (Spearman's ρ=0.81, p<0.001). In the FND group, higher numbers of investigations and costs were associated with the presence of a physiological or psychological trigger and multiple symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Delayed diagnosis of FND significantly affects health care system costs, and raising awareness about FND to improve the diagnostic process and outcomes is necessary.","['Cuoco S', 'Scannapieco S', 'Carotenuto I', 'Picillo M', 'Pellecchia MT', 'Barone P', 'Erro R']",2023,35,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Cuoco S, et al.

35930973,Anaesthesia and the development of functional neurological disorder: A systematic review and case series.,"OBJECTIVE: There are reports of functional neurological disorder (FND) developing after anaesthesia, though separating any aetiological role from other possible factors is challenging. We aimed to systematically review all published cases of post-anaesthetic FND to see if any common factors supported an anaesthetic role. We also aimed to identify all cases of post-anaesthetic FND arising in our FND clinic, to obtain an estimate of its frequency.
METHODS: For the review, a systematic search for published cases of FND developing within 48 h of anaesthesia was conducted in June 2022. For the case series, the medical records of all patients attending an FND clinic in Melbourne between 2017 and 2019 were examined, and all cases with FND within 48 h of anaesthesia extracted.
RESULTS: 36 published cases were identified for the review. Sixteen described preceding stressors and 16 psychiatric diagnoses, including 8 with previous FND. Thirty-two (92%) had undergone general anaesthesia, most commonly for obstetric procedures. Motor/sensory loss was the most common presentation, followed by seizures and coma. Most (80.5%) developed symptoms immediately on induction or cessation of anaesthesia. For the case series, 8 of 107 clinic patients (7.5%), developed FND within 48 h of anaesthesia. All had previous psychiatric diagnoses, including 3 with previous FND. Three underwent general anaesthesia and 3 procedural sedation, with seizures the most common presentation. All developed symptoms immediately on induction or cessation of anaesthesia.
CONCLUSION: These cases provide some support for an aetiological role for anaesthesia: there is evidence for an anaesthetic 'model' for the symptoms of FND that arise, they largely arise with the onset or termination of anaesthesia, and they arise most frequently during general anaesthesia or sedation.","['Huepe-Artigas D', 'Singh P', 'Weinberg L', 'Kanaan RAA']",2022,78,,Gen Hosp Psychiatry,"Huepe-Artigas D, et al.

FND is often associated with weakness and paralysis, yet we could not locate a case depicting symptoms severe enough to cause venous thromboembolism. We present a patient diagnosed with FND who subsequently developed deep vein thromboses (DVT) of the bilateral lower extremities. She was placed on systemic anticoagulation and her functional symptoms improved with physical therapy (PT). This case describes the need for early PT to improve function and prevent complications related to functional immobility.","['Othman A', 'Cecchini A', 'Eftaiha A', 'Nwosisi N', 'Pierce D']",2022,14,6,Cureus,"Othman A, et al.

35863918,Functional Neurological Disorders in the medical education: An urgent need to fill the gaps.,"BACKGROUND: FND is a disabling disease that accounts for 5 to 10% of the reason for consultation in neurology. However, young physicians often say they have little or no training in their management.
AIM: The aim of the present study was to assess whether French junior neurologists, psychiatrists and physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) specialists received teaching on FND during their medical studies, including the residency, and to evaluate their knowledge and perception of the disorder.
METHODS: The survey was distributed by the means of a Google form questionnaire to specialist registrars and young specialists with the help of resident's organizations.
RESULTS: 568 respondents from the 3 specialties were included in the study. Most respondents (72.4%) were specialists registrars. Almost half of the respondents (45.5%) answered they never received any teaching on FND, and only 20.5% of them knew the Hoover's sign, a positive sign specific of functional weakness. A large majority of respondents felt they were not sufficiently trained in FND (87.9%), and they did not have sufficient knowledge of these disorders (85.3%).
DISCUSSION: Better training would allow clinicians to make a diagnosis earlier, to better explain it to patients, and to limit the costs associated with diagnosis delays. A better training of clinicians about FND would also improve the prognosis of patients, as early diagnosis and good explanation is associated with a better prognosis.
CONCLUSION: This survey shows that there is a gap about FND in the training programs in the medical studies and during the specialization training of young doctors in France.","['de Liège A', 'Carle G', 'Hingray C', 'Lehn A', 'Autier L', 'Degos B', 'Garcin B']",2022,178,8,Rev Neurol (Paris),"de Liège A, et al.

35858632,"Functional Neurological Disorders: Clinical Spectrum, Diagnosis, and Treatment.","BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) are common but often misdiagnosed.
REVIEW SUMMARY: The incidence of FNDs is between 4 and 12 per 100,000, comparable to multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and it is the second most common diagnosis in neurology clinics. Some clues in the history are sudden onset, intermittent time course, variability of manifestation over time, childhood trauma, and history of other somatic symptoms. Anxiety and depression are common, but not necessarily more than in the general population. Although there are no tests currently capable of demonstrating whether symptoms are willfully produced, there may not be a clear categorical difference between voluntary and involuntary symptoms. The prognosis of an FND is linked to early diagnosis and symptom duration, but unfortunately, the majority of the patients are diagnosed after considerable delays.
CONCLUSIONS: A positive diagnosis of FNDs can be made on the basis of history and neurological signs without reliance on psychological stressors. Past sensitizing events and neurobiological abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of FNDs. Physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination are helpful in the treatment.","['Mishra A', 'Pandey S']",2022,27,5,Neurologist,"Mishra A and Pandey S.

However, the magnitude of this effect has not been estimated in these populations nor has the potential moderating influence of methodological limitations on effect size variability across studies. This study assessed whether patients with DDs, trauma- and stressor-related disorders (TSDs), and functional neurological disorder (FND) display elevated hypnotic suggestibility. A systematic literature search identified 20 datasets. A random-effects meta-analysis revealed that patients displayed greater hypnotic suggestibility than controls, Hedges's g = 0.92 [0.66, 1.18]. This effect was observed in all subgroups but was most pronounced in the DDs. Although there was some evidence for publication bias, a bias-corrected estimate of the group effect remained significant, g = 0.57 [0.30, 0.85]. Moderation analyses did not yield evidence for a link between effect sizes and methodological limitations. These results demonstrate that DDs and related conditions are characterized by elevated hypnotic suggestibility and have implications for the mechanisms, risk factors, and treatment of dissociative psychopathology.","['Wieder L', 'Brown RJ', 'Thompson T', 'Terhune DB']",2022,139,,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"Wieder L, et al.

35752061,Multi-centre classification of functional neurological disorders based on resting-state functional connectivity.,"BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from functional neurological disorder (FND) experience disabling neurological symptoms not caused by an underlying classical neurological disease (such as stroke or multiple sclerosis). The diagnosis is made based on reliable positive clinical signs, but clinicians often require additional time- and cost consuming medical tests and examinations. Resting-state functional connectivity (RS FC) showed its potential as an imaging-based adjunctive biomarker to help distinguish patients from healthy controls and could represent a ""rule-in"" procedure to assist in the diagnostic process. However, the use of RS FC depends on its applicability in a multi-centre setting, which is particularly susceptible to inter-scanner variability. The aim of this study was to test the robustness of a classification approach based on RS FC in a multi-centre setting.
METHODS: This study aimed to distinguish 86 FND patients from 86 healthy controls acquired in four different centres using a multivariate machine learning approach based on whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity. First, previously published results were replicated in each centre individually (intra-centre cross-validation) and its robustness across inter-scanner variability was assessed by pooling all the data (pooled cross-validation). Second, we evaluated the generalizability of the method by using data from each centre once as a test set, and the data from the remaining centres as a training set (inter-centre cross-validation).
RESULTS: FND patients were successfully distinguished from healthy controls in the replication step (accuracy of 74%) as well as in each individual additional centre (accuracies of 73%, 71% and 70%). The pooled cross validation confirmed that the classifier was robust with an accuracy of 72%. The results survived post-hoc adjustment for anxiety, depression, psychotropic medication intake, and symptom severity. The most discriminant features involved the angular- and supramarginal gyri, sensorimotor cortex, cingular- and insular cortex, and hippocampal regions. The inter-centre validation step did not exceed chance level (accuracy below 50%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the applicability of RS FC to correctly distinguish FND patients from healthy controls in different centres and its robustness against inter-scanner variability. In order to generalize its use across different centres and aim for clinical application, future studies should work towards optimization of acquisition parameters and include neurological and psychiatric control groups presenting with similar symptoms.","['Weber S', 'Heim S', 'Richiardi J', 'Van De Ville D', 'Serranová T', 'Jech R', 'Marapin RS', 'Tijssen MAJ', 'Aybek S']",2022,35,,Neuroimage Clin,"Weber S, et al.

35578800,Views on Using Psychoactive Substances to Self-Manage Functional Neurological Disorder: Online Patient Survey Results.,"Objective: Functional neurological disorder (FND) causes a high burden of disability and distress. Although it is a common disorder, there is a pressing need for improved access to evidence-based treatments. With difficulties in finding effective treatment, some people with FND may seek alternative means of symptom relief, such as legal and illicit psychoactive substances, although the prevalence and nature of such self-management strategies are currently unclear. Additionally, psychoactive substances may represent novel treatment research opportunities, particularly for those with suboptimal improvement. The investigators examined the use of self-management techniques, as well as perspectives on novel therapies, in this patient population. Methods: An online survey was created to assess self-management strategies and views on novel treatments for FND, including psychedelic therapy. The survey was accessible for 1 month, and respondents were recruited internationally through social media and patient groups. A total of 1,048 respondents from 16 countries completed the survey. Results: Almost half (46%) of 980 respondents reported having tried legal psychoactive substances for the management of their FND symptoms and, on average, nicotine, alcohol, and cannabidiol were reported as modestly effective. Additionally, 15% of respondents reported having used illicit substances, mostly cannabis, to manage FND, with the majority reporting moderate effectiveness and experiencing no or minimal physical (90%) and psychological (95%) sequelae. Many respondents (46%) reported that they would be willing to try medically supervised psychedelic therapy (with 19% of respondents ambivalent) if it were found to be safe and effective. Conclusions: Many people with FND seek alternative means of symptom management outside usual medical care, including legal and illicit psychoactive substances. Further research exploring novel treatment options, such as psychedelics, in FND may be warranted.","['Butler M', 'Seynaeve M', 'Bradley-Westguard A', 'Bao J', 'Crawshaw A', 'Pick S', 'Edwards M', 'Nicholson T', 'Rucker J']",2023,35,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Butler M, et al.

35484819,Functional Cognitive Disorder: Differential Diagnosis of Common Clinical Presentations.,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive symptoms in the absence of neurological disease are common. Functional cognitive disorder (FCD) has been conceptualized as a cognitive subtype of functional neurological disorder. Although FCD is understood as different from exaggerated or feigned cognitive complaints, previous accounts have provided little practical advice on how FCD can be separated from factitious or malingered cognitive complaints. Also, the distinction of FCD from other medical or mental health disorders that impact on cognition is an area of ongoing study and debate. Diagnostic precision is important to prevent iatrogenesis and for the development of needed treatment protocols.
METHOD: We summarize the current literature and present seven anonymized case vignettes to characterize the challenges in this area and develop proposals for solutions.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the limitations of categorical diagnostic systems, we position FCD as distinct from feigning and cognitive symptoms of psychiatric disorders, although with overlapping features. We set out typical clinical features and neuropsychological profiles for each category of cognitive disorder and a statistical method to analyze performance validity tests/effort tests to assist in determining feigned or invalid responding.","['Kemp S', 'Kapur N', 'Graham CD', 'Reuber M']",2022,37,6,Arch Clin Neuropsychol,"Kemp S, et al.

A growing number of reports indicate that functional symptoms may follow Covid-19 vaccination, similar to those observed with other vaccines previously. We review previously reported cases of FND following vaccination against Covid-19 and present three additional cases. While two patients presented to the Emergency Department with functional movement disorders, one patient presented with protracted limb weakness and sensory dysfunction. The superficial resemblance to Guillain-Barré syndrome, a known but uncommon complication of vaccination prompted an extensive workup. Clinicians need to convey the diagnosis of FND in clear and unequivocal terms to facilitate institution of appropriate therapy and rehabilitation, but importantly also to dispel any doubts in the minds of the public regarding the safety of the available vaccines. Given the presence of significant vaccine hesitancy in many countries, this is critical to the success of the global immunisation effort.","['de Souza A', 'Jacques R', 'Mohan S']",2023,50,3,Can J Neurol Sci,"de Souza A, et al.

It has been postulated that poor integration and modulation of sensory information with cognitive, affective and behavioral processes may play a role in the pathophysiology of FND. In this article, we first succinctly review the role for occupational therapy (OT) in the multidisciplinary therapeutic approach to managing patients with FND. After highlighting previously published data identifying sensory processing difficulties in patients with FND, we subsequently outline the components of the sensory-based outpatient OT program for FND at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Here, we detail how occupational therapists assess and treat sensory modulation difficulties with the aid of resources like the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile (AASP), The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), and the Sensory-Motor Preference Checklist. We then report on 2 clinical cases representative of the sensory modulation difficulties endorsed by some patients with FND, illustrating how developing an individualized, sensory-based treatment plan can help improve functional neurological symptoms and overall participation in activities of daily living. Prospective, controlled research is needed to further operationalize OT-based sensory modulation interventions, as well as define the tolerability and efficacy of this intervention for pediatric and adult populations with FND.","['MacLean J', 'Finkelstein SA', 'Paredes-Echeverri S', 'Perez DL', 'Ranford J']",2022,41,,Semin Pediatr Neurol,"MacLean J, et al.

35450671,Diagnosis of Functional Weakness and Functional Gait Disorders in Children and Adolescents.,"Functional neurological disorder is neurological dysfunction not primarily explained by pathophysiologic or structural abnormalities and can present in children and adolescents with limb weakness, gait abnormality, non-epileptic seizures or sensory changes. In this review article we focus primarily on the diagnosis of functional limb weakness and functional gait disorders, and how to differentiate functional neurological disorders from structural or pathologic neurological presentations of weakness or gait disturbance. Detailed history and attentive observation of a patient outside of the formal neurological examination can be pertinent to identifying inconsistency and incongruency in keeping with functional neurological presentations. Understanding of structural and physiologic neurological pathology is required to identify non-anatomical and non-pathological features consistent with a diagnosis of functional neurological disorder. Diagnosis is made on recognition of positive clinical features of a functional disorder on examination and is not based primarily on exclusion of a pathologic neurological disorder. Specific tests can be performed to elicit pathognomonic findings supportive of a diagnosis of functional limb weakness and gait disorders.","['West E', 'Shah U']",2022,41,,Semin Pediatr Neurol,West E and Shah U.

The history of FND and its prescientific predecessor, hysteria, is complex and deeply rooted in sexism. Key moments in this history have contributed to the advancement of understanding in functional disorders that neurologists should be aware of. Although pediatric FND has a much less extensive historical literature, there are many parallels between it and the initial interest in hysteria by Charcot and other early modern neurologists. This was followed by waning neurological attention as psychiatrists promoted conversion disorder in the early 1900s.

35450664,The Role of Physiotherapy in the Management of Functional Neurological Disorder in Children and Adolescents.,"Children and adolescents with functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) present with symptoms of impaired motor and sensory function. FND involves complex interactions between the brain, mind, body, and lived experience of the child. The gold standard for treatment is therefore a holistic, biopsychosocial approach with multimodal interventions delivered by a multidisciplinary team. In this narrative review we examine the role of physiotherapy in managing FND in children. We searched Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed (back to 2000) for relevant physiotherapy articles and also manually searched their reference lists. Two review articles and ten observational studies were identified. Data were extracted concerning the type of study, therapies involved, outcome measures, and comorbid mental health outcomes. FND symptoms resolved in 85% to 95% of the patients, and about two-thirds returned to full-time school after completing the multidisciplinary intervention. Ongoing mental health concerns at follow-up were associated with poorer functional outcomes. Key themes included the following: use of psychological interventions embedded in the physiotherapy intervention; integration of play, music, and dance; role of physical exercise in modulating physiological, neural, and endocrine systems; need for FND-specific outcome measures; ethical issues pertaining to randomized trials; and need to develop alternate study methodologies for assessing combined treatments. Clinical vignettes were included to highlight a range of physiotherapy interventions. In conclusion, the emerging literature suggests that physiotherapy for children with FND is a useful intervention for improving motor dysfunction and for addressing other concurrent issues such as physical deconditioning, neuroprotection, chronic pain, disturbed sleep, anxiety and depression, and resilience building.","['Kim YN', 'Gray N', 'Jones A', 'Scher S', 'Kozlowska K']",2022,41,,Semin Pediatr Neurol,"Kim YN, et al.

35430029,Functional neurological disorder: new subtypes and shared mechanisms.,"Functional neurological disorder is common in neurological practice. A new approach to the positive diagnosis of this disorder focuses on recognisable patterns of genuinely experienced symptoms and signs that show variability within the same task and between different tasks over time. Psychological stressors are common risk factors for functional neurological disorder, but are often absent. Four entities-functional seizures, functional movement disorders, persistent perceptual postural dizziness, and functional cognitive disorder-show similarities in aetiology and pathophysiology and are variants of a disorder at the interface between neurology and psychiatry. All four entities have distinctive features and can be diagnosed with the support of clinical neurophysiological studies and other biomarkers. The pathophysiology of functional neurological disorder includes overactivity of the limbic system, the development of an internal symptom model as part of a predictive coding framework, and dysfunction of brain networks that gives movement the sense of voluntariness. Evidence supports tailored multidisciplinary treatment that can involve physical and psychological therapy approaches.","['Hallett M', 'Aybek S', 'Dworetzky BA', 'McWhirter L', 'Staab JP', 'Stone J']",2022,21,6,Lancet Neurol,"Hallett M, et al.

35429701,To the emergency room and back again: Circular healthcare pathways for acute functional neurological disorders.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Studies of Functional Neurological Disorders (FND) are usually outpatient-based. To inform service development, we aimed to describe patient pathways through healthcare events, and factors affecting risk of emergency department (ED) reattendance, for people presenting acutely with FND.
METHODS: Acute neurology/stroke teams at a UK city hospital were contacted regularly over 8 months to log FND referrals. Electronic documentation was then reviewed for hospital healthcare events over the preceding 8 years. Patient pathways through healthcare events over time were mapped, and mixed effects logistic regression was performed for risk of ED reattendance within 1 year.
RESULTS: In 8 months, 212 patients presented acutely with an initial referral suggesting FND. 20% had subsequent alternative diagnoses, but 162 patients were classified from documentation review as possible (17%), probable (28%) or definite (55%) FND. In the preceding 8 years, these 162 patients had 563 ED attendances and 1693 inpatient nights with functional symptoms, but only 26% were referred for psychological therapy, only 66% had a documented diagnosis, and care pathways looped around ED. Three better practice pathway steps were each associated with lower risk of subsequent ED reattendance: documented FND diagnosis (OR = 0.32, p = 0.004), referral to clinical psychology (OR = 0.35, p = 0.04) and outpatient neurology follow-up (OR = 0.25, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: People that present acutely to a UK city hospital with FND tend to follow looping pathways through hospital healthcare events, centred around ED, with low rates of documented diagnosis and referral for psychological therapy. When better practice occurs, it is associated with lower risk of ED reattendance.","['Williams S', 'Southall C', 'Haley S', 'Ba Dhafari T', 'Kemp S', 'Relton SD', 'Alty JE', 'Johnson O', 'Graham CD', 'Maguire M']",2022,437,,J Neurol Sci,"Williams S, et al.

FND is common in pediatric practice. It places substantial strains on children, families, and health care systems. Treatment begins at assessment, which requires the following: the 
RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past decade, three treatment approaches-Retraining and Control Therapy (ReACT), other cognitive-behavioral therapies, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation-have been evaluated in the USA, Canada, and Australia. Of children treated in such programs, 63 - 95% showed full resolution of FND symptoms. The common thread across the programs is their biopsychosocial approach-consideration of biological, psychological, relational, and school-related factors that contribute to the child's clinical presentation.
SUMMARY: Current research strongly supports a biopsychosocial approach to pediatric FND and provides a foundation for a stepped approach to treatment. Stepped care is initially tailored to the needs of the individual child (and family) based on the pattern and severity of FND presentation. The level of care and type of intervention may then be adjusted to consider the child's response, over time, to treatment or treatment combinations. Future research is needed to confirm effective treatment targets, to inform the development of stepped care, and to improve methodologies that can assess the efficacy of stepped-care interventions.","['Vassilopoulos A', 'Mohammad S', 'Dure L', 'Kozlowska K', 'Fobian AD']",2022,24,2,Curr Treat Options Neurol,"Vassilopoulos A, et al.

35253784,"Functional neurological disorder: Extending the diagnosis to other disorders, and proposing an alternate disease term-Attentionally-modifiable disorder.","BACKGROUND: The term ""functional neurological disorder,"" or ""FND,"" applies to disorders whose occurrence of neurological symptoms fluctuate with the patient's attention to them. However, many other disorders that are not called ""FND"" nonetheless can also follow this pattern. Consequently, guidelines are unclear for diagnosing ""FND.""
OBJECTIVE: To review the neurological conditions that follow this pattern, but which have not so far been termed ""FND,"" to understand their overlap with conditions that have been termed ""FND,"" and to discuss the rationale for why FND has not been diagnosed for them.
METHOD: A systematic review of the PubMed literature registry using the terms ""fluctuation,"" ""inconsistency,"" or ""attention"" did not yield much in the way of these candidate disorders. Consequently, this review instead relied on the author's personal library of peer-reviewed studies of disorders that have resembled FND but which were not termed this way, due to his longstanding interest in this problem. Consequently, this approach was not systematic and was subjective regarding disease inclusion.
RESULTS: This review identified numerous, diverse conditions that generally involve fluctuating neurological symptoms that can vary with the person's attention to them, but which have not been called ""FND."" The literature was unclear for reasons for not referring to ""FND"" in these instances.
CONCLUSION: Most likely because of historical biases, the use of the term ""FND"" has been unnecessarily restricted. Because at its core FND is an attentionally-influenced disorder that can respond well to behavioral treatments, the field of neurological rehabilitation could benefit by extending the range of conditions that could be considered as ""FND"" and referred for similar behavioral treatments. Because the term ""FND"" has been viewed unfavorably by some patients and clinical practitioners and whose treatment is not implied, the alternative term attentionally-modifiable disorder is proposed.",['Mark VW'],2022,50,2,NeuroRehabilitation,"Mark VW.

35243288,Neurology residents' education in functional seizures.,"We report a survey of neurology residency program directors (PDs) and recent neurology residency graduates about the education provided during residency on functional seizures (FS), a subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND). The purpose of our study was to assess the education gap for neurology residents about FS since patients with FS are frequently seen by neurologists, who typically conduct the evaluation and share the findings with the patient. A survey was sent to 93 Neurology residency program directors and 71 recent graduates. We obtained a low response rate of 17%. Results of the survey revealed that the most frequent settings for education on FS were within a clinical rotation in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (68.8% of PDs and 88.7% of recent graduate respondents) and via a single didactic lecture (81.3% of PDs and 80.3% of recent graduate respondents). The majority of programs did not provide a curriculum for training and feedback on best practices in communicating the diagnosis or on evidence-based treatments. Eighteen percent of neurology residents reported not learning how to communicate the diagnosis of FS to patients, while 77% responded that they were not taught about treatment. These results illustrate a curriculum gap in what neurology residents are taught about diagnosis and management of FS (and FND). We propose a standardized model that can be adapted in residencies.","['Milligan TA', 'Yun A', 'LaFrance WC', 'Baslet G', 'Tolchin B', 'Szaflarski J', 'Wong VSS', 'Plioplys S', 'Dworetzky BA']",2022,18,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,"Milligan TA, et al.

Our current understanding of the basic epidemiological features of this condition is unclear. We aimed to describe and examine the relationship between age at onset, phenotype and gender in FMD in a large meta-analysis of published and unpublished individual patient cases. An electronic search of PubMed was conducted for studies from 1968 to 2019 according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Individual patient data were collected through a research network. We described the distribution of age of onset and how this varied by gender and motor phenotype. A one-stage meta-analysis was performed using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression, including random intercepts for country and data source. A total of 4905 individual cases were analysed (72.6% woman). The mean age at onset was 39.6 years (SD 16.1). Women had a significantly earlier age of onset than men (39.1 years vs 41.0 years). Mixed FMD (23.1%), tremor (21.6%) and weakness (18.1%) were the most common phenotypes. Compared with tremor (40.7 years), the mean ages at onset of dystonia (34.5 years) and weakness (36.4 years) were significantly younger, while gait disorders (43.2 years) had a significantly later age at onset. The interaction between gender and phenotype was not significant. FMD peaks in midlife with varying effects of gender on age at onset and phenotype. The data gives some support to 'lumping' FMD as a unitary disorder but also highlights the value in 'splitting' into individual phenotypes where relevant.","['Lidstone SC', 'Costa-Parke M', 'Robinson EJ', 'Ercoli T', 'Stone J', 'FMD GAP Study Group']",2022,93,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Lidstone SC, et al.

35213333,Intensive rehabilitation for functional motor disorders (FMD) in the United States: A review.,"BACKGROUND: Higher levels of care in the form of intensive rehabilitation may be appropriate for select patients with a diagnosis of functional motor disorder (FMD). Intensive rehabilitation, as delivered through an outpatient day program or through admission to an inpatient rehabilitation facility, can offer a greater frequency and variety of integrated clinical services than most lower levels of care.
OBJECTIVE: Higher levels of rehabilitation for FMD have not yet been well characterized in the literature. In this article, we will focus on the population of FMD patients who begin receiving care in the outpatient setting.
METHOD: In this review, we describe a range of options for higher levels of FMD care, evaluate the supporting literature, and weigh the pros and cons of each approach. Several specific examples of intensive rehabilitation programs in the United States will be described. Finally, we will consider existing health systems barriers to each of these outpatient and inpatient higher levels of care.
RESULTS: Within a stepped model of care, intensive outpatient day-programs and inpatient rehabilitation may be considered for individuals who present with complex, refractory motor deficits from FMD. For appropriately selected patients, a growing body of literature suggests that time-limited, goal-oriented intensive rehabilitation may provide an effective treatment avenue.
CONCLUSION: It remains to be determined whether treatment in intensive care settings, while more costly in the short term, could lead to greater cost savings in the long term. The prospect of telemedicine rehabilitation for FND in terms of efficacy and cost also remains to be determined.","['Polich G', 'Thompson J', 'Molton I', 'Herman S', 'LaFaver K']",2022,50,2,NeuroRehabilitation,"Polich G, et al.

35213331,The use of rhythmic auditory stimulation for functional gait disorder: A case report.,"BACKGROUND: Functional gait disorders (FGD) are a common and disabling condition. Consensus-based rehabilitation techniques for treating FGD and other functional neurological disorder presentations at large utilize a variety of therapeutic strategies, including distraction, novel approaches to movement, entrainment, stress/hypervigilance modulation, and psychotherapy.
CASE REPORT: Here we present a case of a 24-year-old woman with a complex history of anxiety, depression, left frontal astrocytoma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and FGD. During a multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation stay for FGD, the patient underwent rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) delivered by a neurologic music therapist in conjunction with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and psychotherapy.
RESULTS: The RAS intervention appeared to play a significant role in symptom resolution for this patient. Improvement in the patient's truncal displacement, foot dragging, and well as overall gait speed occurred following serial RAS trials performed over a single treatment session. Benefits persisted immediately following the intervention and upon subsequent reassessment. Although at four-year follow-up the patient's FGD symptoms remained resolved, fatigue continued to limit her ambulatory capacity and overall endurance.
CONCLUSION: RAS represents a unique therapeutic approach for treating FGD, complementary to existing consensus-based rehabilitation recommendations, and may warrant further consideration by the field.","['Hebb C', 'Raynor G', 'Perez DL', 'Nappi-Kaehler J', 'Polich G']",2022,50,2,NeuroRehabilitation,"Hebb C, et al.

35152170,Cortical thickness in default mode network hubs correlates with clinical features of dissociative seizures.,"BACKGROUND: Dissociative seizures (DS) are a common subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND) with an incompletely understood pathophysiology. Here, gray matter variations and their relationship to clinical features were investigated.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients with DS without neurological comorbidities and 43 matched clinical control patients with syncope with structural brain MRIs were identified retrospectively. FreeSurfer-based cortical thickness and FSL FIRST-based subcortical volumes were used for quantitative analyses, and all findings were age and sex adjusted, and corrected for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Groups were not statistically different in cortical thickness or subcortical volumes. For patients with DS, illness duration was inversely correlated with cortical thickness of left-sided anterior and posterior cortical midline structures (perigenual/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, superior parietal cortex, precuneus), and clusters at the left temporoparietal junction (supramarginal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus), left postcentral gyrus, and right pericalcarine cortex. Dissociative seizure duration was inversely correlated with cortical thickness in the left perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, superior/middle frontal gyri, precentral gyrus and lateral occipital cortex, along with the right isthmus-cingulate and posterior-cingulate, middle temporal gyrus, and precuneus. Seizure frequency did not show any significant correlations.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with DS, illness duration inversely correlated with cortical thickness of left-sided default mode network cortical hubs, while seizure duration correlated with left frontopolar and right posteromedial areas, among others. Etiological factors contributing to neuroanatomical variations in areas related to self-referential processing in patients with DS require more research inquiry.","['Zelinski L', 'Diez I', 'Perez DL', 'Kotz SA', 'Wellmer J', 'Schlegel U', 'Popkirov S', 'Jungilligens J']",2022,128,,Epilepsy Behav,"Zelinski L, et al.

However, a functional neurological disorder (FND) can also present with stroke-like symptoms. FND is a multifactorial condition to which biological, psychological and social factors predispose. The distinction between FND and acute ischemic stroke can be challenging, but is very important because fast reperfusion treatment is indicated for ischemic stroke. We show the specific features of FND in history and neurologic examination to pay attention to. Furthermore, we discuss the use of additional investigation to support the diagnosis. We describe two patients with an acute neurological deficit: a 34-year-old male with hemiparesis and speech disturbances due to FND, and a 51-year-old male with hemiparesis and hemi-ataxia due to ischemic stroke. These 2 patients demonstrate how challenging the distinction between FND and stroke may be.","['Lambert F', 'Uyttenboogaart M', 'Tijssen MAJ', 'Rosmalen JGM', 'Luijckx GJR']",2021,165,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Lambert F, et al.

35123242,Functional seizures are associated with cerebrovascular disease and functional stroke is more common in patients with functional seizures than epileptic seizures.,"PURPOSE: To characterize the relationship between functional seizures (FSe), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and functional stroke.
METHOD: A retrospective case-control study of 189 patients at a single large tertiary medical center. We performed a manual chart review of medical records of patients with FSe or epileptic seizures (ES), who also had ICD code evidence of CVD. The clinical characteristics of FSe, ES, CVD, and functional stroke were recorded. Logistic regression and Welch's t-tests were used to evaluate the differences between the FSe and ES groups.
RESULTS: Cerebrovascular disease was confirmed in 58.7% and 87.6% of patients with FSe or ES through manual chart review. Stroke was significantly more common in patients with ES (76.29%) than FSe (43.48%) (p = 4.07 × 10
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the initial observation of increased CVD in patients with FSe and further suggest that patients with FSe may be predisposed to developing another functional neurological disorder (FND) (i.e., functional stroke).

35112075,Functional seizures: The patient's perspective of a diagnostic and treatment odyssey.,"Functional seizures can be challenging to properly diagnose, often leading to delays in treatment. The etiology of functional seizures is multifactorial, with psychological factors identified in many, but not all cases. Misdiagnosis may occur due to clinical features mimicking other medical conditions. Once a correct diagnosis is reached, delivery of definitive, evidence-based treatment may be challenging due to limited availability of specialized resources. Research shows psychological education and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have the greatest efficacy. However, individual differences, including acceptance of the diagnosis, therapeutic alliance, duration of symptoms, comorbidities, and access to care may influence outcomes. There is a critical need for reports that can help identify barriers to effective diagnosis and treatment. We present the diagnosis and treatment of a woman who visited the emergency room after an attack of predominant left-sided paralysis, speech dysfunction and altered awareness. Following multiple daily episodes and visits to multiple medical practitioners, testing led to a diagnosis of functional seizures. While the patient was recommended to undergo a variety of therapeutic interventions, including CBT, she ultimately terminated treatment. In a subsequent interview, the patient revealed her personal experience with perceived limitations of acute management strategies. We explore the complexities of diagnosing and treating individuals with functional seizures.","['Andrini HJ', 'Au Hoy SL', 'Okhovat AM', 'Lockman J', 'Goldsmith GR']",2022,17,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,"Andrini HJ, et al.

35074803,Diagnosis and management of functional neurological disorder.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND), previously regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion, is now a rule-in diagnosis with available treatments. This represents a major step toward destigmatizing the disorder, which was often doubted and deemed untreatable. FND is prevalent, generally affecting young and middle aged adults, and can cause severe disability in some individuals. An early diagnosis, with subsequent access to evidence based rehabilitative and/or psychological treatments, can promote recovery-albeit not all patients respond to currently available treatments. This review presents the latest advances in the use of validated rule-in examination signs to guide diagnosis, and the range of therapeutic approaches available to care for patients with FND. The article focuses on the two most frequently identified subtypes of FND: motor (weakness and/or movement disorders) and seizure type symptoms. Twenty two studies on motor and 27 studies on seizure type symptoms report high specificities of clinical signs (64-100%), and individual signs are reviewed. Rehabilitative interventions (physical and occupational therapy) are treatments of choice for functional motor symptoms, while psychotherapy is an emerging evidence based treatment across FND subtypes. The literature to date highlights heterogeneity in responses to treatment, underscoring that more research is needed to individualize treatments and develop novel interventions.","['Aybek S', 'Perez DL']",2022,376,,BMJ,Aybek S and Perez DL.

34991744,The complex syndrome of functional neurological disorder.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with functional neurological disorders (FND) often present with multiple motor, sensory, psychological and cognitive symptoms. In order to explore the relationship between these common symptoms, we performed a detailed clinical assessment of motor, non-motor symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disability in a large cohort of patients with motor FND. To understand the clinical heterogeneity, cluster analysis was used to search for subgroups within the cohort.
METHODS: One hundred fifty-two patients with a clinically established diagnosis of motor FND were assessed for motor symptom severity using the Simplified Functional Movement Disorder Rating Scale (S-FMDRS), the number of different motor phenotypes (i.e. tremor, dystonia, gait disorder, myoclonus, and weakness), gait severity and postural instability. All patients then evaluated each motor symptom type severity on a Likert scale and completed questionnaires for depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue, cognitive complaints and HRQoL.
RESULTS: Significant correlations were found among the self-reported and all objective motor symptoms severity measures. All self-reported measures including HRQoL correlated strongly with each other. S-FMDRS weakly correlated with HRQoL. Hierarchical cluster analysis supplemented with gap statistics revealed a homogenous patient sample which could not be separated into subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: We interpret the lack of evidence of clusters along with a high degree of correlation between all self-reported and objective measures of motor or non-motor symptoms and HRQoL within current neurobiological models as evidence to support a unified pathophysiology of 'functional' symptoms. Our results support the unification of functional and somatic syndromes in classification schemes and for future mechanistic and therapeutic research.","['Forejtová Z', 'Serranová T', 'Sieger T', 'Slovák M', 'Nováková L', 'Věchetová G', 'Růžička E', 'Edwards MJ']",2023,53,7,Psychol Med,"Forejtová Z, et al.

In recent years, functional neuroimaging studies have provided robust evidence of alterations in activity and connectivity in multiple brain networks in FND. This body of evidence suggests that neurocircuitry-based interventions, such as non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), may also represent an effective therapeutic option for patients with FND.

34922325,Sustained improvement with mindfulness-based therapy for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.,"BACKGROUND: We previously reported on the efficacy of a manualized 12-session mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Completion of MBT provided improvements in weekly PNES frequency and self-rated intensity.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to determine sustainability of improvement of seizure-related measures at 3- to 6-month follow-up after treatment completion. We also examined changes at treatment end and at follow-up on therapeutic targets of the MBT program.
METHODS: Patients with documented PNES were recruited from 2014 to 2018. Baseline measures were collected at time of diagnosis (T0) and at first follow-up post-diagnosis (T1). Outcomes are reported at MBT treatment completion (T3) and 3- to 6-month follow-up (T4). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for pair-wise comparisons of PNES frequency; linear mixed models were used for other outcomes.
RESULTS: Fourteen of the 26 MBT completers (54%) attended follow-up (median 147.5 days between T3 and T4). PNES frequency, intensity, and number of days/week with PNES remained reduced at T4 (p < 0.01 for all; median frequency reduction 1.3/week from T1). Illness perception and feeling understood remained improved at T4 (p < 0.001 for both) as did worry about PNES (p < 0.05). Illness attribution (physical, mental or both) changed from T0 to T3 (p < 0.01), but not to T4. Psychological flexibility did not change over time.
CONCLUSION: Previously reported improvements in seizure-related measures with MBT at treatment conclusion were maintained at 3- to 6-month follow-up. There were sustained improvements in some underlying processes (illness perception, feeling understood, and symptom worry) over the course of treatment and at follow-up. Long-term benefits of MBT need to be established with randomized controlled trials.","['Baslet G', 'Ridlon R', 'Raynor G', 'Gonsalvez I', 'Dworetzky BA']",2022,126,,Epilepsy Behav,"Baslet G, et al.

This raises the question whether subjective and objective measures are closely correlated and - if not - whether one is more accurate or meaningful than the other, especially in patients with Functional Seizures (FS) or other Functional Neurological Symptom Disorders (FND), where subjective and objective observations may be thought particularly likely to deviate. This systematic review explores these questions focussing on measures of distress, arousal and symptom burden. Eighteen studies (12 FS, 6 other FND) capturing 396 FND patients were included. Eleven reported no correlation between subjective and objective measures. Only four studies reported significant correlations (r's = -0.74-0.59, p's < 0.05). The small number of studies and diverse methodologies do not provide conclusive answers to the questions posed. Given that subjective and objective measures capture different aspects of current state or function, a combination of measurement approaches is likely to provide optimal information about patients' health state. In view of the attentional and perceptual alterations implicated in FND, the difference between objective and subjective measures may represent an interesting observation in its own right.","['Adewusi J', 'Levita L', 'Gray C', 'Reuber M']",2021,16,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,"Adewusi J, et al.

34877515,The role of evidence-based guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of functional neurological disorder.,"Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, based on systematic reviews of existing evidence, play an important role in improving and standardizing the quality of patient care in many medical and psychiatric disorders, and could play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of functional seizures and other functional neurological disorder (FND) subtypes. There are several reasons to think that evidence-based guidelines might be especially beneficial for the management of FND. In particular, the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary teamwork necessary for the care of people with FND, the current lack of formal clinical training in FND, and the rapidly expanding body of evidence relating to FND all make guidelines based on systematic literature reviews especially valuable. In this perspective piece, we review clinical practice guidelines, their advantages and limitations, the reasons why evidence-based guidelines might be especially beneficial in the diagnosis and treatment of FND, and the steps that must be taken to create such guidelines for FND. We propose that professional organizations such as the American Academy of Neurology and the American Psychiatric Association undertake guideline development, ideally to create a co-authored or jointly endorsed set of guidelines that can set standards for interdisciplinary care for neurologists and mental health clinicians alike.","['Tolchin B', 'Baslet G', 'Carson A', 'Dworetzky BA', 'Goldstein LH', 'LaFrance WC', 'Martino S', 'Perez DL', 'Reuber M', 'Stone J', 'Szaflarski JP']",2021,16,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,"Tolchin B, et al.

34819179,The relationship between types of life events and the onset of functional neurological (conversion) disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Adverse life events precede the onset of functional neurological disorder (FND, also known as conversion disorder) more commonly than other neuropsychiatric conditions, but their aetiological role is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and quantitative analysis of the type, timing and number of life events preceding the onset of FND in adults, and a meta-analysis of the proportions of types of events in controlled studies. Fifty-one studies of different designs, covering 4247 patients, were eligible for inclusion. There was no clear majority of any type of preceding event. Family problems were the most common category of events, followed by relationship problems. Females were more likely to experience preceding family/relationship problems than males, who reported more work problems. Family problems were the commonest type of preceding event in studies in developing countries, whereas family and health problems were equally common in developed countries. Abuse was associated with early symptom onset, while patients with later onset were more likely to report family problems. The median number of events was one, and the events occurred closer to onset than in controls. Meta-analysis found that family, relationship and work events were all relatively more common in patients than pathological controls, as were events where symptoms might provide a solution to the stressor. In conclusion, although a range of events precede the onset of FND, they do not appear to do so uniformly. This may support a different aetiological role for stressors than in other disorders, although the support is indirect and the quality generally low.","['Morsy SK', 'Aybek S', 'Carson A', 'Nicholson TR', 'Stone J', 'Kamal AM', 'Abdel-Fadeel NA', 'Hassan MA', 'Kanaan RAA']",2022,52,3,Psychol Med,"Morsy SK, et al.

FND is characterised by signs and symptoms affecting the voluntary motor or sensory function that cannot be explained by a specific neurological or general medical condition. FND in pregnancy and postpartum is rare. We report here a case of FND in a 32-year-old woman who presented with multiple medical problems during her perinatal period. She exhibited 'la belle indifference', history of vague unexplained medical symptomatology while all relevant investigations were normal. There were longstanding psychosocial and interpersonal difficulties with significant distress including multiple personal, marital, and family issues which stemmed from her childhood. This left her feeling inadequate as a mother to her infant. The diagnosis of FND was finalised by the multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurologist, physicians, and psychiatrists, based on longitudinal assessment. Psychological intervention for the patient included psychoeducation, supportive psychotherapy, stress management, and parental intervention. The key point in our management of the patient was the delivery of the diagnosis to help her understand the illness and treatment plan. For this patient, functional and psychological recovery is achievable with a good therapeutic alliance, early diagnosis of the illness, and the acceptance of her diagnosis.","['Samuel Kanniah E', 'Subhas N', 'Silim UA', 'Loo JL', 'Tharumalingam T']",2021,76,6,Med J Malaysia,"Samuel Kanniah E, et al.

34755104,A historical review of functional neurological disorder and comparison to contemporary models.,"Over the centuries, various etiologies have been proposed to explain functional neurological disorders (FND), including functional seizures. These have included models relying on supernatural influences upon the body, emphasis on consequences of malfunctioning reproductive organs, the bodily expression of painful emotions involving traumatic memories, or cognitive distortions through attention and predictive biases. Many theorists, especially since the 19th century, have had overlapping themes that continue to be relevant in modern clinical use. Treatments developed in accordance with different conceptual mechanisms. Given the heterogeneity of the disorder and the variable response to individual treatments obtained through history, physicians must consider symptom expression of an FND as an overestimation. An appreciation of multiple theories allows flexible development of unique treatment plans for individual patients.","['Raynor G', 'Baslet G']",2021,16,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,Raynor G and Baslet G.

They are poorly studied but recent research suggests that many idiopathic drop attacks may be usefully considered within the spectrum of functional neurological disorder (FND). The aim of this study was to test a cognitive behavioural model of idiopathic drop attacks, in order to inform formulation and treatment. Interviews and diaries were completed by seven individuals experiencing drop attacks, and were analysed using a grounded theory qualitative data approach. Through the coding and synthesis of data into themes, a proposed cognitive behavioural model was identified, with a main precipitating event in all cases being a fall related to another cause, such as a mechanical fall or a fall due to medical reasons. Additional precipitating factors identified included situational triggers, high levels of stress, and dissociation. A maintaining cycle of thoughts, emotion and behaviour is outlined. Our proposed theory is consistent with current cognitive behavioural models of FND. A cognitive behavioural understanding of drop attacks when considered part of FND aids formulation in clinical practice, and suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy interventions for FND may also be applicable in this population.","['Revell ER', 'Gillespie D', 'Morris PG', 'Stone J']",2021,16,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,"Revell ER, et al.

Thirteen paediatric patients (below 18 years old) with FND and their parents completed a battery of anamnestic and neuropsychological tests, assessing socio-demographic status, cognitive level, behavioural and emotional issues, depression, anxiety, alexithymic traits and dissociative symptoms. Five patients presented movement disorders (tremor, myoclonus and gait disorder), three patients psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and five patients sensitivity disturbances (pain, anaesthesia and paraesthesia). Cognitive profile was normal in 11 patients; academic performance was good in nine patients, but three had a diagnosis of Specific Learning Difficulty or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Precipitating events occurred in 11 patients. At the self-report questionnaires, mean scores close to the clinical cut off were documented with respect to affective and somatic problems. At the parent-report questionnaires, clinically significant mean scores were observed in the subscales assessing anxious-depressive symptoms and somatic complaints. We speculate that paediatric FND patients, although acknowledging the relevance of somatic symptoms, have difficulties in recognizing internal emotional states (that, instead, are easily recognized by their parents). The case of one FND patient was described. These preliminary data might help identifying different clinical phenotypes of paediatric FND.","['Paleari V', 'Nisticò V', 'Nardocci N', 'Canevini MP', 'Priori A', 'Gambini O', 'Zorzi G', 'Demartini B']",2022,27,2,Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,"Paleari V, et al.

Despite this importance, there remains little agreement - and frequent debate - on what to call this condition, known inter alia as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), dissociative seizures (DS), functional seizures (FS), non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD), pseudoseizures, conversion disorder with seizures, and by many other labels besides. This choice of terminology is not merely academic - it affects patients' response to and understanding of their diagnosis, and their ability to navigate health care systems.This paper summarises two recent discussions hosted by the American Epilepsy Society and Functional Neurological Disorders Society on the naming of this condition.

34739941,Unexpected symptoms after concussion: Potential links to functional neurological and somatic symptom disorders.,"OBJECTIVE: Reporting of unexpected symptoms after concussion might, in some people, reflect a Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD), or exaggeration (feigning). This study aimed to determine whether reporting unexpected symptoms after concussion was associated with risk factors for FND/SSD, exaggeration, or both.
METHOD: Adults with persistent symptoms following concussion (N = 77; 61% women) rated the presence and severity of unexpected neurological symptoms (from the Screening for Somatoform Symptoms scale, e.g., paralysis) and somatic symptoms (from the Patient Health Questionnaire-15, e.g., stomach pain) that did not overlap with post-concussion symptom scale items. The independent variables were risk factors for exaggeration (neuropsychological performance validity test failure and personal injury litigation) and predisposing and perpetuating factors for developing FND and/or SSD (e.g., fear avoidance behavior).
RESULTS: When adjusting for all covariates, fear avoidance behavior was most strongly related to unexpected neurological symptoms (B = 0.11, 95% confidence interval = 0.05-0.18, p < .001), while current anxiety scores were most strongly related to unexpected somatic symptoms (B = 0.34, 95% confidence interval = 0.15-0.52, p < .001). Performance validity test failure and litigation were not significant predictors in either model.
CONCLUSION: Unexpected neurological and other somatic symptoms after concussion should not be dismissed as exaggeration. Psychological factors thought to perpetuate FND and SSD (e.g., fear avoidance behavior) may contribute to unexpected symptoms following concussion. More research is needed at the intersection of FND, SSD, and persistent post-concussive symptoms.","['Picon EL', 'Perez DL', 'Burke MJ', 'Debert CT', 'Iverson GL', 'Panenka WJ', 'Silverberg ND']",2021,151,,J Psychosom Res,"Picon EL, et al.

34727420,"Psychotherapy for Functional Neurological (Conversion) Disorder: A Case Bridging Mind, Brain, and Body.","Functional neurologic (conversion) disorder (FND) is a core neuropsychiatric condition directly at the intersection of psychiatry and neurology. Over the past several decades, renewed interest in FND has been catalyzed by use of a ""rule-in"" diagnostic approach leveraging positive clinical signs specific for the diagnosis. In parallel, advances have occurred in identifying mechanisms, etiologic factors, and evidence-based treatments for this population. While ""one size fits all"" formulations of the ""conversion"" of psychological distress into physical symptoms are no longer widely accepted, emotion processing and related psychological constructs (eg, alexithymia, dissociation, threat avoidance) remain central to the conceptual understanding of FND. Furthermore, the biopsychosocial model (foundational to psychiatry) is the prevailing model through which to guide longitudinal treatment, with psychotherapy as an emerging first line intervention for FND. Nonetheless, there is a striking dearth of psychotherapists and mental health providers more broadly that feel well versed in the clinical assessment and management of patients with FND. In this article, we seek to address this gap by presenting the psychotherapy treatment narrative of a woman experiencing paroxysmal functional speech and gait disorder symptoms who had a positive clinical outcome. Our goal with this case presentation and related discussion is to increase the proficiency of psychotherapists in providing treatment to patients with FND.","['Godena EJ', 'Perez DL', 'Crain LD', 'Fishel AK', 'Flaherty A', 'Harley R', 'Cohen JN']",2021,82,6,J Clin Psychiatry,"Godena EJ, et al.

34711069,"Autonomic, Endocrine, and Inflammation Profiles in Functional Neurological Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","OBJECTIVE: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a core neuropsychiatric condition. To date, promising yet inconsistently identified neural circuit profiles have been observed in patients with FND, suggesting that gaps remain in our systems-level neurobiological understanding. As such, other important physiological variables, including autonomic, endocrine, and inflammation findings, need to be contextualized for a more complete mechanistic picture.
METHODS: The investigators conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available case-control and cohort studies of FND. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were searched for studies from January 1, 1900, to September 1, 2020, that investigated autonomic, endocrine, and inflammation markers in patients with FND. Sixty-six of 2,056 screened records were included in the review, representing 1,699 patients; data from 20 articles were used in the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Findings revealed that children and adolescents with FND, compared with healthy control subjects (HCs), have increased resting heart rate (HR); there is also a tendency toward reduced resting HR variability in patients with FND across the lifespan compared with HCs. In adults, peri-ictal HR differentiated patients with functional seizures from those with epileptic seizures. Other autonomic and endocrine profiles for patients with FND were heterogeneous, with several studies highlighting the importance of individual differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation research in FND remains in its early stages. Moving forward, there is a need for the use of larger sample sizes to consider the complex interplay between functional neurological symptoms and behavioral, psychological, autonomic, endocrine, inflammation, neuroimaging, and epigenetic/genetic data. More research is also needed to determine whether FND is mechanistically (and etiologically) similar or distinct across phenotypes.","['Paredes-Echeverri S', 'Maggio J', 'Bègue I', 'Pick S', 'Nicholson TR', 'Perez DL']",2022,34,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Paredes-Echeverri S, et al.

34693243,Using evidence-based psychotherapy to tailor treatment for patients with functional neurological disorders.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) frequently presents with comorbid psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depressive, post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), somatic symptom and pain syndromes, and dissociative and personality disorders). It can become chronic and lead to unemployment and disability for many patients. Psychosocial factors play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of symptoms. Consequently, psychotherapy is recommended for the treatment of FND in general, and especially for the single symptom-based subtype of functional seizures (FS). Some of the psychotherapy approaches that have been utilized for FND include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), third wave approaches, and psychodynamic psychotherapies as well as group therapeutic and psychoeducational interventions. For patients with FS and PTSD, prolonged exposure therapy, a CBT-based treatment has been implemented. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe and analyze specific elements (e.g., theoretical foundations, tools, targets, definitions of success) of the main psychotherapeutic approaches used in patients with FND. Our premise is that these modalities will overlap considerably in some respects. We will conclude by discussing how discrete differences may render them more suitable for subgroups of patients with FND or for patients at different timepoints of their recovery process.","['Myers L', 'Sarudiansky M', 'Korman G', 'Baslet G']",2021,16,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,"Myers L, et al.

34665330,"Opinion, knowledge, and clinical experience with functional neurological disorders among Italian neurologists: results from an online survey.","BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorders (FND) are disabling medical conditions commonly seen in neurological practice. Neurologists play an essential role in managing FND, from establishing a diagnosis to coordination of multidisciplinary team-based treatment for patients. With this study, we investigated the knowledge and the clinical experience of Italian neurologists in managing patients with FND.
METHODS: Members of the Italian Society of Neurology were invited via e-mail to participate in this ad hoc online survey; 492 questionnaires were returned completed.
RESULTS: The term ""Functional neurological disorders"" in reference to FND was used more frequently than other psychological (e.g., psychogenic or conversion), or descriptive terms (e.g., non-organic or stress-related). When speaking with patients, the respondents stated that they preferred explaining symptoms based on abnormal functioning of the nervous system than discussing mental illness and that they would refer their patient to a psychologist rather than to a psychiatrist. Few considered that physiotherapy and psychiatric interventions are useful approaches to treating FND. Some believed that patients simulate their symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the responses suggest that knowledge about scientific advances in FND is somewhat sparse. A psychiatric-centered view of FND opens the way to an approach in which neurobiological and psychological aspects constitute essential factors of the condition. In this context, professional education could improve understanding of FND and optimize patient management.","['Tinazzi M', 'Fiorio M', 'Berardelli A', 'Bonetti B', 'Bonifati DM', 'Burlina A', 'Cagnin A', 'Calabria F', 'Corbetta M', 'Cortelli P', 'Giometto B', 'Guidoni SV', 'Lopiano L', 'Mancardi G', 'Marchioretto F', 'Pellegrini M', 'Teatini F', 'Tedeschi G', 'Tesolin L', 'Turinese E', 'Zappia M', 'Marotta A']",2022,269,5,J Neurol,"Tinazzi M, et al.

More recently, the recognition of FND and SSD were noted to be relevant for the management of PD. FND and SSD appear early in the course of PD, often preceding motor symptoms, may interfere with treatment outcomes, often acquire psychotic features during progression, and are mixed with and often concealed by the progressive cognitive decline. We review the related features from the range of the available reports and discuss theoretical models conceived to explain the potential pathophysiological background of these disorders. Finally, we suggest that FND and SSD should be included among the non-motor symptoms of PD and be considered a prodromal feature in a subset of patients.

Systemic low-grade inflammation might play a role, however, the pathogenic mechanism is still unknown.
AIM: 1) To explore the feasibility to establish and assess a cohort of CD/FND with motor symptoms, involving persons with lived experience (PPI). 2) To generate proof of concept regarding a possible role for cytokines, microRNA, cortisol levels and neurocognitive symptoms in patients with motor CD/FND.
METHOD: Feasibility study.
RESULTS: The study showed active involvement of patients despite high clinical illness burden and disability, neurocognitive symptoms, childhood adverse experiences (ACE) and current life events. The study provided valuable knowledge regarding the feasibility of conducting a study in these patients that will inform future study phases. In the sample there were elevated levels of IL6, IL12, IL17A, IFNg, TNFa and VEGF-a, suggesting systemic low-grade inflammation. Also, microRNAs involved in inflammation and vascular inflammation were correlated with TNFa and VEGFa respectively, suggesting proof of concept for an epigenetic mechanism. Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, the patient sample was limited to 15 patients.
CONCLUSION: It is a novelty that this study is conducted in the clinical setting.

34568805,Identifying and evaluating novel treatment targets for the development of evidence-based interventions for functional neurological disorder.,"Historically, functional neurological disorder (FND) has been described in psychodynamic terms as the physical manifestation of psychological distress. It is often explained to patients and caregivers as the result of anxiety, stress, trauma or other psychiatric comorbidities. However, recent evidence indicates that targeting mood and stress is not equivalent to the treatment of FND and may have limited to no effect on FND symptoms. Given the few randomized controlled trials for FND treatments and the limited evidence of mood and stress as effective treatment targets, the identification and evaluation of novel treatment targets or mediators is an area of great opportunity and should be the focus of future research. Identifying and targeting modifiable disease mechanisms directly as opposed to only treating psychiatric comorbidities may result in greater efficacy in treating FND symptoms, better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. Several novel mechanisms have been identified that warrant additional investigation as potential treatment targets including abnormal attentional focus on the affected area, beliefs and expectations about illness, impairments in habituation, and decreased sense of control over actions. Future intervention studies should take a mechanism-based approach and utilize valid and reliable measures or specific biomarkers to determine whether improvements in FND symptoms are associated with changes in the treatment targets. This transdiagnostic approach will allow researchers to translate the novel mechanistic outcomes emerging from neurophysiological and neuroscience studies into new or improved evidence-based approaches to FND treatment and prevention.","['Fobian AD', 'Szaflarski JP']",2021,16,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,Fobian AD and Szaflarski JP.

34537867,Shared Individual Formulation Therapy (SIFT): an open-label trial of a new therapy accommodating patient heterogeneity in functional neurological disorder.,"BACKGROUND: Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is a complex neuropsychiatric condition with a multifactorial aetiology. The heterogeneity of patients with FND is rarely considered in psychotherapy trials, which may contribute to variable outcomes. Shared Individual Formulation Therapy (SIFT) is a new, brief (four session) psychotherapy that aims to accommodate heterogeneity by providing a personalised, trans-theoretical formulation of the person's difficulties and accompanying management plan.
METHODS: An open-label, prospective trial of outpatient SIFT for adults with FND was conducted, using health-related quality of life (SF-12) as the principal outcome measure, with secondary measures of mental health, dissociation, health care use and attitude to the FND diagnosis. Measures were collected at baseline, end of treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-ups.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants with various FND symptoms enrolled. Twenty-four completed all four sessions and 25 completed follow-up measures at 12 months. SF-12 scores improved significantly at end of treatment and were sustained throughout follow-up with moderate effect sizes (0.39-0.47; all p < 0.001). Most secondary outcomes also improved significantly at all time points. The intervention was highly acceptable and tolerable to patients and perceived as beneficial.
CONCLUSION: This trial provides preliminary evidence for initial and sustained benefit from SIFT for adults with FND. Further study is needed to validate these findings.","['Gutkin M', 'Brown RJ', 'McLean L', 'Streimer J', 'Kanaan RA']",2021,268,12,J Neurol,"Gutkin M, et al.

34521502,"When neurologists diagnose functional neurological disorder, why don't they code for it?","OBJECTIVE:: Clinicians who recognize functional neurological disorders (FND) may not share that diagnosis with patients. Poor communication delays treatment and contributes to substantial disability in FND. Diagnostic (ICD-10) coding, one form of medical communication, offers an insight into clinicians’ face-to-face communication. Therefore, quantifying the phenomenon of non-coding, and identifying beliefs and practice habits that reduce coding, may suggest routes to improve medical communication in FND.
METHODS:: We reviewed all pediatric neurology consultations in our hospital from 2017–2020, selecting those in which neurologists explicitly stated an FND-related diagnosis (N=57). We identified the neurological symptoms and ICD-10 codes assigned for each consultation. In parallel, we reviewed all encounters that utilized FND-related codes to determine whether insurers paid for this care. Finally, we assessed beliefs and practices that influence FND-related coding through a nationwide survey of pediatric neurologists (N=460).
RESULTS:: After diagnosing FND, neurologists selected FND-related ICD-10 codes in only 22.8% of consultations. 96.2% of neurologists estimated that they would code for non-epileptic seizure (NES) when substantiated by EEG; in practice, they coded for 36.7% of such consultations. For other FND manifestations, neurologists coded in only 13.3% of cases. When presented with FND and non-FND scenarios with equal levels of information, neurologists coded for FND 41% less often. The strongest predictor of non-coding was the outdated belief that FND is a diagnosis of exclusion. Coding for FND never resulted in insurance non-payment.
CONCLUSION:: Non-coding for FND is common. Most factors that amplify non-coding also hinder face-to-face communication. Research based on ICD-10 coding (e.g., prevalence, cost) may underestimate the impact of FND by >4-fold.","['Herbert LD', 'Kim R', 'Hassan AA', 'Wilkinson-Smith A', 'Waugh JL']",2021,,,CNS Spectr,"Herbert LD, et al.

34409282,Remote delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with functional neurological disorders: Promise and challenges.,"Functional neurological disorders (FND) are an important source of healthcare utilization and morbidity. While there are no formal guidelines for treating these disorders, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is emerging as a safe and effective treatment. Currently, there is a global shortage of CBT providers, with only a small subset trained in and comfortable with treating patients with FND. We highlight four types of remote CBT delivery to patients with FND to alleviate the access obstacle: workbooks, internet-guided CBT, app-based CBT, and teletherapy. CBT workbooks and teletherapy have been studied in FND, with preliminary studies suggesting efficacy; internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT have not but have been effectively used in patients with psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic disorders. As these disorders are often comorbid and share overlapping neurobiology with FND, internet-guided CBT and app-based CBT represent promising delivery options of CBT for FND. Although remotely-delivered CBT is unlikely to replace in-person CBT and there are technical and logistical challenges to overcome prior to widespread deployment, it holds promise as an adjunct treatment when in-person CBT is inaccessible. We propose a rational approach to future allocation of remote CBT treatment options and highlight important research gaps to bridge beforehand.","['Lin A', 'Espay AJ']",2021,16,,Epilepsy Behav Rep,Lin A and Espay AJ.

34358259,Long-term mental wellbeing and functioning after surgery for cauda equina syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) can cause persisting life-changing dysfunction. There is scarce literature regarding the long-term assessment of CES symptoms, and rarer still is the impact of these symptoms on mental wellbeing investigated. This study assessed the long-term patient reported mental wellbeing outcomes of post-operative CES patients.
METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for CES between August 2013 and November 2014 were identified using an ethically approved database. They then completed validated questionnaires over the telephone assessing their mental and physical functioning (Short-Form 12 Questionnaire), generating the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). Bladder, bowel and sexual function were also assessed using validated questionnaires. MCS scores were compared to both the Scottish mean and previously published cut-offs indicating patients at risk of depression. Correlations of MCS with bladder, bowel, sexual and physical dysfunction were examined and multifactorial regression to predict MCS from these variables analysed. Independent t-tests assessed the mean difference in MCS between patients presenting with incomplete CES (CES-I) and CES with retention (CES-R) and between those with radiologically confirmed and impending CES.
RESULTS: Forty-six participants with a mean follow-up time of 43 months completed the study. The mean (±SD) MCS was 49 (±11.8) with 22% demonstrating poor mental health related quality of life in comparison to the Scottish mean. Overall, 37% had scores consistent with being at risk for depression with in the last 30 days, and 45% within the last 12 months. MCS was significantly correlated with Urinary Symptoms Profile (USP) score (-0.608), NBDS score (-0.556), ASEX score (-0.349) and PCS score (0.413) with worse bladder, bowel, sexual and physical dysfunction associated with worse MCS score. Multifactorial regression analysis demonstrated both urinary (USP score p = 0.031) and bowel function (NBDS score p = 0.009) to be significant predictive variables of mental health related quality of life. There were no significant mean differences in MCS between those presenting with CES-I and CES-R or those with radiologically complete and impending CES.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a high frequency of being at risk for depression in patients with CES and identifies outcome measures (physical, sexual and more so bladder and bowel dysfunction) associated with poorer mental wellbeing. Our large cohort and long follow-up highlight that CES patients should be considered at risk of depression, and the need to consider mental health outcomes following CES surgery.","['Hazelwood JE', 'Hoeritzauer I', 'Carson A', 'Stone J', 'Demetriades AK']",2021,16,8,PLoS One,"Hazelwood JE, et al.

34353136,Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing treatment in functional neurological symptom disorder with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: A study of two cases.,"Patients with functional neurological symptom disorder (FND) have many diverse symptoms including psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), positive movements such as tremor, dystonia, or gait abnormalities, loss of motor function such as leg or arm paresis, and loss of sensory functions, such as blindness, deafness, or loss of feeling in the limbs. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a therapy method that includes some techniques arising from psychodynamic, cognitive, and behavioral approaches. EMDR is known as a proven psychotherapeutic approach in post-traumatic stress disorder, but there are also numerous studies reporting its efficacy in other psychiatric disorders and trauma-associated symptoms, in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders. This article presents the outcome of EMDR treatment of two patients' cases, a 13-year-old female and a 16-year-old male, who were diagnosed as FND with PNES, according to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. In both cases, there was a significant decrease in Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale scores and no pseudo seizures were found, even at the sixth-month follow-up visits. These case studies suggest that EMDR can be an effective method in the long-term treatment of FND with PNES and a useful alternative to other treatment methods.","['Demirci OO', 'Sagaltici E']",2021,26,4,Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,Demirci OO and Sagaltici E.

34245646,International online survey of 1048 individuals with functional neurological disorder.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is common, and symptoms can be severe. There have been no international large-scale studies of patient experiences of FND.
METHODS: A patient questionnaire was created to assess FND patient characteristics, symptom comorbidities and illness perceptions. Respondents were recruited internationally through an open access questionnaire via social media and patient groups over a month-long period.
RESULTS: In total, 1048 respondents from 16 countries participated. Mean age was 42 years (86% female). Median FND symptom duration was 5 years, and median time from first symptom to diagnosis was 2 years. Mean number of current symptoms (core FND and associated) was 9.9. Many respondents had associated symptoms, for example fatigue (93%), memory difficulties (80%) and headache (70%). Self-reported psychiatric comorbidities were relatively common (depression, 43%; anxiety, 51%; panic, 20%; and post-traumatic stress disorder, 22%). Most respondents reported that FND had multiple causes, including physical and psychological.
CONCLUSIONS: This large survey adds further evidence that people with FND typically have high levels of multiple symptom comorbidity with resultant distress. It also supports the notion that associated physical symptoms are of particular clinical significance in FND patients. Dualistic ideas of FND were not supported by respondents, who generally preferred to conceptualize the disorder as one at the interface of mind and brain. The need for a broad approach to this poorly served patient group is highlighted. Potential selection and response biases due to distribution of the survey online, mostly via FND patient groups, are a key limitation.","['Butler M', 'Shipston-Sharman O', 'Seynaeve M', 'Bao J', 'Pick S', 'Bradley-Westguard A', 'Ilola E', 'Mildon B', 'Golder D', 'Rucker J', 'Stone J', 'Nicholson T']",2021,28,11,Eur J Neurol,"Butler M, et al.

34215138,Neuroimaging in Functional Neurological Disorder: State of the Field and Research Agenda.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) was of great interest to early clinical neuroscience leaders. During the 20th century, neurology and psychiatry grew apart - leaving FND a borderland condition. Fortunately, a renaissance has occurred in the last two decades, fostered by increased recognition that FND is prevalent and diagnosed using ""rule-in"" examination signs. The parallel use of scientific tools to bridge brain structure - function relationships has helped refine an integrated biopsychosocial framework through which to conceptualize FND. In particular, a growing number of quality neuroimaging studies using a variety of methodologies have shed light on the emerging pathophysiology of FND. This renewed scientific interest has occurred in parallel with enhanced interdisciplinary collaborations, as illustrated by new care models combining psychological and physical therapies and the creation of a new multidisciplinary FND society supporting knowledge dissemination in the field. Within this context, this article summarizes the output of the first International FND Neuroimaging Workgroup meeting, held virtually, on June 17th, 2020 to appraise the state of neuroimaging research in the field and to catalyze large-scale collaborations. We first briefly summarize neural circuit models of FND, and then detail the research approaches used to date in FND within core content areas: cohort characterization; control group considerations; task-based functional neuroimaging; resting-state networks; structural neuroimaging; biomarkers of symptom severity and risk of illness; and predictors of treatment response and prognosis. Lastly, we outline a neuroimaging-focused research agenda to elucidate the pathophysiology of FND and aid the development of novel biologically and psychologically-informed treatments.","['Perez DL', 'Nicholson TR', 'Asadi-Pooya AA', 'Bègue I', 'Butler M', 'Carson AJ', 'David AS', 'Deeley Q', 'Diez I', 'Edwards MJ', 'Espay AJ', 'Gelauff JM', 'Hallett M', 'Horovitz SG', 'Jungilligens J', 'Kanaan RAA', 'Tijssen MAJ', 'Kozlowska K', 'LaFaver K', 'LaFrance WC', 'Lidstone SC', 'Marapin RS', 'Maurer CW', 'Modirrousta M', 'Reinders AATS', 'Sojka P', 'Staab JP', 'Stone J', 'Szaflarski JP', 'Aybek S']",2021,30,,Neuroimage Clin,"Perez DL, et al.

However, there are few descriptions in the literature of the most effective practical management approaches. This consensus document aims to provide recommendations for assessment and intervention that are relevant to both adults and young people. An international panel of speech and language professionals with expertise in FND were approached to take part. Participants responded individually by email to a set of key questions regarding best practice for assessment and interventions. Next, a video conference was held in which participants discussed and debated the answers to these key questions, aiming to achieve consensus on each issue. Drafts of the collated consensus recommendations were circulated until consensus was achieved. FND should be diagnosed on the basis of positive clinical features. Speech and language therapy for FND should address illness beliefs, self-directed attention and abnormal movement patterns through a process of education, symptomatic treatment and cognitive behavioural therapy within a supportive therapeutic environment. We provide specific examples of these strategies for different symptoms. Speech and language professionals have a key role in the management of people with communication and related symptoms of FND.

34188796,Improvement of functional neurological disorder after administration of esketamine nasal spray: a case report.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a complex neuropsychiatric condition characterized by the presence of neurological symptoms and signs (either motor or sensory) that cannot be explained by any known medical or mental disease. It is frequently presented with psychiatric comorbidities, such as major depression. Its prognosis is poor, with low improvement or recovery rates at 1 year after their onset, and no particular treatment has demonstrated significant efficacy in this regard. Here, we describe the management of a patient affected by treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and FND characterized by mixed paralysis (sensory and motor) in the left arm, and who was successfully treated with esketamine nasal spray, achieving remission in both disorders. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency recently approved esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, for treatment of TRD. It is a fast-acting drug that provides a rapid-onset improvement of depressive symptoms. We have presented the first case, to our knowledge, of functional neurological symptoms being successfully treated with esketamine in a patient with comorbid TRD. While the novelty of this data implies a clear need for further research, it is suggested that esketamine might be a useful tool for the treatment of FND, acting through different theorized mechanisms that are in tune with recent advances in knowledge of the etiopathology of FND.","['Vendrell-Serres J', 'Soto-Angona Ó', 'Rodríguez-Urrutia A', 'Arteaga-Henríquez G', 'Ramos-Quiroga JA']",2021,11,,Ther Adv Psychopharmacol,"Vendrell-Serres J, et al.

34186455,Conversion disorder with aphonia in 12 years old male patient: A case report.,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Conversion aphonia is a rare disease characterized by total loss of voice. It is more commonly reported in females than males, and its diagnosis is based on a comprehensive patient's clinical history, and assessment of vocal cords and other laryngeal structures using Fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Early diagnosis and phonation have a significant role in the treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old medically free male patient with unremarkable medical history and normal physical, social, cognitive and emotional developmental milestones presented to the otorhinolaryngology clinic with a sudden loss of voice for a duration of 3 days with absence of other associated symptoms. A comprehensive clinical history and general examination were within normal limits, and fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a normal-looking laryngeal structure with intact bilateral mobile vocal cords. A diagnosis of psychogenic aphonia was the most likely cause, so speech therapy concurrent with psychotherapy was the mainstay of treatment. Improvement of the patient condition noticed and he restored his speech 4 weeks after initiation of his treatment.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Psychogenic Aphonia is rare disorder with female predominance and younger age onset when it is compared to males. It is also known as functional neurological symptom disorder (FND) as it is not explained by underlying medical or neurological factors. It is often preceded by psychological trauma or stressors. Diagnosis of Psychogenic Aphonia is challenging and it is often missed and delayed. Accordingly, the delay in diagnosis may significantly affect the ultimate outcome for affected patients. Speech therapy concurrent with psychotherapy represents the mainstay of treatment.
CONCLUSION: Being rare disorder, early recognition and diagnosis of conversion disorder with aphonia is crucial. Applying diagnostic criteria which is introduced by American Psychiatric Association in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) facilitate the diagnosis. Multidisciplinary approach in management of affected patients ensures better outcome.","['Al-Balas HI', 'Abuhalaweh M', 'Melhem HB', 'Al-Balas H']",2021,84,,Int J Surg Case Rep,"Al-Balas HI, et al.

In a substantial proportion, PNES are disabling with poor long-term outcomes and high economic costs. Despite the clinical and financial consequences of PNES, there is still a lack of controlled clinical trials on the treatment of this challenging disorder. The study aims to evaluate the feasibility and collect first evidence of the efficacy of a group based-intervention in PNES-patients.
METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled feasibility study with a parallel-group design was performed in adult outpatients with PNES to evaluate a new body-focused group therapy (CORDIS) versus guided self-help groups. Self-assessment of dissociation (Dissociation Experience Scale-DES-20) and seizure severity (Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale-LSSS) were assessed two weeks before and two weeks after the treatment intervention and also six months after treatment as primary outcome parameters.
RESULTS: A total of 53 patients were recruited from a specialized outpatient clinic, and out of those, 29 patients completed either the body-focused group therapy program (n = 15) or a guided self-help group (SHG) therapy (n = 14). When analyzing the ITT sample (n = 22 CORDIS group, n = 20 SHG), both groups showed an effect on seizure severity and level of dissociation. In the per protocol sample (n = 13 CORDIS group, n = 12 SHG), CORDIS was superior to the self-help group for reducing seizure severity 6 months after the treatment.
SIGNIFICANCE: CORDIS is a newly developed body-focused group therapy program for adults with PNES. Further studies should include a multicentric design with a higher number of participants.","['Senf-Beckenbach P', 'Hoheisel M', 'Devine J', 'Frank A', 'Obermann L', 'Rose M', 'Hinkelmann K']",2022,269,1,J Neurol,"Senf-Beckenbach P, et al.

This regulation could be incomplete in patients with functional neurologic disorder (FND) resulting in an overflowing emotional stimulation perpetuating symptoms in FND patients. Here we employed functional MRI to study cognitive reappraisal in FND. A total of 24 FND patients and 24 healthy controls employed cognitive reappraisal while seeing emotional visual stimuli in the scanner. The Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) was used to evaluate concomitant psychopathologies of the patients. During cognitive reappraisal of negative IAPS images FND patients show an increased activation of the right amygdala compared to normal controls. We found no evidence of downregulation in the amygdala during reappraisal neither in the patients nor in the control group. The valence and arousal ratings of the IAPS images were similar across groups. However, a subgroup of patients showed a significant higher account of extreme low ratings for arousal for negative images. These low ratings correlated inversely with the item ""anxiety"" of the SCL-90-R. The increased activation of the amygdala during cognitive reappraisal suggests altered processing of emotional stimuli in this region in FND patients.","['Hassa T', 'Spiteri S', 'Schmidt R', 'Merkel C', 'Schoenfeld MA']",2021,12,,Front Psychiatry,"Hassa T, et al.

33796241,"The neurological symptoms of COVID-19: a systematic overview of systematic reviews, comparison with other neurological conditions and implications for healthcare services.","AIMS: In response to the rapid spread of COVID-19, this paper provides health professionals with better accessibility to available evidence, summarising findings from a systematic overview of systematic reviews of the neurological symptoms seen in patients with COVID-19. Implications of so-called 'Long Covid' on neurological services and primary care and similarities with other neurological disorders are discussed.
METHODS: Firstly, a systematic overview of current reviews of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 was conducted. Secondly, the implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the potential effect on neurological services and the similarities in the experience of patients with COVID-19 and those with other neurological disorders. A total of 45 systematic reviews were identified within seven databases, published between 11 April 2020 and 15 October 2020, following a search in June 2020, updated on 20 October 2020.
RESULTS: The results indicated that COVID-19 exhibits two types of neurological symptoms; life-threatening symptoms such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and encephalitis, and less devastating symptoms such as fatigue and myalgia. Many of these so-called lesser symptoms appear to be emerging as longer-term for some sufferers and have been recently labelled Long Covid. When compared, these less devastating symptoms are very similar to other neurological conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND).
CONCLUSION: Implications for neurological healthcare services in the United Kingdom (UK) may include longer waiting times and a need for more resources (including more qualified health professionals). There is also a possible change-effect on health professionals' perceptions of other neurological conditions such as CFS and FND.

33768494,Are Functional (Psychogenic Nonepileptic) Seizures the Sole Expression of Psychological Processes?,"Functional [psychogenic nonepileptic/dissociative] seizures (FND-seiz) and related functional neurological disorder subtypes were of immense interest to early founders of modern-day neurology and psychiatry. Unfortunately, the divide that occurred between the both specialties throughout the mid-twentieth century placed FND-seiz at the borderland between the two disciplines. In the process, a false Cartesian dualism emerged that labeled psychiatric conditions as impairments of the mind and neurological conditions as disturbances in structural neuroanatomy. Excitingly, modern-day neuropsychiatric perspectives now consider neurologic and psychiatric conditions as disorders of both brain and mind. In this article, we aim to integrate neurologic and psychiatric perspectives in the conceptual framing of FND-seiz. In doing so, we explore emerging relationships between symptoms, neuropsychological constructs, brain networks, and neuroendocrine/autonomic biomarkers of disease. Evidence suggests that the neuropsychological constructs of emotion processing, attention, interoception, and self-agency are important in the pathophysiology of FND-seiz. Furthermore, FND-seiz is a multi-network brain disorder, with evidence supporting roles for disturbances within and across the salience, limbic, attentional, multimodal integration, and sensorimotor networks. Risk factors, including the magnitude of previously experienced adverse life events, relate to individual differences in network architecture and neuroendocrine profiles. The time has come to use an integrated neuropsychiatric approach that embraces the closely intertwined relationship between physical health and mental health to conceptualize FND-seiz and related functional neurological disorder subtypes.","['Sojka P', 'Paredes-Echeverri S', 'Perez DL']",2022,55,,Curr Top Behav Neurosci,"Sojka P, et al.

33722822,Decade of progress in motor functional neurological disorder: continuing the momentum.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a prevalent, disabling and costly condition at the neurology-psychiatry intersection. After being marginalised in the late 20th century, there has been renewed interest in this field. In this article, we review advances that have occurred over the past decade (2011-2020) across diagnosis, mechanisms, aetiologies, treatments and stigma in patients with motor FND (mFND, that is, functional movement disorder and functional limb weakness). In each content area, we also discuss the implications of recent advances and suggest future directions that will help continue the momentum of the past decade. In diagnosis, a major advance has been the emphasis on rule-in physical signs that are specific for hyperkinetic and hypokinetic functional motor symptoms. Mechanistically, greater importance has been given to determining 'how' functional neurological symptoms develop, highlighting roles for misdirected attention, expectation and self-agency, as well as abnormal influences of emotion/threat processing brain areas on motor control circuits. Aetiologically, while roles for adverse life experiences remain of interest in mFND, there is recognition of other aetiologic contributors, and efforts are needed to investigate links between aetiological factors and mechanisms. This decade has seen the first randomised controlled trials for physiotherapy, multidisciplinary rehabilitation and psychotherapy performed in the field, with consensus recommendations for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and outcome measures also published. Across patients, clinicians, healthcare systems and society, stigma remains a major concern. While challenges persist, a patient-centred integrated clinical neuroscience approach is primed to carry forward the momentum of the past decade into the future.","['Perez DL', 'Edwards MJ', 'Nielsen G', 'Kozlowska K', 'Hallett M', 'LaFrance WC']",2021,,,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Perez DL, et al.

33690909,No increased suggestibility to placebo in functional neurological disorder.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On the basis of occasional strong placebo responses, increased susceptibility to placebo has been proposed as a characteristic of functional neurological disorder (FND). The aim of this study was to clarify whether people with FND have a stronger placebo analgesic response than healthy controls.
METHODS: A study using a classic placebo paradigm, with additional conditioning and open-label components, was performed in 30 patients with FND, and in 30 healthy controls. Ratings of mildly to moderately painful electrotactile stimuli were compared before and after the application of a placebo ""anaesthetic"" cream versus a control cream, after an additional conditioning exposure, and after full disclosure (open-label component).
RESULTS: Pain intensity ratings at the placebo compared to the control site were similarly reduced in both groups. The conditioning exposure had no additional effect. After placebo disclosure a residual analgesic effect remained.
CONCLUSION: Patients with FND did not have stronger placebo responses than healthy controls. The notion of generally increased suggestibility or increased suggestibility to placebo in FND seems mistaken. Instead, occasional dramatic placebo responses may occur because functional symptoms are inherently more changeable than those due to organic disease.","['Huys AML', 'Beck B', 'Haggard P', 'Bhatia KP', 'Edwards MJ']",2021,28,7,Eur J Neurol,"Huys AML, et al.

33681789,Functional neurological disorders: effective teaching for health professionals.,"OBJECTIVES: To provide an outline for the delivery of an educational course or lecture about functional neurological disorders (FND) that is directed towards health professionals with varying clinical knowledge and to highlight the educational efficacy that can be derived from a well-designed educational platform.
METHOD: Through multidisciplinary collaboration, a course designed to develop the skills for diagnosis and management of FND was created. Elements essential to the delivery of education are: (A) knowledge creation; (B) facilitating multidisciplinary cross-pollination; (C) listening to patients' experiences; (D) communication skills practice; (E) case studies; (F) discipline specific mentoring; (G) establishing and addressing participant learning goals and (H) developing collegial and referral networks. Changes in participants' knowledge and clinical practice were assessed via anonymous questionnaires before and after the course.
RESULTS: Dramatically improved knowledge and confidence in assessment and management of people with FND has been found both immediately following the course as well as on 6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to make real change in the understanding and management of medical and allied health clinicians working with people with FND with a low-cost intervention. Also, the development of educational networks and multidisciplinary collaboration can lead to the creation of therapeutic platforms for the diagnosis, management and advocacy of this patient group.","['Lehn A', 'Navaratnam D', 'Broughton M', 'Cheah V', 'Fenton A', 'Harm K', 'Owen D', 'Pun P']",2020,2,1,BMJ Neurol Open,"Lehn A, et al.

33659255,Emotion Induced Monoamine Neuromodulator Release Affects Functional Neurological Disorders.,"Functional neurologic disorders (FNDs), also called conversion disorder (previously called hysteria), can show almost all the symptoms of other neurological diseases, including both physical (for example, seizure, weakness, fatigue) and psychological (for instance, depression, anxiety) symptoms. In spite of our general knowledge about emotional processes and developmental defects in the formation of these somatic symptoms, there is still no systemic and comprehensive research on the effects of emotional developmental variables in FND. Recently, both experimental and theoretical emotion studies have been greatly increased, such as prediction error, conceptual act model, basic emotional theory, and monoamine neuromodulator based three primary emotions. In addition, a large amount of evidence has confirmed the role of psychosocial adversity (such as stressful life events, interpersonal difficulties) as an important risk factor for FND. Here, we review recent advances about emotional stress on FND, and pay special attention to the effects of monoamine neuromodulators, such as how norepinephrine and serotonin affect behaviors. Then, we discuss the significance of these changes for FND, which may contribute to clarifying the pathogenesis of FND, and thus provide potential therapeutic drug targets or psychological intervention methods in the future.","['Liang F', 'Xu Q', 'Jiang M', 'Feng R', 'Jiang S', 'Yuan B', 'Xu S', 'Wu T', 'Wang F', 'Huang JH']",2021,9,,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Liang F, et al.

33621135,The impact of neurological disability and sensory loss on mindfulness practice.,"OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness-based approaches are increasingly recommended in the management of medical conditions associated with sensory loss and absence, such as Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). Yet the implications of undertaking practices such as body scanning when living with sensory loss have not been considered. This study aimed to explore the impact of sensory loss on the practice and experience of mindfulness in qualified mindfulness teachers with SCI/FND/MS.
METHODS: Eight mindfulness teachers (5 females, 3 males) with SCI/FND/MS, sensory loss and wheelchair use were recruited from mindfulness teacher databases. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were undertaken, lasting between 50 and 93 min. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Idiographic analyses for descriptive, linguistic and conceptual themes were completed before cross-case analyses.
RESULTS: Analyses resulted in two superordinate themes: (1) Adopting your Body; and (2) Sensation without Loss. These themes reflected the challenge of overcoming initial resistance to areas of the body with sensory disruption, building a relationship with the whole body, such that sensory awareness could be visualised and experienced without proprioception.
CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness offers a unique approach to accepting and working with the body after paralysis or sensory loss. Fundamental to the use of mindfulness with such populations, is the prioritisation of inclusive sensory language and exploring sensory absence as well as sensory presence. The cognitive and emotional outcomes of body scanning may be uniquely elevated in populations with neurophysiological disorders, highlighting the benefits of mindfulness for adaptive and protective self-management.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONMindfulness-based practices which focus on the body and sensation are accessible to people with neurological limitations.Mindfulness techniques can be extended through the use of visualisation strategies to encourage (non-proprioceptive) awareness of paralysed limbs or areas of the body with sensory loss.The language used in mindfulness-based interventions may need adapted by practitioners so that it remains inclusive for people with sensory loss as well as sensory presence.Additional care needs to be taken when using body scans during mindfulness as they have the potential to exacerbate psychological distress in people with reduced sensory awareness.","['Finlay KA', 'Hearn JH', 'Chater A']",2022,44,15,Disabil Rehabil,"Finlay KA, et al.

33615622,Individual differences in interoceptive accuracy and prediction error in motor functional neurological disorders: A DTI study.,"In motor functional neurological disorders (mFND), relationships between interoception (a construct of high theoretical relevance to its pathophysiology) and neuroanatomy have not been previously investigated. This study characterized white matter in mFND patients compared to healthy controls (HCs), and investigated associations between fiber bundle integrity and cardiac interoception. Voxel-based analysis and tractography quantified fractional anisotropy (FA) in 38 mFND patients compared to 38 HCs. Secondary analyses compared functional seizures (FND-seiz; n = 21) or functional movement disorders (n = 17) to HCs. Network lesion mapping identified gray matter origins of implicated fiber bundles. Within-group mFND analyses investigated relationships between FA, heartbeat tracking accuracy and interoceptive trait prediction error (discrepancies between interoceptive accuracy and self-reported bodily awareness). Results were corrected for multiple comparisons, and all findings were adjusted for depression and trait anxiety. mFND and HCs did not show any between-group interoceptive accuracy or FA differences. However, the FND-seiz subgroup compared to HCs showed decreased integrity in right-lateralized tracts: extreme capsule/inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and thalamic/striatum to occipital cortex projections. These alterations originated predominantly from the right temporoparietal junction and inferior temporal gyrus. In mFND patients, individual differences in interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive trait prediction error correlated with fiber bundle integrity originating from the insula, temporoparietal junction, putamen and thalamus among other regions. In this first study investigating brain-interoception relationships in mFND, individual differences in interoceptive accuracy and trait prediction error mapped onto multimodal integration-related fiber bundles. Right-lateralized limbic and associative tract disruptions distinguished FND-seiz from HCs.","['Sojka P', 'Diez I', 'Bareš M', 'Perez DL']",2021,42,5,Hum Brain Mapp,"Sojka P, et al.

33611631,Functional neurological disorder and multiple sclerosis: a systematic review of misdiagnosis and clinical overlap.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) and functional neurological disorder (FND) are both diagnostically challenging conditions which can present with similar symptoms. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify patients with MS who were misdiagnosed with FND, patients with FND who were misdiagnosed with MS, and reports of patients with both conditions. In addition to FND, we included studies of patients with other functional and psychiatric disorders where these caused symptoms leading to investigation for or a diagnosis of MS, which in a different context would likely have been labeled as FND. Our review suggests that MS is one of the most common causes of misdiagnosis of FND and vice versa. We discuss the clinical errors that appear to result in misdiagnoses, such as over-reliance on psychiatric comorbidity when making a diagnosis of FND or over-reliance on neuroimaging for the diagnosis of MS, and practical ways to avoid them. Comorbidity between these two conditions is also likely common, has been poorly studied, and adds complexity to diagnosis and treatment in patients with both MS and FND. Misdiagnosis and comorbidity in a landscape of emerging evidence-based treatments for both MS and FND are issues not only of clinical importance to the care of these patients, but also to treatment trials, especially of MS, where FND could be a hidden confounder.","['Walzl D', 'Solomon AJ', 'Stone J']",2022,269,2,J Neurol,"Walzl D, et al.

33569039,Functional Neurological Disorders as Seen by a Cohort of General Practitioners in Northern Italy: Evidence From an Online Survey.,"General practitioners (GPs) provide primary care and advise their patients on which diagnostic and therapeutic pathways they judge most appropriate. For patients with functional neurological disorders (FND), receiving a proper explanation of diagnosis by their GP from the very beginning may drastically improve prognosis. Novel approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of FND have important implications for effective management. The aim of this study was to investigate Italian GP opinion and knowledge about FND in light of new approaches to the illness. To do this, we evaluated the responses to a 13-item web-based survey completed by 133 GPs practicing in northern Italy. Psychological terms to describe FND were more frequently used than functional neurological disorder and mental illness was considered an important predictor of diagnosis. Referral to a neurologist rather than to a psychiatrist was largely preferred, while physiotherapy consultation was seldom recognized as a valuable approach to treating FND. Overall, the survey findings suggest that knowledge about novel approaches to FND is somewhat lacking. Currently, GPs appear to be transitioning from a classical psychological view of the disorder toward a more modern conceptualization, in which neurobiological, psychological, and social factors all play an important role. Professional education during this transition would be an advantageous way to optimize physician management of FND and to enhance diagnosis, explanation, and management across primary and secondary care pathways.","['Marotta A', 'Fiorio M', 'Fracasso I', 'Franchini CA', 'Defazio G', 'Tinazzi M']",2021,12,,Front Neurol,"Marotta A, et al.

33490941,Complex regional pain syndrome - Autoimmune or functional neurologic syndrome.,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) purports to explain extremity pain accompanied by a variety of subjective complaints, including sensitivity to touch, fatigue, burning sensations, allodynia and signs consistent with voluntary immobilization, including skin changes, edema and trophic changes. By its own definition, CRPS pain is disproportionate to any inciting event or underlying pathology, which means that the syndrome describes non-anatomic and exaggerated symptoms. Although CRPS was coined in the early 1990s, physicians have described unexplained exaggerated pain for centuries. Before a small group of researchers assigned this historical phenomenon with the name CRPS, other physicians in various subspecialties investigated the existence of a common pathophysiologic mechanism but found none. The literature was searched for evidence of a reproducible pathologic mechanism for CRPS. Although some have suggested that CRPS is an autoimmune disease, there is a paucity of evidence to support this. While cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α have been detected during the early phases of CRPS, this cannot lead to the conclusion that CRPS is an autoimmune disease, nor that it is an autoinflammatory disorder. Moreover, intravenous immunoglobulin has showed inconsistent results in the treatment of CRPS. On the other hand, CRPS has been found to meet at least three out of four criteria of malingering, which was previously a DSM-IV diagnosis; and its diagnostic criteria are virtually identical to current DSM-5 Functional Neurological Disorder (""FND""), and proposed ICD-11 classification, which includes FND as a distinct neurological diagnosis apart from any psychiatric condition. Unfortunately, the creation of CPRS is not merely misguided brand marketing. It has serious social and health issues. At least in part, the existence of CRPS has led to the labeling of many patients with a diagnosis that allows the inappropriate use of invasive surgery, addictive opioids, and ketamine. The CRPS hypothesis also ignores the nature and purpose of pain, as a symptom of some organic or psychological process. Physicians have long encountered patients who voice symptoms that cannot be biologically explained. Terminology historically used to describe this phenomenon have been medically unexplained symptoms (""MUS""), hysterical, somatic, non-organic, psychogenic, conversion disorder, or dissociative symptoms. The more recent trend describes disorders where there is a functional, rather than structural cause of the symptoms, as ""functional disorders."" Physicians report high success treating functional neurological symptoms with reassurance, physiotherapy, and cognitive behavior therapy measured in terms of functional improvement. The CRPS label, however, neither leads to functional improvement in these patients nor resolution of symptoms. Under principles of evidence-based medicine, the CRPS label should be abandoned and the syndrome should simply be considered a subset of FNDs, specifically Functional Pain Disorder; and treated appropriately.","['Chang C', 'McDonnell P', 'Gershwin ME']",2021,4,,J Transl Autoimmun,"Chang C, et al.

33344786,Paradoxical wrist flexion: A new test to detect functional weakness of the upper limb.,"BACKGROUND: Positive signs are essential for the diagnosis of functional neurological disorders (FND). The author described a new positive sign to diagnose functional weakness (FW), ""paradoxical wrist flexion"", and tested its validity.
METHODS: The test comprised Medical Research Council (MRC) examinations of wrist flexion in two different limb positions, one with the wrist maximally flexed (wrist flexion in the flexed position; WFfl) and the other with the wrist in the neutral position (wrist flexion in the extended position; WFex). In ""organic"" weakness (OW), WFfl should be stronger than WFex according to the dynamic theory. Paradoxical wrist flexion was judged positive when the MRC score for WFfl was lower than that for WFex. A higher MRC score for WFfl than WFex was considered an ""organic sign"" for wrist flexion. We retrospectively enrolled patients with FND or other ""organic"" neurological disorders, who presented with wrist flexor weakness with an MRC score of 4.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with FW and 40 patients with OW were enrolled. Paradoxical wrist flexion was positive in 16 patients with FW and in no patients with OW, i.e. 67% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The ""organic sign"" for wrist flexion was positive in no patients with FW and in 35 patients with OW, i.e. 88% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Paradoxical wrist flexion is useful for the detection of nonorganic paresis. The background theory is that an active movement is more severely affected in FW than a passive movement when maintaining a limb position.",['Sonoo M'],2021,22,,eNeurologicalSci,Sonoo M.

Patients with FND may present with a myriad of neurological symptoms and frequently have comorbid medical, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Over the past decade, important advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of FND within a biopsychosocial framework. Many challenges remain in addressing the stigma associated with this diagnosis, refining diagnostic criteria, and providing access to evidence-based treatments.

Stigma exacerbates suffering and unmet needs of patients and families, and can result in poor clinical management and prolonged, repetitive use of healthcare resources.

33219037,Suggestibility in functional neurological disorder: a meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Responsiveness to direct verbal suggestions (suggestibility) has long been hypothesised to represent a predisposing factor for functional neurological disorder (FND) but previous research has yielded conflicting results. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate whether patients with FND display elevated suggestibility relative to controls via meta-analysis.
METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched in November 2019, with the search updated in April 2020, for original studies assessing suggestibility using standardised behavioural scales or suggestive symptom induction protocols in patients with FND (including somatisation disorder) and controls. The meta-analysis followed Cochrane, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Data extraction and study quality coding were performed by two independent reviewers. Standardised suggestibility scores and responsiveness to symptom induction protocols were used to calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs) between groups.
RESULTS: Of 26 643 search results, 19 articles presenting 11 standardised suggestibility data sets (FND: n=316; control: n=360) and 11 symptom suggestibility data sets (FND: n=1285; control: n=1409) were included in random-effect meta-analyses. Meta-analyses revealed that patients with FND displayed greater suggestibility than controls on standardised behavioural scales (SMD, 0.48 (95% C, 0.15 to 0.81)) and greater responsiveness to suggestive symptom induction (SMD, 1.39 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.86)). Moderation analyses presented mixed evidence regarding the extent to which effect sizes covaried with methodological differences across studies. No evidence of publication bias was found.
CONCLUSIONS: These results corroborate the hypothesis that FND is characterised by heightened responsiveness to verbal suggestion. Atypical suggestibility may confer risk for FND and be a cognitive marker that can inform diagnosis and treatment of this condition.","['Wieder L', 'Brown R', 'Thompson T', 'Terhune DB']",2021,92,2,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Wieder L, et al.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this article are to (1) describe the clinical manifestations of FMDs, including nonmotor symptoms and occurrence of other functional neurological disorders (FND); and (2) to report the frequency of isolated and combined FMDs and their relationship with demographic and clinical variables.
METHODS: For this multicenter, observational study, we enrolled consecutive outpatients with a definite diagnosis of FMDs attending 25 tertiary movement disorders centers in Italy. Each patient underwent a detailed clinical evaluation with a definition of the phenotype and number of FMDs (isolated, combined) and an assessment of associated neurological and psychiatric symptoms.
RESULTS: Of 410 FMDs (71% females; mean age, 47 ± 16.1 years) the most common phenotypes were weakness and tremor. People with FMDs had higher educational levels than the general population and frequent nonmotor symptoms, especially anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Almost half of the patients with FMDs had other FNDs, such as sensory symptoms, nonepileptic seizures, and visual symptoms. Patients with combined FMDs showed a higher burden of nonmotor symptoms and more frequent FNDs. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a diagnosis of combined FMDs was more likely to be delivered by a movement disorders neurologist. Also, FMD duration, pain, insomnia, diagnosis of somatoform disease, and treatment with antipsychotics were all significantly associated with combined FMDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for multidimensional assessments in patients with FMDs given the high frequency of nonmotor symptoms and other FNDs, especially in patients with combined FMDs.","['Tinazzi M', 'Morgante F', 'Marcuzzo E', 'Erro R', 'Barone P', 'Ceravolo R', 'Mazzucchi S', 'Pilotto A', 'Padovani A', 'Romito LM', 'Eleopra R', 'Zappia M', 'Nicoletti A', 'Dallocchio C', 'Arbasino C', 'Bono F', 'Pascarella A', 'Demartini B', 'Gambini O', 'Modugno N', 'Olivola E', 'Di Stefano V', 'Albanese A', 'Ferrazzano G', 'Tessitore A', 'Zibetti M', 'Calandra-Buonaura G', 'Petracca M', 'Esposito M', 'Pisani A', 'Manganotti P', 'Stocchi F', 'Coletti Moja M', 'Antonini A', 'Defazio G', 'Geroin C']",2020,7,8,Mov Disord Clin Pract,"Tinazzi M, et al.

33161935,Diagnosing functional neurological disorder: seeing the whole picture.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with many phenotypes that are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Despite the heterogeneity of FND, the rate of misidentification is consistently low. For the more common motor subtypes, there are clear positive clinical, electrophysiological, and rarely imaging criteria that can establish the diagnosis in the traditional sense. For nonmotor subtypes, the characterization may be less clear. Here, we argue that the current diagnostic criteria are not reflective of the current shared neuropsychiatric understanding of FND, and, as a result, provide an incomplete picture of the diagnosis. We propose a three-step diagnostic triad for FND, in which the traditional neurological diagnosis is only the first element. Other steps include psychiatric/psychological formulation, integration, and follow-up. We advocate that this diagnostic approach should be the shared responsibility of neurology and mental health professionals. Finally, a research agenda is proposed to address the missing factors in the field.","['Lidstone SC', 'Nassif W', 'Juncos J', 'Factor SA', 'Lang AE']",2020,,,CNS Spectr,"Lidstone SC, et al.

33154184,Systematic review of psychotherapy for adults with functional neurological disorder.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common and disabling disorder that is often considered difficult to treat, particularly in adults. Psychological therapies are often recommended for FND. Outcome research on psychological therapies for FND has grown in recent years but has not been systematically evaluated since 2005. This study aims to build on that by systematically reviewing the evidence-base for individual outpatient cognitive behavioural and psychodynamic psychotherapies for FND. Medical databases were systematically searched for prospective studies of individual outpatient psychotherapy for FND with at least five adult participants. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using a standardised assessment tool. Results were synthesised, and effect sizes calculated for illustrative purposes. The search strategy identified 131 relevant studies, of which 19 were eligible for inclusion: 12 examining cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 7 investigating psychodynamic therapy (PDT). Eleven were pre-post studies and eight were randomised controlled trials. Most studies recruited a single symptom-based subtype rather than all presentations of FND. Effect sizes, where calculable, showed generally medium-sized benefits for physical symptoms, mental health, well-being, function and resource use for both CBT and PDT. Outcomes were broadly comparable across the two therapy types, although a lack of high-quality controlled trials of PDT is a significant limitation, as is the lack of long-term follow-up data in the majority of identified CBT trials. In conclusion, both CBT and PDT appear to potentially offer some benefit for FND, although better quality studies are needed.","['Gutkin M', 'McLean L', 'Brown R', 'Kanaan RA']",2020,,,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Gutkin M, et al.

33104173,Assessment of Emergency Department and Inpatient Use and Costs in Adult and Pediatric Functional Neurological Disorders.,"IMPORTANCE: There is limited information about health care use and costs in patients with functional neurological disorders (FNDs).
OBJECTIVE: To assess US emergency department (ED) and inpatient use and charges for FNDs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation used Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data to assess all-payer (1) adult (age, ≥18 years) hospitalizations (2008-2017), (2) pediatric (age, 5-17 years) hospitalizations (2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2016), and (3) adult and pediatric ED evaluations (2008-2017). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 300.11 (conversion disorder) or 306.0 (musculoskeletal malfunction arising from mental factors) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for conversion disorder/functional neurological symptom disorder (F44.4 to F44.7) were used to conservatively define FNDs and to compare them with other neurological disorders that are associated with high levels of health care use. Analysis was performed between January 2019 and July 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Admission traits (eg, demographic characteristics of patients, length of stay, and discharge disposition) and hospital charges.
RESULTS: Compared with other neurological disorders in 2017, emergency FND evaluations of 36 359 adults (25 807 women [71.0%] and 3800 children (2733 girls [71.9%]) more frequently resulted in inpatient admissions (22 895 adult admissions [69.2% female] and 1264 pediatric admissions [73.4% ]). These FND admissions had a shorter mean (SEM) hospital length of stay (5.21 [0.15] days vs 6.03 [0.03] days, P < .001) but higher workup rates than admissions for comparable neurological diagnoses. Admissions for FNDs had low rates of inpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language pathology, and psychiatric consultation. The total annual costs (a proxy for total costs in 2017 US dollars) were $1066 million (95% CI, $971-$1160 million) for adult FND inpatient charges in 2017 compared with $1241 million (95% CI, $1132-$1351 million) for anterior horn cell disease; $75 million (95% CI, $57-$92 million) for pediatric FND inpatient charges in 2012 compared with $86 million (95% CI, $63-$108 million) for demyelinating diseases; and $163 million (95% CI, $144-$182 million) for adult and pediatric ED visits in 2017 compared with $135 million (95% CI $111-$159 million) for refractory epilepsy. Total charges per admission for ED care of FNDs were higher than the other comparison groups in adults. Total costs and costs per admission for FNDs increased from 2008 to 2017 at a higher rate than that of other neurological disorders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This economic evaluation found that the more than $1.2 billion and increasing annual costs for ED and inpatient care of FNDs were similar to other investigation-intensive and pharmacologically demanding neurological disorders. Unnecessary investigations and iatrogenic harm inflate costs at the expense of necessary but neglected psychiatric and rehabilitative treatments.","['Stephen CD', 'Fung V', 'Lungu CI', 'Espay AJ']",2021,78,1,JAMA Neurol,"Stephen CD, et al.

33058046,Using Patient-Centered Clinical Neuroscience to Deliver the Diagnosis of Functional Neurological Disorder (FND): Results from an Innovative Educational Workshop.,"OBJECTIVES: Psychiatry training is lacking examples of neuroscience education that translates neuroscience literature into accessible clinically oriented concepts. The authors created a teaching activity using patient-centered neuroscience education that focused on delivering the diagnosis of functional neurological disorder (FND). This study aimed to (i) develop a workshop modeling a clinician-patient interaction, (ii) provide a modern neuroscience perspective of FND, and (iii) evaluate the change in clinicians' perceptions of FND.
METHODS: A total of six workshops (each 1 h long and consisting of a video, PowerPoint slides, and pre and post questionnaires) were conducted. Paired t tests were used to measure the change.
RESULTS: Forty-seven clinicians participated. After completing the workshop, nearly all endorsed that functional symptoms are ""real"" (95%) and that treatment is helpful (100%). Participants also reported a greater comfort level with discussing FND diagnosis (46% vs 85%, p < 0.001), an overall increase in understanding the disorder (33% vs 82%, p < 0.001), assessing need for tests (33% vs 66%, p < 0.001), understanding treatment options (26% vs 89%, p < 0.001), and recognition that treatment can help control these symptoms (81% vs 100%, p < 0.01). In addition, learners were more likely to report that patients with FND are truthful (75% vs 95%, p < 0.001) and less likely to be manipulative (48% vs 80%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A brief, educational intervention using neuroscience-based content was found to significantly improve clinicians' perception and confidence when delivering the diagnosis of FND.","['Medina M', 'Giambarberi L', 'Lazarow SS', 'Lockman J', 'Faridi N', 'Hooshmad F', 'Karasov A', 'Bajestan SN']",2021,45,2,Acad Psychiatry,"Medina M, et al.

PNES are not characterized by any specific ictal or postictal EEG abnormalities. Patients with PNES can present with motor or non-motor symptoms, frequently associated with a change in the level of consciousness. PNES duration is variable, often longer than that of epileptic seizures. Prolonged PNES, sometimes termed PNES status, involve continuous or repetitive events that exceed 30 min. Prolonged PNES are often misdiagnosed as an epileptic event and are often inappropriately treated with high doses of antiseizure drugs. In this report, we describe two adolescent patients who presented with prolonged PNES characterized by generalized hypertonic posturing and low levels of consciousness. Despite multiple presentation to the Emergency department, and multiple normal video-EEG, the patients were misdiagnosed with epilepsy and were inappropriately treated with antiseizure medications. Both patients presented psychiatric comorbidity, consisting of a major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, social withdrawal, difficulty of social interaction, and anxious-perfectionist personality traits.

32982250,Towards an Outpatient Model of Care for Motor Functional Neurological Disorders: A Neuropsychiatric Perspective.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND), a condition at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry, is a common and disabling outpatient referral to neurology and neuropsychiatry clinics.

Over the past several decades, there have been dedicated efforts within the neurologic and psychiatric communities to create ""rule-in"" diagnostic criteria, as well as thoughtful approaches to the clinical interview, delivery of the diagnosis and the development of a patient-centered treatment plan. These advances allow the promotion of good clinical practices in the outpatient assessment and management of mFND. Informed by the literature and our prior clinical experiences, we provide suggestions on how to evaluate individuals with suspected functional motor symptoms - including conducting sensitive psychiatric and psychosocial screenings. Additional sections discuss common ""rule-in"" neurological examination and semiologic signs of motor FND, as well as approaches to deliver the diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan based on individual patient needs. To aid the development of shared (partially overlapping) expertise that catalyzes an interdisciplinary approach to mFND, the use of physiotherapy for therapeutic motor retraining and cognitive behavioral therapy to examine relationships between symptoms, thoughts, behaviors and emotions are also discussed. Additional clinical research is needed to further refine and operationalize the assessment and management of mFND, across clinics, healthcare settings and countries.","['Saxena A', 'Godena E', 'Maggio J', 'Perez DL']",2020,16,,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,"Saxena A, et al.

32970485,The vicious cycle of functional neurological disorders: a synthesis of healthcare professionals' views on working with patients with functional neurological disorder.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this review was to synthesise studies which address the views of healthcare professionals (HCPs) towards patients with functional neurological disorder (FND).
METHODS: An interpretive systematised review was conducted. Seven databases were searched using a comprehensive search strategy (MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, PsychINFO, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health, and Scopus). Qualitative studies and those using survey methods were included. An inductive approach to thematic analysis was used to identify concepts from the data and to synthesise the results.
RESULTS: The views of 2769 HCPs were represented in 11 included articles. The overarching theme across the articles was uncertainty: about making the diagnosis of FND, about professional roles, and about optimum management. Fear was also a common theme: of saying the wrong thing, of offending patients, or of breaking the therapeutic relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: If all HCPs felt uncertain about how to manage patients with FND and avoided them by passing them on to another discipline, then a ""vicious cycle"" is formed in which patients are passed from one professional to another but without receiving clear, honest information, or effective treatment. HCPs would benefit from increased training on FND and clear clinical pathways to alleviate feelings of uncertainty.Implications for rehabilitationEvidence-based or, at the very least, consensus-based multi-disciplinary care pathways for the assessment and treatment of patients with functional neurological disorder are required to improve equitability of services.Training packages for healthcare professionals need to be developed, evaluated and implemented in order to improve confidence of making and explaining the diagnosis and to reduce stigma of functional neurological disorders.Improved input for patients with functional neurological disorder is likely to occur if healthcare professionals are open, honest and use effective communication skills, both with their patients and fellow healthcare professionals.","['Barnett C', 'Davis R', 'Mitchell C', 'Tyson S']",2022,44,10,Disabil Rehabil,"Barnett C, et al.

32918317,Enhancing the communication of functional neurological disorder diagnosis: a multidisciplinary education session.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common diagnosis within neurology. Effective communication of the diagnosis is known to be an important part of treatment and can result in reduction or cessation of symptoms, as well as decreased healthcare utilisation. A single group education session, facilitated by professionals commonly involved in the care of patients with FND, was developed to further enhance patients' and relatives' understanding and acceptance of diagnosis.
METHODS: Patients and relatives attending a single education session were asked to complete self-report ratings of understanding of diagnosis, acceptance of diagnosis, belief in treatability and hopefulness regarding recovery, at the beginning and end of the session. Satisfaction data were also collected.
RESULTS: Data were obtained from 193 patients and 153 relatives. Patients had experienced a median duration of symptoms of 4 years, and more than 80% of patients reported more than one functional neurological symptom. There were significant increases in terms of understanding, acceptance, belief in treatability and hopefulness for patients and relatives. Effect sizes ranged from large for improved understanding of FND to small-to-medium for increased agreement with FND diagnosis. High levels of satisfaction were also reported.
CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary, single group education session is an effective and acceptable method of increasing understanding and acceptance of an FND diagnosis, even for patients with a long duration of symptoms and high symptom burden. It could help improve readiness for further treatment.","['Cope SR', 'Smith JG', 'Edwards MJ', 'Holt K', 'Agrawal N']",2021,28,1,Eur J Neurol,"Cope SR, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group included 19 female patients diagnosed with FND, and the control group included 20 healthy subjects. All participants were scanned with a 1.5 T MR scanner. A high-resolution structural image of the entire brain was obtained with sagittal 3D spiral fast spin echo T1-weighted images. Gray level intensity, standard deviation of the histogram, entropy, uniformity, skewness, and kurtosis values were determined with texture analysis. A student’s t-test was used to compare the group data. P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
RESULTS: It was determined that the mean gray level intensity, standard deviation of the histogram, entropy calculated by the maximum, median and variance and size M percentage values were higher in patients with FND. Kurtosis and size U percentages values were lower in patients with FND.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, analysis of CC with T1-weighted MR image HA demonstrated significant differences between FND patients and healthy controls.

The pathophysiology of FND is reflective of dysfunction within and across different brain circuits that, in turn, affects specific constructs. In this perspective article, we briefly review five constructs that are affected in FND: emotion processing (including salience), agency, attention, interoception, and predictive processing/inference. Examples of underlying neural circuits include salience, multimodal integration, and attention networks. The symptoms of each patient can be described as a combination of dysfunction in several of these networks and related processes. While we have gained a considerable understanding of FND, there is more work to be done, including determining how pathophysiological abnormalities arise as a consequence of etiologic biopsychosocial factors. To facilitate advances in this underserved and important area, we propose a pathophysiology-focused research agenda to engage government-sponsored funding agencies and foundations.","['Drane DL', 'Fani N', 'Hallett M', 'Khalsa SS', 'Perez DL', 'Roberts NA']",2020,,,CNS Spectr,"Drane DL, et al.

Specialist physiotherapy programs for treating FND have been developed over the last two decades. This article reports outcome data from three cohorts of children treated with a multidisciplinary rehabilitation intervention - the Mind-Body Program - in which a psychologically informed physiotherapy intervention, known as the wellness approach to physiotherapy, was a key component.
METHODS: For three cohorts of children (n = 57, n = 60 and n = 25, respectively) treated in the Mind-Body Program, data about functional impairment and mental health concerns were collected at presentation and at follow-up (4 years, 12 months and 18 months, respectively).
RESULTS: Outcome data show that FND symptoms resolved in 54/57 (95%), 51/60 (85%) and 22/25 (88%) of children in the three cohorts, and that 31/57 (61%), 32/60 (53%) and 13/25 (52%) of children returned to full health and to full-time school attendance. Changes in Global Assessment of Function (GAF) were significant (t(54) = 21.60, P < 0.001; t(55) = 9.92, P < 0.001; t(24) = 6.51, P < 0.001). Outcomes were less favourable for children with chronic FND symptoms at presentation; those whose comorbid mental health disorders or other (comorbid) functional somatic symptoms did not resolve; and those who subsequently developed chronic mental health problems.

32778007,A Review and Expert Opinion on the Neuropsychiatric Assessment of Motor Functional Neurological Disorders.,"Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a prevalent and disabling condition at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry. Advances have been made in elucidating an emerging pathophysiology for motor FND, as well as in identifying evidenced-based physiotherapy and psychotherapy treatments. Despite these gains, important elements of the initial neuropsychiatric assessment of functional movement disorders (FND-movt) and functional limb weakness/paresis (FND-par) have yet to be established. This is an important gap from both diagnostic and treatment planning perspectives. In this article, the authors performed a narrative review to characterize clinically relevant variables across FND-movt and FND-par cohorts, including time course and symptom evolution, precipitating factors, medical and family histories, psychiatric comorbidities, psychosocial factors, physical examination signs, and adjunctive diagnostic tests. Thereafter, the authors propose a preliminary set of clinical content that should be assessed during early-phase patient encounters, in addition to identifying physical signs informing diagnosis and potential use of adjunctive tests for challenging cases. Although clinical history should not be used to make a FND diagnosis, characteristics such as acute onset, precipitating events (e.g., injury and surgery), and a waxing and waning course (including spontaneous remissions) are commonly reported. Active psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression and anxiety) and ongoing psychosocial stressors also warrant evaluation. Positive physical examination signs (e.g., Hoover's sign and tremor entrainment) are key findings, as one of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The neuropsychiatric assessment proposed emphasizes diagnosing FND by using ""rule-in"" physical signs while also considering psychiatric and psychosocial factors to aid in the development of a patient-centered treatment plan.","['Perez DL', 'Aybek S', 'Popkirov S', 'Kozlowska K', 'Stephen CD', 'Anderson J', 'Shura R', 'Ducharme S', 'Carson A', 'Hallett M', 'Nicholson TR', 'Stone J', 'LaFrance WC', 'Voon V', '(On behalf of the American Neuropsychiatric Association Committee for Research']",2021,33,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Perez DL, et al.

32732388,Occupational therapy consensus recommendations for functional neurological disorder.,"BACKGROUND: People with functional neurological disorder (FND) are commonly seen by occupational therapists; however, there are limited descriptions in the literature about the type of interventions that are likely to be helpful. This document aims to address this issue by providing consensus recommendations for occupational therapy assessment and intervention.
METHODS: The recommendations were developed in four stages. Stage 1: an invitation was sent to occupational therapists with expertise in FND in different countries to complete two surveys exploring their opinions regarding best practice for assessment and interventions for FND. Stage 2: a face-to-face meeting of multidisciplinary clinical experts in FND discussed and debated the data from stage 1, aiming to achieve consensus on each issue. Stage 3: recommendations based on the meeting were drafted. Stage 4: successive drafts of recommendations were circulated among the multidisciplinary group until consensus was achieved.
RESULTS: We recommend that occupational therapy treatment for FND is based on a biopsychosocial aetiological framework. Education, rehabilitation within functional activity and the use of taught self-management strategies are central to occupational therapy intervention for FND. Several aspects of occupational therapy for FND are distinct from therapy for other neurological conditions. Examples to illustrate the recommendations are included within this document.
CONCLUSIONS: Occupational therapists have an integral role in the multidisciplinary management of people with FND.

32718273,Psychologically Informed Physical Therapy for Children and Adolescents With Functional Neurological Symptoms: The Wellness Approach.,"Children with functional neurological disorder (FND) present with motor and sensory neurological symptoms that impair health and physical functioning and that create an ongoing clinical burden for caregivers and hospitals worldwide. Treatment programs for these children involve a multidisciplinary approach with physical therapy as a fundamental component. However, standard musculoskeletal approaches to physical therapy are ineffective or may even exacerbate symptoms because they are unresponsive to the biopsychosocial context in which FND emerges: FND typically occurs in the context of stress, either physical or emotional; symptoms are amplified by attention; and presentations are complicated by psychological factors. Informed, in part, by published guidelines for physical therapy with adult FND patients, this article examines common challenges that arise when working with children: overcoming previous negative encounters in the medical system; avoiding amplification of symptoms by drawing attention to them; and managing comorbid pain, falls, faints, nonepileptic seizures, dizziness, fatigue, and breathlessness, plus psychological symptoms such as anticipatory anxiety and panic attacks. What emerges is a psychologically informed therapeutic approach to physical therapy for children with functional neurological symptoms. This approach prioritizes interpersonal processes and physical therapy techniques that establish a therapeutic relationship and create a safe space for physical therapy, that use indirect physical therapy approaches redirecting the focus of attention away from symptoms and emphasizing the completion of tasks and activities engaging the sick body part indirectly, that tailor the intervention to address the needs and presentation of each particular child, and that integrate psychological interventions to manage common challenges.","['Gray N', 'Savage B', 'Scher S', 'Kozlowska K']",2020,32,4,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Gray N, et al.

32698104,Functional neurological disorder: Characteristics and outcome in a limited-resources country (Sudan).,"BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of reports from limited-resources countries on functional neurological disorder (FND). We therefore carried out this descriptive study from Sudan to highlight the clinical characteristics of patients and the cultural, diagnostic, and management outcome.
METHOD: Of 1000 new referrals and patients seen at a central neuropsychiatric clinic in Khartoum, Sudan, 40 fulfilled the criteria for FND. Subjects were diagnosed by excluding organic illness and confirming psychological distress through neuropsychological assessment and clinical interview. Mood was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scales.
RESULTS: Young unemployed women constituted 60% of our sample. Most subjects presented with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (82.5%), speech abnormalities (47.5%), and limb paralysis or weakness was (35%). Associated mood disorder was found in 97.5% of all subjects. However, 95% of our sample showed a remarkable clinical response to combination therapy (antidepressants and psychotherapy).
SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with FND showed strong evidence of comorbid affective disorders in the form of depression and anxiety disorder. Most patients (95%) responded well to combination therapy with antidepressants and psychotherapy. Sociodemographic correlates of FND in Sudan prove to be consistent with features found in Western cultures, with only minor idiosyncratic characteristics due to local culture.","['Osman AH', 'Alsharief SM', 'Siddig HE']",2020,111,,Epilepsy Behav,"Osman AH, et al.

32690119,Inpatient Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorder: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this scoping review is to describe the characteristics of patients requiring admission to hospital for functional neurological disorder (FND), assess interventions provided, and evaluate outcomes in the context of acute hospital presentation or elective admission with chronic symptoms (>3 months).
METHODS: A scoping review was performed. Included articles described adult patients admitted with FND to an inpatient care setting. Articles focusing on psychogenic non-epileptic attacks (PNEA) were excluded.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 1963 citations. A total of 34 articles met inclusion criteria, with 458 patients (66% female) described. The pooled mean age of patients in all studies was 40.6 years. Eleven studies described patients with acute presentation, and 16 studies described patients with chronic FND symptoms admitted to the hospital. Motor symptoms were most common. Interventions were most commonly physiotherapy and psychotherapy. Most studies reported partial or complete resolution of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review summarizes the literature on the characteristics of patients admitted to the hospital, both with acute and chronic symptoms, for inpatient treatment of FND. When comparing patients with acute to those with chronic symptoms, we found that acute presentations were older (46.9 vs. 43.7 years) and had a higher representation of men (33% vs. 30%). Those presenting with chronic symptoms were more likely to not improve or relapse. We postulate that early diagnosis and inpatient rehabilitation could have a positive impact on outcomes for patients with FND.","['Gilmour GS', 'Jenkins JD']",2021,48,2,Can J Neurol Sci,Gilmour GS and Jenkins JD.

32541544,Attentional Processing and Interpretative Bias in Functional Neurological Disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: Altered attentional processing (automatically attending to negative or illness-relevant information) and interpretative biases (interpreting ambiguous information as negative or illness relevant) may be mechanistically involved in functional neurological disorder (FND). Common mechanisms between FND and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been proposed but not compared experimentally.
METHODS: We compared the cognitive task performance of FND, CFS, and healthy control (HC) groups. The tasks assessed attentional bias toward illness-relevant stimuli (visual probe task), attentional control (attention network task), and somatic interpretations (interpretative bias task), alongside self-reported depression, anxiety, fatigue, and general health.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven participants diagnosed with FND, 52 participants diagnosed with CFS, and 51 HC participants were included. Although participants with CFS showed attentional bias for illness-relevant stimuli relative to HC (t = -3.13, p = .002, d = 0.624), individuals with FND did not (t = -1.59, p = .118, d = 0.379). Both the FND (t = 3.08, p = .003, d = 0.759) and CFS (t = 2.74, p = .007, d = 0.548) groups displayed worse attentional control than did the HC group. Similarly, the FND (t = 3.63, p < .001, d = 0.801) and CFS groups (t = 4.58, p < .001, d = 0.909) showed more somatic interpretative bias than did the HC group.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar attentional control deficits and somatic interpretative bias in individuals with FND and CFS support potential shared mechanisms underlying symptoms. Interpretative bias toward somatic and illness-relevant stimuli in functional disorders may prove a therapeutic target.","['Keynejad RC', 'Fenby E', 'Pick S', 'Moss-Morris R', 'Hirsch C', 'Chalder T', 'Hughes AM', 'Nicholson TR']",2020,82,6,Psychosom Med,"Keynejad RC, et al.

32496293,Cognitive Complaints in Motor Functional Neurological (Conversion) Disorders: A Focused Review and Clinical Perspective.,"Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by sensorimotor symptoms exhibiting features incompatible with other neurologic diseases. Individuals with motor FND (mFND) typically present with limb weakness, nonepileptic seizures, and/or abnormal movements. However, this population also frequently reports clouded thinking, inattention, and memory difficulties. Cognitive complaints in individuals with mFND are important to evaluate as they may negatively impact quality of life and impede treatment engagement. We provide a narrative review of the neuropsychological testing literature detailing neurocognitive profiles of individuals with mFND. We also present three illustrative clinical cases at the intersection of mFND and cognitive concerns. Several studies and our case examples highlight that generally normal cognitive performance can be observed concurrently with subjective cognitive complaints in some individuals with mFND; this mismatch may be a possible ""rule-in"" sign of functional cognitive symptoms. Other studies have reported impairments in attention, memory, language, visuospatial, and executive functioning in individuals with mFND. These impairments could be related to medical-psychiatric comorbidities, psychotropic medication side effects, and intrinsic disease mechanisms. When evaluating individuals with mFND and their cognitive complaints, clinicians can use performance validity test and psychopathology findings to help them interpret the neuropsychological test results. Perceptual mismatches between intact objective cognitive performance and subjective cognitive complaints may reflect a negative attentional bias for cognitive abilities that can be targeted with cognitive retraining and cognitive behavioral therapy. Neuropsychological evaluations may provide a useful adjunctive tool clinicians can use to help assess individuals with mFND and cognitive concerns.","['Alluri PR', 'Solit J', 'Leveroni CL', 'Goldberg K', 'Vehar JV', 'Pollak LE', 'Colvin MK', 'Perez DL']",2020,33,2,Cogn Behav Neurol,"Alluri PR, et al.

32435447,Psychedelic treatment of functional neurological disorder: a systematic review.,"Functional neurological disorder (FND), formerly known as conversion disorder, causes a high burden of disability and distress, and is amongst the most commonly encountered conditions in neurology clinics and neuropsychiatric services, yet the therapeutic evidence base is somewhat limited. There has been recent interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and in recent studies psychedelics have shown promise in treating a range of neuropsychiatric conditions. Modification of neural circuits associated with self-representation is thought to underlie some of this effect, and as some contemporary theories of FND focus on aberrant somatic self-representation, psychedelics may therefore represent an unexplored treatment option for FND. We systematically reviewed studies involving the use of psychedelics in FND. Nine studies published between 1954 and 1967, with a total of 26 patients, were identified. Due to restriction of licencing of psychedelic drugs since this period, no modern studies were identified. In most cases, patients received a course of psychotherapy with variable adjunctive administration of psychedelics (in a combination known as 'psycholytic therapy'), with protocols varying between studies. Of those treated, 69% (","['Butler M', 'Seynaeve M', 'Nicholson TR', 'Pick S', 'Kanaan RA', 'Lees A', 'Young AH', 'Rucker J']",2020,10,,Ther Adv Psychopharmacol,"Butler M, et al.

32284249,Sensory Processing Difficulties in Functional Neurological Disorder: A Possible Predisposing Vulnerability?,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric condition characterized by sensorimotor difficulties. Patients with FND at times report that sensory experiences trigger and/or exacerbate their symptoms. Sensory processing difficulties are also commonly reported in other psychiatric disorders frequently comorbid in FND, suggesting that contextualizing sensory profiles in FND within a biopsychosocial model may be clinically relevant.
OBJECTIVE: To address this literature gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine sensory processing patterns and their relationship to other neuropsychiatric characteristics in patients with FND.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review design was used to investigate sensory processing patterns, established with the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile self-report questionnaire, in 44 patients with FND. Univariate analyses of cross-sectional screening tests followed by multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify clinical factors associated with sensory processing scores in the FND cohort.
RESULTS: Compared to normative data, most patients with FND reported sensory processing tendencies toward low registration, sensory sensitivity, and sensation avoiding. In multivariate regression analyses, the presence of a lifetime anxiety disorder independently predicted elevated low registration scores, while female gender and number of current medications independently predicted increased sensory sensitivity scores. In uncorrected univariate analyses only, individuals with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures were more likely to report increased sensory sensitivity and elevated low registration.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings support sensory processing difficulties in some patients with FND. Prospective and large sample size studies are needed to investigate relationships between sensory processing profiles and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, FND subtypes, and treatment outcomes.","['Ranford J', 'MacLean J', 'Alluri PR', 'Comeau O', 'Godena E', 'LaFrance WC', 'Hunt A', 'Stephen CD', 'Perez DL']",2020,61,4,Psychosomatics,"Ranford J, et al.

This study examines neurocognitive functioning in patients with CD/FND compared to patients with other SSRD. The sample consisted of 318 patients. Twenty-nine patients were diagnosed with CD/FND, mean age 42.4, standard deviation (SD) = 13.8 years, 79.3% women, and 289 patients had other SSRD (mean age 42.1, SD = 13.3, 60.2% women). Patients completed a neuropsychological test battery that addressed a broad range of neurocognitive domains, including information processing speed, attention and executive functioning. Patients with CD/FND had clinically significant neurocognitive deficits in all neurocognitive domains based on normative data comparison. Patients with CD/FND also performed significantly worse than patients with other SSRD on information processing speed (Digit Symbol Substitution Test (V = .115, p = .035), Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT) card 1 (V = .190, p = .006), and SCWT card 2 (V = .244, p < .001). No CD/FND vs. other SSRD differences were observed in other neurocognitive domains.

32111637,Outcome measurement in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and recommendations.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify existing outcome measures for functional neurological disorder (FND), to inform the development of recommendations and to guide future research on FND outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify existing FND-specific outcome measures and the most common measurement domains and measures in previous treatment studies. Searches of Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were conducted between January 1965 and June 2019. The findings were discussed during two international meetings of the FND-Core Outcome Measures group.
RESULTS: Five FND-specific measures were identified-three clinician-rated and two patient-rated-but their measurement properties have not been rigorously evaluated. No single measure was identified for use across the range of FND symptoms in adults. Across randomised controlled trials (k=40) and observational treatment studies (k=40), outcome measures most often assessed core FND symptom change. Other domains measured commonly were additional physical and psychological symptoms, life impact (ie, quality of life, disability and general functioning) and health economics/cost-utility (eg, healthcare resource use and quality-adjusted life years).
CONCLUSIONS: There are few well-validated FND-specific outcome measures. Thus, at present, we recommend that existing outcome measures, known to be reliable, valid and responsive in FND or closely related populations, are used to capture key outcome domains. Increased consistency in outcome measurement will facilitate comparison of treatment effects across FND symptom types and treatment modalities. Future work needs to more rigorously validate outcome measures used in this population.","['Pick S', 'Anderson DG', 'Asadi-Pooya AA', 'Aybek S', 'Baslet G', 'Bloem BR', 'Bradley-Westguard A', 'Brown RJ', 'Carson AJ', 'Chalder T', 'Damianova M', 'David AS', 'Edwards MJ', 'Epstein SA', 'Espay AJ', 'Garcin B', 'Goldstein LH', 'Hallett M', 'Jankovic J', 'Joyce EM', 'Kanaan RA', 'Keynejad RC', 'Kozlowska K', 'LaFaver K', 'LaFrance WC', 'Lang AE', 'Lehn A', 'Lidstone S', 'Maurer CW', 'Mildon B', 'Morgante F', 'Myers L', 'Nicholson C', 'Nielsen G', 'Perez DL', 'Popkirov S', 'Reuber M', 'Rommelfanger KS', 'Schwingenshuh P', 'Serranova T', 'Shotbolt P', 'Stebbins GT', 'Stone J', 'Tijssen MA', 'Tinazzi M', 'Nicholson TR']",2020,91,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Pick S, et al.

32051548,Early-life trauma endophenotypes and brain circuit-gene expression relationships in functional neurological (conversion) disorder.,"Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a neuropsychiatric condition whereby individuals present with sensorimotor symptoms incompatible with other neurological disorders. Early-life maltreatment (ELM) is a risk factor for developing FND, yet few studies have investigated brain network-trauma relationships in this population. In this neuroimaging-gene expression study, we used two graph theory approaches to elucidate ELM subtype effects on resting-state functional connectivity architecture in 30 patients with motor FND. Twenty-one individuals with comparable depression, anxiety, and ELM scores were used as psychiatric controls. Thereafter, we compared trauma endophenotypes in FND with regional differences in transcriptional gene expression as measured by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). In FND patients only, we found that early-life physical abuse severity, and to a lesser extent physical neglect, correlated with corticolimbic weighted-degree functional connectivity. Connectivity profiles influenced by physical abuse occurred in limbic (amygdalar-hippocampal), paralimbic (cingulo-insular and ventromedial prefrontal), and cognitive control (ventrolateral prefrontal) areas, as well as in sensorimotor and visual cortices. These findings held adjusting for individual differences in depression/anxiety, PTSD, and motor phenotypes. In FND, physical abuse also correlated with amygdala and insula coupling to motor cortices. In exploratory analyses, physical abuse correlated connectivity maps overlapped with the AHBA spatial expression of three gene clusters: (i) neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission genes in limbic/paralimbic areas; (ii) locomotory behavior and neuronal generation genes in left-lateralized structures; and (iii) nervous system development and cell motility genes in right-lateralized structures. These circuit-specific architectural profiles related to individual differences in childhood physical abuse burden advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of FND.","['Diez I', 'Larson AG', 'Nakhate V', 'Dunn EC', 'Fricchione GL', 'Nicholson TR', 'Sepulcre J', 'Perez DL']",2021,26,8,Mol Psychiatry,"Diez I, et al.

An observational longitudinal study.,"OBJECTIVE: Explore trauma, stress, and other predictive factors for treatment outcome in conversion disorder/functional neurological disorder (CD/FND).
METHODS: Prospective observational design. Clinical cohort study among consecutive outpatients with DSM-IV CD/FND in a specialized mental health institution for somatic symptom disorders and related disorders (SSRD), presented between 1 February 2010 and 31 December 2017. Patient files were assessed for early childhood trauma, childhood sexual abuse, current stress, and other predictive factors. Patient-related routine outcome monitoring (PROM) data were evaluated for treatment outcome at physical (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ15], Physical Symptoms Questionnaire [PSQ]) level as primary outcome, and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ9]), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder [GAD7]), general functioning (Short Form 36 Health Survey [SF36]), and pain (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]) as secondary outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 64 outpatients were included in the study. 70.3% of the sample reported childhood trauma and 64.1% a recent life event. Mean scores of patients proceeding to treatment improved. Sexual abuse in childhood (F(1, 28) = 30.068, β = 0.608 p < .001) was significantly associated with worse physical (PHQ15, PSQ) treatment outcome. 42.2% reported comorbid depression, and this was significantly associated with worse concomitant depressive (PHQ9) (F[1, 39] = 11.526, β = 0.478, p = .002) and anxiety (GAD7) (F[1,34] = 7.950, β = 0.435, p = .008) outcome.

31986440,"Terminology for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: Making the case for ""functional seizures"".","PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to review the literature on the terminologies for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) and make a proposal on the terminology of this condition. This proposal reflects the authors' own opinions.
METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) and EMBASE from inception to October 10, 2019 for articles written in English with a main focus on PNES (with or without discussion of other functional neurological disorders) and which either proposed or discussed the accuracy or appropriateness of PNES terminologies.
RESULTS: The search strategy reported above yielded 757 articles; 30 articles were eventually included, which were generally of low quality. ""Functional seizures"" (FS) appeared to be an acceptable terminology to name this condition from the perspective of patients. In addition, FS is a term that is relatively popular with clinicians.
CONCLUSION: From the available evidence, FS meets more of the criteria proposed for an acceptable label than other popular terms in the field. While the term FS is neutral with regard to etiology and pathology (particularly regarding whether psychological or not), other terms such as ""dissociative"", ""conversion"", or ""psychogenic"" seizures are not. In addition, FS can potentially facilitate multidisciplinary (physical and psychological) management more than other terms. Adopting a universally accepted terminology to describe this disorder could standardize our approach to the illness and facilitate communication between healthcare professionals, patients, their families, carers, and the wider public.","['Asadi-Pooya AA', 'Brigo F', 'Mildon B', 'Nicholson TR']",2020,104,Pt A,Epilepsy Behav,"Asadi-Pooya AA, et al.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical outcome of acute FND, captured as 'stroke-mimics'.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of studies with outcome data on functional stroke mimics. Authors were contacted to provide more information on their FND mimics, including baseline, discharge and follow-up stroke scales. A random effects meta-analysis of proportion of 'good outcome' was the primary measure of interest, with additional descriptive and statistical analysis. 'Good outcome' employed the usual conventions of modified Rankin Score (mRS) or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≤ 1.
RESULTS: Eight studies with 79 patients were identified and analysed, all of cohorts undergoing thrombolysis. The mean age at presentation was 49.7 years with a 62% female preponderance, and median NIHSS score of 4. The proportion of patients with mRS or NIHSS ≤ 1 changed significantly from admission to discharge or follow up [from 24 (30%) to 50 (63%), p < 0.001]. Meta-analysis of the synthesized data showed the pooled standardized mean change (SMC) was statistically significant (SMC = - 1.28, [95% CI = -2.25, - 0.30], p = 0.010) indicating good symptomatic outcome for acute FND patients presenting as stroke-mimics. Heterogeneity was large.
CONCLUSION: Patients presenting with acute motor FND have good outcome of their presenting symptoms by discharge and at follow-up, following thrombolysis for presumed stroke, in contrast to specialist cohorts. Demographic differences, in addition to the thrombolysis, are possible explanations for these more favourable results.","['Simhan S', 'Thijs V', 'Mancuso S', 'Tsivgoulis G', 'Katsanos A', 'Alexandrov AV', 'Kanaan RA']",2020,267,5,J Neurol,"Simhan S, et al.

31920316,Managing Functional Neurological Disorders: Protocol of a Cohort Study on Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures Study.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) are neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by an underlying neurological lesion or other medical illness and that do not have clear neuropathological correlates. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are a common and highly disabling form of FND, characterized by paroxysmal episodes of involuntary movements and altered consciousness that can appear clinically similar to epileptic seizures. PNES are unique among FNDs in that they are diagnosed by video electroencephalographic (VEEG), a well-established biomarker for the disorder. The course of illness and response to treatment of PNES remain controversial. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of PNES in the Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA), evaluate outcomes of veterans offered different treatments, and compare models of care for PNES.
METHODS: This electronic health record (EHR) cohort study utilizes an informatics search tool and a natural language processing algorithm to identify cases of PNES nationally. We will use VA inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and chart abstraction data across all 170 medical centers to identify cases in fiscal years 2002-2018. Outcome measurements such as seizure frequency, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, suicide-related behavior, and the utilization of psychotherapy prior to and after PNES diagnosis will be used to assess the effectiveness of models of care.
DISCUSSION: This study will describe the risk factors and course of treatment of a large cohort of people with PNES. Since PNES are cared for by a variety of different modalities, treatment orientations, and models of care, effectiveness outcomes such as seizure outcomes and utilization of emergency visits for seizures will be assessed. Outcome measurements such as seizure frequency, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, suicide-related behavior, and psychotherapy prior to and after PNES diagnosis will be used to assess the effectiveness of models of care.","['Altalib HH', 'Galluzzo D', 'Argraves S', 'Goulet J', 'Bornovski Y', 'Cheung KH', 'Jackson-Shaheed E', 'Tolchin B', 'Fenton BT', 'Pugh MJ']",2019,15,,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,"Altalib HH, et al.

31911360,Dealing with the unknown. Functional neurological disorder (FND) and the conversion of cultural meaning.,"Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), otherwise known as Conversion Disorder, is characterized by abnormal sensory or motor symptoms that are determined to be ""incompatible"" with neurological disease. FND patients are a challenge for contemporary medicine. They experience high levels of distress, disability, and social isolation, yet a large proportion of those treated do not get better. Patients with FNDs are often misdiagnosed and suffer from stigma, dysfunctional medical encounters and scarcity of adequate treatments. In this paper we argue that an anthropological understanding of these phenomena is needed for improving diagnosis and therapies. We argue that cultural meaning is pivotal in the development of FND on three levels. 1) The embodiment of cultural models, as shared representations and beliefs about illnesses shape the manifestation of symptoms and the meanings of sensations; 2) The socialization of personal trauma and chronic stress, as the way in which individuals are socially primed to cope or to reframe personal trauma and chronic stress affects bodily symptoms; 3) Moral judgment, as stigma and ethical evaluations of symptoms impact coping abilities and resilience. In particular, we focus on the disorder known as PNES (Psychogenic-Non-Epileptic Seizure) to show how cultural meaning co-determines the development of such seizures. We introduce the notion of interoceptive affordances to account for the cultural scaffolding of patients' bodily experiences. Finally, we suggest that effective treatments of FND must act upon meaning in all of its aspects, and treatment adequacy must be assessed according to the cultural diversity of patients.","['Canna M', 'Seligman R']",2020,246,,Soc Sci Med,Canna M and Seligman R.

31865871,Outcome Measures for Functional Neurological Disorder: A Review of the Theoretical Complexities.,"The development and selection of optimal outcome measures is increasingly recognized as a key component of evidence-based medicine, particularly the need for the development of a standardized set of measures for use in clinical trials. This process is particularly complex for functional neurological disorder (FND) for several reasons. FND can present with a wide range of symptoms that resemble the full spectrum of other neurological disorders. Additional physical (e.g., pain, fatigue) and psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety) symptoms are commonly associated with FND, which also can be highly disabling with implications for prognosis, and warrant concurrent assessment, despite an unclear etiological relationship with FND. Furthermore, several unique clinical aspects of FND make it likely that the usual prioritization of ""objective"" (or clinician-rated) over ""subjective"" (or patient-rated) measures might not be appropriate. Self-report measures may be more clinically meaningful in this patient population. Despite being a common and disabling disorder, there has been little research into outcome measures in FND, and to date trials have largely used measures designed for the assessment of other disorders. An international FND Core Outcome Measure group (FND-COM) has been established to develop a consensus battery of outcomes for FND: a ""core outcome set."" In this perspective article, the authors reviewed the process of outcome measure development and selection before considering the specific features of FND affecting the development of a core outcome set, as well as a research agenda to optimize outcome measurement in this complex neuropsychiatric disorder.","['Nicholson TR', 'Carson A', 'Edwards MJ', 'Goldstein LH', 'Hallett M', 'Mildon B', 'Nielsen G', 'Nicholson C', 'Perez DL', 'Pick S', 'Stone J', 'and the FND-COM (Functional Neurological Disorders Core Outcome Measures) Group', 'FND-COM group collaborators are as follows']",2020,32,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Nicholson TR, et al.

31865870,"Evaluation of LiNES: A New Measure of Trauma, Negative Affect, and Relationship Insecurity Over the Life Span in Persons With FND.","OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated potential predisposing vulnerabilities and perpetuating factors among individuals with functional neurological disorder (FND) by using the novel Lifespan Negative Experiences Scale (LiNES), which assesses retrospective self-report of interpersonal trauma, negative affect, and relationship insecurity at three developmental stages: childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.
METHODS: The LiNES, Childhood Abuse and Trauma Scale (CATS), Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) were administered to 71 individuals with FND. The reliability and validity of LiNES were examined by correlation with the other measures. FND patients' responses on LiNES were compared with those of 170 healthy control subjects.
RESULTS: LiNES scores in the FND group were internally consistent and correlated highly with CATS, RSQ, and PANAS scores. At each developmental stage, LiNES trauma scores were higher among patients with FND, compared with control subjects. The FND subgroup, which comprised patients who also had nonepileptic attack disorder, had higher trauma scores, compared with the FND-only subgroup. Compared with control subjects, patients with FND reported greater negative affect and relationship insecurity in adulthood. Lifetime LiNES scores for interpersonal trauma and relationship insecurity predicted FND group classification with >80% accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further support for the links between FND and trauma, negative affect, and insecure attachment. Recognition of these factors is likely to be important for treatment and stratification of important subpopulations in research. These findings provide new insights into the association between the timing of negative experiences and their effect, with LiNES emerging as a potentially useful measure for patients presenting with FND.","['Levita L', 'Mayberry E', 'Mehmood A', 'Reuber M']",2020,32,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Levita L, et al.

31769368,Reduced limbic microstructural integrity in functional neurological disorder.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a condition at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry. Individuals with FND exhibit corticolimbic abnormalities, yet little is known about the role of white matter tracts in the pathophysiology of FND. This study characterized between-group differences in microstructural integrity, and correlated fiber bundle integrity with symptom severity, physical disability, and illness duration.
METHODS: A diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study was performed in 32 patients with mixed FND compared to 36 healthy controls. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were collected along with patient-reported symptom severity, physical disability (Short Form Health Survey-36), and illness duration data. Weighted-degree and link-level graph theory and probabilistic tractography analyses characterized fractional anisotropy (FA) values across cortico-subcortical connections. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, FND patients showed reduced FA in the stria terminalis/fornix, medial forebrain bundle, extreme capsule, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundle, corpus callosum, and striatal-postcentral gyrus projections. Except for the stria terminalis/fornix, these differences remained significant adjusting for depression and anxiety. In within-group analyses, physical disability inversely correlated with stria terminalis/fornix and medial forebrain bundle FA values; illness duration negatively correlated with stria terminalis/fornix white matter integrity. A FND symptom severity composite score did not correlate with FA in patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In this first DTI study of mixed FND, microstructural differences were observed in limbic and associative tracts implicated in salience, defensive behaviors, and emotion regulation. These findings advance our understanding of neurocircuit pathways in the pathophysiology of FND.","['Diez I', 'Williams B', 'Kubicki MR', 'Makris N', 'Perez DL']",2021,51,3,Psychol Med,"Diez I, et al.

31731915,The role of the anterior and midcingulate cortex in the neurobiology of functional neurologic disorder.,"Functional neurologic disorder (FND)/conversion disorder is a prevalent and disabling condition at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry. Clinicians often report feeling ill-equipped treating patients with FND, perpetuated by a historically limited understanding of neurobiologic disease mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the neuroimaging literature across the spectrum of sensorimotor FND, including functional imaging studies during rest, sensorimotor performance, and emotional-processing tasks as well as structural magnetic resonance imaging findings. Particular attention is given to studies implicating the anterior and middle cingulate cortex and related salience network structures (insula, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray) in the neurobiology of FND. Neuroimaging studies identify cingulo-insular functional alterations during rest, motor performance, and emotion processing in FND populations. The literature also supports that patients with FND exhibit heightened amygdalar and periaqueductal gray reactivity to emotionally valenced stimuli, enhanced coupling between amygdalar and motor control areas, and increased amygdalar volumes. The structural neuroimaging literature also implicates cingulo-insular areas in the pathophysiology of FND, though these findings require replication and clarification. While more research is needed to fully elucidate the pathophysiology of FND, salience network alterations appear present in some FND populations and can be contextualized using biopsychosocial models for FND.","['Ospina JP', 'Jalilianhasanpour R', 'Perez DL']",2019,166,,Handb Clin Neurol,"Ospina JP, et al.

31687867,Virtual Reality-Delivered Mirror Visual Feedback and Exposure Therapy for FND: A Midpoint Report of a Randomized Controlled Feasibility Study.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to provide preliminary feasibility, safety, and efficacy data for a personalized virtual reality-delivered mirror visual feedback (VR-MVF) and exposure therapy (VR-ET) intervention for functional neurological disorder (FND).
METHODS: Midpoint results of a single-blind, randomized controlled pilot are presented. Fourteen adults were randomly assigned to eight weekly 30-minute VR sessions-seven in the treatment arm and seven in the control arm. The treatment arm consisted of an immersive avatar-embodied VR-MVF treatment, plus optional weekly VR-ET starting at session 4 if participants had identifiable FND triggers. The control arm received equally immersive nonembodied sessions involving exploration of a virtual interactive space. Feasibility was measured by acceptability of randomization, completion rates, side effects, adverse events, and integrity of blinding procedures. Exploratory primary and secondary outcome measures were weekly symptom frequency and the Oxford Handicap Scale, respectively.
RESULTS: Two early dropouts occurred in the treatment arm, resulting in an 86% completion rate (N=12/14). No side effects or adverse events were reported. Blind assessment at study end indicated that two of the seven treatment arm and three of the seven control arm participants incorrectly guessed their assignment. Changes in mean symptom frequency and disability were reported, but data will not be statistically analyzed until study end.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report on MVF and VR for treatment of FND. Results generated thus far support feasibility and justify continuation of the study and further investigation into the efficacy of VR interventions for FND.","['Bullock K', 'Won AS', 'Bailenson J', 'Friedman R']",2020,32,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Bullock K, et al.

31684891,Modification of both functional neurological symptoms and neuroimaging patterns with a good anatomoclinical concordance: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: In the nineteenth century, Jean Martin Charcot explained functional neurological disorder (formerly called conversion disorder) as a ""psychodynamic"" lesion. Numerous advances in neuroimaging have permitted identification of the neural underpinnings of this disorder.
CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we describe a case of functional neurological disorder (FND) with initial left sensorimotor deficit, in-coordinated limb movements, neglect, clouded consciousness, slurred speech and a semiology of visual impairment. A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed a right thalamic hypoperfusion, which is rather concordant with the initial semiology. Later, the semiology changed, presenting with a predominantly neurovisual complex presentation. The second SPECT showed no more thalamic abnormalities but an hypoperfusion in the right temporo-occipital junction, right inferior parietal lobe and left superior frontal lobe, which is also rather concordant with the changing semiology.
CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the evolving neuroimaging patterns of FND but also the concordance between semiology and neuroimaging findings in FND supporting Charcot's theory of ""dynamic lesion"".","['Galli S', 'Aybek S', 'Chokron S', 'Moulin T', 'Magnin E']",2019,19,1,BMC Neurol,"Galli S, et al.

31662092,Emotional Reactivity as a Vulnerability for Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures? Responses While Reliving Specific Emotions.,"OBJECTIVE: Dysfunction in emotional processes is a hypothesized contributor to functional neurological disorders (FNDs), yet few studies have evoked real-time emotion during multimethod assessment incorporating subjective, behavioral, and psychophysiological indicators. This approach may reveal clinical and neurobiological vulnerability to FND and clarify how dysfunctional emotional processes serve as perpetuating factors.
METHODS: Eleven participants with video-EEG-confirmed diagnoses of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) were compared with 49 seizure-free trauma control subjects (TCs) with or without clinically elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms (25 clinically elevated [TC-clin], 24 not clinically elevated [TC-nonclin]). Participants recalled and described memories evoking anger, shame, happiness, and neutral feelings.
RESULTS: Even though PNES patients and TCs reported similar amounts of emotional experience, PNES patients reported more difficulty reliving emotions and were less likely to complete the relived shame task. During and after reliving happiness, PNES and TC-clin groups showed respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) decreases, indicating parasympathetic withdrawal, whereas the TC-nonclin group showed RSA increases.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this pilot study are consistent with previous research and clinical observations that emotional engagement may be more effortful for PNES patients. Patterns of RSA change, which may also point to greater effortful engagement, were similar in PNES and TC-clin groups, suggesting that traumatic stress reactions may play a part. At the same time, experience of greater difficulty or avoidance may be even greater among PNES patients. Especially when regulatory resources are already limited, accumulated effort, coupled with self-threatening contexts such as shame, may be particularly problematic for those with PNES and perhaps other FNDs.","['Roberts NA', 'Burleson MH', 'Torres DL', 'Parkhurst DK', 'Garrett R', 'Mitchell LB', 'Duncan CJ', 'Mintert M', 'Wang NC']",2020,32,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Roberts NA, et al.

31619119,What Does Neuroscience Tell Us About the Conversion Model of Functional Neurological Disorders?,"A dualistic mind-body understanding of functional neurological disorders (FNDs), also known as conversion disorders, has led to the view that the cause of the symptom should be either psychological (psychogenic) or physical (neurogenic-""organic""). One of the most influential psychological approaches is the Freudian model of conversion, which suggests that FNDs arise from a defense process in which emotional stress is converted into physical symptoms. This conversion theory has been challenged in recent years, accompanied by a shift in emphasis toward neuropathophysiological models of FND and away from historical psychological concepts. In this review, the authors consider the contemporary relevance of the conversion model from the neuroscientific perspective to reconcile the role of both psychological and biological factors in FND. A narrative review of recent neuroscientific findings pertaining to the conversion model of FND, encompassing neuroimaging, cognitive psychology, biological markers, and epigenetic studies, was performed. Research on the role of psychological stressors is discussed. Neurobiological mechanisms of repression of traumatic memories and their translation into physical symptoms are then explored. Finally, the role of physical symptoms as a potential protective defense mechanism against social stressors is considered. The authors argue that the conversion concept is consistent with recent neuroscientific research findings, and the model allows psychological and neurobiological concepts to be reconciled within a single account of FND that begins to resolve the dualistic mind-body dichotomy.","['Cretton A', 'Brown RJ', 'LaFrance WC', 'Aybek S']",2020,32,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Cretton A, et al.

31587627,What Is the Role of a Specialist Assessment Clinic for FND? Lessons From Three National Referral Centers.,"OBJECTIVE: A growing interest in functional neurological disorders (FND) has led to the development of specialized clinics. This study aimed to better understand the structure and role of such clinics.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from clinical records at three national referral centers, two specifically for motor FND and one for FND in general. Data were for 492 consecutive patients referred over a 9- to 15-month period: 100 from the United Kingdom clinic, 302 from the Swiss clinic, and 90 from the Canadian clinic. Data included symptom subtype and duration, comorbid pain and fatigue, disability, and treatment recommendations.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 492 patients was 44 years, and most (73%) were female. Most had a prolonged motor FND (mean symptom duration of 6 years); 35% were not working because of ill health, 26% received disability benefits, and up to 38% required a care giver for personal care. In the Swiss cohort, 39% were given a diagnosis of another somatic symptom disorder rather than an FND diagnosis. Pain was common in the United Kingdom (79%) and Canada (56%), as was fatigue (48% and 47%, respectively). Most patients (61%) were offered physiotherapy; referral to neuropsychiatry or psychology differed across centers (32%-100%).
CONCLUSIONS: FND specialty clinics have an important role in ensuring correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Most patients with motor FND require specialized neurophysiotherapy. Patients readily accepted an integrated neuropsychiatric approach. Close collaboration between FND clinics and acute neurology facilities might improve early detection of FND and could improve outcomes.","['Aybek S', 'Lidstone SC', 'Nielsen G', 'MacGillivray L', 'Bassetti CL', 'Lang AE', 'Edwards MJ']",2020,32,1,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Aybek S, et al.

31564236,Outpatient Physical Therapy for Functional Neurological Disorder: A Preliminary Feasibility and Naturalistic Outcome Study in a U.S. Cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite promising research and consensus recommendations on the important therapeutic role of physical therapy for motor functional neurological disorder (FND), little is known about the feasibility and potential efficacy of implementing physical therapy for this population in a U.S.-based outpatient program. Given health care system differences internationally, this is an important gap in the literature.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the authors investigated the relationship between treatment adherence and clinical outcome in a hospital-based outpatient physical therapy clinical program. Medical records of 50 consecutive patients with motor FND referred from an FND clinical program were reviewed. The physical therapy intervention included a 1-hour initial assessment and the development of individualized treatment plans guided by published consensus recommendations. Statistical analyses included nonparametric, univariate screening tests followed by multivariate regression analyses.
RESULTS: In univariate analyses, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the number of sessions attended and clinical improvement. This relationship held when adjusting for demographic variables, concurrent psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, and other major neurological comorbidities. In a post hoc analysis of the subset of individuals with available gait speed data, posttreatment 10-meter gait speed times improved compared with baseline measurements. Baseline neuropsychiatric factors did not correlate with clinical improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary, retrospective cohort study demonstrated that treatment adherence to a U.S.-based outpatient physical therapy program was associated with clinical improvement.

31492484,Favourable outcome without psychotherapy in patients with functional neurologic disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients with functional neurologic disorder (FND) may improve without psychotherapy as was suggested by a retrospective study.
METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with newly diagnosed FND. At baseline and at 12 months participants filled out a set of self-reported health questionnaires. During the one-year follow up we recorded the use of psychotherapy.
RESULTS: The study group consisted of 193 included participants. After 12 months 60 participants (60/193 = 31.1%) perceived a favourable outcome. Sixty participants (60/191 = 31.4%) were referred for psychotherapy. Multivariable logistic regression showed that participants with a high level of somatisation were less likely to have a favourable outcome (adjusted OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.29 to 1.04; p = 0.07). We could not demonstrate an independent significant impact of the use of psychotherapy on favourable outcome (adjusted OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.30; p = 0.22).
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the results of the retrospective study.

31483585,[A patient with unexplained neurological symptoms].,"In this case of a 54-year-old woman, severe impairment of motor and sensory function - that could not be assigned to any neurological disease - was diagnosed as a probable conversion disorder or functional neurological disorder (FND). Several psychological stressors, which occurred in the year that preceded the first development of symptoms, were linked to the disorder. Nerve conduction values had not shown any abnormalities at the onset of the disease. However, as the condition progressed, cerebrospinal fluid and nerve conduction study proved an underlying polyneuropathy. In this article we discuss the diagnostic process followed in this case. General lack of evidence for psychological conflict being related to symptoms of conversion disorder/FND led to elimination of this criterion in DSM 5. Instead, the diagnostic process of conversion disorder/FND requires not only exclusion of neurological causes for the symptoms, but also active examination of neurological findings that are discrepant with known neurological diseases; taken together this can positively support a diagnosis of conversion disorder/FND.","['Maris-Boes ES', 'Ramdhani-Joosten AAJ', 'Scholte-Stalenhoef AN']",2019,163,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Maris-Boes ES, et al.

31399207,Functional Neurological Disorder Responds Favorably to Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation Models.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is difficult to treat and costly. Interdisciplinary chronic pain rehabilitation programs (iCPRPs) are multidimensional functional restoration interventions for pain; their impact on FND specifically has not been assessed.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess iCPRP's impact on functioning in FND.
METHODS: Data were examined retrospectively from an Institutional Review Board-approved registry capturing admission and discharge data from patients participating in an outpatient iCPRP. Subjective measures included pain-related disability, depression, anxiety, and stress scores, whereas objective measures included physical functioning measures (timed up and go, stair climbing test, and 6-min walk test). Pre-iCPRP and post-iCPRP measures were compared using a paired t-test approach.
RESULTS: Forty-nine FND patients completed care and showed pre-measures and postmeasures. Statistically significant reductions in subjective measures of pain-related disability (46.40-20.91; P < 0.001, d = 1.92), depression (20.38-4.81; P < 0.001, d = 1.53), anxiety (15.09-6.29; P < 0.001, d = 1.18), and stress (21.96-9.70; P < 0.001, d = 1.21) scores were observed. Statistically significant changes in objective measures of mean timed up and go scores (decreased from 15.96 to 8.87 s), stair climbing test scores (increased from 40.98 to 71.93 steps), and mean 6-minute walk test scores (increased from 0.21 to 0.30 miles) were also observed across the group.
CONCLUSIONS: While preliminary and based on a small patient sample, these findings support the use of interdisciplinary care models for FND treatment.

31394458,Individual differences in social network size linked to nucleus accumbens and hippocampal volumes in functional neurological disorder: A pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: In the biopsychosocial formulation of functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND), little is known about relationships between social behavior and brain anatomy. We hypothesized that social behavior would relate to brain areas implicated in affiliative behaviors and that social network size would correlate with symptom severity and predisposing vulnerabilities in FND.
METHODS: This neuroimaging pilot probed how social network size, as measured by the Social Network Index, related to structural brain profiles in 23 patients with motor FND (15 woman and 8 men). FreeSurfer cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric analyses were performed correcting for multiple comparisons. Stratified analyses compared FND patients with a low social network size to matched healthy controls. Secondary exploratory analyses in an expanded sample of 38 FND patients investigated relationships between social network size, risk factors and patient-reported symptom severity.
RESULTS: Adjusting for age and gender, neuroimaging analyses showed that social network size positively correlated with left nucleus accumbens and hippocampal volumes in patients with FND; stratified analyses did not show any group-level differences. In individuals with FND, social network size correlated with health-related quality of life, graduating college, working full-time and a non-epileptic seizure diagnosis; social network size inversely related to lifetime trauma burden, post-traumatic stress disorder severity and age.
LIMITATIONS: Only patient-reported scales were used and social network size information was not collected for healthy subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: This neuroimaging pilot adds to the literature linking affiliation network brain areas to pro-social behaviors and enhances the biopsychosocial conceptualization of FND.","['Ospina JP', 'Larson AG', 'Jalilianhasanpour R', 'Williams B', 'Diez I', 'Dhand A', 'Dickerson BC', 'Perez DL']",2019,258,,J Affect Disord,"Ospina JP, et al.

31326916,Long-term outcomes of functional neurological disorder in children.,"OBJECTIVES: To establish the incidence and long-term outcomes (up to 21 years) of children presenting to a University hospital paediatric neurology service with symptoms due to functional neurological disorder (FND) with particular reference to occurrence of FND or similar symptoms in adulthood.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review to determine characteristics of the original paediatric FND presentation plus record-linkage with providers of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. Chart review of adult medical records for documentation of functional symptoms in adulthood.
RESULTS: 124 individuals (56% female) met entry criteria. The most common presentations were seizures (18%), sensory loss (18%) and motor symptoms (16%). Frequency gradually increased with age of onset with an incidence in paediatric neurological services of 6 per 100 000 children under 16. In up to 21 years' follow-up (median 8.3 years), 114/124 attained their 16th birthdays by the study census date and were thus eligible for inclusion in an analysis of symptom persistence/recurrence in adulthood. 26/114 (23%) showed evidence of FND in adulthood of sufficient significance to be recorded in medical records.
CONCLUSION: Paediatric FND is commoner than previous estimates. Even in this selected population of children reaching specialist paediatric neurology services, a high long-term remission rate is observed.","['Raper J', 'Currigan V', 'Fothergill S', 'Stone J', 'Forsyth RJ']",2019,104,12,Arch Dis Child,"Raper J, et al.

31229424,Survey of the perceptions of health practitioners regarding Functional Neurological Disorders in Australia.,"Objectives of this study were to identify the knowledge and support needs for a wide range of health professions who come in contact with patients with Functional Neurological Disorders (FND) in Australia. Invitations to an anonymous online survey (36 items) were sent to health professionals (practicing in the fields of neurology, psychiatry, psychology, general practice, nursing and physiotherapy) who are involved in the care of patients suffering from FND. Potential participants were invited via professional and hospital databases, advertising in professional newsletters as well as direct emails. A total of 538 health professionals completed the questionnaire. Most participants did not feel well educated about FND with only 14% of General practitioners (GPs) reporting 'good' knowledge. Neurologists, GPs and nurses reported lower clinical interest and greater negative attitude towards FND than psychiatrists, psychologists and physiotherapists. Many health professionals do not feel confident discussing the possibility of a Functional Neurological Disorder with a patient. Seeing more patients per year was significantly correlated with greater knowledge (r = 0.54) and confidence diagnosing (r = 0.49) FND. It was also significantly related to confidence in discussing the diagnosis of FND with a patient (r = 0.44). These factors were not significantly related to years of practice. Although patients suffering from Functional Neurological Disorders are commonly seen by many health professionals in clinic practice, there is little training in this area and self-perceived knowledge in Australia is generally poor. There is, however, clear interest in this area and our findings suggest that improved teaching and education of health professionals about FND and its management could potentially have a significant impact towards better patient care.","['Lehn A', 'Bullock-Saxton J', 'Newcombe P', 'Carson A', 'Stone J']",2019,67,,J Clin Neurosci,"Lehn A, et al.

31146322,Structural alterations in functional neurological disorder and related conditions: a software and hardware problem?,"Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a condition at the interface of neurology and psychiatry. A ""software"" vs. ""hardware"" analogy describes abnormal neurobiological mechanisms occurring in the context of intact macroscopic brain structure. While useful for explanatory and treatment models, this framework may require more nuanced considerations in the context of quantitative structural neuroimaging findings in FND. Moreover, high co-occurrence of FND and somatic symptom disorders (SSD) as defined in DSM-IV (somatization disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and undifferentiated somatoform disorder; referred to as SSD for brevity in this article) raises the possibility of a partially overlapping pathophysiology. In this systematic review, we use a transdiagnostic approach to review and appraise the structural neuroimaging literature in FND and SSD. While larger sample size studies are needed for definitive characterization, this article highlights that individuals with FND and SSD may exhibit sensorimotor, prefrontal, striatal-thalamic, paralimbic, and limbic structural alterations. The structural neuroimaging literature is contextualized within the neurobiology of stress-related neuroplasticity, gender differences, psychiatric comorbidities, and the greater spectrum of functional somatic disorders. Future directions that could accelerate the characterization of the pathophysiology of FND and DSM-5 SSD are outlined, including ""disease staging"" discussions to contextualize subgroups with or without structural changes. Emerging neuroimaging evidence suggests that some individuals with FND and SSD may have a ""software"" and ""hardware"" problem, although if structural alterations are present the neural mechanisms of functional disorders remain distinct from lesional neurological conditions. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether structural alterations relate to predisposing vulnerabilities or consequences of the disorder.","['Bègue I', 'Adams C', 'Stone J', 'Perez DL']",2019,22,,Neuroimage Clin,"Bègue I, et al.

It is complicated.,"Whereas only neurologists can ""rule in"" functional neurologic disorders (FNDs)-using physical signs and semiologic features-their role in follow-up care remains debated. We outlined the arguments for and against a neurologist's primary role in both assessing and managing FNDs. Favorable arguments include the following: (1) FND presents neurologically, and thus, only neurologists can ascertain the etiology of new neurologic deficits appearing on follow-up, and (2) neurologic encounters facilitate acceptance of diagnosis and enhance treatment engagement. Counter arguments include the following: (1) FND is a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition codified psychiatric disorder with largely psychiatric treatments, and (2) neurologists can reassess patients if new neurologic symptoms develop without playing a primary follow-up role. Although more research is needed to clarify optimal approaches, neurologic expertise could be leveraged for diagnostic and coordinating roles if the pool of neurologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists, physical and occupational therapists, and other allied clinicians trained in the interdisciplinary care of FNDs is substantially increased.","['Perez DL', 'Haller AL', 'Espay AJ']",2019,9,2,Neurol Clin Pract,"Perez DL, et al.

30947820,Screening for functional neurological disorders by questionnaire.,"OBJECTIVE: Diagnostic screening for functional neurological disorders (FNDs) continues to pose a challenge. Simple symptom counts fail clearly to discriminate patients with FND but there is increasing recognition of 'positive' features which are useful diagnostically during face-to-face assessments. A self-completed questionnaire evaluating specific features of FNDs would be useful for screening purposes in clinical and research settings.
METHODS: The Edinburgh Neurosymptoms Questionnaire (ENS) is a 30-item survey of presence and nature of: blackouts, weakness, hemisensory syndrome, memory problems, tremor, pain, fatigue, globus, multiple medical problems, and operations constructed via literature review and expert consensus. We conducted a pilot of the ENS on new general neurology clinic attendees at a large regional neuroscience centre. Patients were grouped according to consultant neurologist impression as having symptoms that were 'Not at all', 'Somewhat', 'Largely' or 'Completely' due to a functional disorder.
RESULTS: Blackouts, weakness and memory questions provided reasonable diagnostic utility (AUROC = 0.94, 0.71, 0.74 respectively) in single symptom analysis. All other symptoms lacked discriminating features. A multivariate linear model with all symptoms predicted functional classification with moderate diagnostic utility (AUROC = 0.83), specificity of 0.97, sensitivity of 0.47. Pain and blackout scores provided the most accurate predictor of functional classification.
CONCLUSION: The ENS questionnaire provides some utility in differentiating patients presenting with functional blackouts but failed to provide diagnostic value in other types of FND, highlighting the limitations of this self-report tool.","['Shipston-Sharman O', 'Hoeritzauer I', 'Edwards M', 'Reuber M', 'Carson A', 'Stone J']",2019,119,,J Psychosom Res,"Shipston-Sharman O, et al.

30850473,Corticolimbic fast-tracking: enhanced multimodal integration in functional neurological disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: Some individuals with functional neurological disorder (FND) exhibit motor and affective disturbances, along with limbic hyper-reactivity and enhanced motor-limbic connectivity. Given that the multimodal integration network (insula, dorsal cingulate, temporoparietal junction (TPJ)) is implicated in convergent sensorimotor, affective and interoceptive processing, we hypothesised that patients with FND would exhibit altered motor and amygdalar resting-state propagation to this network. Patient-reported symptom severity and clinical outcome were also hypothesised to map onto multimodal integration areas.
METHODS: Between-group differences in primary motor and amygdalar nuclei (laterobasal, centromedial) were examined using graph-theory stepwise functional connectivity (SFC) in 30 patients with motor FND compared with 30 healthy controls. Within-group analyses correlated functional propagation profiles with symptom severity and prospectively collected 6-month outcomes as measured by the Screening for Somatoform Symptoms Conversion Disorder subscale and Patient Health Questionnaire-15 composite score. Findings were clusterwise corrected for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with FND exhibited increased SFC from motor regions to the bilateral posterior insula, TPJ, middle cingulate cortex and putamen. From the right laterobasal amygdala, the FND cohort showed enhanced connectivity to the left anterior insula, periaqueductal grey and hypothalamus among other areas. In within-group analyses, symptom severity correlated with enhanced SFC from the left anterior insula to the right anterior insula and TPJ; increased SFC from the left centromedial amygdala to the right anterior insula correlated with clinical improvement. Within-group associations held controlling for depression, anxiety and antidepressant use.

30773149,Characteristics of patients with motor functional neurological disorder in a large UK mental health service: a case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND), previously known as conversion disorder, is common and often results in substantial distress and disability. Previous research lacks large sample sizes and clinical surveys are most commonly derived from neurological settings, limiting our understanding of the disorder and its associations in other contexts. We sought to address this by analysing a large anonymised electronic psychiatric health record dataset.
METHODS: Data were obtained from 322 patients in the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of motor FND (mFND) (limb weakness or disorders of movement or gait) between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2016. Data were collected on a range of socio-demographic and clinical factors and compared to 644 psychiatric control patients from the same register.
RESULTS: Weakness was the most commonly occurring functional symptom. mFND patients were more likely to be female, British, married, employed pre-morbidly, to have a carer and a physical health condition, but less likely to have had an inpatient psychiatric admission or to receive benefits. No differences in self-reported sexual or physical abuse rates were observed between groups, although mFND patients were more likely to experience life events linked to inter-personal difficulties.
CONCLUSIONS: mFND patients have distinct demographic characteristics compared with psychiatric controls. Experiences of abuse appear to be equally prevalent across psychiatric patient groups. This study establishes the socio-demographic and life experience profile of this understudied patient group and may be used to guide future therapeutic interventions designed specifically for mFND.","[""O'Connell N"", 'Nicholson TR', 'Wessely S', 'David AS']",2020,50,3,Psychol Med,"O'Connell N, et al.

30743296,Functional (Psychogenic) Neurological Disorders: Assessment and Acute Management in the Emergency Department.,"Functional neurological disorders (FND) are complex and prevalent neuropsychiatric conditions. Importantly, some patients with FND develop acute onset symptoms requiring emergency department (ED) evaluations. Historically, FND was a ""rule-out"" diagnosis, making assessment and management in the ED difficult. While the rapid triage of potential neurological emergencies remains the initial task, advancements have altered the approach to FND. FND is now a ""rule-in"" diagnosis based on validated neurological examination signs and semiological features. In this perspective article, we review signs and semiological features that can help guide the initial assessment of FND in the acute setting. Thereafter, we outline potential approaches to introduce a suspected diagnosis of FND to patients in the ED, while emphasizing the need for a comprehensive neurological evaluation. Physical and occupational therapy may be useful adjunct assessments in some individuals. Notably, clinicians in the ED setting are important members of the interdisciplinary approach to FND.","['Anderson JR', 'Nakhate V', 'Stephen CD', 'Perez DL']",2019,39,1,Semin Neurol,"Anderson JR, et al.

30714935,Understanding Patients' Behavior: Vision-Based Analysis of Seizure Disorders.,"A substantial proportion of patients with functional neurological disorders (FND) are being incorrectly diagnosed with epilepsy because their semiology resembles that of epileptic seizures (ES). Misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary treatment and its associated complications. Diagnostic errors often result from an overreliance on specific clinical features. Furthermore, the lack of electrophysiological changes in patients with FND can also be seen in some forms of epilepsy, making diagnosis extremely challenging. Therefore, understanding semiology is an essential step for differentiating between ES and FND. Existing sensor-based and marker-based systems require physical contact with the body and are vulnerable to clinical situations such as patient positions, illumination changes, and motion discontinuities. Computer vision and deep learning are advancing to overcome these limitations encountered in the assessment of diseases and patient monitoring; however, they have not been investigated for seizure disorder scenarios. Here, we propose and compare two marker-free deep learning models, a landmark-based and a region-based model, both of which are capable of distinguishing between seizures from video recordings. We quantify semiology by using either a fusion of reference points and flow fields, or through the complete analysis of the body. Average leave-one-subject-out cross-validation accuracies for the landmark-based and region-based approaches of 68.1% and 79.6% in our dataset collected from 35 patients, reveal the benefit of video analytics to support automated identification of semiology in the challenging conditions of a hospital setting.","['Ahmedt-Aristizabal D', 'Denman S', 'Nguyen K', 'Sridharan S', 'Dionisio S', 'Fookes C']",2019,23,6,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,"Ahmedt-Aristizabal D, et al.

30592118,"Speech, language and swallowing impairments in functional neurological disorder: a scoping review.","BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is common across healthcare settings. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders states that speech and swallowing symptoms can be present in FND. Despite this, there is a dearth of guidelines for speech and language therapists (SLTs) for this client group.
AIMS: To address the following question in order to identify gaps for further research: What is known about speech, language and swallowing symptoms in patients with FND?
METHODS & PROCEDURES: A scoping review was conducted. Six healthcare databases were searched for relevant literature: CINAHL PLUS, MEDLINE, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Professionals, Science Citation Index, Scopus, and PsychINFO. The following symptoms were excluded from the review: dysphonia, globus pharyngeus, dysfluency, foreign accent syndrome and oesophageal dysphagia.
MAIN CONTRIBUTION: A total of 63 papers were included in the final review; they ranged in date from 1953 to 2018. Case studies were the most frequent research method (n = 23, 37%). 'Psychogenic' was the term used most frequently (n = 24, 38%), followed by 'functional' (n = 21, 33%). Speech symptoms were reported most frequently (n = 41, 65%), followed by language impairments (n = 35, 56%) and dysphagia (n = 13, 21%). Only 11 publications comment on the involvement of SLTs. Eight papers report direct speech and language therapy input; however, none studied the effectiveness of speech and language therapy.
CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Speech, language and swallowing symptoms do occur in patients with FND, yet it is a highly under-researched area. Further research is required to create a set of positive diagnostic criteria, gather accurate data on numbers of patients with FND and speech, language or swallowing symptoms, and to evaluate the effectiveness of direct speech and language therapy involvement.","['Barnett C', 'Armes J', 'Smith C']",2019,54,3,Int J Lang Commun Disord,"Barnett C, et al.

30455406,"Emotional processing in functional neurological disorder: a review, biopsychosocial model and research agenda.","Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common and highly disabling disorder, but its aetiology remains enigmatic. Conceptually, there has been reduced emphasis on the role of psychosocial stressors in recent years, with a corresponding increase in neurobiological explanations. However, a wealth of evidence supports the role of psychosocial adversities (eg, stressful life events, interpersonal difficulties) as important risk factors for FND. Therefore, there is a need to integrate psychosocial (environmental) and neurobiological factors (eg, sensorimotor and cognitive functions) in contemporary models of FND. Altered emotional processing may represent a key link between psychosocial risk factors and core features of FND. Here, we summarise and critically appraise experimental studies of emotional processing in FND using behavioural, psychophysiological and/or neuroimaging measures in conjunction with affective processing tasks. We propose that enhanced preconscious (implicit) processing of emotionally salient stimuli, associated with elevated limbic reactivity (eg, amygdala), may contribute to the initiation of basic affective/defensive responses via hypothalamic and brainstem pathways (eg, periaqueductal grey). In parallel, affect-related brain areas may simultaneously exert a disruptive influence on neurocircuits involved in voluntary motor control, awareness and emotional regulation (eg, sensorimotor, salience, central executive networks). Limbic-paralimbic disturbances in patients with FND may represent one of several neurobiological adaptations linked to early, severe and/or prolonged psychosocial adversity. This perspective integrates neurobiological and psychosocial factors in FND and proposes a research agenda, highlighting the need for replication of existing findings, multimodal sampling across emotional response domains and further examination of emotional influences on sensorimotor and cognitive functions in FND populations.","['Pick S', 'Goldstein LH', 'Perez DL', 'Nicholson TR']",2019,90,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Pick S, et al.

30409887,Stress and functional neurological disorders: mechanistic insights.,"At the interface between mind and body, psychiatry and neurology, functional neurological disorder (FND) remains poorly understood. Formerly dominant stress-related aetiological models have been increasingly challenged, in part due to cases without any history of past or recent trauma. In this perspective article, we review current evidence for such models, and how research into the role of traumatic stress in other disorders and the neurobiology of the stress response can inform our mechanistic understanding of FND. First, we discuss the association between stress and the onset or exacerbation of a variety of physical and mental health problems. Second, we review the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in the neurobiology of ill-health, alongside evidence for similar mechanisms in FND. Third, we advocate a stress-diathesis model, in which biological susceptibility interacts with early life adversity, where FND can be precipitated by traumatic events later in life and maintained by psychological responses. We hypothesise that greater biological susceptibility to FND is associated with less severe remote and recent stress, and that FND precipitated by more severe stress is associated with lower biological vulnerability. This would explain clinical experience of variable exposure to historical and recent traumatic stress among people with FND and requires empirical investigation. A testable, evidence-based stress-diathesis model can inform nuanced understanding of how biological and psychological factors interact at the individual level, with potential to inform personalised treatment pathways. Much-needed research to establish the aetiology of FND will enhance clinical care and communication, facilitate effective treatment and inform prevention strategies.","['Keynejad RC', 'Frodl T', 'Kanaan R', 'Pariante C', 'Reuber M', 'Nicholson TR']",2019,90,7,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Keynejad RC, et al.

There is limited research investigating connections between attachment styles, other predisposing vulnerabilities, and symptom severity in patients with motor FND. By using a within-group design with prospective data collection, the authors performed univariate tests followed by multivariate linear regressions to investigate neuropsychiatric factors associated with four attachment styles (secure, fearful, preoccupied, and dismissing) among 56 patients with motor FND (mean age=40.2 years [SD=13.0]; women, N=41; men, N=15). In univariate analyses, fearful attachment style was associated with self-reported adverse life event burden, alexithymia, dissociation, depression, anxiety, impaired stress coping skills, functional neurologic symptom severity, and marital status. In a multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis, childhood abuse, alexithymia, depression, and not being married independently predicted fearful attachment. In a post hoc analysis, childhood sexual and emotional abuse were each independently associated with fearful attachment tendencies. There were no independent predictors of secure, preoccupied, or dismissing attachment styles in this study population.

However, understanding of the nature, frequency and treatment of FND has changed dramatically in the last 10-15 years. FND is no longer assumed to be only the result of 'conversion' of psychological conflict but is understood as a complex interplay between physiological stimulus, expectation, learning and attention mediated through a Bayesian framework, with biopsychosocial predisposing, triggering and perpetuating inputs. Building on this new 'whole brain' perspective of FND, we reframe the debate about the 'psychological versus physical' basis of CRPS. We recognise how CRPS research may inform mechanistic understanding of FND and conversely, how advances in FND, especially treatment, have implications for improving understanding and management of CRPS.","['Popkirov S', 'Hoeritzauer I', 'Colvin L', 'Carson AJ', 'Stone J']",2019,90,5,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Popkirov S, et al.

We found evidence for autonomic dysregulation in FND; convergent neuroimaging findings implicate abnormal limbic-motor interactions in response to emotional stimuli in FND. Our results do not provide enough empirical evidence for social modulation of the symptoms, but there is a clinical support for the role of suggestion and placebo in FND. Our results provide evidence for abnormal bodily awareness in FND. Based on these findings, we propose that functional neurological symptoms are forms of emotional reactions shaped into symptoms by previous experience with illness and possibly reinforced by actual social contexts. Additional research should investigate the effect of social context on the intensity of functional neurological symptoms and associated brain regions.","['Sojka P', 'Bareš M', 'Kašpárek T', 'Světlák M']",2018,9,,Front Psychiatry,"Sojka P, et al.

30342702,Secure Attachment and Depression Predict 6-Month Outcome in Motor Functional Neurological Disorders: A Prospective Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND: The relationships between baseline neuropsychiatric factors and clinical outcome in patients with functional neurological disorder (FND)/conversion disorder remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: This prospective, naturalistic pilot study investigated links between predisposing vulnerabilities (risk factors) and clinical outcome in patients with motor FND engaged in usual care within a subspecialty FND clinic.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients with motor FND were enrolled and completed baseline and 6-month follow-up psychometric questionnaires. Univariate screening tests followed by multivariate linear regression analyses were used to investigate neuropsychiatric predictors of 6-month clinical outcome in patients with motor FND.
RESULTS: In univariate analyses, baseline secure attachment traits and depression as measured by the Relationship Scales Questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory-II positively correlated with improved Patient Health Questionnaire-15 scores. In a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusting for the interval time between baseline and follow-up data collection, baseline secure attachment and depression scores independently predicted improvements in Patient Health Questionnaire-15 scores. In additional analyses, patients with a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures compared to individuals with other motor FND subtypes showed a trend toward worse 6-month physical health outcomes as measured by the Short Form Health Survey-36.
CONCLUSION: Future large-scale, multi-site longitudinal studies are needed to comprehensively investigate neuropsychiatric predictors of clinical outcome in patients with motor FND, including functional weakness, functional movement disorders, and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.","['Jalilianhasanpour R', 'Ospina JP', 'Williams B', 'Mello J', 'MacLean J', 'Ranford J', 'Fricchione GL', 'LaFrance WC', 'Perez DL']",2019,60,4,Psychosomatics,"Jalilianhasanpour R, et al.

30287439,Functional neurological disorders: acute presentations and management.,"Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common and associated with significant morbidity and healthcare costs. Patients with FND often present acutely, particularly with dissociative seizures (resembling epilepsy) or persistent weakness resembling a stroke. History and careful observation and examination are critical to diagnosis, as investigations will often be normal or non-contributory. The nature of convulsive movements in dissociative seizures often differs from that in epilepsy, and long duration of individual events, waxing and waning, closed eyes and high reported frequency in an apparently well individual are all suggestive. In those with stroke-like episodes, demonstration of normal power even briefly (eg Hoover's sign, 'give way' weakness) together with distractability are positive physical features indicating a functional disorder. A positive diagnosis and clear non-judgemental explanation, backed up by reliable information sources associated with prompt onward referral to a neurologist can greatly reduce distress and ultimately improve outcomes.","['Cock HR', 'Edwards MJ']",2018,18,5,Clin Med (Lond),Cock HR and Edwards MJ.

30143887,Blood CRP levels are elevated in children and adolescents with functional neurological symptom disorder.,"There is accumulating evidence that patients with functional neurological symptom disorder (FND) show activation of multiple components of the stress system-the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and brain regions involved in arousal- and emotion-processing. This study aims to examine whether the immune-inflammatory component of the stress system is also activated. C-reactive protein (CRP) blood titre levels were measured in 79 children and adolescents with FND. CRP values ≥ 2 mg/L suggest low-grade inflammation. CRP values > 10 mg/L suggest a disease process. Sixty-six percent of subjects (n = 52) had CRP titres ≥ 2 mg/L. The upward shift in the distribution of CRP levels suggested low-grade inflammation (median CRP concentration was 4.60 mg/L, with 75th and 90th percentiles of 6.1 and 10.3 mg/L, respectively).

29876262,"""Motoring in idle"": The default mode and somatomotor networks are overactive in children and adolescents with functional neurological symptoms.","OBJECTIVE: Children and adolescents with functional neurological symptom disorder (FND) present with diverse neurological symptoms not explained by a disease process. Functional neurological symptoms have been conceptualized as somatoform dissociation, a disruption of the brain's intrinsic organization and reversion to a more primitive level of function. We used EEG to investigate neural function and functional brain organization in children/adolescents with FND.
METHOD: EEG was recorded in the resting eyes-open condition in 57 patients (aged 8.5-18 years) and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Using a topographical map, EEG power data were quantified for regions of interest that define the default mode network (DMN), salience network, and somatomotor network. Source localization was examined using low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). The contributions of chronic pain and arousal as moderators of differences in EEG power were also examined.
RESULTS: Children/adolescents with FND had excessive theta and delta power in electrode clusters corresponding to the DMN-both anteriorly (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex [dmFPC]) and posteriorly (posterior cingulate cortex [PCC], precuneus, and lateral parietal cortex)-and in the premotor/supplementary motor area (SMA) region. There was a trend toward increased theta and delta power in the salience network. LORETA showed activation across all three networks in all power bands and localized neural sources to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/dmPFC, mid cingulate cortex, PCC/precuneus, and SMA. Pain and arousal contributed to slow wave power increases in all three networks.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that children and adolescents with FND are characterized by overactivation of intrinsic resting brain networks involved in threat detection, energy regulation, and preparation for action.","['Kozlowska K', 'Spooner CJ', 'Palmer DM', 'Harris A', 'Korgaonkar MS', 'Scher S', 'Williams LM']",2018,18,,Neuroimage Clin,"Kozlowska K, et al.

29868890,Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders.,"IMPORTANCE: Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes.
OBSERVATIONS: Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.","['Espay AJ', 'Aybek S', 'Carson A', 'Edwards MJ', 'Goldstein LH', 'Hallett M', 'LaFaver K', 'LaFrance WC', 'Lang AE', 'Nicholson T', 'Nielsen G', 'Reuber M', 'Voon V', 'Stone J', 'Morgante F']",2018,75,9,JAMA Neurol,"Espay AJ, et al.

RESULTS: All patients showed dominance of an early developmental prototype (P0) characterized by flexed postures resembling the infant held by his caregivers and relative paucity of a more developed prototype (P1) characterized by erect position typical for a face to face interaction.

While neurologists may be more comfortable diagnosing patients with FND, there is only limited guidance as to how to conduct follow-up outpatient visits. Using clinical vignettes, we provide practical suggestions that may help guide clinical encounters including how to: (1) explore illness beliefs openly; (2) enquire longitudinally about predisposing vulnerabilities, acute precipitants and perpetuating factors that may be further elucidated over time; (3) facilitate psychotherapy engagement by actively listening for potentially unhelpful or maladaptive patterns of thoughts, behaviours, fears or psychosocial stressors that can be reflected back to the patient and (4) enquire about the fidelity of individual treatments and educate other providers who may be less familiar with FND. These suggestions, while important to individualise, provide a blueprint for follow-up FND clinical care.","['Adams C', 'Anderson J', 'Madva EN', 'LaFrance WC', 'Perez DL']",2018,18,4,Pract Neurol,"Adams C, et al.

29735513,"A unifying theory for cognitive abnormalities in functional neurological disorders, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Functional cognitive disorder (FCD) describes cognitive dysfunction in the absence of an organic cause. It is increasingly prevalent in healthcare settings yet its key neuropsychological features have not been reported in large patient cohorts. We hypothesised that cognitive profiles in fibromyalgia (FM), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorders (FNDs) would provide a template for characterising FCD.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies with cognition-related outcomes in FM, CFS and FND.
RESULTS: We selected 52 studies on FM, 95 on CFS and 39 on FND. We found a general discordance between high rates of subjective cognitive symptoms, including forgetfulness, distractibility and word-finding difficulties, and inconsistent objective neuropsychological deficits. Objective deficits were reported, including poor selective and divided attention, slow information processing and vulnerability to distraction. In some studies, cognitive performance was inversely correlated with pain, exertion and fatigue. Performance validity testing demonstrated poor effort in only a minority of subjects, and patients with CFS showed a heightened perception of effort.
DISCUSSION: The cognitive profiles of FM, CFS and non-cognitive FND are similar to the proposed features of FCD, suggesting common mechanistic underpinnings. Similar findings have been reported in patients with mild traumatic brain injury and whiplash. We hypothesise that pain, fatigue and excessive interoceptive monitoring produce a decrease in externally directed attention. This increases susceptibility to distraction and slows information processing, interfering with cognitive function, in particular multitasking. Routine cognitive processes are experienced as unduly effortful. This may reflect a switch from an automatic to a less efficient controlled or explicit cognitive mode, a mechanism that has also been proposed for impaired motor control in FND. These experiences might then be overinterpreted due to memory perfectionism and heightened self-monitoring of cognitive performance.","['Teodoro T', 'Edwards MJ', 'Isaacs JD']",2018,89,12,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Teodoro T, et al.

29702433,Individual differences in corticolimbic structural profiles linked to insecure attachment and coping styles in motor functional neurological disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Insecure attachment and maladaptive coping are important predisposing vulnerabilities for Functional Neurological Disorders (FND)/Conversion Disorder, yet no prior structural neuroimaging studies have investigated biomarkers associated with these risk factors in FND populations. This magnetic resonance imaging study examined cortical thickness and subcortical volumes associated with self-reported attachment and coping styles in patients with FND. We hypothesized that insecure attachment and maladaptive coping would relate to limbic-paralimbic structural alterations.
METHODS: FreeSurfer cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric analyses were performed in 26 patients with motor FND (21 women; 5 men) and 27 healthy controls (22 women; 5 men). For between-group comparisons, patients with FND were stratified by Relationship Scales Questionnaire, Ways of Coping Scale-Revised, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale scores. Within-group analyses were also performed in patients with FND. All analyses were performed in the complete cohort and separately in women only to evaluate for gender-specific effects. Cortical thickness analyses were whole-brain corrected at the cluster-wise level; subcortical analyses were Bonferroni corrected.
RESULTS: In women with FND, dismissing attachment correlated with reduced left parahippocampal cortical thickness. Confrontive coping was associated with reduced right hippocampal volume, while accepting responsibility positively correlated with right precentral gyrus cortical thickness. These findings held adjusting for anti-depressant use. All FND-related findings were within the normal range when compared to healthy women.
CONCLUSION: These observations connect individual-differences in limbic-paralimbic and premotor structures to attachment and coping styles in FND. The relationship between parahippocampal thickness and dismissing attachment may indicate aberrant social-emotional and contextual appraisal in women with FND.","['Williams B', 'Jalilianhasanpour R', 'Matin N', 'Fricchione GL', 'Sepulcre J', 'Keshavan MS', 'LaFrance WC', 'Dickerson BC', 'Perez DL']",2018,102,,J Psychiatr Res,"Williams B, et al.

29628294,The Inpatient Assessment and Management of Motor Functional Neurological Disorders: An Interdisciplinary Perspective.,"BACKGROUND: Motor functional neurologic disorders (FND)-previously termed ""hysteria"" and later ""conversion disorder""-are exceedingly common and frequently encountered in the acute hospital setting. Despite their high prevalence, patients with motor FND can be challenging to diagnose accurately and manage effectively. To date, there is limited guidance on the inpatient approach to the neuropsychiatric evaluation of patients with functional (psychogenic) neurologic symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: The authors outline an inpatient multidisciplinary approach, involving neurology, psychiatry, and physical therapy, for the assessment and acute inpatient management of motor FND.
METHODS: A vignette of a patient with motor FND is presented followed by a discussion of general assessment principles. Thereafter, a detailed description of the neurologic and psychiatric assessments is outlined. Delivery of a ""rule-in"" diagnosis is emphasized and specific guidance for what can be accomplished postdiagnosis in the hospital is suggested.
DISCUSSION: We encourage an interdisciplinary approach beginning at the early stages of the diagnostic assessment once an individual is suspected of having motor FND.
CONCLUSIONS: Practical suggestions for the inpatient assessment of motor FND are presented. It is also important to individualize the diagnostic assessment. Future research should be conducted to test best practices for motor FND management in the acute inpatient hospital setting.","['McKee K', 'Glass S', 'Adams C', 'Stephen CD', 'King F', 'Parlman K', 'Perez DL', 'Kontos N']",2018,59,4,Psychosomatics,"McKee K, et al.

29588989,Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures among patients with functional neurological disorder: A case series from a Tanzanian referral hospital and literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are likely as common in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as in the rest of the world, but there is a dearth of literature on the epidemiology and clinical presentation of these disorders in Africa. The purpose of this paper is to describe a case series of FNDs presenting to a referral hospital in SSA. In addition, we review the existing literature on FNDs in Africa.
METHODS: A hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence, epidemiology, and clinical phenotype of FNDs and PNES in a referral hospital in Northern Tanzania over a 6-year period (2007-2013).
RESULTS: Of 2,040 patients presenting with neurological complaints, 44 (2.2%) were diagnosed with FNDs. Half (n = 22) had the clinical presentation of PNES. Age of presentation for FNDs and PNES peaked in the teen years 12-19 (n = 21 48%; and n = 14, 63%, respectively), and the majority were female (n = 30, 68%; and n = 14, 63%, respectively). The majority presented acutely with short-lived and self-limiting symptoms (only 2 recurrent cases). Literature review revealed multiple reports of ""mass hysteria"" in SSA often meeting the clinical criteria of epidemic FNDs.
SIGNIFICANCE: FNDs and PNES occur in Africa with age and gender distribution comparable to that found elsewhere. Although the percentage of FND cases overall was relatively low (2.2%), it is likely to be an underestimate because not all cases were recorded, and cases may be appropriately managed locally before patients are referred to a hospital. PNES was the most common phenotype of FNDs reported, and the African phenotype may be short-lived and self-limiting rather than chronic and recurrent, as reported elsewhere in the world. PNES presentations may also occur in clusters, which may have cultural significance in Africa. FNDs in Africa appear to be underreported, particularly over the last 30 years.","['Dekker MCJ', 'Urasa SJ', 'Kellogg M', 'Howlett WP']",2018,3,1,Epilepsia Open,"Dekker MCJ, et al.

29549192,Functional neurological disorders in Parkinson disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain demographic and clinical features of Parkinson disease (PD) associated with functional neurological features.
METHODS: A standardised form was used to extract data from electronic records of 53 PD patients with associated functional neurological disorders (PD-FND) across eight movement disorders centres in the USA, Canada and Europe. These subjects were matched for age, gender and disease duration to PD patients without functional features (PD-only). Logistic regression analysis was used to compare both groups after adjusting for clustering effect.
RESULTS: Functional symptoms preceded or co-occurred with PD onset in 34% of cases, nearly always in the most affected body side. Compared with PD-only subjects, PD-FND were predominantly female (68%), had longer delay to PD diagnosis, greater prevalence of dyskinesia (42% vs 18%; P=0.023), worse depression and anxiety (P=0.033 and 0.025, respectively), higher levodopa-equivalent daily dose (972±701 vs 741±559 mg; P=0.029) and lower motor severity (P=0.019). These patients also exhibited greater healthcare resource utilisation, higher use of [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT and were more likely to have had a pre-existing psychiatric disorder (P=0.008) and family history of PD (P=0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: A subtype of PD with functional neurological features is familial in one-fourth of cases and associated with more psychiatric than motor disability and greater use of diagnostic and healthcare resources than those without functional features.

This prospective case-control study investigated self-reported resilience in patients with FND compared to controls and examined relationships between resilience and affective symptoms, personality traits, alexithymia, health status and adverse life event burden.
METHODS: 50 individuals with motor FND and 47 healthy controls participated. A univariate test followed by a logistic regression analysis investigated group-level differences in Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) scores. For within-group analyses performed separately in patients with FND and controls, univariate screening tests followed by multivariate linear regression analyses examined factors associated with self-reported resilience.
RESULTS: Adjusting for age, gender, education status, ethnicity and lifetime adverse event burden, patients with FND reported reduced resilience compared to controls. Within-group analyses in patients with FND showed that individual-differences in mental health, extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness positively correlated with CD-RISC scores; post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity, depression, anxiety, alexithymia and neuroticism scores negatively correlated with CD-RISC scores. Extraversion independently predicted resilience scores in patients with FND. In control subjects, univariate associations were appreciated between CD-RISC scores and gender, personality traits, anxiety, alexithymia and physical health; conscientiousness independently predicted resilience in controls.
CONCLUSION: Patients with FND reported reduced resilience, and CD-RISC scores covaried with other important predisposing vulnerabilities for the development of FND. Future research should investigate if the CD-RISC is predictive of clinical outcomes in patients with FND.","['Jalilianhasanpour R', 'Williams B', 'Gilman I', 'Burke MJ', 'Glass S', 'Fricchione GL', 'Keshavan MS', 'LaFrance WC', 'Perez DL']",2018,107,,J Psychosom Res,"Jalilianhasanpour R, et al.

29406995,Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder): A role for microglial-based plasticity mechanisms?,"Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FND) is a relatively common neurological condition, accounting for approximately 3-6% of neurologist referrals. FND is considered a transient disorder of neuronal function, sometimes linked to physical trauma and psychological stress. Despite this, chronic disability is common, for example, around 40% of adults with motor FND have permanent disability. Building on current theoretical models, this paper proposes that microglial dysfunction could perpetuate functional changes within acute motor FND, thus providing a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the chronic stage of the motor FND phenotypes seen clinically. Core to our argument is microglia's dual role in modulating neuroimmunity and their control of synaptic plasticity, which places them at a pathophysiological nexus wherein coincident physical trauma and psychological stress could cause long-term change in neuronal networks without producing macroscopic structural abnormality. This model proposes a range of hypotheses that are testable with current technologies.","['Stephenson CP', 'Baguley IJ']",2018,111,,Med Hypotheses,Stephenson CP and Baguley IJ.

29363837,A case series of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for reducing symptom interference in functional neurological disorders.,"There is limited high-quality evidence supporting psychological treatments for functional neurological disorders (FNDs), and what evidence exists suggests that the impact of such treatments could be improved. One way to increase effectiveness is to utilize approaches that can have impact across heterogeneous FND presentations. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) targets a transdiagnostic process called psychological flexibility and is used effectively to integrate multidisciplinary treatments in other clinical contexts. Here, we present a consecutive case series (N = 8) of a relatively brief (6 to 10 sessions) ACT intervention, delivered face to face by a clinical psychologist in an outpatient neuropsychology service. Treatment aimed to reduce symptom interference and improve mood via improvements in psychological flexibility. Service users presented with a range of FND symptoms (e.g., syncope, limb paralysis, and paraesthesia). Following treatment, 5 participants showed reliable improvements in symptom interference (Work and Social Adjustment Scale), 2 to the extent of clinical significance; 4 had reliable improvements in mood (Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-10), and 2 within the range of clinical significance. There were no reliable deteriorations in symptom interference or mood. Marked variation was apparent on the measure of psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II), with 4 reliable improvements, 3 within the range of clinical significance, and also 2 reliable deteriorations. These promising results suggest that further investigation of an ACT approach to FND is warranted. Future studies should include measures of psychological flexibility with greater comprehensibility.","['Graham CD', ""O'Hara DJ"", 'Kemp S']",2018,25,3,Clin Psychol Psychother,"Graham CD, et al.

Of 81 patients who returned for follow-up, a history of chronic pain disorder inversely correlated with improvement.

29080235,Cortical thickness alterations linked to somatoform and psychological dissociation in functional neurological disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Links between dissociation and functional neurological disorder (FND)/conversion disorder are well-established, yet the pathophysiology of dissociation remains poorly understood. This MRI study investigated structural alterations associated with somatoform and psychological dissociation in FND. We hypothesized that multimodal, paralimbic cingulo-insular regions would relate to the severity of somatoform dissociation in patients with FND.
METHODS: FreeSurfer cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric analyses were performed in 26 patients with motor FND and 27 matched healthy controls. Patients with high dissociation as measured by the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire-20 (SDQ) or Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) were compared to controls in stratified analyses. Within-group analyses were also performed with SDQ and DES scores in patients with FND. All cortical thickness analyses were whole-brain corrected at the cluster-wise level.
RESULTS: Patients with FND and high somatoform dissociation (SDQ > 35) showed reduced left caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) cortical thickness compared to controls. In within-group analyses, SDQ scores inversely correlated with left caudal ACC cortical thickness in patients with FND. Depersonalization/derealization scores positively correlated with right lateral occipital cortical thickness. Both within-group findings remained statistically significant controlling for trait anxiety/depression, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, adverse life events, and motor FND subtypes in post-hoc analyses.
CONCLUSION: Using complementary between-group and within-group analyses, an inverse association between somatoform dissociation and left caudal ACC cortical thickness was observed in patients with FND. A positive relationship was also appreciated between depersonalization/derealization severity and cortical thickness in visual association areas.

28863348,Biological and perceived stress in motor functional neurological disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Current models explaining motor functional neurological disorders (FND) integrate both the neurobiological mechanisms underlying symptoms production and the role of psychosocial stressors. Imaging studies have suggested abnormal motor control linked to impaired emotional and stress regulation. However, little is known on the biological stress regulation in FND. Our aim was to study the biological and perceived response to stress in patients with motor FND.
METHODS: Sixteen patients with motor FND (DSM-5 criteria) and fifteen healthy controls underwent the Trier Social Stress Test. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) response was evaluated with salivary cortisol and autonomous sympathetic response with salivary alpha-amylase. Area under the curve was computed to reflect background levels (AUCg) and change over time (AUCi). Life adversities and perceived subjective stress on a visual analog scale (VAS) were correlated with biological responses.
RESULTS: FND patients had significantly higher background levels (AUCg) of both stress markers (cortisol and amylase) than controls. The biological response (AUCi) to stress did not differ between groups for both markers but the subjective response showed an interaction effect with patients reporting higher levels of stress than controls. After stress, controls showed a strong correlation between subjective and objective sympathetic values (amylase) but not patients. The number and subjective impact of adverse life events correlated with cortisol AUCg in patients only.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms a baseline HPA-axis and sympathetic hyperarousal state in motor FND related to life adversities. During a social stress, dissociation between perceived stress and biological markers was observed in patients only, reflecting a dysregulation of interoception capacity, which might represent an endophenotype of this disorder.","['Apazoglou K', 'Mazzola V', 'Wegrzyk J', 'Frasca Polara G', 'Aybek S']",2017,85,,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Apazoglou K, et al.

28856091,Disrupted avoidance learning in functional neurological disorder: Implications for harm avoidance theories.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorder (FND) is an elusive disorder characterized by unexplained neurological symptoms alongside aberrant cognitive processing and negative affect, often associated with amygdala reactivity.
METHODS: We examined the effect of negative conditioning on cognitive function and amygdala reactivity in 25 FND patients and 20 healthy volunteers (HV). Participants were first conditioned to stimuli paired with negative affective or neutral (CS +/CS -) information. During functional MRI, subjects then performed an instrumental associative learning task to avoid monetary losses in the context of the previously conditioned stimuli. We expected that FND patients would be better at learning to avoid losses when faced with negatively conditioned stimuli (increased harm avoidance). Multi-echo resting state fMRI was also collected from the same subjects and a robust denoising method was employed, important for removing motion and physiological artifacts.
RESULTS: FND subjects were more sensitive to the negative CS + compared to HV, demonstrated by a reinforcement learning model. Contrary to expectation, FND patients were generally more impaired at learning to avoid losses under both contexts (CS +/CS -), persisting to choose the option that resulted in a negative outcome demonstrated by both behavioural and computational analyses. FND patients showed enhanced amygdala but reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responses when they received negative feedback. Patients also had increased resting state functional connectivity between these two regions.
CONCLUSIONS: FND patients had impaired instrumental avoidance learning, findings that parallel previous observations of impaired action-outcome binding. FND patients further show enhanced behavioural and neural sensitivity to negative information. However, this did not translate to improved avoidance learning. Put together, our findings do not support the theory of harm avoidance in FND. We highlight a potential mechanism by which negative contexts interfere with adaptive behaviours in this under-explored disorder.","['Morris LS', 'To B', 'Baek K', 'Chang-Webb YC', 'Mitchell S', 'Strelchuk D', 'Mikheenko Y', 'Phillips W', 'Zandi M', 'Jenaway A', 'Walsh C', 'Voon V']",2017,16,,Neuroimage Clin,"Morris LS, et al.

28844071,Corticolimbic structural alterations linked to health status and trait anxiety in functional neurological disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: Affective symptoms influence health status (health-related quality of life) in functional neurological disorder (FND), and the salience network is implicated in the pathophysiology of FND and mood/anxiety disorders. We hypothesised that self-reported health status and affective symptoms would map onto salience network regions and that patients with FND would show decreased insular volumes compared with controls.
METHODS: This voxel-based morphometry study investigated volumetric differences in 26 patients with FND (21 women, 5 men; mean age=40.3±11.5) compared with 27 healthy controls (22 women, 5 men; mean age=40.5±10.8). Post hoc analyses stratified patients with FND by mental and physical health scores (Short Form Health Survey-36). Within-group analyses investigated associations with mental health, physical health, trait anxiety and depression in patients with FND.
RESULTS: There were no volumetric differences between the complete FND cohort and controls. In stratified analyses, however, patients with FND reporting the most severe physical health impairments showed reduced left anterior insular volume compared with controls. In within-group analyses, impaired mental health and elevated trait anxiety were associated with increased right amygdalar volumes in patients with FND. The relationship between amygdalar volume and mental health, driven by emotional well-being deficits and role limitations due to emotional problems, was independent of sensorimotor functional neurological symptom severity and motor FND subtype. In secondary within-group analyses, increased periaqueductal grey volume was associated with role limitations due to emotional problems. Impaired physical functioning correlated with decreased left anterior insular volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support roles for several regions of the salience network in the pathophysiology of FND.","['Perez DL', 'Williams B', 'Matin N', 'LaFrance WC', 'Costumero-Ramos V', 'Fricchione GL', 'Sepulcre J', 'Keshavan MS', 'Dickerson BC']",2017,88,12,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Perez DL, et al.

Disturbed sleep appears to be part of the FND context; however, the clinical importance of sleep disturbance (extent, characteristics and impact) remains largely unknown. We described sleep quality in two samples, and investigated the relationship between sleep and FND-related functional impairment.
METHODS: We included a sample recruited online via patient charities (N=205) and a consecutive clinical sample (N=20). Participants completed validated measures of sleep quality and sleep characteristics (e.g. total sleep time, sleep efficiency), mood, and FND-related functional impairment.
RESULTS: Poor sleep was common in both samples (89% in the clinical range), which was characterised by low sleep efficiency (M=65.40%) and low total sleep time (M=6.05h). In regression analysis, sleep quality was negatively associated with FND-related functional impairment, accounting for 16% of the variance and remaining significant after the introduction of mood variables.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary analyses suggest that subjective sleep disturbance (low efficiency, short sleep) is common in FND. Sleep quality was negatively associated with the functional impairment attributed to FND, independent of depression. Therefore, sleep disturbance may be a clinically important feature of FND.","['Graham CD', 'Kyle SD']",2017,378,,J Neurol Sci,"Graham CD and Kyle SD.

28416565,"Cingulo-insular structural alterations associated with psychogenic symptoms, childhood abuse and PTSD in functional neurological disorders.","OBJECTIVE: Adverse early-life events are predisposing factors for functional neurological disorder (FND) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cingulo-insular regions are implicated in the biology of both conditions and are sites of stress-mediated neuroplasticity. We hypothesised that functional neurological symptoms and the magnitude of childhood abuse would be associated with overlapping anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insular volumetric reductions, and that FND and PTSD symptoms would map onto distinct cingulo-insular areas.
METHODS: This within-group voxel-based morphometry study probes volumetric associations with self-report measures of functional neurological symptoms, adverse life events and PTSD symptoms in 23 mixed-gender FND patients. Separate secondary analyses were also performed in the subset of 18 women with FND to account for gender-specific effects.
RESULTS: Across the entire cohort, there were no statistically significant volumetric associations with self-report measures of functional neurological symptom severity or childhood abuse. In women with FND, however, parallel inverse associations were observed between left anterior insular volume and functional neurological symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and the Screening for Somatoform Symptoms Conversion Disorder subscale. Similar inverse relationships were also appreciated between childhood abuse burden and left anterior insular volume. Across all subjects, PTSD symptom severity was inversely associated with dorsal ACC volume, and the magnitude of lifetime adverse events was inversely associated with left hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals distinct cingulo-insular alterations for FND and PTSD symptoms and may advance our understanding of FND. Potential biological convergence between stress-related neuroplasticity, functional neurological symptoms and reduced insular volume was identified.","['Perez DL', 'Matin N', 'Barsky A', 'Costumero-Ramos V', 'Makaretz SJ', 'Young SS', 'Sepulcre J', 'LaFrance WC', 'Keshavan MS', 'Dickerson BC']",2017,88,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Perez DL, et al.

28183377,Impaired awareness of motor intention in functional neurological disorder: implications for voluntary and functional movement.,"BACKGROUND: Functional neurological disorders (FNDs), also known as conversion disorder, are unexplained neurological symptoms unrelated to a neurological cause. The disorder is common, yet poorly understood. The symptoms are experienced as involuntary but have similarities to voluntary processes. Here we studied intention awareness in FND.
METHOD: A total of 26 FND patients and 25 healthy volunteers participated in this functional magnetic resonance study using Libet's clock.
RESULTS: FND is characterized by delayed awareness of the intention to move relative to the movement itself. The reporting of intention was more precise, suggesting that these findings are reliable and unrelated to non-specific attentional deficits. That these findings were more prominent with aberrant positive functional movement symptoms rather than negative symptoms may be relevant to impairments in timing for an inhibitory veto process. Attention towards intention relative to movement was associated with lower right inferior parietal cortex activity in FND, a region early in the processing of intention. During rest, aberrant functional connectivity was observed with the right inferior parietal cortex and other motor intention regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The results converge with observations of low inferior parietal activity comparing involuntary with voluntary movement in FND, emphasizing core deficiencies in intention. Heightened precision of this impaired intention is consistent with Bayesian theories of impaired top-down priors that might influence the sense of involuntariness. A primary impairment in voluntary motor intention at an early processing stage might explain clinical observations of slowed effortful voluntary movement, heightened self-directed attention and underlie functional movements. These findings further suggest novel therapeutic targets.","['Baek K', 'Doñamayor N', 'Morris LS', 'Strelchuk D', 'Mitchell S', 'Mikheenko Y', 'Yeoh SY', 'Phillips W', 'Zandi M', 'Jenaway A', 'Walsh C', 'Voon V']",2017,47,9,Psychol Med,"Baek K, et al.

27842291,Aversive stimuli exacerbate defensive motor behaviour in motor conversion disorder.,"Conversion disorder or functional neurological symptom disorder (FND) can affect the voluntary motor system, without an organic cause. Functional symptoms are thought to be generated unconsciously, arising from underlying psychological stressors. However, attempts to demonstrate a direct relationship between the limbic system and disrupted motor function in FND are lacking. We tested whether negative affect would exacerbate alterations of motor control and corresponding brain activations in individuals with FND. Ten patients and ten healthy controls produced an isometric precision-grip contraction at 10% of maximum force while either viewing visual feedback of their force output, or unpleasant or pleasant emotional images (without feedback). Force magnitude was continuously recorded together with change in brain activity using fMRI. For controls, force output decayed from the target level while viewing pleasant and unpleasant images. Patients however, maintained force at the target level without decay while viewing unpleasant images, indicating a pronounced effect of negative affect on force output in FND. This emotional modulation of force control was associated with different brain activation patterns between groups. Contrasting the unpleasant with the pleasant condition, controls showed increased activity in the inferior frontal cortex and pre-supplementary motor area, whereas patients had greater activity in the cerebellum (vermis), posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus. Engagement of a cerebellar-limbic network in patients is consistent with heightened processing of emotional salience, and supports the role of the cerebellum in freezing responses in the presence of aversive events. These data highlight a possible neural circuit through which psychological stressors elicit defensive behaviour and modulate motor function in FND.","['Blakemore RL', 'Sinanaj I', 'Galli S', 'Aybek S', 'Vuilleumier P']",2016,93,Pt A,Neuropsychologia,"Blakemore RL, et al.

27719879,Imaging studies of functional neurologic disorders.,"Brain imaging techniques provide unprecedented opportunities to study the neural mechanisms underlying functional neurologic disorder (FND, or conversion disorder), which have long remained a mystery and clinical challenge for physicians, as they arise with no apparent underlying organic disease. One of the first questions addressed by imaging studies concerned whether motor conversion deficits (e.g., hysteric paralysis) represent a form of (perhaps unconscious) simulation, a mere absence of voluntary movement, or more specific disturbances in motor control (such as abnormal inhibition). Converging evidence from several studies using different techniques and paradigms has now demonstrated distinctive brain activation patterns associated with functional deficits, unlike those seen in actors simulating similar deficits. Thus, patients with motor FND show consistent hypoactivation of both cortical and subcortical motor pathways, with frequent increases in other brain areas within the limbic system, but no recruitment of prefrontal regions usually associated with voluntary motor inhibition. Other studies point to a dysfunction in sensorimotor integration and agency - related to parietal dysfunction - and abnormal motor planning related to supplementary motor area and prefrontal areas. These findings not only suggest that functional symptoms reflect a genuine brain dysfunction, but also give new insights into how they are produced. However, fewer studies attempted to understand why these symptoms are produced and linked to potential psychologic or emotional risk/triggering factors. Results from such studies point towards abnormal limbic regulation with heightened emotional arousal and amygdalar activity, potentially related to engagement of defense systems and stereotyped motor behaviors, mediated by medial prefrontal cortex and subcortical structures, including the periaqueductal gray area and basal ganglia. In addition, across different symptom domains, several studies reported abnormal recruitment of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region known to regulate emotion appraisal, memory retrieval, and self-reflective representations. The vmPFC might provide important modulatory signals to both cortical and subcortical sensorimotor, visual, and even memory circuits, promoting maladaptive self-protective behaviors based on personal affective appraisals of particular events. A better understanding of such a role of vmPFC in FND may help link how and why these symptoms are produced. Further research is also needed to determine brain activation patterns associated with FND across different types of deficits and different evolution stages (e.g., acute vs. chronic vs. recovered).","['Aybek S', 'Vuilleumier P']",2016,139,,Handb Clin Neurol,Aybek S and Vuilleumier P.

27719877,Transcranial magnetic stimulation and sedation as treatment for functional neurologic disorders.,"Functional neurologic disorder (FND), also known as conversion disorder, is common and often associated with a poor prognosis. It has been relatively neglected by research and as such there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based treatments. Physical and psychologic therapies are the main treatment modalities, over and above reassurance and sensitive explanation of the diagnosis. However there are two other historic treatments that have seen a recent resurgence of interest and use. The first is electric stimulation, which was initially pioneered with direct stimulation of nerves but now used indirectly (and therefore noninvasively) in the form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The second is (therapeutic) sedation, previously known as ""abreaction,"" where it was mostly used in the context of psychologic investigation and treatment, but now increasingly advocated during rehabilitation as a way to therapeutically demonstrate reversibility of symptoms. This chapter introduces the background of these treatment modalities, their evolution into their current applications before critically evaluating their current evidence base and exploring possible mechanisms of action. It also tentatively suggests when they should be considered in current practice and briefly considers their future potential. In summary there is encouraging preliminary evidence to suggest that both TMS and sedation may be effective treatments for FNDs.","['Nicholson TRJ', 'Voon V']",2016,139,,Handb Clin Neurol,Nicholson TRJ and Voon V.

27719871,Physical treatment of functional neurologic disorders.,"Physical interventions are widely considered an important part of treatment of functional neurologic disorders (FNDs). The evidence base for physical interventions has been limited to a collection of case series, but the recent publication of several large cohort studies and a randomized controlled trial have provided stronger evidence to support its use. While the evidence for efficacy appears to be promising, details on how this should be delivered remain limited, perhaps due to the dominance of psychologically focused etiologic models. A move towards understanding how the symptoms of FND are generated on a neurobiologic level has resulted in an expansion of pathophysiologic models providing a clearer rationale for physical treatment. In this context, the motor symptoms of FND can be considered as learnt patterns of movement, driven by attention and belief. Physical treatment aims to retrain movement by redirecting attention and addressing unhelpful illness beliefs and behaviors. The patient's problems should be considered in a broad biopsychosocial framework where symptom-predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors can be addressed within a multidisciplinary environment as a gold standard. Further research is required to refine interventions and create evidence-based treatment guidelines.",['Nielsen G'],2016,139,,Handb Clin Neurol,Nielsen G.

27719870,Explanation as treatment for functional neurologic disorders.,"There is widespread agreement that the way health professionals communicate the diagnosis of functional neurologic disorders (FND) has a central role in treatment, as it does arguably for most conditions. In this chapter we discuss barriers to effective diagnosis, different models of explanation and evidence regarding the importance of effective communication of the diagnosis in FND, especially movement disorders, and dissociative (nonepileptic) seizures. Debates and disagreements about how to go about this task often reflect different theoretic models held by health professionals rather than evidence. More evidence is required to know whether an initial emphasis on one model is more or less effective than another (e.g., a functional model vs. a psychologic model). We conclude, however, that there are a number of generic components to effective explanation shared by most authors on the topic that form the basis of a consensus. These include taking the patient seriously, giving the problem a diagnostic label, explaining the rationale for the diagnosis, some discussion of how the symptoms arise, emphasis on the potential for reversibility (rather than damage), and effective triage and referral for other treatment where appropriate. Although explanation can sometimes be therapeutic on its own, its role is probably more important as a facilitator to other therapy, including self-help, physical treatments, and psychotherapy.","['Stone J', 'Carson A', 'Hallett M']",2016,139,,Handb Clin Neurol,"Stone J, et al.

27719864,Epidemiology.,"The epidemiology of functional neurologic disorders (FND) is complex and has been hampered over the years by a lack of clear definition, with previous definitions struggling with an uneasy mix of both physical and psychologic components. The recent changes in DSM-5 to a definition based on positive identification of physical symptoms which are incongruent and inconsistent with neurologic disease and the lack of need for any associated psychopathology represent a significant step forward in clarifying the disorder. On this basis, FND account for approximately 6% of neurology outpatient contacts and putative community incidence rates of 4-12 per 100 000 per annum. Comorbid neurologic disease occurs in around 10% of cases. The diagnosis is reliable, with revision rates less than 5%. Of note, this revision rate was consistent prior to the widespread utilization of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. FND symptoms are disabling and associated with significant distress. They are more common in women and have a peak incidence between the ages of 35 and 50; however the presentation is common in men and throughout the lifespan. The issues surrounding case definition, ascertainment, misdiagnosis, and risk factors are discussed in detail.","['Carson A', 'Lehn A']",2016,139,,Handb Clin Neurol,Carson A and Lehn A. Epidemiology.

26900733,Functional Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology of Functional Neurological Disorders (Conversion Disorder).,"Much is known regarding the physical characteristics, comorbid symptoms, psychological makeup, and neuropsychological performance of patients with functional neurological disorders (FNDs)/conversion disorders. Gross neurostructural deficits do not account for the patients' deficits or symptoms. This review describes the literature focusing on potential neurobiological (i.e. functional neuroanatomic/neurophysiological) findings among individuals with FND, examining neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies of patients with the various forms of motor and sensory FND. In summary, neural networks and neurophysiologic mechanisms may mediate ""functional"" symptoms, reflecting neurobiological and intrapsychic processes.","['Voon V', 'Cavanna AE', 'Coburn K', 'Sampson S', 'Reeve A', 'LaFrance WC', '(On behalf of the American Neuropsychiatric Association Committee for Research)']",2016,28,3,J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,"Voon V, et al.

25050687,Gamma knife for obsessive compulsive disorder: can it be detrimental?,"Functional neurological disorders (FND) have been a challenge to treat both for neurologists and neurosurgeons. Various ablative as well as non-ablative techniques have been used to treat these disorders. Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is also being practised to treat refractory obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD). The subsequent complications of GKRS reported have been variable, with headache being the most common. We discuss here a rare complication of 'late onset radiation necrosis in bilateral caudate nuclei' in a patient after receiving GKRS three years back. This case highlights the need to be more cautious before administering ablative procedures in patients suffering with functional disorders.","['Tripathi M', 'Mukherjee K', 'Chhabra R', 'Radotra I', 'Singh AP', 'Radotra B']",2014,24,4,Turk Neurosurg,"Tripathi M, et al.
