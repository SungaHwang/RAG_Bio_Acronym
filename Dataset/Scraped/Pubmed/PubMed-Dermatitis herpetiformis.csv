37798283,Autoantibody binding and unique enzyme-substrate intermediate conformation of human transglutaminase 3.,"Transglutaminase 3 (TG3), the autoantigen of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), is a calcium dependent enzyme that targets glutamine residues in polypeptides for either transamidation or deamidation modifications. To become catalytically active TG3 requires proteolytic cleavage between the core domain and two C-terminal β-barrels (C1C2). Here, we report four X-ray crystal structures representing inactive and active conformations of human TG3 in complex with a TG3-specific Fab fragment of a DH patient derived antibody. We demonstrate that cleaved TG3, upon binding of a substrate-mimicking inhibitor, undergoes a large conformational change as a β-sheet in the catalytic core domain moves and C1C2 detaches. The unique enzyme-substrate conformation of TG3 without C1C2 is recognized by DH autoantibodies. The findings support a model where B-cell receptors of TG3-specific B cells bind and internalize TG3-gluten enzyme-substrate complexes thereby facilitating gluten-antigen presentation, T-cell help and autoantibody production.","['Heggelund JE', 'Das S', 'Stamnaes J', 'Iversen R', 'Sollid LM']",2023,14,1,Nat Commun,"Heggelund JE, et al.

37793183,Serum reactivity in dermatitis herpetiformis: an international multicenter study.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare gluten-induced skin disorder characterized predominantly by IgA autoantibodies against endomysium, tissue transglutaminase (TG2/tTG), epidermal transglutaminase (TG3/eTG), and deamidated gliadin. To date, circulating autoantibody reactivity has not been systematically described.
OBJECTIVE: Characterization of serum reactivities in DH.
METHODS: This multicenter international study analyzed sera from 242 DH patients taken at the time of initial diagnosis. DH-specific IgA and IgG serum autoantibodies were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) on monkey esophagus, and by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) based on recombinant TG2/tTG, TG3/eTG, and deamidated gliadin (GAF3X).
RESULTS: IgA indirect IF microscopy on monkey esophagus revealed the highest reactivity (84.3%; specificity 100%) followed by IgA TG2/tTG ELISA (78.5%, 99.0%), IgA TG3/eTG ELISA (72.7%, 95.0%), and IgA GAF3X ELISA (69.0%, 98.5%).
CONCLUSION: Serum IgA and IgG autoantibodies against endomysium, TG2/tTG, TG3/eTG, and deamidated gliadin are highly prevalent in DH. Indirect IF microscopy on monkey esophagus (IgA) provides the highest diagnostic accuracy that can be further enhanced by 3.5% when combined with IgA TG2/tTG ELISA.","['Boch K', 'Heck F', 'Hammers CM', 'Antiga E', 'Caproni M', 'Juhl D', 'Goletz S', 'Horváth ON', 'Huilaja L', ""Khil'chenko S"", 'Sina C', 'Tasanen K', 'Vassileva S', 'Schlumberger W', 'Zillikens D', 'Shahid M', 'Drenovska K', 'Zone JJ', 'Koszorú K', 'Fechner K', 'Dähnrich C', 'König IR', 'Schmidt E']",2023,,,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Boch K, et al.

37790051,Gluten Intolerance and Its Association With Skin Disorders: A Narrative Review.,"Gluten sensitivity is defined as a chronic intolerance to gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. The etiology is thought to be immune-mediated and has a variable dermatologic presentation. Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common forms of gluten intolerance and encompasses a wide range of extra-intestinal pathology, including cutaneous, endocrine, nervous, and hematologic systems. Psoriasis, another long-term inflammatory skin condition, has been linked to significant symptomatic improvement with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Palmoplantar pustulosis (PP), a variant of psoriasis, and aphthous stomatitis, which causes recurrent oral ulcers, have also exhibited beneficial results after the dietary elimination of gluten. In addition to this, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), another immune-mediated skin disorder, is genetically similar to CD and has, therefore, shown tremendous improvement with a GFD. Another highly prevalent long-term skin condition called atopic dermatitis (AD), however, has revealed inconsistent results with gluten elimination and would require further research in the future to yield concrete results. Hereditary angioedema (HA) has shown an association with gluten intolerance in some patients who had symptomatic benefits with a GFD. Similarly, vitiligo and linear IgA bullous dermatosis have also shown some clinical evidence of reversal with a GFD. On the contrary, rosacea enhances the risk of developing CD. This narrative review emphasizes the potential impact of gluten intolerance on different cutaneous conditions and the potential therapeutic effect of a GFD on various symptomatic manifestations. There is a need for additional clinical and observational trials to further expand on the underlying pathophysiology and provide conclusive and comprehensive recommendations for possible dietary interventions.","['Vats V', 'Makineni P', 'Hemaida S', 'Haider A', 'Subramani S', 'Kaur N', 'Butt AN', 'Scott-Emuakpor R', 'Zahir M', 'Mathew M', 'Iqbal J']",2023,15,9,Cureus,"Vats V, et al.

37736457,Exploring Celiac Disease: A Case Analysis of Multi-Systemic Symptoms and Effective Dietary Intervention in a Young Female.,"This study presents the case of a 23-year-old woman diagnosed with celiac disease (CD), a condition triggered by an immune response to gluten, leading to inflammation in the small intestine. The patient manifested typical gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, complemented by extra-intestinal signs such as fatigue and skin rashes. Diagnosis was corroborated through the presence of tTG-IgA antibodies and distinct histological changes in the duodenum. A notable finding was the patient's iron deficiency anemia, directly linked to the duodenal damage caused by CD. Effective management, encompassing a strict gluten-free diet and iron supplementation, resulted in marked improvement in her condition. This case accentuates the significance of early CD detection, especially in patients exhibiting a combination of gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms. Emphasis is placed on the pivotal role of timely diagnosis, adherence to a gluten-free regimen, and sustained monitoring to ensure patient well-being and prevent complications.","['Ahmed M', 'Sunkara V', 'Khan MS', 'Affaf M', 'Anwaar MA']",2023,15,8,Cureus,"Ahmed M, et al.

37703003,Skin-Related Quality of Life During Autoimmune Bullous Disease Course.,"IMPORTANCE: Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are chronic relapsing-remitting conditions with significant morbidity. Skin-related quality of life (SRQL) may vary by AIBD subtype and disease type. Disease severity and flare severity can be difficult to define; SRQL can offer a key insight.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the Skindex-16 score as an SRQL measure in AIBD subtypes during flare and nonflare states and to evaluate Skindex-16 construct validity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1, 2016, to February 1, 2020, among 192 patients at the University of Utah Health autoimmune dermatology clinic with pemphigoid, pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear immunoglobulin A disease. Patients had an encounter-associated diagnosis, Skindex-16 scores, and self-reported flare status. Statistical analysis was performed from March 2022 to June 2023.
EXPOSURE: Autoimmune bullous disease subtype and patient-reported flare status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Skindex-16 domain scores (emotions, symptoms, and functioning; range, 0-100, where 0 indicates no effect on SRQL and 100 maximum effect) and individual item scores were described by disease and flare status. Flare scores were expected to be higher by at least the standard error of measurement (SEm). Convergent validity was assessed using Spearman correlation among Skindex-16 scores, serologic titers, and other patient-reported outcome measures. Floor or ceiling domain scores (<20% of sample scoring either lowest or highest possible domain scores, respectively) were assessed for Skindex-16. Structural validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
RESULTS: The study included 192 patients with 212 visits (median age, 68 years [IQR, 58-76 years]; 123 of 212 women [58.0%]) with Skindex-16 scores (64 in flare state and 148 in nonflare state). Median Skindex-16 domain scores were higher for all disease categories among patients in the flare state compared with those in the nonflare state (pemphigoid [emotions: flare, 52.4 (IQR, 38.1-69.0); nonflare, 7 (IQR, 0-17); symptoms: flare, 37.5 (IQR, 29.2-58.0); nonflare, 13 (IQR, 0-25); functioning: flare, 26.7 (IQR, 10.0-56.7); nonflare, 0 (IQR, 0-3)]; pemphigus [emotions: flare, 54.8 (IQR, 31.0-81.0; nonflare, 0 (IQR, 0-19); symptoms: flare, 58.3 (IQR, 41.7-70.8); nonflare, 4 (IQR, 0-12.5); functioning: flare, 26.7 (IQR, 13.3-83.3); nonflare, 0 (IQR, 0-3.33)]; dermatitis herpetiformis [emotions: flare, 72.6 (IQR, 34.7-90.5); nonflare, 14.3 (IQR, 2.4-26.2); symptoms: flare, 69 (IQR, 31.3-85.4); nonflare, 12.5 (IQR, 0-29.2); functioning: flare, 38.3 (IQR, 5.0-63.2); nonflare, 0 (IQR, 0-13.3)]. This difference exceeded SEm cut points. Cronbach α was greater than 0.80 for all domains and AIBDs. Moderate or low correlations were seen with desmoglein 1 and bullous pemphigoid 180 titers. Moderate correlation existed between Skindex-16 and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression scores (emotions: ρ = 0.40; symptoms: ρ = 0.41; functioning: ρ = 0.48), and strong correlation existed between Skindex-16 and patient-reported disease severity (emotions: ρ = 0.71; symptoms: ρ = 0.73; functioning: ρ = 0.66). Floor domain scores greater than 20% were seen among patients in the nonflare state, but ceiling domain scores were rare (<10% for all domains); CFA model fit was poor.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, SRQL was highly associated with flare of AIBDs. Skin-related quality of life was worse during periods without flare among patients with pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis compared with pemphigus, highlighting residual SRQL morbidity. Skindex-16 showed good construct validity, but the poor CFA model fit needs further research. Clinical measurement of SRQL in AIBDs can add critical disease-severity information.","['Hopkins ZH', 'Jimenez A', 'Taliercio VL', 'Clarke JT', 'Hansen CB', 'Hull CM', 'Rhoads JLW', 'Zone JJ', 'Sahni VN', 'Kean J', 'Secrest AM']",2023,,,JAMA Dermatol,"Hopkins ZH, et al.

37477901,Patient-reported burden of skin disorders in coeliac disease.,"OBJECTIVES: The current knowledge on the associations between coeliac disease and different skin diseases is contradictory and the patient's perspective on the burden of these is lacking. This study aimed to investigate patient-reported frequency, severity and quality of life effects of skin disorders in coeliac disease patients compared to controls and moreover to study the impacts of gluten-free diet on these skin diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study questionnaire designed for the purposes of this study and a validated Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire were posted to 600 adult members of the Finnish Coeliac Society and 1173 matched controls. Responses from 327 coeliac disease patients and 382 non-coeliac controls were compared.
RESULTS: Coeliac disease patients were shown to be at no increased risk of atopic dermatitis, acne, rosacea, psoriasis, alopecia areata, vitiligo or chronic urticaria. The severity of these skin diseases did not differ between study groups, but the risk for at least moderate effects on quality of life caused by dermatological diseases was increased among those with coeliac disease. Positive response from gluten-free diet was most commonly experienced by coeliac disease patients with atopic dermatitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Even though the risk for skin diseases was shown not to be increased among coeliac disease patients, there is still an increased burden related to experienced skin symptoms among these patients, which non-dermatologists treating coeliac disease patients should acknowledge.","['Turjanmaa E', 'Hervonen K', 'Huhtala H', 'Arnala S', 'Reunala T', 'Kaukinen K', 'Salmi T']",2023,,,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Turjanmaa E, et al.

37424036,Separate Gut Plasma Cell Populations Produce Auto-Antibodies against Transglutaminase 2 and Transglutaminase 3 in Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an inflammatory skin disorder often considered as an extra intestinal manifestation of celiac disease (CeD). Hallmarks of CeD and DH are auto-antibodies to transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and transglutaminase 3 (TG3), respectively. DH patients have auto-antibodies reactive with both transglutaminase enzymes. Here it is reported that in DH both gut plasma cells and serum auto-antibodies are specific for either TG2 or TG3 with no TG2-TG3 cross reactivity. By generating monoclonal antibodies from TG3-specific duodenal plasma cells of DH patients, three conformational epitope groups are defined. Both TG2-specific and TG3-specific gut plasma cells have few immunoglobulin (Ig) mutations, and the two transglutaminase-reactive populations show distinct selection of certain heavy and light chain V-genes. Mass spectrometry analysis of TG3-specific serum IgA corroborates preferential usage of IGHV2-5 in combination with IGKV4-1. Collectively, these results demonstrate parallel induction of anti-TG2 and anti-TG3 auto-antibody responses involving separate B-cell populations in DH patients.","['Das S', 'Stamnaes J', 'Kemppainen E', 'Hervonen K', 'Lundin KEA', 'Parmar N', 'Jahnsen FL', 'Jahnsen J', 'Lindfors K', 'Salmi T', 'Iversen R', 'Sollid LM']",2023,10,25,Adv Sci (Weinh),"Das S, et al.

37378421,Risk of vascular diseases in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease: a long-term cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease. Increased cardiovascular morbidity has been reported in coeliac disease, but in DH only little is known about this. In this cohort study with a long-term follow-up, the risk for vascular diseases in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and coeliac disease was assessed.
METHODS: The study consisted of 368 DH and 1072 coeliac disease patients with biopsy-proven diagnosis performed between 1966 and 2000. For each DH and coeliac disease patient three matched reference individuals were obtained from the population register. Data regarding all outpatient and inpatient treatment periods between 1970 and 2015 were reviewed for diagnostic codes of vascular diseases from the Care Register for Health Care. Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the risks for the diseases studied and the HRs were adjusted for diabetes mellitus (aHR).
RESULTS: The median follow-up time of DH and coeliac disease patients was 46 years. The risk for cardiovascular diseases did not differ between DH patients and their references (aHR 1.16, 95% CI 0.91-1.47), but among coeliac disease patients, the risk was increased (aHR 1.36, 95% CI 1.16-1.59). The risk for cerebrovascular diseases was found to be decreased in DH patients when compared with references (aHR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.99) and increased in coeliac disease patients (aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07-1.66). The risk for venous thrombosis was increased in coeliac disease patients (aHR 1.62, 95% CI 1.22-2.16) but not in DH.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk for vascular complications appears to differ between DH and coeliac disease. In DH the risk for cerebrovascular diseases seems to be decreased, while in coeliac disease an elevated risk for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases was observed. These differing vascular risk profiles between the two manifestations of the same disease merit further investigation.","['Nilsson N', 'Leivo J', 'Collin P', 'Koskinen I', 'Kaukinen K', 'Huhtala H', 'Palmio J', 'Reunala T', 'Hervonen K', 'Salmi T', 'Pasternack C']",2023,55,1,Ann Med,"Nilsson N, et al.

37265490,Skin gluten-related disorders: new and old cutaneous manifestations to be considered.,"The term gluten-related disorders (GRD) refer to a spectrum of different clinical manifestations triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, including coeliac disease (CD), wheat allergy and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). GRD are characterized by a large variety of clinical presentations with both intestinal and extra-intestinal manifestations. The latter may affect almost every organ of the body, including the skin. Besides the well-known association between CD and dermatitis herpetiformis, considered as the cutaneous specific manifestation of CD, many other muco-cutaneous disorders have been associated to GRD. In this review, we analyzed the main features of dermatological diseases with a proven association with GRD and those that improve after a gluten-free diet, focusing on the newly described cutaneous manifestations associated with NCGS. Our main hypothesis is that a ""cutaneous-gluten sensitivity,"" as specific cutaneous manifestation of NCGS, may exist and could represent a diagnostic marker of NCGS.","['Verdelli A', 'Corrà A', 'Mariotti EB', 'Aimo C', 'Quintarelli L', 'Ruffo di Calabria V', 'Donati ME', 'Bonciolini V', 'Antiga E', 'Caproni M']",2023,10,,Front Med (Lausanne),"Verdelli A, et al.

36979421,Pruritus Is Associated with an Increased Risk for the Diagnosis of Autoimmune Skin Blistering Diseases: A Propensity-Matched Global Study.,"Autoimmune bullous skin diseases (AIBDs), such as bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus, are characterized and caused by autoantibodies targeting structural proteins. In BP, clinical experience and recent systematic evaluation identified pruritus to be common and an important cause of impaired quality of life. Furthermore, chronic pruritus may be the sole clinical symptom of BP. In pemphigus, a retrospective study recently documented a high prevalence of pruritus. The temporal relation between pruritus and BP/pemphigus are, however, unknown. Likewise, the presence of pruritus in AIBDs other than BP and pemphigus is unknown. To address this, we performed propensity-matched retrospective cohort studies using TriNetX, providing real-world patient data to (i) assess the risk to develop AIBDs following the diagnosis of pruritus and (ii) vice versa. We assessed this in eight AIBDs: BP, mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, dermatitis herpetiformis, lichen planus pemphigoides (LPP), pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceous, and paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP). For all AIBDs, pruritus was associated with an increased risk for the subsequent diagnosis of each of the eight investigated AIBDs in 1,717,744 cases (pruritus) compared with 1,717,744 controls.

36926325,Computer-aided classification of indirect immunofluorescence patterns on esophagus and split skin for the detection of autoimmune dermatoses.,"Autoimmune bullous dermatoses (AIBD) are rare diseases that affect human skin and mucous membranes. Clinically, they are characterized by blister formation and/or erosions. Depending on the structures involved and the depth of blister formation, they are grouped into pemphigus diseases, pemphigoid diseases, and dermatitis herpetiformis. Classification of AIBD into their sub-entities is crucial to guide treatment decisions. One of the most sensitive screening methods for initial differentiation of AIBD is the indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) microscopy on tissue sections of monkey esophagus and primate salt-split skin, which are used to detect disease-specific autoantibodies. Interpretation of IIF patterns requires a detailed examination of the image by trained professionals automating this process is a challenging task with these highly complex tissue substrates, but offers the great advantage of an objective result. Here, we present computer-aided classification of esophagus and salt-split skin IIF images. We show how deep networks can be adapted to the specifics and challenges of IIF image analysis by incorporating segmentation of relevant regions into the prediction process, and demonstrate their high accuracy. Using this semi-automatic extension can reduce the workload of professionals when reading tissue sections in IIF testing. Furthermore, these results on highly complex tissue sections show that further integration of semi-automated workflows into the daily workflow of diagnostic laboratories is promising.","['Hocke J', 'Krauth J', 'Krause C', 'Gerlach S', 'Warnemünde N', 'Affeldt K', 'van Beek N', 'Schmidt E', 'Voigt J']",2023,14,,Front Immunol,"Hocke J, et al.

36923800,A Rare Case of COVID-19-Induced Acute Exacerbation of Oral Dermatitis Herpetiformis in a Geriatric Patient.,"INTRODUCTION: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune vesiculobullous disease associated with celiac enteropathy. The clinical manifestation of DH is the occurrence of a papulovesicular rash on the skin. Oral mucosal involvement in DH is very rare. This study aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on the acute exacerbation of oral dermatitis herpetiformis.
CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old woman was referred to the Oral Medicine Department with a chief complaint of the blisters on the skin for a week and ulcers in the oral cavity appeared two days ago. Extraoral examination revealed crusts on the neck and extremities. The lips appeared dry and desquamative. Intraoral examination revealed erosive lesions covered with a white-yellowish plaques on the right and left sides of the buccal mucosa, an ulcer with a diameter of 0.5 cm, and purpura hemorrhagic on left buccal mucosa and right lateral border of the tongue. Histopathological examination of the skin lesion revealed a subepithelial blister with eosinophils and neutrophil cells. The definitive diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis was made. She was given 5 mg intravenous dexamethasone, cetirizine 10 mg, and clindamycin 300 mg by the dermatologist. We gave hyaluronic acid 0.025% mouthwash for oral ulcers and petroleum jelly for the lips. The oral lesions had significant improvement after 4 weeks of treatment. Two months later, the patient experienced acute exacerbation after being infected with COVID-19 (anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG S-RBD >40,000 AU/mL). The oral lesions healed after a month of treatment.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can trigger the acute exacerbation of dermatitis herpetiformis. SARS-CoV-2 causes an immune dysregulation and hypersensitivity reaction.","['Shafuria A', 'Sufiawati I', 'Usman HA']",2023,16,,Int Med Case Rep J,"Shafuria A, et al.

36875085,Primate liver tissue substrate in indirect immunofluorescence diagnostics for patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare autoimmune, polymorphous blistering disorder, characterized by severe itch or burning sensation, which represents the cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease (CD). The current estimation of DH versus CD is around 1:8 and the affected individuals have a genetic predisposition. Pathogenetically, IgA autoantibodies against the epidermal transglutaminase, an essential constituent of the epidermis, cause DH and are reported to develop through cross-reaction with the tissue transglutaminase, with IgA auto-antibodies causing CD. Immunofluorescence techniques allow for a rapid diagnostics of the disease using patient sera. Evaluation of IgA endomysial deposition with indirect immunofluorescence on monkey oesophagus is highly specific, but moderately sensitive, with some operator-dependent variability. Recently, indirect immunofluorescence with monkey liver as a substrate has been proposed as an alternative, well-functioning diagnostic approach with higher sensitivity in CD.
METHODS: The objective of our study was to evaluate whether monkey oesophagus or liver tissue shows advantage for diagnostics in patients with DH, compared to CD. To that end, sera of 103 patients with DH (n=16), CD (n=67) and 20 controls ere compared by 4 blinded experienced raters.
RESULTS: For DH, we found a sensitivity of 94.2% for monkey liver (ML) compared to 96.2% in monkey oesophagus (ME), while specificity in ML was superior (91.6% versus 75%) to ME. In CD, ML had a sensitivity of 76.9% (ME 89.1%) and specificity of 98.3% (ME 94.1%).
DISCUSSION: Our data show that ML substrate is well suitable for DH diagnostics.","['Schauer F', 'Tasiopoulou G', 'Schuster D', 'Behrens M', 'Müller S', 'Kiritsi D']",2023,14,,Front Immunol,"Schauer F, et al.

36846641,Atypical Dermatitis Herpetiform and Scalp Psoriasis in Ulcerative Colitis Patient Treated With Adalimumab.,"Adalimumab is a blocker of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha with established efficacy in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. However, literature indicated that adalimumab can, occasionally, induce paradoxical psoriasis reactions and, very rarely, dermatitis herpetiformis. We present a unique case of a 26-year-old female patient who developed a combination of dermatitis herpetiformis and scalp psoriasis paradoxically as a result of adalimumab treatment for ulcerative colitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of such a combination within the context of adalimumab therapy. The etiopathological underpinning of such a reaction remains elusive but is speculated to be complex and involves the interaction of several immunological and dermatological mechanisms. Adalimumab therapy is associated with a genuine risk for the development of paradoxical psoriasis and dermatitis herpetiformis. We, through this case report, added to the evidence confirming such an association. Clinicians should follow these potential adverse effects and make every effort to warn patients of their likelihood.","['Alshehri H', 'Alshehri A', 'Bin Abbas A']",2023,15,2,Cureus,"Alshehri H, et al.

Subepidermal blisters containing neutrophils and eosinophils visualized on histology supported the diagnosis of linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood (LABDC). The dermatosis presents with vesicles and tense blisters in an annular distribution, erythematous papules, and/or excoriated plaques. Histopathology shows subepidermal blisters with a neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis, mainly concentrated at the tips of dermal papillae in the early stage of the disease, which can be mistaken for the pattern of neutrophilic infiltration as seen in dermatitis herpetiformis. Dapsone is the treatment of choice, which is started at a dosage of 0.5mg/kg/day. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis of childhood is a rare autoimmune disease that can be mistaken for other conditions with similar presentations but should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with blistering.","['Nasri J', 'Jungo P', 'Blickenstorfer M', 'Mühleisen B', 'Navarini AA', 'Juratli HA', 'Lapides R', 'Roider E']",2022,28,5,Dermatol Online J,"Nasri J, et al.

36780126,Subclinical Celiac Disease Unmasked by Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are antibodies that block immune checkpoint proteins from binding with their partner proteins on cancer cells, subsequently allowing cytotoxic T-cell-associated enhancement of antitumor responses. Although ICIs have become the standard of care for various malignancies, their use is often limited by unique immune-related adverse events, including dermatologic, endocrine, inflammatory, hepatic, and gastrointestinal events. Diarrhea and colitis are common lower gastrointestinal tract immune-related adverse events, however, only a few cases have reported the association between celiac disease (CD) and ICIs. We report here a case of a 75-year-old man with new onset CD after exposure to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 ICI, ipilimumab. Although ICI-induced CD is relatively rare, it is essential to consider it in a genetically susceptible patient undergoing treatment with ICI. Patients with known high susceptibility to CD, such as a family history of CD, or with the ancestry of high celiac penetrance (eg, Northern Europe, North Africa, etc), dermatitis herpetiformis, or chronic bowel symptoms, we feel should have celiac panel testing before initiating ICI therapy.","['Braun DS', 'Patel S', 'Schwartz A']",2023,46,4,J Immunother,"Braun DS, et al.

Diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical and immunopathological findings. Oral manifestations of DH have rarely been described. The aim of the study was to evaluate IgA, IgG, IgM and C3 complement deposits in the oral mucosa in DH patients. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) was performed on the oral mucosa specimens collected from 10 DH patients. Biopsy was taken in a local anesthesia from perilesional site from the buccal mucosa and then preserved in a standard procedure using polyclonal rabbit IgG, IgA, IgM and C3 antibodies. Granular IgA and C3 deposits were found in 6 patients (60%), and in 3 subjects (30%) the result was indeterminate. Significant fluorescence of the deposits along the basement membrane was observed in 2 patients, moderate fluorescence in 3 patients, and in 4 cases the result was indeterminate. C3 deposits were found in 5 subjects (50%), 3 of them being moderate and 2 indeterminate. No IgM and IgG deposits were detected in the collected buccal mucosa specimens.","['Mania-Końsko A', 'Szponar E', 'Dańczak-Pazdrowska A', 'Bowszyc-Dmochowska M', 'Pazdrowski J', 'Wyganowska M']",2023,20,3,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Mania-Końsko A, et al.

We studied the clinicopathologic and genetic features of 136 HGBL-NOS patients and compared them to patients with DLBCL/HGBL-DH (n = 224, defined by 5th Edition WHO) and DLBCL (n = 217). HGBL-NOS patients had clinical features similar to DLBCL/HGBL-DH patients. MYC rearrangement (MYC-R) was present in 43% of HGBL-NOS. With induction regimen similar to DLBCL/HGBL-DH patients, HGBL-NOS patients had a median overall survival (OS) of 28.9 months, similar to DLBCL/HGBL-DH (p = 0.48) but inferior to DLBCL patients (p = 0.03). R-EPOCH induction was associated with improved OS compared with R-CHOP. MYC-R, history of lymphoma, and high IPI were independent adverse prognostic factors in HGBL-NOS patients. Whole transcriptome profiling performed on a subset of HGBL-NOS cases showed a profile more similar to DLBCL/HGBL-DH than to DLBCL; 53% of HGBL-NOS had a DH-like signature (DH-like-Sig) and were enriched for MYC-R. DH-like-Sig+ HGBL-NOS patients had a poorer OS than DH-like-Sig-negative patients (p = 0.04). In conclusion, HGBL-NOS has clinicopathologic features and a gene expression profile more similar to DLBCL/HGBL-DH than to DLBCL. Cases of HGBL-NOS frequently carry MYC-R and have a DH-like-Sig+. R-EPOCH induction in HGBL-NOS appears associated with improved OS compared with standard R-CHOP.","['Li S', 'Qiu L', 'Xu J', 'Lin P', 'Ok CY', 'Tang G', 'McDonnell TJ', 'James You M', 'Khanlari M', 'Miranda RN', 'Medeiros LJ']",2023,37,2,Leukemia,"Li S, et al.

36321689,Defining the optimum strategy for identifying adults and children with coeliac disease: systematic review and economic modelling.,"BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingesting gluten. It affects approximately 1% of the UK population, but only one in three people is thought to have a diagnosis. Untreated coeliac disease may lead to malnutrition, anaemia, osteoporosis and lymphoma.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to define at-risk groups and determine the cost-effectiveness of active case-finding strategies in primary care.
DESIGN: (1) Systematic review of the accuracy of potential diagnostic indicators for coeliac disease. (2) Routine data analysis to develop prediction models for identification of people who may benefit from testing for coeliac disease. (3) Systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for coeliac disease. (4) Systematic review of the accuracy of genetic tests for coeliac disease (literature search conducted in April 2021). (5) Online survey to identify diagnostic thresholds for testing, starting treatment and referral for biopsy. (6) Economic modelling to identify the cost-effectiveness of different active case-finding strategies, informed by the findings from previous objectives.
DATA SOURCES: For the first systematic review, the following databases were searched from 1997 to April 2021: MEDLINE
REVIEW METHODS: For review 1, cohort and case-control studies reporting on a diagnostic indicator in a population with and a population without coeliac disease were eligible. For review 2, diagnostic cohort studies including patients presenting with coeliac disease symptoms who were tested with serological tests for coeliac disease and underwent a duodenal biopsy as reference standard were eligible. In both reviews, risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were fitted, in which binomial likelihoods for the numbers of true positives and true negatives were assumed.
RESULTS: People with dermatitis herpetiformis, a family history of coeliac disease, migraine, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis or chronic liver disease are 1.5-2 times more likely than the general population to have coeliac disease; individual gastrointestinal symptoms were not useful for identifying coeliac disease. For children, women and men, prediction models included 24, 24 and 21 indicators of coeliac disease, respectively. The models showed good discrimination between patients with and patients without coeliac disease, but performed less well when externally validated. Serological tests were found to have good diagnostic accuracy for coeliac disease. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase had the highest sensitivity and endomysial antibody the highest specificity. There was little improvement when tests were used in combination. Survey respondents (
LIMITATIONS: The interpretation of meta-analyses was limited by the substantial heterogeneity between the included studies, and most included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. The main limitations of the prediction models were that we were restricted to diagnostic indicators that were recorded by general practitioners and that, because coeliac disease is underdiagnosed, it is also under-reported in health-care data. The cost-effectiveness model is a simplification of coeliac disease and modelled an average cohort rather than individuals. Evidence was weak on the probability of routine coeliac disease diagnosis, the accuracy of serological and genetic tests and the utility of a gluten-free diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Population screening with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (1% pre-test probability) and of immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody followed by human leucocyte antigen testing or human leucocyte antigen testing followed by immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability appear to have similar cost-effectiveness results. As decisions to implement population screening cannot be made based on our economic analysis alone, and given the practical challenges of identifying patients with higher pre-test probabilities, we recommend that human leucocyte antigen combined with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing should be considered for adults with at least a 1.5% pre-test probability of coeliac disease, equivalent to having at least one predictor. A more targeted strategy of 10% pre-test probability is recommended for children (e.g. children with anaemia).
FUTURE WORK: Future work should consider whether or not population-based screening for coeliac disease could meet the UK National Screening Committee criteria and whether or not it necessitates a long-term randomised controlled trial of screening strategies. Large prospective cohort studies in which all participants receive accurate tests for coeliac disease are needed.

It is caused by genetic alterations (mutations or deletions) in the DOCK 8 gene and is characterized by multiple allergies, elevated IgE levels, and susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. Early diagnosis is critical to optimize the success of stem cell transplantation.
CASE SUMMARY: This study reports the case of a pediatric patient with DOCK 8 deficiency who had negative genetic testing using multiplex primary immunodeficiency (PID) panel and whole-exome sequencing (WES) with a next-generation sequencing method. He presented with chronic diarrhea and was managed as celiac disease based on previous negative workup for immunodeficiency and duodenal biopsy. He developed a generalized vesicular rash which was thought to be dermatitis herpetiformis associated with celiac disease. However, it turned out to be Eczema herpeticum based on positive herpes simplex virus from blood and lesions. The diagnosis was re-evaluated after the child was found to have multiple viral, bacterial, and parasitic co-infections (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus,

ATE include brain, heart, aortic, and peripheral ischemic complications which usually aggravate a course of the disease leading to lifethreatening conditions.
A CASE REPORT: The authors describe a case of a 53-year-old male with Duhring disease in the remission period admitted due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone (2000 mg once daily), dexamethasone (8 mg once daily), enoxaparin (60 mg twice daily), baricitinib (4 mg once daily), and remdesivir (200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg within 4 consecutive days); he required high flow oxygen therapy. On day 5 of hospitalization, he began to suffer from pain of the right lower extremity; in physical examination the limb was cold with absent femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses. Urgent computed tomography angiography revealed total occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) in the absence of any atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta. The patient was intubated and transferred to department of vascular surgery, where a giant clot was removed from SFA. Unfortunately, the patient outcome was unfavorable due to respiratory failure progression. The authors underline that ATE may occur even in anticoagulated patients and that association of some therapeutic options of COVID-19, like janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors use with an increased risk of ATE, should not be excluded.","['Elikowski W', 'Pietrzak I', 'Fertała N', 'Zawodna-Marszałek M', 'Włodarski A', 'Skrzywanek P', 'Żytkiewicz M']",2022,50,298,Pol Merkur Lekarski,"Elikowski W, et al.

35923586,Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus in females.,"Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (BSLE) is a rare blistering presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus, typically affecting women with the highest incidence in those of African descent. The key pathogenic insult includes the formation of autoantibodies against type VII collagen, which weaken the basement membrane zone and lead to the formation of subepidermal blisters. The acute vesiculobullous eruptions in BSLE generally tend to affect photo-distributed areas, although they can arise unrelated to sun exposure (eg, mucous membranes, axillae). The bullae can arise from erythematous macules, inflammatory plaques, or previously normal skin. Their appearance can range from small, grouped vesicles reminiscent of lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis to large, tense blisters, similar to bullous pemphigoid. Internal organ involvement occurs in up to 90% of those affected. This mostly includes lupus nephritis (classes III-V, lifetime prevalence of up to 90%), arthralgias/arthritis, and cytopenias, while serositis and neuropsychiatric involvement are rare. First-line management with dapsone should be considered in mild disease with stable underlying systemic lupus erythematosus. As discussed in this review, the off-label use of rituximab (an anti-CD20 B-cell depleting agent) has been shown to be safe and effective in several refractory cases of BSLE unresponsive to dapsone, glucocorticoids, or steroid-sparing immunosuppressants.","['Sprow G', 'Afarideh M', 'Dan J', 'Hedberg ML', 'Werth VP']",2022,8,3,Int J Womens Dermatol,"Sprow G, et al.

35874457,Bullous Grover's Disease in a Chinese Tibetan Adolescent: A Case Report.,"Grover's disease (GD), also known as Transient acantholytic dermatosis, has no typical clinical rash features. It usually occurs in elderly white men but very rarely in China. This is a disease of acantholysis and dyskeratosis, which is usually considered to be spontaneous remission. The skin lesions of the disease are diverse, and the main symptom is severe itching. We have reported a case of GD in a 14-year-old Chinese Tibetan male whose clinical manifestations were pruritic red papule, generalized red papules, papulo vesicles and blisters ranging from millet rice to soybean size. Skin lesions change rapidly and variously. In order to confirm the diagnosis, we have done skin biopsies, immunofluorescence, dermoscopy, microscopy and other examinations. Pathological skin biopsy showed acantholysis. Intraepidermal blisters and the presence of blisters on the basal cells as well as under the stratum corneum can be observed on the same pathological section. Type IV collagen immunohistochemistry showed blisters in the epidermis. The diagnosis of GD depended on the exclusion of other diseases. After we performed whole exon sequencing (WES) on DNA from the patient's blood, pathogenic gene mutations were not found. Pustular psoriasis, Subcorneal pustular dermatosis, Herpesvirus infections, Dermatitis herpetiformis, Pemphigus vulgaris, Norwegian scabies, Darier's disease, and Hailey-Hailey disease were all excluded.

35858884,Guidelines of the Italian societies of gastroenterology on the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are immune-mediated diseases triggered by the consumption of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. These guidelines were developed to provide general practitioners, paediatricians, gastroenterologists, and other clinicians with an overview on the diagnosis, management and follow-up of coeliac patients and those with dermatitis herpetiformis.
METHODS: Guidelines were developed by the Italian Societies of Gastroenterology. Following a systematic literature review, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Statements and recommendations were developed by working groups consisting of gastroenterologists and a paediatrician with expertise in this field.
RESULTS: These guidelines provide a practical guidance for the diagnosis, management and follow-up of coeliac patients and dermatitis herpetiformis in children and adults, both in primary care and in specialist settings. We developed four sections on diagnosis, gluten-free diet, follow-up and risk of complications in adults, one section focused on diagnosis and follow-up in children and one on the diagnosis and management of dermatitis herpetiformis.
CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines may support clinicians to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with coeliac disease.","['Zingone F', 'Maimaris S', 'Auricchio R', 'Caio GPI', 'Carroccio A', 'Elli L', 'Galliani E', 'Montagnani M', 'Valiante F', 'Biagi F']",2022,54,10,Dig Liver Dis,"Zingone F, et al.

The diagnostic workup for this heterogeneous group of disorders consists of a multi-step process, of which the light microscopic examination is a crucial component. This review is organized following a classification scheme that is based on two main histopathologic features, namely level of intraepithelial split and composition of the inflammatory infiltrate. Overall, we aim to place emphasis on the histopathologic clues that can assist pathologists in differential diagnosis and review the updates in the literature.","['Tekin B', 'Johnson EF', 'Wieland CN', 'Gibson LE', 'Camilleri MJ', 'Kalaaji AN', 'Comfere NI', 'Peters MS', 'Lehman JS']",2022,128,,Hum Pathol,"Tekin B, et al.

35743598,Current and Innovated Managements for Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorders: An Overview.,"Autoimmune bullous skin disorders are a group of disorders characterized by the formation of numerous blisters and erosions on the skin and/or the mucosal membrane, arising from autoantibodies against the intercellular adhesion molecules and the structural proteins. They can be classified into intraepithelial or subepithelial autoimmune bullous dermatoses based on the location of the targeted antigens. These dermatoses are extremely debilitating and fatal in certain cases, depending on the degree of cutaneous and mucosal involvement. Effective treatments should be implemented promptly. Glucocorticoids serve as the first-line approach due to their rapid onset of therapeutic effects and remission of the acute phase. Nonetheless, long-term applications may lead to major adverse effects that outweigh the benefits. Hence, other adjuvant therapies are mandatory to minimize the potential harm and ameliorate the quality of life. Herein, we summarize the current therapeutic strategies and introduce promising therapies for intractable autoimmune bullous diseases.","['Chu KY', 'Yu HS', 'Yu S']",2022,11,12,J Clin Med,"Chu KY, et al.

35717838,A literature review on Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors for the treatment of immunobullous disorders.,"Janus kinases (JAKs) are a group of intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinase proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic part of the transmembrane cytokine receptors and regulate signaling. The pathophysiology of various autoimmune and autoinflammatory conditions relies on JAK/STAT signaling and therefore, the inhibition of JAK/STAT pathways can be a promising treatment for such diseases, especially inflammatory skin conditions. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of immunobullous diseases, including pemphigus, pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and epidermolysis bullosa. The databases used to identify the studies were Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed/Medline for studies published until 2/3/2022. The current review suggests that JAK inhibitors may be revolutionary for the future treatments of dermatologic conditions, especially autoimmune bullous disease. Results also indicated the effectiveness of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of immunobullous diseases.","['Kalantari Y', 'Sadeghi S', 'Asadi D', 'Goodarzi A']",2022,110,,Int Immunopharmacol,"Kalantari Y, et al.

35713926,The risk of renal comorbidities in celiac disease patients depends on the phenotype of celiac disease.,"BACKGROUND: An increased risk of kidney disease in patients with celiac disease has been reported, but the association has remained obscure. Only few studies have investigated the association between renal comorbidities and dermatitis herpetiformis, a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether patients with different phenotypes of celiac disease are at higher risk of kidney diseases than age- and sex-matched references.
METHODS: The diagnoses of glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, interstitial nephritis, and end-stage renal disease obtained from the National Hospital Discharge Register between 1970 and 2015 were identified in celiac disease (Marsh III, n = 1072) and dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 368) patients diagnosed at Tampere University Hospital catchment region and in 4296 reference subjects. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we compared the risk of kidney diseases between patients and references. The study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Tampere University Hospital (R16090). As the study was register based, no consent from patients was required.
RESULTS: Even after adjusting for type 1 diabetes, celiac disease was associated with an elevated risk of kidney disease (hazard ratio [HR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-3.03), glomerulonephritis (HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.64-6.95), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) (HR 18.98, 95% CI 2.29-157.63). No similarly elevated risk was found among dermatitis herpetiformis patients (HR 1.50, 95% CI 0.63-3.55; HR 2.21, 95% CI 0.77-6.38; and HR 5.87, 95% CI 0.53-64.79, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Celiac disease patients were at increased risk of kidney diseases, notably IgAN. The risk was dependent on the celiac disease phenotype and was not seen in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Awareness of possible renal manifestations is recommended when treating celiac disease patients.","['Nurmi R', 'Pasternack C', 'Salmi T', 'Hervonen K', 'Koskinen I', 'Järvelin J', 'Huhtala H', 'Collin P', 'Mustonen J', 'Kaukinen K', 'Mäkelä S']",2022,292,5,J Intern Med,"Nurmi R, et al.

35646449,Serological Biomarkers and Their Detection in Autoimmune Bullous Skin Diseases.,"Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are a group of skin-related disorders that involve damage to structures maintaining cell-cell adhesion, such as desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. Key AIBDs include pemphigus related diseases, pemphigoid related conditions, acquired epidermolysis bullosa (EBA), and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Each group of conditions exhibits characteristic clinical lesion patterns and is associated with specific autoantibodies targeting epidermal and dermal structures involved in cell-cell adhesion and skin integrity. Pemphigus diseases primarily target desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and Dsg1 proteins but several non-Dsg autoantibodies have also been linked to pemphigus. Pemphigoid diseases typically target bullous pemphigoid (BP)180 and BP230; EBA is associated with antibodies directed against anti-type VII collagen and DH by IgA autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase and deaminated gliadin. Investigation into the serological biomarkers found in AIBDs have allowed the development of diagnostic assessments (i.e. tissue antibody detection and serological testing) based on the unique autoantibody profiles of a particular disease group. The methods for the detection and quantification of disease-associated autoantibodies continue to evolve and improve.","['Heckler I', 'Hong M', 'Amart Sinha A', 'Venkataraman I']",2022,12,2,Dermatol Pract Concept,"Heckler I, et al.

The burden of coeliac disease is increased especially in females, but studies concerning sex differences in patients with long-term treated dermatitis herpetiformis are scarce. This questionnaire study compared adherence to a gluten-free diet, clinical symptoms and well-being between females and males in a cohort of 237 long-term treated (median 24 years) patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Females had better adherence to a gluten-free diet (p = 0.022) and they used dapsone significantly less often at the time of the study than did males (4% vs 13%, p = 0.017). The occurrence of skin symptoms was equal in both sexes, but dermatological quality of life was lower in females (p = 0.024), and gastrointestinal symptoms were more severe among females with dermatitis herpetiformis than among males (p = 0.027). In conclusion, long-term treated female patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have better adherence to a gluten-free diet, but they also experience more severe clinical symptoms compared with males.","['Pasternack C', 'Hervonen K', 'Mansikka E', 'Reunala T', 'Kaukinen K', 'Salmi T']",2022,102,,Acta Derm Venereol,"Pasternack C, et al.

35369614,Etiopathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is a rare chronic, autoimmune bullous disease linked to gluten sensitivity with intense pruritus and characteristic skin eruptions. Etiopathogenesis is complex and not fully understood. It is currently considered to be a specific cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Genetic, environmental and immunological factors influence both conditions. Exposure to gluten is the starting point of an inflammatory cascade leading to the formation of circulating IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and skin immune IgA deposition followed by skin lesions. Binding of the immune complex deposits of IgA transglutaminases and epidermal antibodies with enzymes in the papillary dermis stimulates complement activation, neutrophil influx, proinflammatory cytokine release and overproduction of matrix metalloproteinases. We have collected current knowledge of the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis.","[""Rybak-d'Obyrn J"", 'Placek W']",2022,39,1,Postepy Dermatol Alergol,Rybak-d'Obyrn J and Placek W.

35328331,Antibody Responses to Transglutaminase 3 in Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Lessons from Celiac Disease.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is the skin manifestation of celiac disease, presenting with a blistering rash typically on the knees, elbows, buttocks and scalp. In both DH and celiac disease, exposure to dietary gluten triggers a cascade of events resulting in the production of autoantibodies against the transglutaminase (TG) enzyme, mainly TG2 but often also TG3. The latter is considered to be the primary autoantigen in DH. The dynamics of the development of the TG2-targeted autoimmune response have been studied in depth in celiac disease, but the immunological process underlying DH pathophysiology is incompletely understood. Part of this process is the occurrence of granular deposits of IgA and TG3 in the perilesional skin. While this serves as the primary diagnostic finding in DH, the role of these immunocomplexes in the pathogenesis is unknown. Intriguingly, even though gluten-intolerance likely develops initially in a similar manner in both DH and celiac disease, after the onset of the disease, its manifestations differ widely.","['Kaunisto H', 'Salmi T', 'Lindfors K', 'Kemppainen E']",2022,23,6,Int J Mol Sci,"Kaunisto H, et al.

Being both conditions multifactorial, they share some genetic traits and pathogenic mechanisms, which are responsible for the typical skin and gastrointestinal manifestations. In dermatitis herpetiformis, skin and other lesions heal after gluten-free diet and reappear shortly after its reintroduction to complete diet. Prevalence of celiac disease is 1% in the population, and approximately 13% of patients with the disease develop dermatitis herpetiformis. Diagnosis of celiac disease has progressively increased in recent decades, while clinical manifestations become more and more diverse.

35035485,Clinical Treatment Study of Secondary Multiple Squamous Cell Carcinoma with Psoriasis Vulgaris.,"Dermatologic diseases are the fourth most frequent nonfatal common illness, yet they have a psychological, economical, and professional burden that is comparable to or larger than other chronic conditions. From a survey in China of 6 provinces, the overall prevalence of psoriasis with squamous cell carcinoma was 0.47%. According to the current investigation, the outburst of skin disease was not associated with gender, but mainly with the climate of the environment; that is, dry cold weather will more likely to induce psoriasis. Approximately 3% of people around the world have psoriasis, which is near the most common autoimmune skin disease in adults. By simple estimation, there are at least two hundred million psoriasis patients in the world. Therefore, it is not just a simple health problem in a country or a region but a serious global challenge. Of note, about half of the adult patients had been reported to be sick in their childhood and they mostly fell ill around 10 years old. Actinic keratosis is perhaps the most common, followed by squamous cell carcinoma and, to a lesser extent, acne vulgaris, psoriasis, and hidradenitis suppurativa, as well as dermatitis herpetiformis. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 0.5 percent is used topically to treat actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma with good outcomes, while it might cause significant toxicity in certain patients. Dapsone, a Valosin-containing protein, is a medication that is often used to treat inflammatory skin disorders like psoriatic arthritis, but it can occasionally cause hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, biologic medications for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis and multiple squamous cell carcinoma have proven to be successful and safe; nevertheless, a small percentage of patients do not react to biologic treatment in the long term or do not respond at all. Based on the data from the China Food and Drug Administration, the majority of chemical drugs are utilized as the topical formulations, while Chinese medicines are mainly delivered by an oral route, suggesting that the market for topical preparations of Chinese medicine to treat skin diseases like psoriasis is worth exploration. This large interindividual diversity in response could be caused by changes in genes that encode proteins implicated in the disease's pathologic environment or the medication's mechanism of action. Pharmacogenetics is the study of the association between genetic differences and medication response, which is valuable for identifying nonresponsive patients and those who are more likely to suffer toxicity as a result of treatment. This study highlights the pharmacogenetic recommendations for dermatology therapies that have the strongest evidence at this time, highlighting those that have been incorporated in clinical practice guides. Pharmacogenetic clinical guidelines for multiple squamous cell carcinoma and psoriasis vulgaris were found in this investigation. Here, for multiple squamous cell carcinoma trichohyalin-like 1 (TCHHL1), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 0.5% is recommended. Along with that dapsone, Valosin-containing protein can be recommended for treating the psoriasis vulgaris. We made some clinical trials over the two diseases, and from the result obtained, we hypothesize that the suggested drug may be a novel therapeutic target in treating the multiple squamous cell carcinoma with psoriasis vulgaris.","['Han SN', 'Feng SJ', 'Ai DF']",2022,2022,,J Oncol,"Han SN, et al.

The relationship between CD and vitiligo has been reported in several studies, but their conclusions are inconsistent. Further, it has also been reported that a gluten-free diet (GFD) can improve the symptoms of immune-related skin diseases such as vitiligo. In this mini-review, we summarize and review the literature on the relationship between CD and vitiligo, assess the therapeutic significance of GFD for patients with vitiligo, and explore their possible physiopathology.

34996089,Diagnostics for Dermatologic Diseases with Autoantibodies.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatologic diseases with autoantibodies were recognized early as autoimmunity became accepted as a pathogenic immunologic concept. Laboratory testing to identify disease-defining autoantibodies and investigate their role in pathophysiology has evolved since.
CONTENT: Blistering dermatologic diseases, profiled by autoantibody production, target epithelial components critical in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, resulting in epithelial separation and other characteristic features of the disorders. This review covers the clinical indications for dermatologic disease-related autoantibody testing, the specifics of procuring specimens to test, the available diagnostic tests, and information provided by the testing. Atypical, uncharacteristic, and less well-known clinical and autoantibody profiles as well as several of the many future prospects for expansion of the testing applications are elaborated on in the online Data Supplement.
SUMMARY: Autoantibody-associated dermatologic diseases are acquired immunologic disorders that have considerable clinical implications affecting essential barrier functions of skin and mucous membranes and causing discomfort, including pain and pruritus. Certain of the diseases can have life-threatening manifestations, and treatments can have significant side-effects. The skin diseases may presage other clinical associations that are important to recognize and treat. Laboratory testing aids in the diagnosis of these diseases through identification of the autoantibodies and is essential for prompt and precise knowledge of the disease type for prognosis, further clinical evaluations, and treatment decisions.","['Leiferman KM', 'Snook JP', 'Khalighi MA', 'Kuechle MK', 'Zone JJ']",2022,7,1,J Appl Lab Med,"Leiferman KM, et al.

This study aims to investigate the risk for major oral diseases or oral-manifesting diseases in asthmatic compared with non-asthmatic adults.
DESIGN: We conducted a population-based matched cohort study with a 13.8-year follow-up.
SETTING: A baseline questionnaire was completed by participants in 1997 and follow-up data were extracted from the national hospital discharge registry of the National Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland from 1997 to 2014.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1394 adults with asthma were matched with 2398 adults without asthma based on sex, age and area of residence. Asthmatic adults were identified from the Drug Reimbursement Register of the Finnish Social Insurance Institution based on a special drug reimbursement right resulting from asthma. Participants without asthma were identified from the Population Register.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Oral health-related primary diagnoses were retrieved using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition and divided into groups of diseases. Cox's proportional hazards models stratified by matching unit and models matched and adjusted for pack-years, education level and body mass index (when possible) were used to evaluate the matched and further adjusted HRs for diseases comparing asthmatic and non-asthmatic cohorts.
RESULTS: Adult asthma was associated with a higher risk for any oral-manifesting disease (adjusted HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.80), herpes zoster (adjusted HR 6.18, 95% CI 1.21 to 31.6), benign tumours of the oral cavity and pharynx (matched HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.56) and dermatological diseases (pemphigus, pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis and lichen planus, HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.78).

CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old Ukrainian male suffered from symmetric, sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy and encephalopathy associated with celiac disease, which is characterized by severe trophic disorders in the lower extremities (trophic ulcers, hyperkeratosis, and anhidrosis). Acrodystrophic changes in the lower extremities were due to both neurogenic and direct immunoinflammatory damaging effects. Clinical-electrophysiological dissociation was also noted, which was represented by a gross axonal lesion with the preservation of muscle strength. The absence of enteropathic manifestations was accompanied by the pronounced histological changes in the duodenal mucosa by IIIb stage of Marsh. A gluten-free diet in combination with membrane plasma exchange and intravenous pulse methylprednisolone was prescribed to reduce the severity of sensory disorders and regression of encephalopathy within 7 months.
CONCLUSION: Celiac disease may be a potential cause of neuropathy and encephalopathy in adult patients. Further immunosuppressive treatment protocols for both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease are required.","['Bardakov SN', 'Tran MD', 'Lapin SV', 'Moshnikova AN', 'Kalinina EU', 'Bogdanova EG', 'Bolekhan AV', 'Gavriluk BL']",2021,15,1,J Med Case Rep,"Bardakov SN, et al.

34909845,THE MANAGEMENT OF DERMATITIS HERPETIFORMIS BY THE GASTROENTEROLOGIST. A SERIES OF CASES.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is considered a skin celiac disease (CD). The individuals can be seen by primary care professionals or by dermatologists that could refer the patient to a gastroenterologist.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the clinical profile of patients diagnosed with DH and referred to a gastroenterologist and evaluate the treatment response.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients with DH referred to the same gastroenterologist at a private office in Curitiba, Brazil, between January 2010 to December 2019. We included adult patients with a confirmed DH diagnosis. Symptoms, clinical signs, laboratory and histological data, as well as treatment response, were collected.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were studied (60.6% women, mean age at diagnosis 40.8±12.61 years). The median delay for DH diagnosis was four years. Skin involvement was mild in 33.3%, moderate in 18.2%, and severe in 48.5%. The more frequent gastrointestinal complaints were abdominal distension (78.8%), flatulence (75.7%), and gastroesophageal reflux (51.5%). Depression and anxiety were observed in 81.8% and anemia in 51.1%. A higher prevalence of bone disorders was associated with higher age at DH diagnosis (P=0.035). Duodenal biopsy showed changes in all patients. Improvement after treatment only with a gluten-free diet (GFD) plus dapsone was verified in 81.2%.
CONCLUSION: Patients with DH referred to a gastroenterologist showed a high frequency of gluten intolerance and systemic complaints. Duodenal histological alterations were found in all the cases. The treatment based on GFD plus dapsone was effective in most patients.","['Kotze LMDS', 'Kotze LR', 'Purim KSM', 'Nisihara R']",2021,58,4,Arq Gastroenterol,"Kotze LMDS, et al.

However, the diet carries some disadvantages such as elevated costs, nutritional deficiencies, and social and psychological barriers. The present work aims to review indications, proven benefits, and adverse events of a gluten-free diet. Close follow-up with patients following the diet is recommended.

This group of diseases is broad and encompasses subepidermal conditions such as bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis, as well as intraepidermal conditions such as pemphigus and its variants. The pathophysiology of each condition is incompletely understood but broadly involves the formation of autoantibodies targeting skin adhesion proteins, a process that relies on a complex interplay between a dysregulated immune system, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors. We review the impact of nutrition on pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment of various autoimmune bullous diseases.","['Stoj V', 'Lu J']",2022,40,2,Clin Dermatol,Stoj V and Lu J.

It clinically presents with malabsorption syndrome along with a myriad of extraintestinal manifestations such as anemia, osteoporosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, peripheral neuropathies, ataxia and cognitive impairment. Although the prevalence of these extraintestinal features range from 1 to 15% in these patients, their presence in the absence of intestinal manifestations is very rare.

34703686,Frequency of Cutaneous Disorders in Patients With Celiac Disease.,"Background and objective Celiac disease is an autoimmune multisystem disorder that is triggered by dietary gluten sensitivity in genetically susceptible individuals. It presents with extraintestinal cutaneous manifestations including dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, urticaria, and alopecia areata. Due to the insufficient availability of data, this study aimed to estimate the frequency of cutaneous manifestation in a Pakistani population with celiac disease. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2020 to July 2021, and 300 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease were enrolled in the study from the internal medicine department of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. Celiac disease was confirmed by the presence of immunoglobulin A (IgA) endomysial antibody and IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody. The presence of cutaneous manifestations was assessed with the assistance of a qualified dermatologist and noted in a self-structured questionnaire. Results Overall, the most common cutaneous manifestation was DH (16.0%), whereas the second most common cutaneous manifestation was psoriasis (13.8%). DH was most commonly found among males (18.9%), while psoriasis was more common among females (14.12%). Conclusion Among the various cutaneous presentations in patients with celiac disease, the most common dermatological manifestation was DH. Therefore, patients with cutaneous manifestations should undergo screening for celiac disease.","['Dev K', 'Rahul F', 'Makheja K', 'Kumar J', 'Ahuja V', 'Ekta F', 'Dholia S', 'Khan S', 'Talpur AS']",2021,13,9,Cureus,"Dev K, et al.

34695139,The accuracy of diagnostic indicators for coeliac disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of coeliac disease (CD) is around 1%, but diagnosis is challenged by varied presentation and non-specific symptoms and signs. This study aimed to identify diagnostic indicators that may help identify patients at a higher risk of CD in whom further testing is warranted.
METHODS: International guidance for systematic review methods were followed and the review was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020170766). Six databases were searched until April 2021. Studies investigating diagnostic indicators, such as symptoms or risk conditions, in people with and without CD were eligible for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Summary sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were estimated for each diagnostic indicator by fitting bivariate random effects meta-analyses.
FINDINGS: 191 studies reporting on 26 diagnostic indicators were included in the meta-analyses. We found large variation in diagnostic accuracy estimates between studies and most studies were at high risk of bias. We found strong evidence that people with dermatitis herpetiformis, migraine, family history of CD, HLA DQ2/8 risk genotype, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis, or chronic liver disease are more likely than the general population to have CD. Symptoms, psoriasis, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, fractures, type 2 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis showed poor diagnostic ability. A sensitivity analysis revealed a 3-fold higher risk of CD in first-degree relatives of CD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted testing of individuals with dermatitis herpetiformis, migraine, family history of CD, HLA DQ2/8 risk genotype, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis, or chronic liver disease could improve case-finding for CD, therefore expediting appropriate treatment and reducing adverse consequences. Migraine and chronic liver disease are not yet included as a risk factor in all CD guidelines, but it may be appropriate for these to be added. Future research should establish the diagnostic value of combining indicators.","['Elwenspoek MMC', 'Jackson J', ""O'Donnell R"", 'Sinobas A', 'Dawson S', 'Everitt H', 'Gillett P', 'Hay AD', 'Lane DL', 'Mallett S', 'Robins G', 'Watson JC', 'Jones HE', 'Whiting P']",2021,16,10,PLoS One,"Elwenspoek MMC, et al.

34684612,Skin Manifestations and Coeliac Disease in Paediatric Population.,"Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy caused by gluten ingestion, affecting approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Extraintestinal symptoms may be present as the first signs of CD, years before the CD diagnosis is made. A great variety of extraintestinal manifestations may be associated with CD. Cutaneous manifestations represent the main extraintestinal manifestations, with dermatitis herpetiformis being the most common in patients with CD. In adults, it has been demonstrated that the role of a gluten-free diet is crucial not only for the recovery of signs and symptoms associated with CD but also for cutaneous manifestations, which often improve after gluten avoidance. In children with CD, the association with skin disorders is well documented regarding dermatitis herpetiformis, but studies considering other dermatological conditions, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, are few. The prevalence and manifestations of dermatological disorders in celiac children are often different from those in adults, explaining the gap between these populations. In addition, the therapeutic role of a gluten-free diet in the improvement in skin alterations is not fully understood in children and in adult population except for dermatitis herpetiformis. Therefore, cutaneous CD symptoms need to be known and recognized by physicians despite their specialties to improve early CD diagnosis, which is critical for a better prognosis. This review describes the current scientific evidence on skin manifestations associated with CD in the pediatric population.","['Persechino F', 'Galli G', 'Persechino S', 'Valitutti F', 'Zenzeri L', 'Mauro A', 'Corleto VD', 'Parisi P', 'Ziparo C', 'Evangelisti M', 'Quatrale G', 'Di Nardo G']",2021,13,10,Nutrients,"Persechino F, et al.

34613346,Assessment of Clinical and Laboratory Use of the Cutaneous Direct Immunofluorescence Assay.,"IMPORTANCE: Dermatologists submit direct immunofluorescence (DIF) biopsies on a daily basis, using an assay detecting immunoreactant deposition with a panel that has traditionally comprised immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, IgM, C3, and fibrin, with or without albumin antibodies.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the frequency of immunoreactants in DIF biopsies submitted over an 8-year period and assess use by dermatologists based on clinical impression.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A quality improvement study was conducted in a community outreach reference laboratory associated with a large academic medical center. Results of 2050 consecutive DIF skin biopsies submitted to the laboratory between April 1, 2012, and June 12, 2020, were analyzed by final pathologic diagnosis and antibody subtype positivity, in comparison with clinical impression. Biopsies in which the submitting physician had not performed the biopsy were excluded.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Histopathologic findings and the results of DIF biopsies using the standard 6-antibody panel were evaluated in correlation with the submitted clinical diagnosis to assess immunoreactivity of the assay.
RESULTS: Of 2050 DIF biopsies submitted, 367 (17.9%) were positive; IgG, IgA, and C3 alone identified all primary immunobullous disease cases (pemphigoid, pemphigus, linear IgA, and dermatitis herpetiformis), and IgA, C3, and fibrin antibodies alone identified all vasculitis cases. A panel of IgG, IgA, IgM, and fibrin identified all cases of lupus erythematosus. DIF results were positive in less than half of cases of hematoxylin and eosin biopsy-confirmed lupus erythematosus (23 of 47 [49%]). A total of 247 biopsies were submitted for clinical diagnoses not optimally supported on DIF: lichen planus, porphyria, and connective tissue disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that there is a knowledge gap among dermatologists relating to the opportunity for high-value, cost-conscious use of DIF. The practice of reflexive antibody testing using a 6-antibody panel for all DIF biopsies is likely unnecessary. DIF protocols tailored to the clinical diagnosis may enhance cost-effectiveness without loss of test sensitivity or specificity.","['Reimann JDR', 'Moynihan SP', 'Horn TD']",2021,157,11,JAMA Dermatol,"Reimann JDR, et al.

34577605,Clinical Application of Pharmacogenetic Markers in the Treatment of Dermatologic Pathologies.,"Dermatologic pathologies are the fourth most common cause of non-fatal disease worldwide; however, they produce a psychosocial, economic, and occupational impact equal to or greater than other chronic conditions. The most prevalent are actinic keratosis, followed by basal-cell carcinoma, in a lesser proportion acne vulgaris, psoriasis, and hidradenitis suppurativa, among others, and more rarely dermatitis herpetiformis. To treat actinic keratosis and basal-cell carcinoma, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 0.5% is administered topically with good results, although in certain patients it produces severe toxicity. On the other hand, dapsone is a drug commonly used in inflammatory skin conditions such as dermatitis herpetiformis; however, it occasionally causes hemolytic anemia. Additionally, biologic drugs indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa have proved to be effective and safe; nevertheless, a small percentage of patients do not respond to treatment with biologics in the long term or they are ineffective. This interindividual variability in response may be due to alterations in genes that encode proteins involved in the pathologic environment of the disease or the mechanism of action of the medication. Pharmacogenetics studies the relationship between genetic variations and drug response, which is useful for the early identification of non-responsive patients and those with a higher risk of developing toxicity upon treatment. This review describes the pharmacogenetic recommendations with the strongest evidence at present for the treatments used in dermatology, highlighting those included in clinical practice guides. Currently, we could only find pharmacogenetic clinical guidelines for 5-FU. However, the summary of product characteristics for dapsone contains a pharmacogenetic recommendation from the United States Food and Drug Administration. Finally, there is an enormous amount of information from pharmacogenetic studies in patients with dermatologic pathologies (mainly psoriasis) treated with biologic therapies, but they need to be validated in order to be included in clinical practice guides.","['Membrive Jiménez C', 'Pérez Ramírez C', 'Sánchez Martín A', 'Vieira Maroun S', 'Arias Santiago S', 'Ramírez Tortosa MC', 'Jiménez Morales A']",2021,14,9,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Membrive Jiménez C, et al.

34564936,Role of nutritional supplements in selected dermatological disorders: A review.,"BACKGROUND: While a plethora of literature continues to be published on the role of nutritional agents both in lay press and indexed journals, the data is not on a firm footing and leaves the dermatologist in a quandry and the patient confused. The various agents include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, antioxidants, diets & gluten. A proper knowledge of the role of nutritional supplements in dermatological diseases can be a useful tool in advising the patients and in certain cases ameliorating the disorder.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Literature review of last 15 years was made using the terms ""diet in dermatology,"" ""nutrition and skin,"" ""nutritional supplements in dermatology,"" ""nutritional agents and acne,"" ""nutritional agents and alopecia,"" and ""nutritional agents and psoriasis.""
RESULTS: While there are multiple publications on the use of nutritional supplements for amelioration of skin diseases, most of them are based on either associations or in vitro studies, but very few transcend the rigors of a clinical trial or the holey grail of a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. There seem to be some evidence in acne, psoriasis, telogen effluvium, urticaria & vitiligo. Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis have a strong link with diet. Rosacea has a strong link with certain foods, but the other disorders like melasma, aphthous stomatitis do not have any scientifically validated association with diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Our updated review examines the role of nutritional supplements and antioxidants in various dermatological disorders. We have found that there are varying levels of evidence with notable associations of low glycemic diet & acne, fish oil & weight loss with psoriasis, fish oils & probiotics with atopic dermatitis & vitamins & botanical extracts with vitiligo. The evidence for diet and nutrition in bullous disorders and photoageing is scarce. The role of low histamine diet in urticaria is useful in select cases of episodic urticaria. Rosacea is triggered by hot and spicy food . Apart from gluten and Dermatitis Herpetiformis, no diet can be considered disease modifying in our reveiw. The lack of comparison of nutritional or dietary modiffication with conventional validated agents, makes the data difficult to translate in real world patient management.","['Sardana K', 'Sachdeva S']",2022,21,1,J Cosmet Dermatol,Sardana K and Sachdeva S.

34490466,Persistent Skin Symptoms after Diagnosis and on a Long-term Gluten-free Diet in Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease treated with a gluten-free diet. However, the itching and blistering rash alleviates slowly after gluten withdrawal and occasionally persists despite a long-term gluten-free diet. This study investigated the prevalence and factors associated with prolonged (i.e. >2 years) and ongoing skin symptoms in 237 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Data were gathered from medical records and via questionnaires. Among patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, 38% had prolonged symptoms after diagnosis, and 14% had ongoing skin symptoms at follow-up (median duration of gluten-free diet 24 years). A severe rash at diagnosis was associated with both prolonged and ongoing cutaneous symptoms. In addition, patients with dermatitis herpetiformis with ongoing skin symptoms at follow-up had been on the dietary treatment for a shorter time (median duration 16 vs 25 years) and were less often on a strict diet (53% vs 78%) compared with patients with dermatitis herpetiformis without ongoing skin symptoms.","['Pasternack C', 'Hervonen K', 'Mansikka E', 'Reunala T', 'Collin P', 'Kaukinen K', 'Salmi T']",2021,101,9,Acta Derm Venereol,"Pasternack C, et al.

34477081,A Case of Possible Concurrence of Dermatitis Herpetiformis and Linear Immunoglobulin A / Immunoglobulin G Bullous Dermatosis.,"Dear Editor, Linear immunoglobulin (Ig) A bullous dermatosis (LABD), one subtype of subepidermal autoimmune bullous skin diseases (AIBDs), is characterized by linear deposit of only IgA along the basement membrane zone (BMZ) on direct immunofluorescence (DIF) (1,2). Patients showing linear deposits of both IgA and IgG are diagnosed with linear IgA/IgG bullous dermatosis (LAGBD) (3,4). Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is another type of subepidermal AIBD characterized by clinically pruritic erythematous skin lesions with vesicles on the elbows, knees, and buttocks with granular IgA deposits of IgA by DIF (5). In this study, we report a Japanese case of a patient who showed possible concurrence of DH and LAGBD based on clinical, histological, and immunological findings. A 72-year-old Japanese man who had a past history of dyslipidemia and resected lung cancer but was not taking any medicines, presented with a one-year history of blistering skin lesions. Physical examination revealed erythemas and peripherally arranged vesicles and erosions on the bilateral elbows, knees, and the buttock (Figure 1, a-c). Mucous membranes were not involved. The results of all laboratory tests were within normal ranges, except for increased serum IgA level 351 mg/dL (normal ranges; 46-260 mg/dL). Skin biopsy histopathologically showed subepidermal blisters infiltrated with neutrophils and eosinophils (Figure 1, d). DIF showed deposits of IgG, IgA, and complement component 3 along the BMZ mainly in granular but partially in a linear pattern (Figure 1, e-g). Circulating IgG (Figure 1, h) and IgA (Figure 1, i) autoantibodies were not detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) of normal skin, however, circulating IgA (Figure 1, j) but not IgG (Figure 1, k) antibodies were bound to both the epidermal and dermal sides by IIF of 1M NaCl-split normal skin. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for BP180 NC16a domain, BP230, and type Vll collagen (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), showed negative results for both IgG and IgA antibodies. IgG in-house ELISA for full length BP180 was also negative. IgG and IgA immunoblotting analyses of different antigen sources, including normal human epidermal and dermal extracts, recombinant proteins of NC16a, and C-terminal domains of BP180 region, BP230, purified laminin 332, and concentrated culture supernatant of HaCaT cells for LAD-1, were all negative. IgA ELISAs of tissue- and epidermal-transglutaminases were negative (1.92 AU/mL and 20.98 AU/mL, respectively; normal range <22.0 AU/mL). The patient was successfully treated with only topical corticosteroids with occasional mild local relapses. Japanese DH is different from European DH in some respects, i.e., DH is very rare in Japan due to genetic/HLA difference, absence of celiac disease, and frequent fibrillar IgA deposition in DIF. Therefore, we believe that this case is interesting as a rare Japanese DH case with complicated conditions. The clinical and immunochemical characteristics in the present case were compatible for both DH and LAGBD. Clinical features of vesicles on erythemas on the knees and buttock suggested DH, while histopathological features were compatible with LAGBD but also with DH, DIF results suggested both LAGBD and DH, and the results of IIF of 1M NaCl-split skin suggested LAGBD. All biochemical studies for autoantigens were negative, which suggested DH. However, autoantigens are not clearly detected in many LAGBD cases, either. IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase antibody, a DH marker, was negative, but the titer was relatively high but within normal range. Therefore, we considered that this case might have developed DH and LAGBD concurrently. However, there may be two other possibilities: [1] this case was DH and non-pathogenic circulating autoantibodies were secondary production, and [2] LAGBD cases may sometimes show granular-linear BMZ deposition of IgG and IgA.

34441348,Evaluation of a Bi-Analyte Immunoblot as a Useful Tool for Diagnosing Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"Immune responses to tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and nonapeptides of gliadin (npG) are associated with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a gluten-related dermatosis. Recently, a bi-analyte immunoblot (b-aIB) was introduced to detect IgA antibodies in response to tTG and npG. We compared the utility of ELISA and b-aIB with tTG in serological diagnoses of DH and their agreement with direct immunofluorescence (DIF). In total, 55 sera (27 DIF-positive DH patients, 4 DIF-negative DH patients and 24 healthy controls) were examined. ELISA for anti-tTG IgA, b-aIB for anti-npG and anti-tTG IgA, and statistical analysis were performed. The b-aIB with tTG showed 78% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, and 82% negative predictive value in relation to ELISA. A better rate of agreement (Cohen's kappa values) in IgA detection was observed in the pair tTG ELISA and b-aIB with npG (0.85) than in pairs tTG ELISA and b-aIB with tTG (0.78) or b-aIB with tTG and b-aIB with npG (0.78). No degree of agreement was found between serological tests and DIF. Both serological tests may be used to detect the anti-tTG IgA in DH patients. Still, DH diagnosing requires careful consideration of clinical data as well as results of tissue imaging (crucial DIF) and immunoserological techniques detecting DH-type features.","['Gornowicz-Porowska J', 'Seraszek-Jaros A', 'Jałowska M', 'Bowszyc-Dmochowska M', 'Kaczmarek E', 'Dmochowski M']",2021,11,8,Diagnostics (Basel),"Gornowicz-Porowska J, et al.

34441049,"Dermatitis Herpetiformis: An Update on Diagnosis, Disease Monitoring, and Management.","Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), Duhring disease, is caused by gluten sensitivity and affects 11.2 to 75.3 per 100,000 people in the United States and Europe with an incidence of 0.4 to 3.5 per 100,000 people per year. DH is characterized by a symmetrical blistering rash on the extensor surfaces with severe pruritus. The diagnosis continues to be made primarily by pathognomonic findings on histopathology, especially direct immunofluorescence (DIF). Recently, anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) antibodies have shown to be a primary diagnostic serology, while anti-tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and other autoantibodies may be used to support the diagnosis and for disease monitoring. Newly diagnosed patients with DH should be screened and assessed for associated diseases and complications. A gluten-free diet (GFD) and dapsone are still mainstays of treatment, but other medications may be necessary for recalcitrant cases. Well-controlled DH patients, managed by a dermatologist, a gastroenterologist, and a dietician, have an excellent prognosis. Our review comprehensively details the current diagnostic methods, as well as methods used to monitor its disease course.

34391330,Significant improvement of dermatitis herpetiformis with tofacitinib.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder in which patients with celiac disease, a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, present with a severely pruritic papulovesicular eruption over extensor surfaces such as the knees, elbows, lower back, buttocks, and neck. Patients are instructed to adhere to a gluten-free diet for purposes of improving their skin disease and gluten-sensitive enteropathy; this is the only treatment that lowers risk of enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. Patients who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet often have remission of their skin disease over months to years. Dapsone is a rapid and extremely effective first-line treatment option and often used while transitioning to a gluten-free diet. Aside from gluten-free diet and dapsone, second-line treatment options include sulfapyridine, sulfasalazine, and colchicine. Some patients have difficulty adhering to a gluten-free diet or develop intolerable side effects to systemic therapies. Furthermore, there is limited data on the use of the second-line treatments. Recent studies have shed light on the role of JAK-STAT-dependent pathways in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis. We present a patient treated with tofacitinib, 5mg twice daily, an oral JAK1/3 inhibitor, who demonstrated clinical improvement of DH and control of new lesion development.","['Kahn JS', 'Moody K', 'Rosmarin D']",2021,27,7,Dermatol Online J,"Kahn JS, et al.

34255799,The epidemiology of autoimmune bullous diseases in Sudan between 2000 and 2016.,"OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune bullous diseases vary in their clinico-epidemiological features and burden across populations. Data about these diseases was lacking in Sudan. We aimed to describe the epidemiological profile and to estimate the burden of autoimmune bullous diseases in Sudan.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at Khartoum Dermatological and Venereal Diseases Teaching Hospital. We used routinely collected health care data, and included all patients with an autoimmune bullous disease who presented to the hospital between 2001 and 2016.
RESULTS: Out of the 4736 patients who were admitted to the hospital during the study period, 923 (19.5%) had an autoimmune bullous disease. The average rate of patients at the hospital was 57.7 per year representing 1.3 per 100,000 population per year. After exclusion of patients where the final diagnosis was missing, 585 were included in the further analysis. Pemphigus vulgaris was the most common disease (50.9%), followed by bullous pemphigoid (28.2%), linear IgA disease/chronic bullous disease of childhood (8.4%), and pemphigus foliaceous (8.2%). Pemphigoid gestationis and IgA pemphigus constituted 1.4% and 1.2% of the cohort, respectively. Paraneoplastic pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, lichen planus pemphigoidis, bullous systemic lupus erythematosus, and dermatitis herpetiformis were rare. None of the patients had epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinico-epidemiological characteristics vary among the types of autoimmune bullous diseases. Females were more predominant in most of them. Sudanese patients tended in general to present at a younger age than other populations. The pool of Sudanese patients with autoimmune bullous diseases is large which requires investigation for the local risk factors and presents a field for future trials.","['Siddig O', 'Mustafa MB', 'Kordofani Y', 'Gibson J', 'Suleiman AM']",2021,16,7,PLoS One,"Siddig O, et al.

34252043,[The many-faced gluten sensitivity: Gluten-induced autoimmunity from dermatological point of view].,"Összefoglaló. A glutén, alimentáris környezeti antigénként, különböző szervrendszereket érintő autoimmun betegségeket tud kiváltani. A kórképek hátterében a gluténtolerancia veleszületett hiánya vagy az élet során bekövetkező elvesztése áll. A gluténindukált autoimmun betegségek között a leggyakoribb a coeliakia, melyet különböző súlyosságú enteropátia jellemez, és melynek a szöveti, 2-es típusú transzglutamináz az autoantigénje. A coeliakia extraintestinalis tünetei között azonban néha olyan bőr- és idegrendszeri kórképek jellegzetességei is megtalálhatók, melyek hátterében további transzglutamináz-autoimmunitás kialakulása áll. Idesorolható a hevesen viszkető, polimorf autoimmun bőrbetegség, a dermatitis herpetiformis (transzglutamináz-3-autoimmunitás) és a centrális és/vagy perifériás neurológiai károsodások egy jellegzetes csoportja (transzglutamináz-6-autoimmunitás). Az indukált autoimmunitás reverzibilis, a szigorúan tartott gluténmentes diéta mellett a coeliakia és a bőrtünetek elmúlnak, de az idegrendszeri tünetek egy része maradandó. Az elmúlt évtizedben beszámoltak gluténérzékeny, transzglutamináz-6-pozitív, nem coeliakiás (transzglutamináz-2-negatív) betegekről is. A gluténszenzitivitás sokféle megjelenését ma is erősen kutatják. Fontos a korai felismerés és a kórképek interdiszciplináris szemléletű kezelése. A coeliakia családi szűrővizsgálatokkal való korai felismerése és a tünetmentes egyének diétás kezelése is nagy jelentőségű a gluténérzékenység által kiváltott hiányállapotok és a társuló egyéb betegségek kialakulásának megelőzésében. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(28): 1107-1118. Summary. Autoimmune diseases induced by digestion of gluten, an environmental antigen, can affect different organ systems. The diseases develop in individuals with congenital or acquired loss of gluten tolerance for life. Amongst the gluten-induced autoimmune diseases, celiac disease is the most common one, characterized by an enteropathy of varying severity. Here the target autoantigen is tissue (type 2) transglutaminase. While the extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease are complex, they may include characteristics of certain skin and nervous system disorders that develop due to additional transglutaminase autoimmunities. Such diseases are the severely pruritic, polymorphic autoimmune skin disease, dermatitis herpetiformis due to epidermal (type 3) transglutaminase autoimmunity, and a distinctive group of gluten-sensitive neuropathies with central and/or peripheral neurological involvement caused by type 6 transglutaminase autoimmunity. While the celiac and skin autoimmune diseases gradually get into remission under a strict gluten-free diet, some neurological symptoms may persist. In the last decade, gluten-induced transglutaminase 6 positive but non-celiac (transglutaminase 2 negative) patients were reported. Today, various manifestations of gluten sensitivity are under extensive research. Early detection and interdisciplinary treatment of these disorders are important. Family screenings are of particular relevance in early recognition and dietary treatment of latent disease forms in order to prevent enteropathy-induced, malabsorption-related and other associated co-morbidities.

34235011,Morphological Spectrum of Vesiculobullous Skin Lesions: An Institutional Perspective.,"Introduction A vesiculobullous lesion of the skin encompasses a group of dermatological disorders with protean clinicopathological features. They usually occur as a part of the spectrum of various infectious, inflammatory, drug-induced, genetic, and autoimmune disorders. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of these lesions is essential for appropriate management and to reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. The conventional skin punch biopsy is the mainstay in the diagnosis of dermatological diseases, especially when combined with confirmatory tests, such as direct immunofluorescence (DIF). Our study evaluated the clinicopathological spectrum of vesiculobullous lesions. Methods We studied 150 cases of vesiculobullous lesions at the Department of Histopathology, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College Karachi, Pakistan. Written and informed consent was taken from the patients followed by skin punch procedure in which three biopsies were obtained, which included one biopsy from the lesion and two peri-lesional biopsies. One peri-lesional biopsy was sent in cryomatrix for DIF studies, whereas the other two were sent in formalin to follow the standard tissue-processing protocol. Results Our results showed that most patients belonged to the geriatric age group of more than 50 years (44.7%), and 54.7% of the patients were females. Total 74.7% of the patients had generalized lesions, followed by lower limbs (9.3%) and trunk (7.3%) involvement. Most patients were diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid (31.3%), followed by pemphigus vulgaris (27.3%), dermatitis herpetiformis (15.3%), Darier's disease (14.7%), pemphigus foliaceus (4.7%), epidermolysis bullosa (2%), linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis (2%), paraneoplastic pemphigus (0.7%), and drug reactions (0.7%). DIF studies were applied on 60 cases, out of which complement protein C3c was the most commonly deposited protein (53.3%). Conclusion Our study emphasized the diagnostic role of skin punch biopsy in the proper evaluation of vesiculobullous skin lesions. Histopathology is the cornerstone diagnostic tool in this regard, with DIF being a useful adjunct.","['Ali J', 'Islam S', 'Ali SM', 'Yaqeen SR', 'Aslam A', 'Khan QUA', 'Malik UA', 'Irfan M', 'Naqvi H', 'Hashmi AA']",2021,13,5,Cureus,"Ali J, et al.

34212363,Could it be gluten? Additional skin conditions associated with celiac disease.,"Celiac disease is a multifactorial, inflammatory disorder initiated and sustained by the ingestion of gluten. Occurring across a broad population, the intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease are variable in severity and may be nonspecific in presentation. Given that environmental, genetic, and immune factors involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease that the digestive tract and skin share many characteristics, and with a prevalence of 0.5-1% in most populations, it is reasonable to consider varying presentations of skin conditions that are linked with celiac disease. The association between celiac disease and skin conditions has been discussed earlier, but new studies have emerged suggesting cutaneous involvement in addition to dermatitis herpetiformis. We review the current literature identifying the relationship and potential mechanisms between celiac disease and various skin conditions.","['Klemm N', 'Gooderham MJ', 'Papp K']",2022,61,1,Int J Dermatol,"Klemm N, et al.

34145701,Therapeutic approaches and targets for treatment of autoimmune bullous diseases.,"Autoimmune bullous diseases are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by the development of cutaneous and mucosal vesicles, blisters, and finally erosions. The common pathogenetic mechanism is the presence of autoantibodies targeting structural proteins of the skin and mucous membranes (demosomes and hemidesmosomes): in the case of pemphigus, the antigens are intraepidermal, whereas in the case of pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita they are subepidermal. Mucosal involvement typically affects the oral and ocular mucosa, but in some cases, the upper airways or the upper digestive tract are affected. The burden on patients' lives could be severe due to the impairment of normal feeding or breathing. In other cases, they may represent paraneoplastic syndromes. Since autoimmune bullous diseases may result in significant morbidity and mortality, depending on the grade of cutaneous and mucosal involvement, a prompt therapeutic approach is mandatory and, in recalcitrant cases, may be challenging. The first line therapy consists of corticosteroids, both topical and systemic. Once remission or control of the acute phase is obtained, adjuvant therapies need to be introduced in order to spare the corticosteroid load and minimize side effects such as iatrogenic diabetes or osteoporosis. Herein, we describe all current therapeutic approaches to autoimmune bullous diseases, also including emerging therapies.","['Bardazzi F', 'Loi C', 'Chessa Marco A', 'Di Altobrando A', 'Filippi F', 'Lacava R', 'Viviani F', 'Balestri R', 'Leuzzi M', 'Sacchelli L']",2021,34,5,Dermatol Ther,"Bardazzi F, et al.

25905277,Osteoporosis: Clinical Evaluation,"None: The identification of a patient at high risk of fracture should be followed by evaluation for factors contributing to low bone mass, skeletal fragility, falls, and fractures. Components of the evaluation include a bone density test, osteoporosis-directed medical history and physical exam, laboratory studies, and possibly skeletal imaging. A bone density test with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) helps with diagnostic classification, assessment of fracture risk, and provides a baseline for monitoring the skeletal effects of treatment. FRAX is a fracture risk algorithm that includes input of femoral neck bone mineral density measured by DXA. The DXA T-score, prior fracture history, and FRAX estimation of fracture risk are used with clinical practice guidelines to determine whether treatment is indicated. The medical history may reveal underlying causes of osteoporosis (e.g., nutritional deficiencies, gastric surgery, medications with adverse skeletal effects) and important risk factors for fracture (e.g., past history of fracture, family history of osteoporosis, or recent falls). Physical exam may show skeletal deformities due to unrecognized fractures (e.g., loss of height, kyphosis, or diminished rib-pelvis space), identify possible secondary causes of skeletal fragility (e.g., blue sclera with osteogenesis imperfecta, urticarial pigmentosa with systemic mastocytosis, dermatitis herpetiformis with celiac disease, or bone tenderness with osteomalacia), and help to recognize patients with poor balance and frailty that might lead to falls. Laboratory studies may show potentially reversible abnormalities (e.g., vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, or impaired kidney function) that must be assessed and corrected, if possible, before starting pharmacological therapy. Disorders other than osteoporosis, requiring other types of treatment, may be found; for example, low serum alkaline phosphatase suggests hypophosphatasia, M-component may be due to myeloma, or hypocalciuria due to celiac disease. There are important safety considerations that can be derived from a pre-treatment assessment, as well. A patient with a blood clotting disorder should not be treated with raloxifene, a history of esophageal stricture is a contraindication for oral bisphosphonates, and previous skeletal radiation therapy precludes treatment with teriparatide or abaloparatide. Skeletal imaging may be helpful when a fracture, malignancy, or Paget’s disease of bone is suspected. Bone biopsy is rarely performed in clinical practice, but may be helpful in some situations, such as when it is necessary to determine the underlying bone disease in a patient with severe chronic kidney disease.

METHODS: The guidelines were created by small subgroups of a guideline committee consisting of 26 specialists from various medical fields and one patients' representative. The members of the committee then discussed the guidelines and voted for the final version at two consensus meetings. The guidelines were developed under the support of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) and in collaboration with the European Dermatology Forum (EDF).
RESULTS: The guidelines summarize evidence-based and expert-based recommendations (S2 level) for the management of DH (see Appendix).

33959126,T Cell Response Toward Tissue-and Epidermal-Transglutaminases in Coeliac Disease Patients Developing Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"The reason why only few coeliac patients develop the cutaneous manifestation of the disease, named dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), is still unknown. Epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) has been described as the main autoantigen of humoral immunity in DH but the mechanisms leading to this autoimmune response remain obscure. Here we characterized T cells from skin, gut and peripheral blood of DH and coeliac disease (CD) patients, evaluated the impact of the gluten-free diet on circulating T lymphocytes' phenotype and investigated antigen specific T cell response toward epidermal and tissue transglutaminase (TG2). DH patients showed an increased frequency of skin-derived T cells producing TNFα when compared to CD patients. Moreover, circulating T cells producing TNFα and IL-17A positively correlated with clinical score of skin disease activity and decreased after gluten-free diet. Finally, TG2 and TG3-specific T cells resulted more reactive to antigens stimulation in DH patients and showed cross reactivity toward the two autoantigens in both the group of patients. Our data suggest a role of TNFα and IL-17A producing cells in the development of DH and, for the first time, show the existence of a crossed T cell response toward the two transglutaminases isoforms, thus suggesting new insights on T cells role in skin damage.","['Caproni M', 'Capone M', 'Rossi MC', 'Santarlasci V', 'Maggi L', 'Mazzoni A', 'Rossettini B', 'Renzi D', 'Quintarelli L', 'Bianchi B', 'Ninci A', 'Lami G', 'Calabrò A', 'Cosmi L', 'Annunziato F', 'Liotta F']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Caproni M, et al.

33854513,Missing Insight Into T and B Cell Responses in Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous form of celiac disease manifesting as an itching rash typically on the elbows, knees and buttocks. It is driven by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals and characterized by granular deposits of immunoglobulin A in the papillary dermis. These antibodies target transglutaminase (TG) 3 and in the majority of patients they are also found in circulation. The circulating antibodies disappear and skin symptoms resolve as a result of gluten-free diet but the cutaneous anti-TG3 IgA deposits may persist for several years. In dermatitis herpetiformis, plasma cells secreting antibodies against TG3 are located in the intestinal mucosa similarly to those producing TG2 antibodies characteristic for celiac disease. In fact, both TG2- and TG3-specific plasma cells and gluten responsive T cells are found in dermatitis herpetiformis patients but the interplay between these cell populations is unknown. The small bowel mucosal damage in celiac disease is believed to be mediated by co-operation of cytotoxic intraepithelial T cells and the inflammatory milieu contributed by gluten-reactive CD4+ T cells, whereas the skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis appear to be devoid of gluten reactive T cells. Thus, how celiac disease-type intestinal T and B cell responses develop into an autoimmune condition affecting the skin is still incompletely understood. Finally, the skin and small bowel lesions may reappear upon reintroduction of gluten in patients treated with gluten-free diet but virtually nothing is known about the long-lived B cell and memory T cell populations activating in response to dietary gluten in dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Kemppainen E', 'Salmi T', 'Lindfors K']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,"Kemppainen E, et al.

Anaemia is a common finding in patients with untreated coeliac disease, but little is known about the occurrence of anaemia in those with dermatitis herpetiformis. This study investigated the prevalence of anaemia and factors associated with anaemia in 250 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, at diagnosis and one year after diagnosis. As controls, 139 patients with coeliac disease were included. Patient records were reviewed to gather baseline clinical, histological, and laboratory data. Follow-up data for patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were collected from patient records and via questionnaires or at follow-up visits. The prevalence of anaemia was 12% in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and 17% in patients with coeliac disease at diagnosis (p = 0.257). Anaemia in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was not associated with the severity of skin symptoms or small bowel damage. The prevalence of anaemia at a 1-year follow-up had increased to 19%, but it was associated mainly with dapsone treatment.","['Alakoski A', 'Pasternack C', 'Reunala T', 'Kaukinen K', 'Huhtala H', 'Mansikka E', 'Jernman J', 'Hervonen K', 'Salmi T']",2021,101,4,Acta Derm Venereol,"Alakoski A, et al.

33835002,A Case of Dapsone-induced Mild Methemoglobinemia with Dyspnea and Cyanosis.,"Dear Editor, Dapsone is a dual-function drug with antimicrobial and antiprotozoal effects and anti-inflammatory features (1). In dermatology, it is a first choice for conditions such as leprosy, IgA pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis, or an adjunctive treatment for, e.g. bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus vulgaris (1). However, dapsone is associated with some adverse effects, including methemoglobinemia (1). Methemoglobin (MetHb) concentrations of less than 15% usually cause no symptoms in patients with normal hemoglobin concentrations (2). Herein, we report the case of a patient with BP who developed dyspnea because of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia that was as mild as 4.7%. A 93-year-old man was diagnosed with BP based on skin manifestations (Figure 1, a and b), histopathological findings (Figure 1, c and d), and anti-BP180 NC16A antibody titer determined by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (279 U/mL) 3 years earlier. His comorbidities included diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure, right pleural effusion, and brain infarction. The patient had been successfully treated with oral prednisolone, so the steroid was tapered to 4 mg/day. The blisters recurred, however, and new ones kept developing even though the prednisolone was increased to 25 mg/day. Dapsone (75 mg/day) was begun as adjunctive treatment, and new blister formation ceased. At one week from dapsone initiation, the patient developed dyspnea, and his oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry decreased to 88% on room air. At presentation, his blood pressure was 118/78 mmHg, the heart rate was 95 beats/minute, and axillary temperature was 36.3 °C. Neurological examination and consciousness findings remained unchanged compared with findings before dyspnea onset. Chest examination showed normal breath and heart sounds, but lip and peripheral cyanosis was present. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 12,920/μl; red blood cells, 370×104/μl; hemoglobin, 11.7 g/dl; and CMV antigenemia (or C7-HRP), negative. Chest CT and echocardiography indicated no remarkable change compared with imaging from one year earlier. Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.454, PaO2 63.1 mmHg, PaCO2 35.4 mmHg, HCO3- 24.3 mmol/L, SaO2 92.4%, and MetHb of 4.7%. These findings indicated a saturation gap (difference between SpO2 and SaO2) induced by MetHb. Upon cessation of dapsone, MetHb levels and SpO2 returned to normal and the dyspnea resolved, implicating dapsone in the methemoglobinemia (Figure 1, e). Differential diagnoses were pulmonary disease, heart disease, neuromuscular disease, sepsis, and drug intoxication. These possibilities were ruled out by the physical examination, drug history, vital signs, blood tests, and chest CT and echocardiography. In normal individuals, MetHb levels are less than 1% (2). Healthy patients with normal hemoglobin concentrations develop cyanosis at MetHb level of 15-20%, dyspnea at 20-50%, and coma at 50-70%, and die at more than 70% (2). However, patients with hematologic disease, acidosis, or cardiopulmonary diseases, for example, present with symptoms even with MetHb levels less than 15% (2,3). We inferred that our patient presented with dyspnea even under mild methemoglobinemia because he had anemia, chronic heart failure, and right pleural effusion. The occurrence of dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia with obvious symptoms is rare (1,4). Clinicians should be aware that methemoglobinemia symptoms are influenced not only by MetHb concentrations but also by comorbidities.","['Hayama Y', 'Imanishi H', 'Yoshimoto N', 'Sugawara K', 'Tsuruta D']",2020,28,4,Acta Dermatovenerol Croat,"Hayama Y, et al.

33790758,Development of Dermatitis Herpetiformis in Chronic Plaque Psoriasis.,"Chronic plaque psoriasis is often associated with autoimmune bullous diseases. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare immunobullous disease that has been linked to celiac disease (CD). To our knowledge, the coexistence of psoriasis and DH is uncommon, and has only been described in anecdotal reports. We report a case of chronic plaque psoriasis complicated by DH in a 60-year-old patient with no known history of CD or associated symptoms. In our patient, DH presented atypically as multiple vesicles along the edges of psoriatic plaques located on the back and hips, and as vesiculobullous eruptions on the fingers. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of dapsone and a gluten-free diet for DH, and secukinumab for psoriasis. This case highlights the importance of screening for CD in patients with psoriasis, as well as other concomitant autoimmune diseases. A gluten-free diet should be trialled in psoriatic patients with positive CD serology.","['Lee R', 'Lobo Y', 'Spelman L']",2021,13,1,Case Rep Dermatol,"Lee R, et al.

33739792,EBV-positive Mucocutaneous Ulcer With Small Lymphocytic Infiltration Mimicking Nonspecific Ulceration.,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorder may resemble nonspecific inflammation. We report 3 cases of immunosuppressed adult patients with small lymphocytic EBV ulcers in the skin and oral mucosa, characterized by a lack of atypical lymphocytic infiltration. All 3 cases were diagnosed in routine practice. For comparisons, cases of conventional Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU) were reviewed which were extracted from our pathology archives (n=11). The present patients were 2 females and 1 male, aged above 70 years. The primary disease was rheumatoid arthritis (n=2) and dermatitis herpetiformis (n=1). The main source of immunosuppression was prednisolone (n=2) and methotrexate (n=1). The ulcers were located in the oral cavity, buttock, and/or external genitalia. Histology evaluation revealed nonspecific lymphocytic infiltration. Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER)-positive cells were small and coexpressed CD20. The number of EBER-positive cells ranged from 52 to 132/HPF, which was within the range of that observed in the reviewed conventional EBVMCUs (range, 48 to 1328; median, 121). All 3 cases regressed spontaneously or by the reduction of immunosuppressants. Although the present cases lacked cytologic atypia, those clinical course and loads of EBER-positive cells (>50/HPF) suggested EBV involvement. Current cases of EBVMCU with small lymphocytic infiltration underscore the need for EBER in situ hybridization when an etiology of ulcer with predominant lymphocytes in an immunosuppressed patient is unclear.","['Fujimoto M', 'Kaku Y', 'Hirata M', 'Usui S', 'Yamada Y', 'Haga H']",2021,45,5,Am J Surg Pathol,"Fujimoto M, et al.

Acquired tense acral bullae and fixed urticarial annular lesions on the trunk are diagnostic clues of infantile BP. Diagnosis is supported by immunosorbent assay (IgG anti-BP180 and BP230) and direct immunofluorescence (linear deposition of IgG at the dermo-epidermal junction). Topical and/or systemic corticosteroids are the first-line treatment. The prognosis is good with a self-limited clinical course. Differential diagnoses include impetigo and other bullous diseases in children, such as dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis and erythema multiforme.

33669324,Research Supporting a Pilot Study of Metronomic Dapsone during Glioblastoma Chemoirradiation.,"This short note presents previous research data supporting a pilot study of metronomic dapsone during the entire course of glioblastoma treatment. The reviewed data indicate that neutrophils are an integral part of human glioblastoma pathophysiology, contributing to or facilitating glioblastoma growth and treatment resistance. Neutrophils collect within glioblastoma by chemotaxis along several chemokine/cytokine gradients, prominently among which is interleukin-8. Old data from dermatology research has shown that the old and inexpensive generic drug dapsone inhibits neutrophils' chemotaxis along interleukin-8 gradients. It is on that basis that dapsone is used to treat neutrophilic dermatoses, for example, dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid, erlotinib-related rash, and others. The hypothesis of this paper is that dapsone will reduce glioblastomas' neutrophil accumulations by the same mechanisms by which it reduces dermal neutrophil accumulations in the neutrophilic dermatoses. Dapsone would thereby reduce neutrophils' contributions to glioblastoma growth. Dapsone is not an ideal drug, however. It generates methemoglobinemia that occasionally is symptomatic. This generation is reduced by concomitant use of the antacid drug cimetidine. Given the uniform lethality of glioblastoma as of 2020, the risks of dapsone 100 mg twice daily and cimetidine 400 mg twice daily is low enough to warrant a judicious pilot study.",['Kast RE'],2021,9,1,Med Sci (Basel),Kast RE.

There was a greater delay (54 months) in establishing the diagnosis in those with atypical coeliac disease (p < 0.001). No difference was observed in the mode of delivery or duration of breast feeding, but significant difference was observed between gestational age at birth (p < 0.001). Most cases showed stunted growth and underweight. Irritability, anaemia, rickets, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia and intussusception were other common predictors of atypical coeliac disease. Because of a myriad spectrum of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, at any age with diverse presentation, a high index of suspicion is therefore required.","['Lomash A', 'Venkatakrishnan A', 'Bothra M', 'Dhingra B', 'Kumar P', 'Kapoor S']",2021,51,3,Trop Doct,"Lomash A, et al.

33432477,Dermatitis Herpetiformis: An Update on Diagnosis and Management.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), presenting with an intense itch and blistering symmetrical rash, typically on the elbows, knees, and buttocks, is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Though overt gastrointestinal symptoms are rare, three-fourths of patients with DH have villous atrophy in the small bowel, and the rest have celiac-type inflammatory changes. DH affects mostly adults and slightly more males than females. The mean age at onset is about 50 years. DH diagnosis is confirmed by showing granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the papillary dermis. The DH autoantigen, transglutaminase 3, is deposited at the same site in tightly bound immune complexes. At present, the DH-to-celiac disease prevalence is 1:8. The incidence of DH is decreasing, whereas that of celiac disease is increasing, probably because of improved diagnostics. In DH, the treatment of choice for all patients is a gluten-free diet (GFD) in which uncontaminated oats are allowed. At onset, most patients need additional dapsone to rapidly control the rash and itching. Dapsone can be stopped after a mean of 2 years, and a strict lifelong GFD alone is required. Dietary adherence offers an excellent long-term prognosis for patients with DH, with a normal quality of life and all-cause mortality.","['Reunala T', 'Hervonen K', 'Salmi T']",2021,22,3,Am J Clin Dermatol,"Reunala T, et al.

Controls included healthy volunteers and patients with both bowel symptoms and skin eruptions unrelated to coeliac disease. Clinical data and serum level of anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-epidermal transglutaminase IgA antibodies were collected from patients and controls. Granular deposits of IgA or IgA1 in the skin were found in 29 out of 45 patients with coeliac disease (64.4%), and in none of the included controls (specificity 100%; sensitivity 64.4%). Positive direct immunofluorescence correlated significantly with an increased serum level of anti-epidermal transglutaminase IgA antibodies (p < 0.005).

We aimed to determine trends and clinical predictors of long-term GFD adherence in adult CD.
METHODS: Initial and long-term (>3 years) GFD adherence, clinical characteristics at baseline and follow-up were collected retrospectively from celiac patients followed-up over 20 years (2000-2020). Predictors of long-term GFD adherence at diagnosis, and follow-up were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: 248 patients (37 ± 12 years, 186F, median time on a GFD 90 months) were included. Twenty-five (10.1%) had only short-term follow-up (<3 years) while 223 (89.9%) had initial and long-term dietary assessment. 187/223 (83.9%) patients were initially adherent and 36/223 (16.1%) were not. 17/36 (47.2%) patients initially not adherent become adherent, while only 4/187 (2.1%) initially adherent patients became not adherent. In the long-term, 200/223 (89.7%) were adherent and 21/223 (9.4%) patients were not. Adherence improved more frequently than worsened (OR, 39.5; 95% CI, 11.4-178.5; P < .01). Classical symptoms (diarrhea, weight loss) at diagnosis of CD predicted stricter long-term GFD adherence (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.21-8.81; P = .02), while anemia (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.82; P = .02) and dermatitis herpetiformis (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.91; P = .04) predicted poorer long-term adherence. At follow-up, initial GFD adherence (OR, 42.70; 95% CI, 10.70-171.00; P = .04) was the major determinant of long-term GFD adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: GFD adherence changes over time in <10% of patients, generally improving when it does. Major determinants of long-term GFD adherence are classical symptoms at diagnosis and initial adherence to a GFD. Patients with anemia or dermatitis herpetiformis at diagnosis require stricter dietetic input.","['Schiepatti A', 'Maimaris S', 'Nicolardi ML', 'Alimenti E', 'Vernero M', 'Costetti M', 'Costa S', 'Biagi F']",2022,20,4,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Schiepatti A, et al.

Autoimmune bullous lesions, may be fatal if not treated with appropriate agents. Bearing in mind, the morbidity of these diseases, it is important to establish a firm diagnosis. A diagnostic skin biopsy with immunofluorescence is frequently used to confirm a clinical diagnosis, especially where it is not apparent clinically. There are many centres in India where immunofluorescence is not available and the diagnosis in these lesions is based on clinical and histopathological features only. Here in this study, we studied 53 skin punch biopsies with clinical suspicion of vesicobullous lesions followed by histopathological examination was carried out over a period of 2 years in a Medical College in Gujarat. Lesions were categorised based on the location of the blister. 1) Suprabasal 2) subcorneal 3) and subepidermal. Further subtyping was done based on additional histopathological features and clinical correlation. All the patients responded appropriately to the treatment and the results correlated well with the immunofluorescence done in a few cases. This study lays emphasis upon the histopathology and clinical features keeping in consideration of the lack of ancillary techniques in many centres especially in the developing world.","['Garg R', 'Bhojani K']",2020,20,2,Afr Health Sci,Garg R and Bhojani K.

33144153,Risk of skin disorders in patients with celiac disease: A population-based cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Although dermatitis herpetiformis is closely associated with celiac disease (CD), data on the relationship between CD and other dermatologic disorders have been mixed. We aimed to quantify the risk of skin disorders in patients after CD diagnosis in a population-based setting.
METHODS: Using data from all 28 pathology departments in Sweden from 1969 to 2016, we identified patients with CD. Each patient was matched by age, sex, calendar year, and geographic region to up to 5 population control individuals. We calculated the risk of any skin disease and specific skin diseases using Cox proportional hazards.
RESULTS: We identified 43,300 patients with CD and 198,532 matched control individuals. After a median follow-up time of 11.4 years, the incidences of skin disease in patients with CD and control individuals were 22.6 and 14.8 per 1000 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51-1.58). Increased risks were present for eczema (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.56-1.79), psoriasis (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.43-1.68), urticaria (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.42-1.64), vitiligo (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.52-2.39), acne (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.29-1.50), and alopecia areata (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.43-2.20).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the general population, patients with CD are at increased risk of multiple common skin disorders, a risk that persists in the long term.","['Lebwohl B', 'Söderling J', 'Roelstraete B', 'Lebwohl MG', 'Green PHR', 'Ludvigsson JF']",2021,85,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Lebwohl B, et al.

33072118,Autoantibodies Against the Immunodominant Bullous Pemphigoid Epitopes Are Rare in Patients With Dermatitis Herpetiformis and Coeliac Disease.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extraintestinal manifestation of coeliac disease (CD). Patients with DH have an elevated risk of development of another autoimmune blistering skin disease, bullous pemphigoid (BP). In this study we investigated whether patients with DH and CD (mean age for both 49 years) have circulating autoantibodies against BP180, the major BP autoantigen. ELISA tests showed that only a few DH (3/46) and CD (2/43) patients had BP180-NC16A IgG autoantibodies. Immunoblotting found that more than half of the DH samples contained IgG autoantibodies against full-length BP180. Epitope mapping with 13 fusion proteins covering the BP180 polypeptide revealed that in DH and CD patients, IgG autoantibodies did not target the NC16A or other epitopes typical of BP but recognized other intracellular and mid-extracellular regions of BP180. None of the analyzed DH and CD patients with either ELISA or immunoblotting positivity had IgG or IgA reactivity against the cutaneous basement membrane in indirect immunofluorescence analysis or skin symptoms characteristic of BP. Although only a minority of middle-aged DH patients had IgG autoantibodies against the immunodominant epitopes of BP180, our results do not exclude the possibility that intermolecular epitope spreading could explain the switch from DH to BP in elderly patients.","['Nätynki A', 'Tuusa J', 'Hervonen K', 'Kaukinen K', 'Lindgren O', 'Huilaja L', 'Kokkonen N', 'Salmi T', 'Tasanen K']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"Nätynki A, et al.

33055534,Immunoglobulin and Complement Immunohistochemistry on Paraffin Sections in Autoimmune Bullous Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue has been proposed as a potential tool in the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) in lieu of standard direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy. To comprehensively determine the diagnostic accuracy of immunoglobulin and complement IHC for diagnosis of AIBDs, we conducted a systematic review and multivariate Bayesian model-based meta-analysis of the literature. Quality and heterogeneity assessment of studies was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist and the I2 index, respectively. Electronic searches using PubMed from April 1964 to July 2020 identified 14 articles meeting predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Median sensitivities with 95% credible intervals in pemphigus and pemphigoid were 0.24 (0.01-0.89) and 0.22 (0.02-0.77) with immunoglobulin G (IgG), 0.77 (0.39-0.95) and 0.25 (0.02-0.85) with IgG4, 0.11 (0.02-0.32) and 0.86 (0.56-0.98) with C3d, and 0.84 (0.56-0.97) and 0.75 (0.37-0.94) with C4d, respectively. Specificities were 1.00 (0.00-1.00) with IgG, 0.98 (0.89-1.00) with IgG4, 0.99 (0.97-1.00) with C3d, and 0.99 (0.97-1.00) with C4d. The risk of bias and heterogeneity among studies was a serious problem, decreasing the level of evidence. Our work suggests that, in selected cases, paraffin-based IHC may be a helpful procedure to screen for AIBDs, especially when specialized laboratories and/or biopsy specimens for DIF do not exist. Nevertheless, more studies with a refined quality design are needed to explore the true usefulness of this diagnostic method in AIBDs.","['Kasperkiewicz M', 'Lai O', 'Kim G', 'DeClerck B', 'Woodley DT', 'Zillikens D', 'Recke A']",2021,43,10,Am J Dermatopathol,"Kasperkiewicz M, et al.

33021479,Mast cells and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) expression positively correlates with pruritus intensity in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Pruritus is one of the leading symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), however, studies on the pathogenesis of pruritus are scarce. Currently, skin mast cells (MCs) have been indicated to play a role in pruritus in autoimmune bullous disease.
OBJECTIVE: To study the role of mast cells and related mediators involved in the pathogenesis of pruritus in DH.
MATERIALS & METHODS: The number of MCs and expression of histamine and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was investigated in lesions of 29 DH cases and 15 healthy skin donors by immunohistochemistry. Fourteen patients were assessed for severity of pruritus based on the Numeric Rating Scale and Pruritus Grading System. The levels of histamine and TSLP in the serum of 18 DH patients and 15 healthy controls were also investigated.
RESULTS: A significant increase in the number of MCs and degranulation was observed in DH lesions, which positively correlated with intensity of pruritus. In addition, skin TSLP but not histamine was shown to correlate with intensity of pruritus. No significant difference in expression of serum TSLP or histamine was observed between DH patients and healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that skin MCs and TSLP might be involved in the pathogenesis of pruritus in DH which should be further clarified in future studies.","['Xia Q', 'Liu T', 'Wang J', 'Sun L', 'Chen X', 'Liu Y', 'Lu X', 'Liu H', 'Sun Y', 'Zhang F']",2020,30,5,Eur J Dermatol,"Xia Q, et al.

32967363,TG6 Auto-Antibodies in Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extraintestinal manifestation of gluten sensitivity, in which an autoimmune response is directed against transglutaminase 3 (TG3), an epidermal transglutaminase. TG2 is the autoantigen in celiac disease (CD), defined by the presence of enteropathy, and TG6 is the autoantigen in neurological manifestations of gluten sensitivity. The interplay between B cell responses to these 3 transglutaminases in developing the clinical spectrum of disease manifestations is not completely understood. Also, the individual or combined diagnostic and predictive value of the respective autoantibodies is not fully explored. We examined the prevalence of TG6 antibodies in a cohort of patients with DH. TG6 positivity was found in 13/33 (39%), with IgA detected in 11 patients, IgG in 3, and both in 1. This was significantly higher compared to what is seen in the classic CD cases (14%) in a Finnish population.

It is common that patients associate skin conditions with their diet, and the advantages of a gluten-free diet (GFD) are brought up frequently. Indeed, there is evidence that certain dermatologic conditions can respond to a GFD, especially for those with concomitant CD and DH.

Celiac disease (CD), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), gluten ataxia (GA), wheat allergy (WA), and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are the five major GRDs that present with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of GRDs can be challenging because the typical and atypical clinical manifestations of the GRDs overlap. In this review, the current definitions of gluten-related disorders, focusing on their clinical features, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are presented. We concluded that GRDs are usually diagnosed using a combination of clinical features, serological tests, and histopathological findings.

32631499,Mechanisms of skin autoimmunity: Cellular and soluble immune components of the skin.,"Autoimmune diseases are driven by either T cells or antibodies reacting specifically to 1 or more self-antigens. Although a number of self-antigens associated with skin diseases have been identified, the causative antigen(s) remains unknown in the great majority of skin diseases suspected to be autoimmune driven. Model diseases such as pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis, and more recently psoriasis have added greatly to our understanding of skin autoimmunity. Depending on the dominant T- or B-cell phenotype, skin autoimmune diseases usually follow 1 of 6 immune response patterns: lichenoid, eczematous, bullous, psoriatic, fibrogenic, or granulomatous. Usually, skin autoimmunity develops as a consequence of several events-an altered microbiome, inherited dysfunctional immunity, antigens activating innate immunity, epigenetic modifications, sex predisposition, and impact of antigens either as neoantigen or through molecular mimicry. This review summarizes currently known antigens of skin autoimmune diseases and discusses mechanisms of skin autoimmunity.","['Gudjonsson JE', 'Kabashima K', 'Eyerich K']",2020,146,1,J Allergy Clin Immunol,"Gudjonsson JE, et al.

32618663,Overall and Cause-Specific Mortality in Adult Celiac Disease and Dermatitis Herpetiformis Diagnosed in the 21st Century.,"INTRODUCTION: We assessed whether celiac disease-associated mortality is increased in Finland among patients diagnosed in the 21st century, given recent improvements in diagnostic and treatment facilities.
METHODS: Biopsy-proven patients with celiac disease (Marsh III) and dermatitis herpetiformis aged 20-79 years (median 50 years) diagnosed 2005-2014 (n = 12,803) were identified from the national dietary grant registry. Dates and causes of death were obtained from Statistics Finland. Overall mortality and causes of death were compared with reference individuals (n = 38,384) matched for age, sex, and area of residence (at the time of celiac disease diagnosis) selected from the Population Information System.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 7.7 years (SD ±3.0 years), 884 (6.9%) and 2,613 (6.8%) deaths occurred among the celiac cohort and reference group, respectively. Overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.94-1.09), mortality from all malignancies (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.96-1.27), gastrointestinal tract malignancies (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.56-1.71), or cardiovascular diseases (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.07) were not increased among patients with celiac disease. Overall, mortality from lymphoproliferative diseases (HR 2.36, 95% CI 1.65-3.39) and nonmalignant digestive diseases (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.40-3.43) was increased, but HRs decreased after the exclusion of the first 2 years of follow-up (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.10-2.66 and HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.01-3.05, respectively).

32542511,[Modern diagnostics of autoimmune bullous diseases].,"Blisters and erosions of skin and mucous membranes are key features of the clinically heterogeneous group of autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs). These can be divided into pemphigoid diseases with autoantibodies against structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction, pemphigus diseases with autoantibodies against desmosomal proteins, and dermatitis herpetiformis with autoantibodies against transglutaminases 1 and 2. A differentiation based only on clinical features is often not sufficient. After researching the literature in PubMed, the current diagnostic tools for AIBDs are summarized.AIBD diagnostics are performed using histology, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, as well as ELISA and immunoblotting. For serological diagnosis, the conventional multistep approach or multivariant assays for the analysis of autoantibodies against several target antigens in parallel can be applied. These allow a precise classification of AIBD and therefore a tailored use of different therapeutic regimens, e.g., for bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus foliaceus/vulgaris, as well as identification of disease entities with a known association with neoplasia.Direct immunofluorescence is still the diagnostic mainstay of AIBDs. However, novel serological assays, such as target-antigen-specific ELISA or indirect immunofluorescence systems using BIOCHIP™ mosaic technology, allow serologic diagnosis in most AIBD patients and the exact classification of the disease entity at the molecular level.","['van Beek N', 'Schumacher N', 'Rose C', 'Schmidt E', 'Zillikens D']",2020,41,4,Pathologe,"van Beek N, et al.

32517378,Pitfalls in the Diagnosis of Coeliac Disease and Gluten-Related Disorders.,"The spectrum of gluten-related disorders (GRD) has emerged as a relevant phenomenon possibly impacting on health care procedures and costs worldwide. Current classification of GRD is mainly based on their pathophysiology, and the following categories can be distinguished: immune-mediated disorders that include coeliac disease (CD), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and gluten ataxia (GA); allergic reactions such as wheat allergy (WA); and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), a condition characterized by both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms subjectively believed to be induced by the ingestion of gluten/wheat that has recently gained popularity. Although CD, DH, and WA are well-defined clinical entities, whose diagnosis is based on specific diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of NCGS may on the contrary be considered only after the exclusion of other organic disorders. Neither allergic nor autoimmune mechanisms have been found to be involved in NCGS. Mistakes in the diagnosis of GRD are still a relevant clinical problem that may result in overtreatment of patients being unnecessary started on a gluten-free diet and waste of health-care resources. On the basis of our clinical experience and literature, we aim to identify the main pitfalls in the diagnosis of CD and its complications, DH, and WA. We provide a practical methodological approach to guide clinicians on how to recognize and avoid them.","['Schiepatti A', 'Savioli J', 'Vernero M', 'Borrelli de Andreis F', 'Perfetti L', 'Meriggi A', 'Biagi F']",2020,12,6,Nutrients,"Schiepatti A, et al.

32394361,Eosinophilic Dermatoses: Recognition and Management.,"Eosinophilic dermatoses encompass a broad spectrum of diseases of different etiologies hallmarked by eosinophilic infiltration of the skin and/or mucous membranes, with or without associated blood eosinophilia. The wide range of dermatological manifestations of this spectrum, including nodules and plaques, pustules, blisters, ulcers, and urticarial lesions, is reflected in a non-univocal classification system. We identified six groups of eosinophilic dermatoses based on the predominant anatomic level of involvement: (1) epidermal; (2) of the dermal-epidermal junction; (3) dermal; (4) of the hypodermis and muscle fascia; (5) of the pilosebaceous unit; and (6) vascular/perivascular. We review clinicopathologic features and management of diseases belonging to each group, particularly: (1) pemphigus herpetiformis and atopic dermatitis as prototypes of the epidermal group; (2) bullous pemphigoid as prototypic eosinophilic dermatosis of the dermal-epidermal junction; (3) eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells syndrome), hypereosinophilic syndromes, Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy and chronic spontaneous urticaria as paradigmatic dermal eosinophilic dermatoses; (4) eosinophilic fasciitis as an eosinophilic dermatosis with predominant involvement of the hypodermis and muscle fascia; (5) eosinophilic pustular folliculitis as a model of the pilosebaceous unit involvement; and (6) granuloma faciale, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, belonging to the vascular/perivascular group.","['Marzano AV', 'Genovese G']",2020,21,4,Am J Clin Dermatol,Marzano AV and Genovese G.

32318104,Consensus on the Clinical Approach to Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis in Spain: A Delphi Survey.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to gather information on the current assessment and management of patients with moderate-to-severe AD in routine daily practice.
METHODS: A cross-sectional two-round Delphi survey with the participation of dermatologists and allergologists throughout Spain was conducted. They completed a 46-item questionnaire, and consensus was defined when responses of ≥80% of participants coincided in the categories of a 5-point Likert scale for that item.
RESULTS: A total of 105 specialists (aged 40-59 years) completed the two rounds. Participants agreed regarding the consideration of AD as a multifaceted disease and the differences in clinical presentation of AD according to the patient's age. It is recommendable to perform a skin biopsy to exclude early stage T-cell cutaneous lymphoma, psoriasis, or dermatitis herpetiformis, among others (99.1%). Also, consensus was reached regarding the use of the SCORAD index to quantify the severity of the disease (86.7%), the use of wet wraps to increase the effect of topical corticosteroids (90.4%), the usefulness of proactive treatment during follow-up (85.6%) and tacrolimus ointment (91.2%) to reduce new flares, and the fact that crisaborole is not the treatment of choice for severe AD (92.4%). AD was not considered a contraindication for immunotherapy in patients with allergic respiratory diseases (92.4%). In patients with severe AD, the use of immune response modifier drugs (97.6%) or phototherapy (92.8%) does not sufficiently cover their treatment needs. Consensus was also obtained regarding the role of the new biologic drugs (93.6%) targeting cytokines involved in the Th2 inflammatory pathway (92.0%) and the potential role of dupilumab as first-line treatment (90.4%) in moderate-to-severe AD patients.
CONCLUSION: This study contributes a reference framework to the care of AD patients. There is no diagnostic test or biomarkers to direct treatment or to assess the severity of the disease, and many therapeutic challenges remain.","['Sastre J', 'Baldrich ES', 'Armario Hita JC', 'Herráez L', 'Jáuregui I', 'Martín-Santiago A', 'Ortiz de Frutos J', 'Silvestre JF', 'Valero A']",2020,2020,,Dermatol Res Pract,"Sastre J, et al.

In a GFD, wheat, rye and barley should be strictly avoided, but the role of oats is more controversial. This study aimed to investigate the safety and long-term quality of life and health effects of oat consumption in 312 long-term treated DH patients. Baseline data were gathered from patient records and follow-up data from questionnaires or interviews, and validated questionnaires were used to assess quality of life. We found that altogether 256 patients (82%) were consuming oats as part of their GFD at the follow-up. Long-term follow-up data showed that there were no differences in the presence of long-term illnesses, coeliac disease complications or the usage of medication between those consuming and not consuming oats. However, oat consumers had a better quality of life and reported ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms less frequently (4% vs 19%, ","['Alakoski A', 'Hervonen K', 'Mansikka E', 'Reunala T', 'Kaukinen K', 'Kivelä L', 'Laurikka P', 'Huhtala H', 'Kurppa K', 'Salmi T']",2020,12,4,Nutrients,"Alakoski A, et al.

METHODS: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of DH that referred to nine different Italian centers between 2011 and 2016 were characterized assessing demographic, clinical and laboratory findings, and evaluating gender and age differences across selected variables.
RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were included. Among them, 81 (53.6%) were males and 70 (46.4%) were females, with a male to female ratio of 1.2 : 1. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 41 years (range 0-85). Males had a significant longer diagnostic delay if compared to females (9 vs. 3 months, respectively; 
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed some of the most relevant data regarding DH that have been previously reported in the literature. In addition, we found a reduced diagnostic delay in females with respect to males, possibly related to the higher sensitivity of serologic testing in females with DH compared to males. Finally, we demonstrated that intestinal involvement could be severe in patients with DH and that females should be tested for thyroiditis.","['Antiga E', 'Bonciolini V', 'Cazzaniga S', 'Alaibac M', 'Calabrò AS', 'Cardinali C', 'Cozzani E', 'Marzano AV', 'Micali G', 'Not T', 'Quaglino P', 'Vassallo C', 'Naldi L', 'Caproni M', 'The Gised Group And The Italian Group For Cutaneous Immunopathology']",2019,2019,,Biomed Res Int,"Antiga E, et al.

32069794,Intestinal TG3- and TG2-Specific Plasma Cell Responses in Dermatitis Herpetiformis Patients Undergoing a Gluten Challenge.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease, is characterized by transglutaminase (TG) 3-targeted dermal immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits. The treatment for DH is the same as for coeliac disease, namely a life-long gluten-free diet. DH patients typically have gluten-dependent circulating autoantibodies targeting TG3 and TG2, and plasma cells secreting such autoantibodies have been detected in the small intestinal mucosa. This study investigates the gluten-responsiveness of intestinal TG3 and TG2 antibody-secreting plasma cells in 16 treated DH patients undergoing a gluten challenge. The frequency of both plasma cell populations increased significantly during the challenge, and their frequency correlated with the corresponding serum autoantibody levels at post-challenge. TG3-specific plasma cells were absent in all 18 untreated coeliac disease patients and seven non-coeliac control subjects on gluten-containing diets. These findings indicate that, in DH, both intestinal TG3- and TG2-antibody secreting plasma cells are gluten-dependent, and that TG3-antibody secreting plasma cells are DH-specific.","['Sankari H', 'Hietikko M', 'Kurppa K', 'Kaukinen K', 'Mansikka E', 'Huhtala H', 'Laurila K', 'Reunala T', 'Hervonen K', 'Salmi T', 'Lindfors K']",2020,12,2,Nutrients,"Sankari H, et al.

32039457,Current Concepts of Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune skin disease that causes itchy, blistering rash, typically on the elbows, knees and buttocks. DH and coeliac disease share the same genetic background, gluten-dependent enteropathy and antibody response against tissue transglutaminase. DH is currently considered a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease, and the prevailing hypothesis is that DH develops as a late manifestation of subclinical coeliac disease. The incidence of DH is decreasing contemporarily with the increasing incidence of coeliac disease. The IgA immune response in DH skin is directed against epidermal transglutaminase, while the autoantigen in the gut is tissue transglutaminase. Granular IgA deposition in the papillary dermis is pathognomonic for DH, and is a finding used to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment of choice for DH is a life-long gluten-free diet, which resolves the rash and enteropathy, increases quality of life, and offers a good long-term prognosis.","['Salmi T', 'Hervonen K']",2020,100,5,Acta Derm Venereol,Salmi T and Hervonen K.

The DIF of uninvolved, perilesional skin is a crucial laboratory procedure in diagnosing dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). IgA deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of perilesional skin with DIF can also be found in coeliac patients with inflammatory skin diseases different from DH. In certain patients presenting with the rash resembling DH, the deposition of exclusively C3 at DEJ can be found. The term ""granular C3 dermatosis"" was proposed to name such a rash. Recent data on DH suggest that perhaps the very concept of DH that we are universally accepting now is misleading and should be revised.","['Dmochowski M', 'Gornowicz-Porowska J', 'Bowszyc-Dmochowska M']",2019,36,6,Postepy Dermatol Alergol,"Dmochowski M, et al.

31909480,Update on the use of dapsone in dermatology.,"Dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is the only remaining sulfone used in anthropoid therapeutics and is commercially available as an oral formulation, an inhaled preparation, and a 5% or 7.5% cream. Dapsone has antimicrobial effects stemming from its sulfonamide-like ability to inhibit the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid. It also has anti-inflammatory properties such as inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species, reducing the effect of eosinophil peroxidase on mast cells and down-regulating neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses. This allows for its use in the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory and infectious skin conditions. Currently in dermatology, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for dapsone are leprosy, dermatitis herpetiformis, and acne vulgaris. However, it proved itself as an adjunctive therapeutic agent to many other skin disorders. In this review, we discuss existing evidence on the mechanisms of action of dapsone, its FDA-approved indications, off-label uses, and side effects.","['Ghaoui N', 'Hanna E', 'Abbas O', 'Kibbi AG', 'Kurban M']",2020,59,7,Int J Dermatol,"Ghaoui N, et al.

31809599,Deciphering crucial genes in coeliac disease by bioinformatics analysis.,"Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by malabsorption in sensitive individuals. CD is triggered by the ingestion of grains containing gluten. CD is concomitant with several other disorders, including dermatitis herpetiformis, selective IgA deficiency, thyroid disorders, diabetes mellitus, various connective tissue disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. The advent of high throughput technologies has provided a massive wealth of data which are processed in various omics scale fields. These approaches have revolutionized the medical research and monitoring of the biological systems. In this regard, omics scaled analyses of CD by Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), DISEASES, and GeneCards databases have retrieved 2656 CD associated genes. Amongst, 54 genes were assigned by Venn Diagram of the intersection to be shared by these 3 databases for CD. These common genes were subjected to further analysis and screening. The Enrich database, GeneMANIA, Cytoscape, and WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit) were employed for functional analysis. These analyses indicated that the obtained genes are mainly involved in the immune system and signalling pathways related to autoimmune diseases. The STAT1, ALB, IL10, IL2, IL4, IL17A, TGFB1, IL1B, IL6, TNF, IFNG hub genes were particularly indicated to have significant roles in CD. Functional analyses of these hub genes by GeneMANIA indicated that they are involved in immune systems regulation. Moreover, 25 out of 54 genes were identified to be seed genes by the WebGestalt database. Gene set analysis with GEO2R tool from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) showed that there were 15 significant genes in GSE76168, 29 significant genes in GSE87460, 12 significant genes in GSE87458, 9 significant genes in GSE87457, 3753 significant genes in GSE112102 and 1043 significant genes in GSE102991 with differential expression in coeliac patients compared to controls. The IRF1and STAT1 genes were common between the significant genes from GEO and the 54 CD related genes from three public databases. In the light these results, nine key genes, including IRF1, STAT1, IL17A, TGFB1, ALB, IL10, IL2, IL4, and IL1B, were identified to be associated with CD. These findings could be used to find novel diagnostic biomarkers, understand the pathology of disease, and devise more efficient treatments.","['Noori E', 'Kazemi B', 'Bandehpour M', 'Zali H', 'Khalesi B', 'Khalili S']",2020,53,2,Autoimmunity,"Noori E, et al.

31785504,Gender-Related Differences in Celiac Patients at Diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical presentation of celiac disease (CD) in terms of gender have demonstrated differences between symptoms among women and men. This study evaluated the differences in the clinical presentation of CD among Brazilian men and women at the time of diagnosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated data on symptoms and clinical signs of 240 patients (80 [33.3%] men and 160 [66.6%] women) aged >18 years who were diagnosed with CD during 2000-2017. The overall mean age at diagnosis was 38.3 ± 13.28 years, with the mean age being 38.1 ± 14.48 years for men and 38.4 ± 12.68 years for women (p = 0.16). Details regarding other previously diagnosed autoimmune diseases were enquired with the patient. All data were collected at the time of diagnosis of CD.
RESULTS: Symptoms such as anxiety/depression (OR = 7.9), lack of appetite (OR = 3.5), flatulence (OR = 1.9), malaise (OR = 2.5), nausea (OR = 3.1), and vomiting (OR = 6.5) were more frequent in females than in males. Only steatorrhea was more frequent in men (OR = 2.6). Clinical signs such as anemia (OR = 2.8), short stature (OR >20), and weight loss (OR = 2.4) were also more frequent in women. Other findings such as diarrhea, abdominal distension or pain, and anorexia did not reveal differences in terms of gender. Regarding concomitant autoimmune diseases, dermatitis herpetiformis was more frequent in men (OR = 2.6), and thyroiditis was more frequent in women (OR = 10.5).
CONCLUSION: Our study has demonstrated that men and women with CD presented differences in clinical presentation at the time of diagnosis. Women exhibited more gastrointestinal symptoms and clinical signs than men.","['Lima RF', 'Maria da Silva Kotze L', 'Kotze LR', 'Chrisostomo KR', 'Nisihara R']",2019,50,7,Arch Med Res,"Lima RF, et al.

HbA1c reflects the level of blood glucose to which the erythrocyte has been exposed during its lifespan, and there are a number of clinical situations affecting the erythrocyte life span in which HbA1c values may be spuriously high or low and therefore not reflective of the true level of glucose control. In the present case series, we describe the particulars of three patients with diabetes who had spuriously low HbA1c levels as a result of dapsone usage. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of HbA1c testing and the mechanisms by which it may be affected by dapsone in particular.
LEARNING POINTS: Various conditions and medications can result in falsely low HbA1c. Dapsone can lead to falsely low HbA1c by inducing haemolysis and by forming methaemoglobin. Capillary glucose measurement, urine glucose measurements and fructosamine levels should be used as alternatives to HbA1c for monitoring glycaemic control if it was falsely low or high.","['Aljenaee K', 'Hakami O', 'Davenport C', 'Farrell G', 'Tun TK', 'Pazderska A', 'Phelan N', 'Healy ML', 'Sreenan S', 'McDermott JH']",2019,2019,,Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,"Aljenaee K, et al.

31559249,Alopecia in Autoimmune Blistering Diseases: A Systematic Review of Pathogenesis and Clinical Features of Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBD) are characterised by the body's production of autoantibodies against structural proteins in the epidermis and/or the basement membrane on cutaneous and mucosal surfaces. Alopecia is a complication of AIBD that has generally been overlooked in patients with severe blistering diseases because it is regarded as a cosmetic issue. Yet recent research into quality of life tools has found that stigmatisation by appearance plays a significant role in blistering diseases.
AIM: To review the current literature detailing the pathogenesis and clinical presentations of alopecia in AIBD patients.
METHOD: We searched Medline, PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases up to September 2018, for empirical human and animal studies.
RESULTS: Only 36 human studies including 223 patients (190 pemphigus, 25 pemphigoid, 5 epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, 2 dermatitis herpetiformis and 1 linear IgA disease) detailed demographic and clinical manifestations of alopecia. A range of hair evaluation methods was demonstrated to reach alopecia diagnosis. Furthermore, with no universal validated scoring system for alopecia severity, alopecia patterns have been summarised.
CONCLUSION: Previous randomised trials have not highlighted alopecia as an important outcome of AIBD, so epidemiological evaluation of the available literature has been helpful in summarising trends between existing studies and demonstrating inconsistencies.","['Xie D', 'Bilgic-Temel A', 'Abu Alrub N', 'Murrell DF']",2019,5,5,Skin Appendage Disord,"Xie D, et al.

31506891,Bullous Diseases in Children: A Review of Clinical Features and Treatment Options.,"Bullous diseases are uncommon in children; however, as they have the potential to affect quality of life, occasionally have long-term side effects in the setting of scarring processes, and carry a rare risk of underlying malignancy [e.g., with paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP)], knowledge of their clinical presentation and treatment options is essential. Given the rarity of these conditions, our current state of knowledge is largely derived from case reports and case series, with a paucity of evidence-based recommendations. In this review, we discuss the clinical presentation of and treatment options for linear immunoglobulin A disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, PNP, bullous pemphigoid, mucus membrane pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and inherited epidermolysis bullosa. In general, when these conditions, except for PNP, occur in childhood, they have a better prognosis than when they occur in adults. Clinical, histopathological, and immunologic features frequently overlap, but distinct differences have also been reported, most commonly in clinical presentation. Treatment is often similar to that in adults, although specific considerations are necessary for a pediatric population.","['Schultz B', 'Hook K']",2019,21,5,Paediatr Drugs,Schultz B and Hook K.

31387782,Experimental dapsone administration induces infertility in male Wistar rats: Mechanisms and clinical implications.,"Dapsone (4, 4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone, DDS) is a potent anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compound which has been used in the treatment of leprosy, vasculitis and dermatitis herpetiformis, lupus erythematosus profundus and even as an antimalarial in combination with proguanil. This study investigated the effect of the administration of dapsone on the reproductive activities of male rats using in vivo and in vitro techniques. In the in vivo study, dapsone was administered orally to male Wistar rats for 5 days or 6 weeks after which their body weight, relative reproductive organ weights, sperm parameters and reproductive hormones were determined while testicular and epididymal histology were also assessed. Data were compared using analysis of variance and Students-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. For the in vitro study, Sertoli cells were cultured and treated with varying doses of dapsone at different durations, thereafter Sertoli cell viability and nuclei integrity were determined. Also, the genetic expressions of Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and transferrin were assessed. The results obtained from the in vivo study showed a duration-dependent significant decrease in body and reproductive organ weights, sperm parameters and serum testosterone concentration. Testicular and epididymal histology also showed duration-dependent degenerative changes. However, all these changes were restored towards control values in the recovery experiment. The viability and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integrity of the treated Sertoli cells showed dose and duration-dependent adverse effects while GDNF and transferrin showed normal genetic expressions. These results suggest that dapsone could induce male reproductive stress by affecting testicular and epididymal structure and function.","['Akinsomisoye OS', 'Gupta G', 'Raji Y']",2019,26,3-4,Pathophysiology,"Akinsomisoye OS, et al.

31293600,Complement Activation in Autoimmune Bullous Dermatoses: A Comprehensive Review.,"Autoimmune bullous dermatoses (AIBD) are characterized by circulating autoantibodies that are either directed against epidermal antigens or deposited as immune complexes in the basement membrane zone (BMZ). The complement system (CS) can be activated by autoantibodies, thereby triggering activation of specific complement pathways. Local complement activation induces a pathogenic inflammatory response that eventually results in the formation of a sub- or intraepidermal blister. Deposition of complement components is routinely used as a diagnostic marker for AIBD. Knowledge from different animal models mimicking AIBD and deposition of complement components in human skin biopsies provides more insight into the role of complement in the pathogenesis of the different AIBD. This review outlines the role of the CS in several AIBD including bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), pemphigus, linear IgA-disease, and dermatitis herpetiformis. We also discuss potential therapeutic approaches targeting key complement components, pathways and pathogenic complement-mediated events.","['Edwards G', 'Diercks GFH', 'Seelen MAJ', 'Horvath B', 'van Doorn MBA', 'Damman J']",2019,10,,Front Immunol,"Edwards G, et al.

31281319,Coagulation and Skin Autoimmunity.,"Several lines of evidence indicate that the immune system, inflammation, and coagulation are simultaneously activated in autoimmune and immune-mediated skin diseases. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induce the expression of the main initiator of coagulation, i.e., tissue factor. The proteases of coagulation in turn act on protease-activated receptors inducing the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines triggering inflammation. The cross-talk among immune system, inflammation, and coagulation amplifies and maintains the activation of all three pathways. This review focuses on three skin disorders as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), angioedema, and bullous pemphigoid (BP), in which the relationships among the three systems have been investigated or their clinical consequences are relevant. Markers of thrombin generation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation have been reported to be increased in the plasma during flares of CSU and angioedema, as well as in the active phase of BP, with the marker levels reverting to normal during remission. The coagulation activation seems to be important only at local level in CSU and angioedema while both at local and systemic levels in BP which is the only condition associated with an increased thrombotic risk. The prothrombotic state in autoimmune skin diseases raises the question of the indication of anticoagulant treatment, particularly in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.","['Cugno M', 'Borghi A', 'Garcovich S', 'Marzano AV']",2019,10,,Front Immunol,"Cugno M, et al.

31244841,Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Novel Perspectives.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an inflammatory disease of the skin, considered the specific cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease (CD). Both DH and CD occur in gluten-sensitive individuals, share the same Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haplotypes (DQ2 and DQ8), and improve following the administration of a gluten-free diet. Moreover, almost all DH patients show typical CD alterations at the small bowel biopsy, ranging from villous atrophy to augmented presence of intraepithelial lymphocytes, as well as the generation of circulating autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG). Clinically, DH presents with polymorphic lesions, including papules, vesicles, and small blisters, symmetrically distributed in typical anatomical sites including the extensor aspects of the limbs, the elbows, the sacral regions, and the buttocks. Intense pruritus is almost the rule. However, many atypical presentations of DH have also been reported. Moreover, recent evidence suggested that DH is changing. Firstly, some studies reported a reduced incidence of DH, probably due to early recognition of CD, so that there is not enough time for DH to develop. Moreover, data from Japanese literature highlighted the absence of intestinal involvement as well as of the typical serological markers of CD (i.e., anti-tTG antibodies) in Japanese patients with DH. Similar cases may also occur in Caucasian patients, complicating DH diagnosis. The latter relies on the combination of clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic findings. Detecting granular IgA deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) from perilesional skin represents the most specific diagnostic tool. Further, assessing serum titers of autoantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase (eTG), the supposed autoantigen of DH, may also serve as a clue for the diagnosis. However, a study from our group has recently demonstrated that granular IgA deposits may also occur in celiac patients with non-DH inflammatory skin diseases, raising questions about the effective role of eTG IgA autoantibodies in DH and suggesting the need of revising diagnostic criteria, conceivably emphasizing clinical aspects of the disease along with DIF. DH usually responds to the gluten-free diet. Topical clobetasol ointment or dapsone may be also applied to favor rapid disease control. Our review will focus on novel pathogenic insights, controversies, and management aspects of DH.","['Antiga E', 'Maglie R', 'Quintarelli L', 'Verdelli A', 'Bonciani D', 'Bonciolini V', 'Caproni M']",2019,10,,Front Immunol,"Antiga E, et al.

31210940,European Society for the Study of Coeliac Disease (ESsCD) guideline for coeliac disease and other gluten-related disorders.,"This guideline presents recommendations for the management of coeliac disease (CD) and other gluten-related disorders both in adults and children. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of CD over the last 50 years and many patients remain undiagnosed. Diagnostic testing, including serology and biopsy, should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The diagnosis of CD is based on a combination of clinical, serological and histopathological data. In a group of children the diagnosis may be made without biopsy if strict criteria are available. The treatment for CD is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation and follow-up. Slow-responsiveness occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms necessitate a review of the original diagnosis, exclude alternative diagnoses, confirm dietary adherence (dietary review and serology) and follow-up biopsy. In addition, evaluation to exclude complications of CD, such as refractory CD or lymphoma, should be performed. The guideline also deals with other gluten-related disorders, such as dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a cutaneous manifestation of CD characterized by granular IgA deposits in the dermal papillae. The skin lesions clear with gluten withdrawal. Also, less well-defined conditions such as non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and gluten-sensitive neurological manifestations, such as ataxia, have been addressed. Newer therapeutic modalities for CD are being studied in clinical trials but are not yet approved for use in practice.","['Al-Toma A', 'Volta U', 'Auricchio R', 'Castillejo G', 'Sanders DS', 'Cellier C', 'Mulder CJ', 'Lundin KEA']",2019,7,5,United European Gastroenterol J,"Al-Toma A, et al.

Mucosal lesions are present only in linear IgA bullous dermatosis. The elaboration of this consensus consisted of a brief presentation of the different aspects of these dermatoses and, above all, of an updated literature review on the various therapeutic options that were discussed and compared with the authors' experience, aiming at the treatment orientation of these diseases in Brazil. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, and can be controlled with a gluten-free diet and dapsone. On the other hand, linear IgA bullous dermatosis arises spontaneously or is triggered by drugs, and can be controlled with dapsone, but often requires the association of systemic corticosteroids and eventually immunosuppressants.","['Vale ECSD', 'Dimatos OC', 'Porro AM', 'Santi CG']",2019,94,2 Suppl 1,An Bras Dermatol,"Vale ECSD, et al.

31106757,Fibrillar-type dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a pruritic papulovesicular disease that is relatively common in Caucasian populations, and was first reported by Louis Duhring. It is characterized by granular IgA deposition in the dermal-epidermal junction and gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) associated with human leukocyte antigen-DQ2/DQ8 haplotype. In contrast, DH is rare in Japan, and Japanese DH patients occasionally show unique features, including a high frequency of fibrillar IgA deposition in the papillary dermis, and rare occurrence of GSE. We refer to this condition in Japanese patients as ""fibrillar-type DH"", while the DH that is typically observed in the Caucasian population is referred to as ""granular-type DH"". In patients with typical fibrillar-type DH, IgA antibodies to epidermal transglutaminase are the only antibodies detected. In addition, Th2-type cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, may be important in the development of skin lesions in fibrillar-type DH (especially in the infiltration of tissue by eosinophils), as in granular-type DH. The pathogenesis of fibrillar-type DH may differ from that of granular-type DH, which is dependent on gluten and in which IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (the main antigen in GSE) are detected. We herein review the clinical, histological, and immunological findings of fibrillar-type DH.","['Makino T', 'Shimizu T']",2019,29,2,Eur J Dermatol,Makino T and Shimizu T.

31093998,Dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease (CD), which causes an itching and blistering rash, typically on the elbows, knees and buttocks. DH and CD share a similar genetic background, small bowel mucosal alterations, and an autoimmune response against tissue transglutaminase in the serum and small bowel. DH is typically diagnosed during adulthood, and it is slightly more common among males than females. The incidence of DH seems to be decreasing, in contrast to the detected four-fold increase in the incidence of CD. In addition to typical clinical picture, diagnosis of DH relies on the demonstration by direct immunofluorescence of pathognomonic granular IgA deposits in the papillary dermis. Circulating tissue transglutaminase antibodies support the diagnosis, but their absence does not exclude DH. Obtainment of small bowel mucosal biopsies is not necessary when DH is diagnosed, but if performed, the majority of patients are found to have villous atrophy, and even those with normal villous architecture evince CD-type inflammation. The treatment of choice in DH is a strict, life-long adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). In addition to alleviating the symptoms of DH and healing the small bowel mucosal damage, a GFD increases the quality of life for patients, and decreases the risk for lymphoma in DH. Further, the mortality rate of patients with DH treated with a GFD seems to be lower than that of the general population. However, as changing to a GFD has a rather slow effect on the DH rash, patients with severe skin symptoms should additionally be treated with dapsone medication.

Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it requires a fresh tissue specimen. This study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for the detection of C4d in paraffin-embedded tissue of BP cases.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 30 BP cases (confirmed by Hematoxylin and eosin [H&E] and DIF) and 30 controls. IHC studies were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.
RESULTS: Of 30 BP patients (11 male and 19 female), 27 (90%) were C4d positive and three patients (10%) were C4d negative. The C4d deposits were seen as linear brown stain along the dermoepidermal junction (18 cases), around basal keratinocytes (eight cases), or Civatte-like (three cases).

31048663,Autoimmune Diseases and Gastric Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"PURPOSE: Autoimmunity is an alternative etiology of gastric inflammation, the initiating event in the gastric carcinogenic cascade. This mechanism may be an increasingly important cause of gastric cancer with the waning prevalence of its primary etiologic factor, chronic Helicobacter pylori infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to September 2018. Autoimmunity and 96 specific manifestations were considered for associations with gastric cancer risk. Random effects analysis was used to calculate pooled relative risk estimates (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: We found a total of 52 observational studies representing 30 different autoimmune diseases. Overall, the presence of an autoimmune condition was associated with a gastric cancer pooled RR of 1.37 (95% CI, 1.24 to 1.52). Among the 24 autoimmune conditions with two or more independent reports, nine were significantly associated with increased gastric cancer risk: dermatomyositis (RR, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.74 to 7.79), pernicious anemia (RR, 2.84; 95% CI, 2.30 to 3.50), Addison disease (RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.26 to 3.53), dermatitis herpetiformis (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.97; n=3), IgG4-related disease (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.87), primary biliary cirrhosis (RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.37), diabetes mellitus type 1 (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.67), systemic lupus erythematosus (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.84), and Graves disease (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.52).
CONCLUSION: Our analysis documents the wide range of autoimmune diseases associated with gastric cancer. These associations may reflect unreported links between these conditions and autoimmune gastritis. Further studies are warranted to investigate potential causal mechanisms.","['Song M', 'Latorre G', 'Ivanovic-Zuvic D', 'Camargo MC', 'Rabkin CS']",2019,51,3,Cancer Res Treat,"Song M, et al.

The renal biopsy specimen suggested proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits under routine light, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The staining for IgG subclasses (IgG1 and IgG2) and κ/λ light chain indicated secondary immune complex type MPGN type 3. The patient had been diagnosed as having dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a phenotype of gluten hypersensitivity prior to the appearance of the renal abnormality. Although common autoantibodies might be related to the pathogenesis of disorders in the skin and kidney, DH is mainly driven by IgA autoantibody, while MPGN is induced by IgG immune complexes. IgA was not observed in the glomeruli by immunofluorescence. Neither the examination for DH specific autoantibodies nor HLA-DQB1 genotype supported the diagnosis of DH. Reassessment of the skin biopsy record revealed that the blister was localized in the epidermis, suggesting pemphigus herpetiformis by IgG class anti-epidermal autoantibody, which also affected the renal disorder.","['Shimizu Y', 'Wakabayashi K', 'Hayashi Y', 'Hara K', 'Aoyama R', 'Niimi T', 'Tomino Y', 'Wada R', 'Hata M', 'Suzuki Y']",2019,9,1,Case Rep Nephrol Dial,"Shimizu Y, et al.

30998982,Gluten Challenge Induces Skin and Small Bowel Relapse in Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet-Treated Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease causing an itchy, blistering rash. Granular IgA deposits in the skin are pathognomonic for DH, and the treatment of choice is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Preliminary evidence suggests that there are patients with DH who redevelop gluten tolerance after adherence to a GFD treatment. To evaluate this, we performed a 12-month gluten challenge with skin and small-bowel mucosal biopsy samples in 19 patients with DH who had adhered to a GFD for a mean of 23 years. Prechallenge biopsy was negative for skin IgA and transglutaminase 3 deposits in 16 patients (84%) and indicated normal villous height-to-crypt depth ratios in the small bowel mucosa in all 19 patients. The gluten challenge caused a relapse of the rash in 15 patients (79%) in a mean of 5.6 months; of these 15 patients, 13 had skin IgA and transglutaminase 3 deposits, and 12 had small-bowel villous atrophy. In addition, three patients without rash or immune deposits in the skin developed villous atrophy, whereas one patient persisted without any signs of relapse. In conclusion, 95% of the patients with DH were unable to tolerate gluten even after long-term adherence to a GFD. Therefore, lifelong GFD treatment remains justified in all patients with DH.","['Mansikka E', 'Hervonen K', 'Kaukinen K', 'Ilus T', 'Oksanen P', 'Lindfors K', 'Laurila K', 'Hietikko M', 'Taavela J', 'Jernman J', 'Saavalainen P', 'Reunala T', 'Salmi T']",2019,139,10,J Invest Dermatol,"Mansikka E, et al.

The common age of onset for pemphigus and pemphigoid, as well as dermatitis herpetiformis, encompasses the adult age, but all these disorders can be observed neonatally and/or during childhood. If the disease occurs postpartum or neonatally, physicians should consider transplacental transmission of pathogenic maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG)-autoantibodies, and both mother and child should be included in the diagnostic work up. If the disorder is suspected in childhood, early immunoserological testing and skin biopsies for direct immunofluorescence analyses are recommended for the correct diagnosis and subsequently for the right choice of treatment. First-line recommendations are nonhalogenated topical steroids, followed by oral dapsone. All therapies require preliminary examinations, e. g. enzyme-activity testing (as is glucose-6-phophate dehydrogenase in dapsone treatment). In refractory cases, further treatment choices like high-dose intravenous immunoglobins, plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption or targeted therapies like anti-CD20 autoantibody therapies are indicated. An intense dermatological support and good medical care are essential for an age-appropriate development of the child and to lower possible treatment-associated adverse events.","['Kiritsi D', 'Schauer F']",2019,70,4,Hautarzt,Kiritsi D and Schauer F.

However, the pathogenesis of DH is not yet fully understood and no data are available regarding a possible role of fibroblasts in this disease. The aim of this study was to assess baseline DNA damage in fibroblasts in DH-diagnosed patients vs. fibroblasts of controls without DH or CD. Primary fibroblast cultures were derived from dermal biopsies from DH patients and controls (without DH or CD). In vitro genotoxic damage was investigated using the comet assay and ɣH2AX test after different treatments (with 33mer peptide and digested gliadin [DG]) in order to investigate a correlation between oxidative stress (evaluated by reactive oxygen species formation) and glutathione content. Our results demonstrate a difference in baseline DNA damage between cutaneous fibroblasts of controls and DH patients, moreover, DNA damage significantly increased after exposure to gluten (DG and 33mer peptide) in fibroblasts from DH patients. DNA damage in fibroblasts from patients under dapsone treatment was similar to that of the control group. Our data indicate that oxidative stress and DNA damage may be characteristics of fibroblasts from DH patients who are not treated with dapsone, particularly after exposure to gliadin peptides.","['Lombardo G', 'Marabini L', 'Doneda L', 'Lombardo V', 'Scricciolo A', 'Elli L', 'Della Valle V', 'Muratori S', 'Roncoroni L']",2019,29,2,Eur J Dermatol,"Lombardo G, et al.

We conducted this systematic review based on the current epidemiology knowledge of GRDs, focusing on the changing prevalence of GRDs reported in the Asia-Pacific region.
METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane database with the following MeSH terms and keywords: celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and gluten ataxia (GA) and the prevalence studies published from January 1991 to January 2018. Each article was cross-referenced with ""Asia-Pacific region"" and countries in this region such as Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran and others.
RESULTS: We included 66 studies, which reported the prevalence of GRDs in the Asia-Pacific region. Prevalence of celiac disease was 0.32%-1.41% in healthy children and 0.05%-1.22% in the adult population, while the prevalence in the high risk population was higher (0.6%-11.8%). Previous studies have shown a very low incidence of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) (<0.001%) and gluten ataxia (GA) in this area. Few studies on NCGS outbreaks have been found in this area due to the lack of specific diagnostic biomarkers. Wheat allergy (WA), although uncommon in most Asian-Pacific countries, is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in this region.
CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review suggest the need to plan further proper epidemiological studies in order to understand the natural history of GRDs and to assess its burden on health systems.","['Ashtari S', 'Pourhoseingholi MA', 'Rostami K', 'Aghdaei HA', 'Rostami-Nejad M', 'Busani L', 'Tavirani MR', 'Zali MR']",2019,28,1,J Gastrointestin Liver Dis,"Ashtari S, et al.

Moreover, sex is associated with differences in clinical presentation, onset, progression, and outcomes of disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of IMDs at diagnosis in patients with celiac disease (CD) and their first-degree relatives and to compare the findings between female and male patients of different age.
METHODS: A retrospective study including Brazilian patients with CD who visited the same doctor during January 2012 to January 2017 was performed. Demographic and medical history data were collected through self-administered questionnaires and medical charts of the patients. In total, 213 patients were examined at diagnosis: 52 males (mean age, 40.0 years) and 161 females (mean age, 41.4 years). The patients were divided into two groups according to sex and age.
RESULTS: IMDs were observed in 60.2% of the female (97/161) and 42.3% of the male patients (22/52; P=0.22). However, the frequency of IMDs was significantly higher in females aged 51-60 years than in males with same age (P=0.0002). Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) was significantly more prevalent in males (P=0.02), whereas atopy was more prevalent in females (P=0.02). IMDs observed in first-degree relatives were similar to those observed in patients (70.9%; P<0.001), with a higher number observed in female relatives.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of IMDs in CD patients was similar in all age groups and both sexes, except women diagnosed with CD after 51 years of age presented with an increased frequency of IMDs compared with males. Dermatitis herpetiformis was more prevalent in males, whereas atopy was more prevalent in females.

We aimed to investigate the effects of HLA-DQB1*02 allele dose on clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all coeliac patients attending to three Hungarian university clinics after 1997 and included those patients, who (a) were diagnosed with CD, (b) underwent high-resolution HLA typing and (c) were ≥18 years at the time of data collection. HLA typing was performed to determine DQB1*02 allele dose. Patients were divided into risk groups by DQB1*02 allele dose, as follows: high-, intermediate- and low-risk groups corresponded to a double, single and zero doses, respectively. We used ANOVA and Pearson's chi-squared test to explore association between HLA risk and clinical variables.
RESULTS: A total of 727 coeliac patients attended the clinics but only 105 (14.4%) patients were eligible for inclusion. High, intermediate and low HLA risk patients comprised 35.3%, 52.3% and 12.3% of the study population, respectively. Double dose of HLA-DQB1*02 was more frequent in patient with high tTGA level (>10 times the upper limit of normal; p = 0.045). Gene dose was not associated with younger age at diagnosis (p = 0.549), gender (p = 0.739), more severe diagnostic histology (p = 0.318), more frequent classical presentation (p = 0.846), anaemia (p = 0.611), metabolic bone disease (p = 0.374), dermatitis herpetiformis (p = 0.381) and autoimmune diseases (p = 0.837).

30717318,Gluten-Induced Extra-Intestinal Manifestations in Potential Celiac Disease-Celiac Trait.,"Celiac disease patients may suffer from a number of extra-intestinal diseases related to long-term gluten ingestion. The diagnosis of celiac disease is based on the presence of a manifest small intestinal mucosal lesion. Individuals with a normal biopsy but an increased risk of developing celiac disease are referred to as potential celiac disease patients. However, these patients are not treated. This review highlights that patients with normal biopsies may suffer from the same extra-intestinal gluten-induced complications before the disease manifests at the intestinal level. We discuss diagnostic markers revealing true potential celiac disease. The evidence-based medical literature shows that these potential patients, who are ""excluded"" for celiac disease would in fact benefit from gluten-free diets. The question is why wait for an end-stage disease to occur when it can be prevented? We utilize research on dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a model disease in which a gluten-induced entity erupts in the skin irrespective of the state of the small intestinal mucosal morphology. Furthermore, gluten ataxia can be categorized as its own entity. The other extra-intestinal manifestations occurring in celiac disease are also found at the latent disease stage. Consequently, patients with celiac traits should be identified and treated.","['Popp A', 'Mäki M']",2019,11,2,Nutrients,Popp A and Mäki M.

30612975,Dermatitis Herpetiformis and Celiac Disease Increase the Risk of Bullous Pemphigoid.,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) are autoimmune bullous skin diseases. DH has been described to evolve into BP and the two diseases can have overlapping clinical appearances and diagnostic findings, but the association between DH and BP has not previously been studied in a large population. To evaluate DH and celiac disease as risk factors for BP, we conducted a retrospective case-control study of patients with BP and matched controls with basal cell carcinoma diagnosed in Finland between 1997 and 2013. A total of 3,397 patients with BP and 12,941 controls were included in the study. Forty-one (1.2%) BP patients and 7 (0.1%) controls had preceding DH. Diagnosed DH increased the risk of BP 22-fold (odds ratio = 22.30; 95% confidence interval = 9.99-49.70) and celiac disease 2-fold (odds ratio = 2.54; 95% confidence interval = 1.64-3.92) compared to controls. Eighteen (43.9%) of the patients who had DH and subsequent BP had bought dapsone during the 2 years prior to their BP diagnosis. Mean time between diagnosed DH and BP was 3 years. We conclude that diagnosis of DH is associated with a striking increase in the risk for BP.","['Varpuluoma O', 'Jokelainen J', 'Försti AK', 'Timonen M', 'Huilaja L', 'Tasanen K']",2019,139,3,J Invest Dermatol,"Varpuluoma O, et al.

30593123,Transglutaminase diseases: from biochemistry to the bedside.,"In humans, 9 members of the transglutaminase (TG) family have been identified, of which 8 [factor XIII (FXIII)A and TG1-TG7] catalyze post-translational protein-modifying reactions, and 1 does not (protein 4.2). The TG enzymatic activities considered in our discussion of human disease include deamidation of glutamine (Gln) residues, amine incorporation into Gln residues, and protein crosslinking. Except for TG7, which remains poorly studied, all individual TG members have been correlated with disparate human diseases that arise from either TG function or lack of function. Loss of TG function is associated with numerous orphan diseases that affect a relatively small number of individuals: loss of FXIIIa (transamidase-activated form) crosslinking leads to defects in blood coagulation in FXIII deficiency; loss of TG1 and TG5 cross linking leads to defects in epidermal cornification in lamellar ichthyosis and acral peeling skin syndrome, respectively; loss of TG3 crosslinking in hair-cuticle formation leads to uncombable hair syndrome; the predicted loss of TG6 crosslinking leads to spinocerebellar ataxia-35; and loss of the structural erythrocyte membrane protein, protein 4.2, leads to hereditary spherocytosis type 5. The enzymatic activity of TG2 is involved in the exacerbation of celiac disease and in at least 1 case of hemoglobinopathy, characterized by shortened erythrocyte lifespan. TGs are also autoantigens in a number of immune diseases, resulting in the production of autoantibodies against FXIIIa in acquired FXIII deficiency, TG2 in celiac disease, TG3 in dermatitis herpetiformis, TG4 in autoimmume polyglandular syndrome type 1, and TG6 in gluten axonal neuropathy and gluten ataxia. Much still remains to be learned and confirmed with respect to disease mechanisms, particularly with respect to TG-related immune diseases, in which development of isozyme-specific inhibitors may be useful for treatment.-Lorand, L., Iismaa, S.

30516407,An update on the cutaneous manifestations of coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.,"INTRODUCTION: Coeliac disease is a gluten-induced immune-mediated enteropathy, characterised by the expression of specific genotypes and the production of autoantibodies. The inflammatory process specifically targets the intestinal mucosa, but gastrointestinal and extraintestinal signs and symptoms can also be present. Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) can be diagnosed in individuals who have intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten, but do not have autoantibodies and do not suffer from lesions in the duodenal mucosa. Among the extraintestinal manifestations, cutaneous manifestations are the most common for both diseases.
PURPOSE: We conducted this review to illustrate the common and uncommon features underlying the association of coeliac disease and NCGS with cutaneous manifestations related to gluten ingestion. Areas covered: The roles of innate and adaptive immunity in the cutaneous appearance of gluten sensitivity will be discussed.","['Graziano M', 'Rossi M']",2018,37,6,Int Rev Immunol,Graziano M and Rossi M.

30450358,Diagnosis of Autoimmune Blistering Diseases.,"Autoimmune skin blistering diseases (AIBD) are characterized by autoantibodies that are directed against structural proteins in the skin and adjacent mucous membranes. Some clinical signs are typical for a specific AIBD, however, correct diagnosis requires the detection of tissue-bound or circulating autoantibodies. The gold standard for diagnosis of AIBD is the detection of autoantibodies or complement component 3 by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy of a perilesional biopsy. Circulating antibodies can be detected via indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) microscopy of different tissue substrates including human skin, monkey esophagus, and more recently, recombinant forms of the different target antigens. Latter are also employed in various commercial ELISA systems and by immunoblotting in in-house assays available in specialized laboratories. ELISA systems are also particularly valuable for monitoring of the disease activity during the disease course which can be helpful for treatment decisions. Exact diagnosis is essential for both treatment and prognosis, since some AIBD are associated with malign tumors such as paraneoplastic pemphigus and anti-laminin 332 mucous membrane pemphigoid. This review presents clinical and immunopathological features of AIBD for the state-of the art diagnosis of these disorders.","['Witte M', 'Zillikens D', 'Schmidt E']",2018,5,,Front Med (Lausanne),"Witte M, et al.

30395395,Bullous autoimmune dermatoses.,"Pathophysiologically, bullous autoimmune dermatoses are caused by autoantibodies directed against adhesion molecules or structural proteins of the skin and mucous membranes, clinically resulting in blister formation. Depending on the respective target proteins of the autoimmune response and their location in the skin, a distinction is made between intraepidermal (pemphigus disorders), junctional (pemphigoid disorders), and subepidermal (epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, dermatitis herpetiformis) autoimmune blistering diseases. The most common bullous autoimmune dermatosis, bullous pemphigoid is characterized by marked clinical variability and intense pruritus. Predominantly affecting elderly individuals, there has been a significant increase in its incidence in recent years. While mucosal lesions occur in less than 30 % of bullous pemphigoid patients, the second most common bullous autoimmune dermatosis, pemphigus vulgaris, typically presents with oral erosions as the predominant and - frequently - initial symptom. Its onset is usually in the 4","['Hofmann SC', 'Juratli HA', 'Eming R']",2018,16,11,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Hofmann SC, et al. Bullous autoimmune dermatoses.

30390734,Two Cases of Dermatitis Herpetiformis Successfully Treated with Tetracycline and Niacinamide.,"Dear Editor, Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic, polymorphic, pruritic autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by subepidermal blisters, neutrophilic microabscesses, and granular IgA deposition within the dermal papillae. DH is classified as a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease, a type of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (1). The treatment of DH includes dapsone and a gluten-free diet (GFD). Other therapies should be considered in patients who are unable to tolerate dapsone, including sulfapyridine and glucocorticoids. Herein we present two cases of DH with good responses to tetracycline and niacinamide combination therapy. Case 1 was a 42-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with a 3-year history of recurrent pruritic papules and bullous lesions involving the trunk and upper limbs. On examination, the patient showed disseminated erythematous papules on the upper limbs and back as well as vesicles. Nikolsky's sign for vesicles was negative (Figure 1, a-c). The results of routine blood examinations were within normal ranges. He did not have a history of chronic diarrhea. The histologic examination showed subepidermal blisters and accumulation of neutrophils at the papillary dermis of the involved ski. Direct immunofluorescence revealed fibrillar deposition of IgA on the dermal papillae (Figure 1. g, h). Case 2 was a 34-year-old woman who had a history of skin rash and pruritic lesions predominantly involving the arms and legs, which had been present for 10 months. She had been treated with prednisone (30 mg daily) with improvement; however, the lesions reappeared when the prednisone was discontinued. She had a history of constipation. On physical examination, the skin lesions manifested as erythematous papules, vesicles, and scabs on the limbs (Figure 2. a-c). She felt apparently pruritic. The histologic examination of the biopsy identified subepidermal blisters with a neutrophil infiltrate in the upper dermis. Direct immunofluorescence revealed granular deposition of IgA on the dermal papillae (Figure 2. e, f). The results of routine blood examinations were within normal ranges, with the exception of elevated IgE concentration (222.5 ku/L (normal range, 0-100 ku/L)). The clinical manifestations and histologic and immunofluorescence examinations of the two cases confirmed the diagnosis of DH. The two patients were subsequently started on a strict GFD. At that time, dapsone was not available in the hospital. The patients were treated with oral tetracycline (500 mg four times daily) and nicotinamide (500 mg three times daily). The rash affecting case 1 resolved entirely in 2 weeks. The patient discontinued the medications after 6 months, and occasionally presented with a few pruritic papules and vesicles, but the lesions resolved within 1 week. The lesions affecting case 2 completely healed within 1 month. The patient continued taking those medications and no recurrence of the skin lesions occurred during 2 years of follow-up. Dapsone is considered first-line therapy for patients with DH (2). Recent findings have shown dapsone and lower dosages of sulfasalazine combination therapy in DH are effective and well-tolerated (3). Alternative monotherapeutic agents in mild autoimmune bullous diseases such as DH include a tetracycline group of antibiotics with niacinamide or its derivatives as well as sulfasalazine. Because dapsone is difﬁcult to obtain in China except for patients with leprosy, we treated the patients with tetracycline and nicotinamide. To our knowledge, only a few cases of DH have been successfully treated with oral tetracycline and niacinamide (2,4). One of the patients was also prescribed heparin (4). Tetracycline has anti-inflammatory properties due to the inhibition of metalloproteinase activity and mast cell activation (5). Nicotinamide is a potent modulator of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nicotinamide can inhibit cytokine release (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) from immune cells, inhibit chemotaxis and degranulation of immune cells, inhibit lymphocyte blast transformation, and suppress T-cell activity (6). The non-antibiotic properties of tetracycline in combination with nicotinamide may participate in inhibition of antibody formation, modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inﬂammatory cell accumulation, lymphocyte transformation, and T-cell activation. In summary, we reported two typical cases of DH that were successfully treated with oral tetracycline and niacinamide, which completely healed the rash and relieved the symptoms within 1 month. The combination of tetracycline and nicotinamide can be recommended as a useful therapy for patients where dapsone is not available or for patients who do not tolerate dapsone.","['Wang Y', 'Yang B', 'Zhou G', 'Zhang F']",2018,26,3,Acta Dermatovenerol Croat,"Wang Y, et al.

30368309,Celiac Disease in the Pediatric Population.,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the lining of the gastrointestinal tract is damaged by an immune-mediated response to gluten proteins (Allen, 2015). It is a polygenetic disease that only appears in genetically susceptible individuals (Newton & Singer, 2012). It is a worldwide concern, with North America having a high prevalence rate (Liu et al., 2017). Celiac disease can present in a spectrum of manifestations, making it difficult to identify and diagnosis (Reilly & Green, 2012). High-risk populations include those with a positive family history as well as individuals with other autoimmune disorders (Newton & Singer, 2012). Screening and diagnosis are completed with a blood test followed by a biopsy of the small intestinal lining (Zevit & Shamir, 2014). Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a strict, gluten-free diet. Further research is warranted in areas of environmental risk factors and treatments (Allen, 2015; Newton & Singer, 2012).","['Durham J', 'Temples HS']",2018,32,6,J Pediatr Health Care,Durham J and Temples HS.

30275824,Risk Factors Associated with the Occurrence of Autoimmune Diseases in Adult Coeliac Patients.,"OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune diseases (AD) may be associated with coeliac disease (CD), but specific risk factors have been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the spectrum of AD and its specific risk factors associated in a series of adult coeliac patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single-center case-control study including adult newly diagnosed CD patients. To evaluate the risk factors of the association between AD and CD, 341 coeliac patients included were categorized on the basis of AD presence: 91 cases with at least one AD and 250 controls without AD were compared for clinical, serological, and histological features. Eighty-seven cases were age-gender-matched with 87 controls.
RESULTS: Among 341 CD patients, 26.6% of CD patients had at least one AD. Endocrine and dermatological diseases were the most prevalent AD encountered: autoimmune thyroiditis was present in 48.4% of cases, psoriasis in 17.6%, and type I diabetes and dermatitis herpetiformis in 11%, respectively. At logistic regression, factors associated with AD were a positive 1st-degree family history of AD (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.93-7), a body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m
CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with family history of AD, overweight at CD diagnosis, and a delay of CD diagnosis had an increased risk of having another AD. The benefit of CD screening in these specific subsets of patients with AD awaits further investigation.","['Conti L', 'Lahner E', 'Galli G', 'Esposito G', 'Carabotti M', 'Annibale B']",2018,2018,,Gastroenterol Res Pract,"Conti L, et al.

30269455,Therapeutic effect of ascorbic acid on dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia in rats.,"OBJECTIVE: Dapsone (diaminodiphenyl sulfone, DDS) is currently used to treat leprosy, malaria, dermatitis herpetiformis, and other diseases. It is also used to treat pneumocystis pneumonia and Toxoplasma gondii infection in HIV-positive patients. The most common adverse effect of DDS is methemoglobinemia from oxidative stress. Ascorbic acid is an antioxidant and reducing agent that scavenges the free radicals produced by oxidative stress. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of ascorbic acid in the treatment of DDS induced methemoglobinemia.
METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: an ascorbic acid group, a methylene blue (MB) group, and a control group. After DDS (40 mg/kg) treatment via oral gavage, ascorbic acid (15 mg/kg), MB (1 mg/kg), or normal saline were administered via tail vein injection. Depending on the duration of the DDS treatment, blood methemoglobin levels, as well as the nitric oxide levels and catalase activity, were measured at 60, 120, or 180 minutes after DDS administration.
RESULTS: Methemoglobin concentrations in the ascorbic acid and MB groups were significantly lower compared to those in the control group across multiple time points. The plasma nitric oxide levels and catalase activity were not different among the groups or time points.
CONCLUSION: Intravenous ascorbic acid administration is effective in treating DDS-induced methemoglobinemia in a murine model.","['Kang C', 'Kim DH', 'Kim T', 'Lee SH', 'Jeong JH', 'Lee SB', 'Kim JH', 'Jung MH', 'Lee KW', 'Park IS']",2018,5,3,Clin Exp Emerg Med,"Kang C, et al.

BAIDs können in zwei Gruppen eingeteilt werden: Pemphigus-Erkrankungen, die durch intraepidermale Blasenbildung und Autoantikörper gegen desmosomale Proteine wie Desmoglein (Dsg) 1, Dsg3 und Mitglieder der Plakin-Familie charakterisiert sind, sowie subepidermale BAIDs, die Pemphigoid-Erkrankungen und die Dermatitis herpetiformis umfassen. Bei der Dermatitis herpetiformis greifen die Autoantikörper die Transglutaminasen 2 und 3 an, während sie bei Pemphigoid-Erkrankungen gegen Strukturproteine der dermoepidermalen Junktionszone gerichtet sind. Die Analyse einer periläsionalen Biopsie mittels direkter Immunfluoreszenzmikroskopie (IF-Mikroskopie) stellt zwar nach wie vor den diagnostischen Goldstandard dar, mittlerweile sind jedoch verschiedene Tests allgemein verfügbar, die eine serologische Diagnosefindung für den Großteil der Patienten ermöglichen.

30179336,Diagnosis of autoimmune bullous diseases.,"Autoimmune bullous disorders (AIBDs) are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases clinically characterized by erosions and/or blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. AIBDs can be categorized into two groups: pemphigus diseases, characterized by intraepidermal blistering and autoantibodies against desmosomal proteins such as desmoglein (Dsg) 1, Dsg3, members of the plakin family, and subepidermal AIBDs, comprised of pemphigoid diseases and dermatitis herpetiformis. Autoantibodies in dermatitis herpetiformis target transglutaminases 2 and 3, while in pemphigoid disease, autoantibodies are directed against structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction. Although analysis of a perilesional biopsy with direct immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy is still the diagnostic gold standard, several assays have become widely available that allow serological diagnosis in the majority of patients. Standard serological diagnosis includes indirect IF on monkey esophagus and salt-split human skin. Assays to further characterize autoantibody specificity include ELISA systems based on recombinant forms of the immunodominant regions of the target antigens as well as multivariant indirect IF microscopy tests with several miniature substrates. These serological assays are complemented by various in-house assays using immunoblotting and ELISA, which are only available in specialized laboratories.

30099930,Coeliac disease.,"Coeliac disease (CD) develops in genetically susceptible individuals who, in response to unclear environmental triggers, develop an immune response triggered by gluten ingestion. It is now recognised as a global disease affecting about 0.7% of the world's population. The clinical presentation ranges from malabsorption to asymptomatic individuals diagnosed by screening high-risk groups. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of small intestinal villous atrophy in the presence of circulating coeliac auto-antibodies and/or an unequivocal response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Recent guidelines suggest that, in a subset of children, duodenal biopsies can be avoided in the presence of strict symptomatic and serological criteria. While the majority of patients respond to a GFD, up to 20% of patients with CD have persistent or recurrent symptoms.

30064599,The Value of Etiological Tests and Skin Biopsy in the Management of Prurigo Simplex Subacuta.,"It has been emphasized that prurigo simplex subacuta may be associated with various disorders and may be clinically confused with dermatitis herpetiformis. Aim of the study was to evaluate the value of our set of tests for finding possible associations and for the aforementioned differential diagnosis. Rates of implementations and abnormal results in our set of tests, including skin prick test, skin biopsy, complete blood count, blood chemistry panel, and psychiatric evaluation were analyzed retrospectively between the years of 2010 and 2015 in 130 patients clinically diagnosed with prurigo simplex subacuta. The set of tests was implemented completely in 43.8% patients and with only a single missing test in 31.5% of the patients. The least implemented procedure was psychiatric evaluation (66.9%). The most commonly found issues were psychiatric abnormalities (55.2% of 87 psychiatrically evaluated patients) and atopy (53.8% of 104 skin prick tested patients). The most common finding suggestive of internal diseases was hyperglycemia (25.4% of 130 patients). It was a striking result that hematological malignancies were suspected upon complete blood count and peripheral blood smear and confirmed by further investigations in 4 of 102 patients. Dermatitis herpetiformis was diagnosed in 2 of 120 skin biopsied patients. Because of the substantial rate of implementation, the high frequencies of psychiatric abnormalities and atopy, and detection of hematological malignancies and dermatitis herpetiformis even in just a few patients, we recommend our set of tests for patients clinically diagnosed as prurigo simplex subacuta.","['Topal SG', 'Karakuş G', 'Karaman BF', 'Yücel A', 'Aksungur VL']",2017,25,4,Acta Dermatovenerol Croat,"Topal SG, et al.

We aimed to analyze the epidemiological, clinical, and immunological presentation and management of the disease in a cohort of south Tunisian patients with a long-term follow-up.
METHODS: We included all patients with confirmed PH followed from January 1987 to December 2015 in the dermatology department.
RESULTS: We included 24 south Tunisian female patients with a mean age of 36 years (20-63), mainly from rural origin (84%). All patients had exclusive skin lesions. Clinical features combined erythematous, vesicular, or bullous lesions, with circinate borders mainly on the trunk and limbs associated with severe pruritus (91%). Peripheral hypereosinophilia was noted in 31% of cases. Histological examination demonstrated no intraepithelial (50%), suprabasal (35%), or subcorneal cleavage (15%). Eosinophilic spongiosis was seen in 42% of cases. On direct immunofluorescence, there was an intercellular staining in 96% of cases composed mainly of IgG and C3 (79%). Indirect immunofluorescence was positive in 71% of cases. Reactivity was mainly directed against Dsg1. Dapsone alone was inefficient. All patients received systemic corticosteroids. Most patients (64%) relapsed. Iatrogenic complications and cutaneous infections were noted in 40% and 16% of cases, respectively.
CONCLUSION: PH is characterized by the occurrence of exclusive skin lesions in young women with a good response to corticosteroids but not to Dapsone. Reactivity mainly against Dsg1 suggests that PH in south Tunisia is a particular variant of nonendemic pemphigus foliaceus.","['Jerbi A', 'Hachicha H', 'Feki S', 'Bahloul E', 'Sellami K', 'Abida O', 'Charfi S', 'Bouzid A', 'Sellami Boudawara T', 'Turki H', 'Masmoudi A', 'Masmoudi H']",2018,57,9,Int J Dermatol,"Jerbi A, et al.

The presence of granular IgA deposits, detected by direct immunofluorescence, is the hallmark of dermatitis herpetiformis; nevertheless, IgA deposits have also been demonstrated in healthy skin of patients with coeliac disease. The main objective of this study was to investigate whether IgA deposits could be found in the skin of patients with coeliac disease who have non-dermatitis herpetiformis inflammatory skin diseases. Direct immunofluorescence was performed on perilesional skin biopsies of 6 patients with coeliac disease with non-dermatitis herpetiformis inflammatory skin diseases and, as control, on 12 non-coeliac patients with inflammatory skin diseases. IgA deposits were found in all of the patients with coeliac disease, but were absent in the control group. In conclusion, IgA deposits may be considered an immunopathological marker for coeliac disease; therefore, patients with coeliac disease showing skin manifestations with positive direct immunofluorescence should be investigated carefully in order to make a differential diagnosis between dermatitis herpetiformis and other non-dermatitis herpetiformis inflammatory skin diseases.","['Bonciolini V', 'Antiga E', 'Bianchi B', 'Del Bianco E', 'Ninci A', 'Maio V', 'Pimpinelli N', 'Caproni M']",2019,99,1,Acta Derm Venereol,"Bonciolini V, et al.

29948572,Thyroid diseases and skin autoimmunity.,"The skin is the largest organ of the body, at the boundary with the outside environment. Primarily, it provides a physical and chemical barrier against external insults, but it can act also as immune organ because it contains a whole host of immune-competent cells of both the innate and the adaptive immune systems, which cooperate in eliminating invading pathogens following tissue injury. On the other hand, improper skin immune responses lead to autoimmune skin diseases (AISD), such as pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, vitiligo, and alopecia. Although the interplay among genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors has been shown to play a major role in AISD etiology and progression, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease development are far from being fully elucidated. In this context, epidemiological studies aimed at defining the association of different AISD with other autoimmune pathologies revealed possible shared molecular mechanism(s) responsible for disease progression. In particular, over the last decades, a number of reports have highlighted a significant association between thyroid diseases (TD), mainly autoimmune ones (AITD), and AISD. Here, we will recapitulate the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and pathogenesis of the main AISD, and we will summarize the epidemiological evidence showing the associations with TD as well as possible molecular mechanism(s) underlying TD and AISD pathological manifestations.","['Baldini E', 'Odorisio T', 'Tuccilli C', 'Persechino S', 'Sorrenti S', 'Catania A', 'Pironi D', 'Carbotta G', 'Giacomelli L', 'Arcieri S', 'Vergine M', 'Monti M', 'Ulisse S']",2018,19,4,Rev Endocr Metab Disord,"Baldini E, et al.

29946113,Granzyme B is elevated in autoimmune blistering diseases and cleaves key anchoring proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction.,"In healthy skin, epidermis and dermis are anchored together at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), a specialized basement membrane pivotal for skin integrity and function. However, increased inflammation in the DEJ is associated with the disruption and separation of this junction and sub-epidermal blistering. Granzyme B (GzmB) is a serine protease secreted by immune cells. Dysregulated inflammation may lead to increased GzmB accumulation and proteolysis in the extracellular milieu. Although elevated GzmB is observed at the level of the DEJ in inflammatory and blistering skin conditions, the present study is the first to explore GzmB in the context of DEJ degradation in autoimmune sub-epidermal blistering. In the present study, GzmB induced separation of the DEJ in healthy human skin. Subsequently, α6/β4 integrin, collagen VII, and collagen XVII were identified as extracellular substrates for GzmB through western blot, and specific cleavage sites were identified by mass spectrometry. In human bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, GzmB was elevated at the DEJ when compared to healthy samples, while α6/β4 integrin, collagen VII, and collagen XVII were reduced or absent in the area of blistering. In summary, our results suggest that regardless of the initial causation of sub-epidermal blistering, GzmB activity is a common final pathway that could be amenable to a single targeted treatment approach.","['Russo V', 'Klein T', 'Lim DJ', 'Solis N', 'Machado Y', 'Hiroyasu S', 'Nabai L', 'Shen Y', 'Zeglinski MR', 'Zhao H', 'Oram CP', 'Lennox PA', 'Van Laeken N', 'Carr NJ', 'Crawford RI', 'Franzke CW', 'Overall CM', 'Granville DJ']",2018,8,1,Sci Rep,"Russo V, et al.

His complaints were dizziness and intermittent palpitations for the last two years. No precipitating cause could be identified. He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath or syncope. He had a background of schizophrenia, epilepsy, coeliac disease, depression and dermatitis herpetiformis. He was on dapsone, venlafaxine, procyclidine, furosemide, diazepam, omeprazole, meloxicam and folic acid. On examination, his pulse was 82 beats per minute, blood pressure 131/74 mm of Hg, respiratory rate was 14/minute and his saturations on room air were 94%. Neurologic, cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination was unremarkable. His investigations showed Hb of 121g/L (130-180) WCC 7.8*10 g/L (4-11), platelets 182*10 (150-400), MCV 83 fl (80-100), TSH 2.53 mU/L (0.4-4.0 mU/L), anti TTG 14.9 (normal). Renal, liver function, serum folate, vitamin B12 and complement levels were within normal limits with a negative ANCA and ANA. His oral glucose tolerance test was negative for diabetes with fasting and twohour post prandial blood sugar of 4.8mmol/L and 6.9 mmol/L respectively. Because of the history of chronic Dapsone use and possibility of drug induced low HbA1C, patient was investigated along those lines. The low Hba1c was attributed to haemolysis secondary to dapsone. HbA1c improved to 42 mmol/mol within three months following discontinuation of dapsone. His haemoglobin level also normalized (142 g/L). Clinicians should consider haemolysis as a possible factor falsely reducing HbA1c while interpreting results in these patients.

Many patients with CD do not report gastrointestinal symptoms making it difficult to reach an early diagnosis. On the other hand, CD is related to a wide spectrum of extra-intestinal manifestations, with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) being the best characterized. These associated conditions may be the clue to reaching the diagnosis of CD. Over the last few years, there have been multiple reports of the association between CD and several cutaneous manifestations that may improve with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The presence of some of these skin diseases, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, should give rise to an appropriate screening method for CD. The aim of this paper is to describe the different cutaneous manifestations that have been associated with CD and the possible mechanisms involved.","['Rodrigo L', 'Beteta-Gorriti V', 'Alvarez N', 'Gómez de Castro C', 'de Dios A', 'Palacios L', 'Santos-Juanes J']",2018,10,7,Nutrients,"Rodrigo L, et al.

29757210,Dermatitis Herpetiformis: A Common Extraintestinal Manifestation of Coeliac Disease.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a common extraintestinal manifestation of coeliac disease presenting with itchy papules and vesicles on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Overt gastrointestinal symptoms are rare. Diagnosis of DH is easily confirmed by immunofluorescence biopsy showing pathognomonic granular immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits in the papillary dermis. A valid hypothesis for the immunopathogenesis of DH is that it starts from latent or manifest coeliac disease in the gut and evolves into an immune complex deposition of high avidity IgA epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) antibodies, together with the TG3 enzyme, in the papillary dermis. The mean age at DH diagnosis has increased significantly in recent decades and presently is 40⁻50 years. The DH to coeliac disease prevalence ratio is 1:8 in Finland and the United Kingdom (U.K.). The annual DH incidence rate, currently 2.7 per 100,000 in Finland and 0.8 per 100,000 in the U.K., is decreasing, whereas the reverse is true for coeliac disease. The long-term prognosis of DH patients on a gluten-free diet is excellent, with the mortality rate being even lower than for the general population.","['Reunala T', 'Salmi TT', 'Hervonen K', 'Kaukinen K', 'Collin P']",2018,10,5,Nutrients,"Reunala T, et al.

29752728,A retrospective study of dermatitis herpetiformis from an immunobullous disease clinic in north India.,"BACKGROUND: Indian data on dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is not available. The aim of this study was to investigate the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with DH and to study its association with other autoimmune diseases.
METHODS: All data were collected from case record forms of patients registered in immunobullous disease clinic of our institute. The diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical and immuno/histopathological features.
RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included, which constituted 9.47% of the registered patients in the immunobullous disease clinic over 3.5 years. The male to female ratio was 1.4 : 1; the average age was 44.35 ± 15.52 years. Direct immunofluorescence showed granular IgA deposits at the papillary tips in 83.07% and basement membrane zone in 12.3% patients. Sixteen (24.1%) patients had associated celiac disease, and 15 (23.07%) patients had other autoimmune comorbidities such as hypothyroidism. Forty percent of patients on strict gluten-free diet achieved remission in 2 years, while 35.4% had frequent relapses as they continued gluten intake.
CONCLUSIONS: Dermatitis herpetiformis is not a rare disease in northern India as previously believed. The clinical, histological, and immunopathological characteristics of Indian DH patients are similar to those reported in Caucasian populations.

29662290,Extra-intestinal manifestations of non-celiac gluten sensitivity: An expanding paradigm.,"Non celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by a cohort of symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food in subjects who are not affected by celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy. The possibility of systemic manifestations in this condition has been suggested by some reports. In most cases they are characterized by vague symptoms such as 'foggy mind', headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness even if more specific complaints have been described. NCGS has an immune-related background. Indeed there is a strong evidence that a selective activation of innate immunity may be the trigger for NCGS inflammatory response. The most commonly autoimmune disorders associated to NCGS are Hashimoto thyroiditis, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis and rheumatologic diseases. The predominance of Hashimoto thyroiditis represents an interesting finding, since it has been indirectly confirmed by an Italian study, showing that autoimmune thyroid disease is a risk factor for the evolution towards NCGS in a group of patients with minimal duodenal inflammation. On these bases, an autoimmune stigma in NCGS is strongly supported; it could be a characteristic feature that could help the diagnosis and be simultaneously managed. A possible neurological involvement has been underlined by NCGS association with gluten ataxia, gluten neuropathy and gluten encephalopathy. NCGS patients may show even psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety and psychosis. Finally, a link with functional disorders (irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia) is a topic under discussion. In conclusion, the novelty of this matter has generated an expansion of literature data with the unavoidable consequence that some reports are often based on low levels of evidence. Therefore, only studies performed on large samples with the inclusion of control groups will be able to clearly establish whether the large information from the literature regarding extra-intestinal NCGS manifestations could be supported by evidence-based agreements.","['Losurdo G', 'Principi M', 'Iannone A', 'Amoruso A', 'Ierardi E', 'Di Leo A', 'Barone M']",2018,24,14,World J Gastroenterol,"Losurdo G, et al.

29577349,Natural history and clinical detection of undiagnosed coeliac disease in a North American community.,"BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is a substantially underdiagnosed disorder, with clinical testing currently guided by case finding.
AIM: To determine the presence of indications for diagnostic testing and frequency of clinical testing in undiagnosed coeliac disease.
METHODS: This was a case-control study of adults without prior diagnosis of coeliac disease. Undiagnosed cases were identified through sequential serology, and unaffected age- and gender-matched controls were selected. Medical records were systematically reviewed for indications for and evidence of clinical testing.
RESULTS: Of 47 557 adults, 408 cases of undiagnosed coeliac disease were identified. 408 serology negative matched controls were selected. Eight-matched pairs were excluded, leading to 800 included individuals (61% female; median age 44.2 years). The odds of any indication for clinical testing were similar among undiagnosed coeliac disease and controls (odds ratio (OR) 1.18; 95% CI: 0.85-1.63, P = 0.32). Most individual indications were not associated with serologic status. Exceptions to this include hypothyroidism, which was more likely in cases of undiagnosed coeliac disease, and dyspepsia and chronic diarrhoea, which were less likely. Cases of undiagnosed coeliac disease were more likely to develop osteoporosis (P = 0.005), dermatitis herpetiformis (P = 0.006), chronic fatigue (P = 0.033), thyroiditis (P = 0.003), autoimmune diseases (P = 0.008), and have a family member diagnosed with coeliac disease (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study strongly suggests that current case finding is not effective in detecting undiagnosed coeliac disease. Individuals with undiagnosed coeliac disease were more likely than controls to develop indications for testing overtime. A more effective method for detection of coeliac disease is needed.","['Hujoel IA', 'Van Dyke CT', 'Brantner T', 'Larson J', 'King KS', 'Sharma A', 'Murray JA', 'Rubio-Tapia A']",2018,47,10,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,"Hujoel IA, et al.

29573413,Herpetiform pemphigus with characteristic transmission electron microscopic findings of various-sized ballooning vacuoles in keratinocytes without acantholysis.,"We report a unique case of a Japanese woman with herpetiform pemphigus (HP) who had IgG autoantibodies reactive with nondesmosomal sites of keratinocytes and presented characteristic transmission electron microscopic (TEM) findings of various-sized vacuoles in keratinocytes without acantholysis. The patient presented with pruritic annular oedematous erythemas with small blisters lining the margins on the trunk and extremities. Histopathological examinations showed intraepidermal blisters with prominent infiltrations of eosinophils. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence tests revealed the presence of in vivo bound and circulating IgG autoantibodies to the keratinocyte cell surfaces. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for desmoglein (Dsg) 1, Dsg3 and desmocollins 1-3 showed negative results. Immunoblotting using the full-length human Dsg1 recombinant protein showed a positive band. TEM examination showed various-sized vacuoles squashing the nuclei in many keratinocytes, resulting in rupture of the cells. Immunoelectron microscopic examination revealed IgG deposition over the entire keratinocyte cell surfaces, which spared the desmosomes. IgG antibodies were also present on the inside walls of the vacuoles around the nuclei of keratinocytes and on the cell surfaces of infiltrating eosinophils. This patient also had marked eosinophilia and high levels of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and interleukin-5 in the serum. These results indicated a novel autoantigen on the nondesmosomal keratinocyte cell surfaces and the pathogenesis of bullous spongiotic change with inflammation in HP.","['Ishiura N', 'Tamura-Nakano M', 'Okochi H', 'Tateishi C', 'Maki M', 'Shimoda Y', 'Ishii N', 'Hashimoto T', 'Tamaki T']",2019,180,1,Br J Dermatol,"Ishiura N, et al.

29566927,Blistering diseases in the mature patient.,"Autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBD) are a group of chronic diseases affecting the skin and mucous membranes, with different presentation, clinical course, histologic and immunopathologic findings, and different therapeutic approach. Blisters develop as a result of autoantibodies directed against distinct adhesion structures within desmosomes or within the basement membrane zone. The most common AIBD that develops in the elderly is bullous pemphigoid (previously also named ""pemphigoid senilis""), but mature patients can also present with other AIBD as mucous membrane pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, paraneoplastic pemphigus, pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, linear IgA dermatosis, and dermatitis herpetiformis. There are no differences in treatment approach to mature patients with AIBD, but due to more common comorbidities, systemic therapy should be given with more caution and control, and due to distorted skin integrity in the aged skin, the safety concerns are increased with the long-term use of any topical medication.","['Lakoš Jukić I', 'Jerković Gulin S', 'Marinović B']",2018,36,2,Clin Dermatol,"Lakoš Jukić I, et al.

29531885,Translational Chemistry Meets Gluten-Related Disorders.,"Gluten-related disorders are a complex group of diseases that involve the activation of the immune system triggered by the ingestion of gluten. Among these, celiac disease, with a prevalence of 1 %, is the most investigated, but recently, a new pathology, named nonceliac gluten sensitivity, was reported with a general prevalence of 7 %. Finally, there other less-prevalent gluten-related diseases such as wheat allergy, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis (with an overall prevalence of less than 0.1 %). As mentioned, the common molecular trigger is gluten, a complex mixture of storage proteins present in wheat, barley, and a variety of oats that are not fully degraded by humans. The most-studied protein related to disease is gliadin, present in wheat, which possesses in its sequence many pathological fragments. Despite a lot of effort to treat these disorders, the only effective method is a long-life gluten-free diet. This Review summarizes the actual knowledge of gluten-related disorders from a translational chemistry point of view. We discuss what is currently known from the literature about the interaction of gluten with the gut and the critical host responses it evokes and, finally, connect them to our current and novel molecular understanding of the supramolecular organization of gliadin and the 33-mer gliadin peptide fragment under physiological conditions.","['Lammers KM', 'Herrera MG', 'Dodero VI']",2018,7,3,ChemistryOpen,"Lammers KM, et al.

In addition, atypical presentations of scabies can masquerade as dermatitis herpetiformis, ecchymosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, urticaria, and urticaria pigmentosa. A 59-year-old male presented with non-pruritic papulosquamous plaques on his chest, abdomen, and back resembling lesions of pityriasis rosea in morphology and distribution. The complete cutaneous examination also demonstrated burrows on his finger webs. A mineral oil preparation of skin scrapings showed scabies mites, ova, and scybala. His infestation resolved after the treatment with topical permethrin 5% cream and oral ivermectin 15 mg on days one and eight. In conclusion, scabies surrepticius is a term that has recently been established to unify not only the numerous variants but also the atypical presentations of scabies. The inaccurate diagnosis of scabies infestation can lead to increased medical costs and the side effects of unnecessary tests and the treatment.

29422292,Autoinflammatory keratinization diseases: An emerging concept encompassing various inflammatory keratinization disorders of the skin.,"Classifying inflammatory skin diseases is challenging, especially for the expanding group of disorders triggered by genetic factors resulting in hyperactivated innate immunity that result in overlapping patterns of dermal and epidermal inflammation with hyperkeratosis. For such conditions, the umbrella term ""autoinflammatory keratinization diseases"" (AIKD) has been proposed. AIKD encompasses diseases with mixed pathomechanisms of autoinflammation and autoimmunity, and includes IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra)-related pustulosis, CARD14-mediated pustular psoriasis, pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) type V, and familial keratosis lichenoides chronica (KLC). Mechanistically, the entities include generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) without psoriasis vulgaris, impetigo herpetiformis and acrodermatitis continua, which are IL-36Ra-related pustuloses caused by loss-of-function mutations in IL36RN; GPP with psoriasis vulgaris and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis which are CARD14-mediated pustular psoriasiform dermatoses with gain-of-function variants of CARD14; PRP type V which is caused by gain-of-function mutations in CARD14; and, familial KLC in which mutations in NLRP1, an inflammasome sensor protein predominantly expressed in skin, have been identified. It is likely that further inflammatory keratinization disorders will also fall within the concept of AIKD, as elucidation of novel pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory keratinization diseases emerges. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of AIKD is likely to lead to innovative, targeted therapies that benefit patients.","['Akiyama M', 'Takeichi T', 'McGrath JA', 'Sugiura K']",2018,90,2,J Dermatol Sci,"Akiyama M, et al.

29417981,"Immunoexpression of IgA receptors (CD89, CD71) in dermatitis herpetiformis.","INTRODUCTION: The role of IgA receptors in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) pathogenesis is still unknown. CD89 and CD71 may be associated with immune response during DH development. The purpose of this study was to perform semiquantitative analysis of simultaneous immunoexpression of CD89 and CD71 in DH and IgA/neutrophil-mediated non-DH dermatoses (IgAN) in relation to specific IgA autoantibodies/antibodies (tissue and epidermal transglutaminases, nonapeptides of gliadin - eTG/tTG/npG) as well neutrophil activation via the release of neutrophil elastase (NE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 48 patients were studied. The study was conducted on skin lesions and sera obtained from DH and IgAN patients. DH and IgAN served as mutually positive control groups. We used immunohistochemical technique with semiquantitative digital morphometry and ELISA to measure serum levels of anti-eTG/tTG/npG IgA.
RESULTS: CD89 showed a significantly higher expression in DH than in IgAN. CD71 was overexpressed in DH and IgAN. CD89 immunoexpression correlated negatively with CD71 in IgAN. A positive correlation was revealed between CD89 immunoexpression and anti-npG IgA in DH. No statistically significant correlations were found in DH between the CD89/CD71 and NE immunoexpression, between CD71 immunoexpression and anti-tTG/eTG/npG IgA, or between CD89 immunoexpression and anti-eTG/tTG IgA serum levels.
CONCLUSIONS: CD89 is probably a key IgA Fc receptor in DH development, where it is associated with immune response to gluten. CD71 may be linked with inflammation in DH and IgAN. We suggest that interaction between CD89 and CD71 can modulate the inflammation in IgAN.","['Gornowicz-Porowska J', 'Seraszek-Jaros A', 'Bowszyc-Dmochowska M', 'Kaczmarek E', 'Dmochowski M']",2017,55,4,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,"Gornowicz-Porowska J, et al.

29301808,"Skin and coeliac disease, a lot to think about: a case series.","Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease, characterised by a permanent sensitivity to gluten. It is being progressively recognised as a multisystemic disease, with multiple extraintestinal manifestations. Skin conditions (eg, dermatitis herpetiformis) are an example of its manifestations; however, its underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. This article presents three cases of uncommon skin conditions in patients with a history of CD. Two of them concern linear IgA bullous dermatosis and erythema nodosum, which have been described in the literature as having potential associations with CD, though only a few cases were reported. The third case corresponds to pityriasis lichenoides-a rare lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown aetiology-, which has no correlation with CD in the literature reviewed. The authors aim to draw attention to the possibility of CD as a potential predisposing factor for the occurrence of these skin diseases.","['Vaz SO', 'Franco C', 'Santos P', 'Amaral R']",2018,2018,,BMJ Case Rep,"Vaz SO, et al.

29293478,Expression of Elafin in Dermatitis Herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Elafin is a serine protease inhibitor that has various epithelial cell regulatory and immunomodulatory effects including inactivation of neutrophil elastases. This later role originated the interest of elafin in certain neutrophil-rich dermatoses. Interestingly, it has been speculated that elafin has a protective role by slowing the deamidation process of gliadin in celiac disease (CD), despite the typical absence of neutrophils in intestinal histologic samplings. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic recurrent vesicular dermatitis associated with gluten hypersensitivity and also characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate and granular immunoglobulin A deposits in papillary dermis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 31 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin specimens of DH that demonstrated typical immunopathologic findings and probed them with rabbit polyclonal immunoglobulinG antielafin antibodies through standard immunohistochemistry analysis. Negative controls consisted of normal skin from elbow and knee surgical re-excisions specimen lacking residual tumor. Positive controls included skin biopsies of active plaque psoriasis, Sweet syndrome, and pyoderma gangrenosum.
RESULTS: Similar to what has been previously reported in intestinal sampling of patients with active CD, abnormal expression of elafin was noted in virtually all probed skin biopsies of DH patients with active cutaneous disease.
CONCLUSION: Under normal circumstances, keratinocytes overexpress elafin to downregulate a neutrophil mediated inflammatory response. The deficient expression of elafin in the aforementioned probed DH specimens correlates with previous similar elafin underexpression in intestinal samples of active CD. These histological findings suggest that these 2 gluten mediated disorders carry an abnormal elafin underexpression during disease activity.","['Ollague JE', 'Nousari CH']",2018,40,1,Am J Dermatopathol,Ollague JE and Nousari CH.

Irregular functioning of the cascade may contribute to pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases; however, there are no reports concerning autoimmune bullous diseases yet to be published. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of proteins constituting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in skin lesions and perilesional area in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and bullous pemphigoid (BP), as well as in the control group. Skin biopsies were collected from 21 DH patients, from 20 BP patients, and from 10 healthy volunteers. The localization and expression of selected STAT and JAK proteins were examined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. We found significantly higher expression of JAK/STAT proteins in skin lesions in patients with BP and DH, in comparison to perilesional skin and the control group, which may be related to proinflammatory cytokine network and induction of inflammatory infiltrate in tissues. Our findings suggest that differences in the JAK and STAT expression may be related to distinct cytokines activating them and mediating neutrophilic and/or eosinophilic infiltrate.","['Juczynska K', 'Wozniacka A', 'Waszczykowska E', 'Danilewicz M', 'Wagrowska-Danilewicz M', 'Wieczfinska J', 'Pawliczak R', 'Zebrowska A']",2017,2017,,Mediators Inflamm,"Juczynska K, et al.

29182792,Ex vivo Culture of Duodenal Biopsies from Patients with Dermatitis Herpetiformis Indicates that Transglutaminase 3 Antibody Production Occurs in the Gut.,"Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) are characterized by autoantibodies targeting transglutaminase (TG)2 and TG3, respectively. Previous studies show that TG2 antibodies are produced in the gut and can be assessed in organ culture of small-intestinal biopsies from patients with coeliac disease. Thus far, no studies have investigated TG3 antibodies in organ culture of biopsies from patients with DH, or exploited the method in DH. The aim of this study was to investigate TG3 and TG2 antibody responses in serum and small-intestinal biopsies from patients with DH with active disease, and from those in remission. The majority of patients with DH were negative for both serum and organ culture medium TG2-targeting antibodies. Surprisingly, patients with active DH secreted TG3 antibodies into the culture medium despite seronegativity. In patients secreting high levels of TG3 antibodies into the culture medium, we also detected TG3-antibody-positive cells in the small-intestinal mucosa. These findings suggest that TG3 antibodies can be investigated in the organ culture system and that their secretion occurs in the small intestine, especially in active DH.","['Hietikko M', 'Hervonen K', 'Ilus T', 'Salmi T', 'Huhtala H', 'Laurila K', 'Rauhavirta T', 'Reunala T', 'Kaukinen K', 'Lindfors K']",2018,98,3,Acta Derm Venereol,"Hietikko M, et al.

The highest currently reported prevalence of DH is in Finland, but knowledge of diagnostic delay is limited. This study investigated the duration of rash prior to diagnosis in 446 patients with DH, analysing the results in 3 periods of 15 years. The diagnosis was considered delayed when the duration of rash before diagnosis was 2 years or longer. Factors associated with delayed diagnosis were analysed. Within the 45 years, the median duration of rash before diagnosis decreased significantly, from 12.0 to 8.0 months (p?=?0.002) and the occurrence of a delayed diagnosis decreased from 47% to 25% (p?=?0.002). Female sex, the presence of villous atrophy, and a diagnosis of DH before the year 2000 were significantly associated with delayed diagnosis. In conclusion, the present study showed that one-quarter of patients currently have a diagnostic delay of 2 years or more, which is far from ideal.","['Mansikka E', 'Salmi T', 'Kaukinen K', 'Collin P', 'Huhtala H', 'Reunala T', 'Hervonen K']",2018,98,2,Acta Derm Venereol,"Mansikka E, et al.

The examined material consisted of skin/mucosal tissues and sera. In total, 87 patients were studied. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections with quantitative digital morphometry was used to measure the intensity of CD32A/CD89/NE expressions. Levels of anti-DSG1/DSG3 IgG, anti-BP180/BP230 IgG, and anti-npG/tTG/eTG IgA were evaluated with ELISAs. CD32A was abundantly expressed in cutaneous lesions in pemphigus and BP. We found no statistically significant correlation between the CD32A/CD89 and NE expression intensities in pemphigus, BP, and DH. There was a significant correlation between CD89 expression and anti-npG IgA in DH. Our results revealed a lack of correlation between CD32A expressions and anti-DSG1/DSG3 IgG levels in pemphigus, anti-BP180/BP230 IgG in BP as well as CD89 expression and anti-tTG/eTG IgA in DH. CD89 seems to be linked with gluten intolerance in DH rather than with proteolytic destruction of dermal-epidermal junction.

28974086,Renal disease in patients with celiac disease.,"Celiac disease, an inflammatory disease of small bowel caused by sensitivity to dietary gluten and related protein, affects approximately 0.5-1% of the population in the Western world. Extra-intestinal symptoms and associated diseases are increasingly recognized including diabetes mellitus type 1, thyroid disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and ataxia. There have also been a number of reports of various types of renal involvement in patients with celiac disease including diabetes nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome related to malabsorption, oxalate nephropathy, and associations of celiac disease with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease.

28962565,A novel data-driven workflow combining literature and electronic health records to estimate comorbidities burden for a specific disease: a case study on autoimmune comorbidities in patients with celiac disease.,"BACKGROUND: Data collected in EHRs have been widely used to identifying specific conditions; however there is still a need for methods to define comorbidities and sources to identify comorbidities burden. We propose an approach to assess comorbidities burden for a specific disease using the literature and EHR data sources in the case of autoimmune diseases in celiac disease (CD).
METHODS: We generated a restricted set of comorbidities using the literature (via the MeSH® co-occurrence file). We extracted the 15 most co-occurring autoimmune diseases of the CD. We used mappings of the comorbidities to EHR terminologies: ICD-10 (billing codes), ATC (drugs) and UMLS (clinical reports). Finally, we extracted the concepts from the different data sources. We evaluated our approach using the correlation between prevalence estimates in our cohort and co-occurrence ranking in the literature.
RESULTS: We retrieved the comorbidities for 741 patients with CD. 18.1% of patients had at least one of the 15 studied autoimmune disorders. Overall, 79.3% of the mapped concepts were detected only in text, 5.3% only in ICD codes and/or drugs prescriptions, and 15.4% could be found in both sources. Prevalence in our cohort were correlated with literature (Spearman's coefficient 0.789, p = 0.0005). The three most prevalent comorbidities were thyroiditis 12.6% (95% CI 10.1-14.9), type 1 diabetes 2.3% (95% CI 1.2-3.4) and dermatitis herpetiformis 2.0% (95% CI 1.0-3.0).
CONCLUSION: We introduced a process that leveraged the MeSH terminology to identify relevant autoimmune comorbidities of the CD and several data sources from EHRs to phenotype a large population of CD patients. We achieved prevalence estimates comparable to the literature.","['Escudié JB', 'Rance B', 'Malamut G', 'Khater S', 'Burgun A', 'Cellier C', 'Jannot AS']",2017,17,1,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,"Escudié JB, et al.

28940785,Transglutaminases in autoimmune and inherited skin diseases: The phenomena of epitope spreading and functional compensation.,"Transglutaminases (TGs) are structurally and functionally related enzymes that modify the post-translational structure and activity of proteins or peptides, and thus are able to turn on or switch off their function. Depending on location and activities, TGs are able to modify the signalling, the function and the fate of cells and extracellular connective tissues. Besides mouse models, human diseases enable us to appreciate the function of various TGs. In this study, skin diseases induced by genetic damages or autoimmune targeting of these enzymes will be discussed. TG1, TG3 and TG5 contribute to the cutaneous barrier and thus to the integrity and function of epidermis. TGM1 mutations related to autosomal recessive ichthyosis subtypes, TGM5 mutations to a mild epidermolysis bullosa phenotype and as novelty TGM3 mutation to uncombable hair syndrome will be discussed. Autoimmunity to TG2, TG3 and TG6 may develop in a few of those genetically determined individuals who lost tolerance to gluten, and manifest as coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis or gluten-dependent neurological symptoms, respectively. These gluten responder diseases commonly occur in combination. In autoimmune diseases, the epitope spreading is remarkable, while in some inherited pathologies, a unique compensation of the lost enzyme function is noted.","['Kárpáti S', 'Sárdy M', 'Németh K', 'Mayer B', 'Smyth N', 'Paulsson M', 'Traupe H']",2018,27,8,Exp Dermatol,"Kárpáti S, et al.

28940562,"Declining trend in the incidence of biopsy-verified coeliac disease in the adult population of Finland, 2005-2014.","BACKGROUND: The frequency of coeliac disease (CD) has been on the rise over the past decades, especially in Western Europe, but current trends are unclear.
AIM: To research the recent temporal changes in the incidence of adult, biopsy-verified coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) in Finland, a country with a high frequency of coeliac disease.
METHODS: All coeliac disease and DH cases diagnosed at age 20-79 years during 2005-2014 were retrieved from a nationwide database documenting all applicants for monthly compensation to cover the extra cost of maintaining a gluten-free diet. This benefit is granted on the basis of histology, not socioeconomic status. Temporal trends in the annual incidences were estimated using Poisson regression analyses.
RESULTS: The total incidence of coeliac disease decreased from 33/100 000 during the years 2005-2006 to 29/100 000 during 2013-2014. The mean annual incidence of coeliac disease was nearly twice as high among women as among men, 42 vs 22 per 100 000, respectively. For middle- and old-aged women, the average rate of decrease in incidence was 4.8% (95% CI 3.9-5.7) per year and for men 3.0% (1.8-4.1) (P for linear trend <.001, for both). Similarly, the annual incidence of DH declined. For young adults, the rate of change remained low and nonsignificant throughout the period 2005-2014.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the awareness of coeliac disease has increased during the past decades, the incidence of biopsy-verified diagnoses is not increasing, which suggests that exposure to yet unidentified triggering factors for coeliac disease has plateaued among the Finnish adult population.","['Virta LJ', 'Saarinen MM', 'Kolho KL']",2017,46,11-12,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,"Virta LJ, et al.

28856676,Trichoscopy - a useful tool in the preliminary differential diagnosis of autoimmune bullous diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Scalp is a common location of autoimmune bullous diseases. Trichoscopy is a noninvasive method for diagnosing hair and scalp diseases. Data on trichoscopy in autoimmune bullous diseases are limited to the studies on pemphigus including a small number of patients. Trichoscopic characteristics of bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis were not reported to date. The aim of the study was to determine the value of trichoscopy in the differential diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis.
METHODS: Trichoscopy was used to evaluate scalp lesions in 68 patients (26 with pemphigus vulgaris, 17 with pemphigus foliaceus, 17 with bullous pemphigoid, and 8 with dermatitis herpetiformis). The working magnification was 20-fold and 70-fold.
RESULTS: The most frequent trichoscopic feature of autoimmune bullous diseases was extravasations. They occurred in 76.9% of patients with pemphigus vulgaris, 70.6% of patients with pemphigus foliaceus, 76.5% of patients with bullous pemphigoid, and 100% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Yellow hemorrhagic crusts occurred in, respectively, 73.1%, 70.6%, 64.7%, and 35.5% of the cases. Yellow diffuse scaling and tubular scaling occurred more frequently in pemphigus foliaceus (52.9% and 41.2%, respectively). Clustered dotted vessels were characteristic for dermatitis herpetiformis (5/8, 62.5%). Dotted vessels with whitish halo were a hallmark of pemphigus vulgaris. A trichoscopic algorithm for the differential diagnosis of autoimmune bullous diseases was developed.
CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune bullous diseases present characteristic trichoscopic patterns. Trichoscopy can be regarded as a rapid in-office preliminary diagnostic method in the differential diagnosis of these diseases.","['Sar-Pomian M', 'Rudnicka L', 'Olszewska M']",2017,56,10,Int J Dermatol,"Sar-Pomian M, et al.

28816740,The Value of Direct Immunofluorescence on Proteinase-Digested Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Skin Biopsies.,"Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) on frozen tissue (DIF-F) is the method of choice for the identification of immune deposits present in skin and other tissues. DIF can also be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (DIF-P) after antigen retrieval with proteases and has proven to be of value in renal pathology. However, its utility in skin biopsies has not been fully examined. In this study, we performed DIF-P on 60 skin biopsies that comprised of bullous pemphigoid (n = 18), pemphigoid gestationis (n = 1), pemphigus (n = 7), linear IgA disease (n = 7), vasculitis (n = 20), lupus erythematosus (n = 3), and dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 4) cases. We compared the results of DIF-P with those of DIF-F from the same patients. The diagnostic features were found in 15 of 19 (79%) pemphigoid (bullous pemphigoid and pemphigoid gestationis), 3 of 7 (43%) pemphigus, 3 of 7 (43%) linear IgA disease, 14 of 20 (70%) vasculitis, 1 of 3 (33%) lupus erythematosus, and none (0%) of the dermatitis herpetiformis cases tested. Overall, DIF-P is less sensitive than DIF-F but seems to be a valuable technique that could aid in the diagnosis of vasculitides, immunobullous, and connective tissue disorders when fresh tissue is unavailable.","['Valencia-Guerrero A', 'Deng A', 'Dresser K', 'Bouliane G', 'Cornejo KM']",2018,40,2,Am J Dermatopathol,"Valencia-Guerrero A, et al.

Its pathogenesis is still not fully known. The aim of this research was to assess the role of IL-31 in development of itch as well as to measure its intensity. Obtained results, as well as literature data, show that lower concentration of IL-31 in patients' serum may be correlated with its role in JAK/STAT signaling pathway which is involved in development of autoimmune blistering disease. Intensity of itch is surprisingly huge problem for the patients and the obtained results are comparable with results presented by atopic patients.","['Kulczycka-Siennicka L', 'Cynkier A', 'Waszczykowska E', 'Woźniacka A', 'Żebrowska A']",2017,2017,,Biomed Res Int,"Kulczycka-Siennicka L, et al.

28794567,Autoimmune Bullous Disease in Childhood.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune bullous disorders (AIBDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases which are rarely seen in children. Studies concerning the immunobullous diseases in pediatric patients are scarce.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical features and treatment outcomes of AIBDs in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic records of the patients in our AIBDs outpatient clinic were retrospectively reviewed. All cases diagnosed before the age of 16 years were included in the analysis of clinical features, treatment outcomes, and follow-up data.
RESULTS: Of the 196 patients with immunobullous diseases, 9 (4.6%) were diagnosed before the age of 16 years. Mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 7.72 ± 5.66 years. Among nine patients, linear immunoglobulin A disease (LAD), pemphigus vulgaris (PV), and bullous pemphigoid (BP) were seen in 5, 2, and 2 children, respectively. All patients were treated with at least two systemic agents (including methylprednisolone, dapsone, methotrexate, salazopyrine, intravenous Ig [IVIg], and rituximab) leading to clinical remission in all of them after a mean period of 31.77 ± 27.99 months.
CONCLUSION: In line with earlier studies, LAD was the most common immunobullous disease and in general, associated with a favorable response to dapsone. This study was noteworthy in that the patients with PV and BP demonstrated a relatively more recalcitrant course, requiring rituximab and IVIg for remission, respectively. Overall, patients had a good prognosis.","['Salman A', 'Tekin B', 'Yucelten D']",2017,62,4,Indian J Dermatol,"Salman A, et al. Autoimmune Bullous Disease in Childhood.

Some surveys have been carried out to describe the spectrum of ABDs in a region, but this is the first that has focused on ABDs in elderly patients. This study was conducted to determine the clinicoepidemiologic features of ABDs in elderly patients. Medical records of all ABD patients with disease onset after the age of 60 years who presented to the Autoimmune Bullous Diseases Research Center, Tehran, Iran between April 2003 and March 2013 were reviewed. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were not included. During the 10-year period studied, 296 patients with ABD and disease onset after 60 years of age were diagnosed. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) was observed to be the most common ABD (48.3%), followed by pemphigus vulgaris (45.3%), pemphigus foliaceus (3.7%), mucous membrane pemphigoid (1.4%), paraneoplastic pemphigus (0.7%), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (0.3%), and linear IgA bullous disease (0.3%). A predominance in women was observed for total ABDs, BP, and pemphigus vulgaris. Although Iran is known to have a high prevalence of pemphigus, BP is the most frequent ABD among elderly patients in Iran, highlighting the importance of the clinical diagnosis of BP in elderly patients.","['Ghiasi M', 'Daneshpazhooh M', 'Ismonov M', 'Chams-Davatchi C']",2017,15,3,Skinmed,"Ghiasi M, et al.

28701089,Increased risk of herpes zoster in patients with coeliac disease - nationwide cohort study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Clinical experience suggests that patients with coeliac disease (CD) are more prone to develop herpes zoster (HZ), but robust studies are lacking.
METHODS: We identified 29,064 patients with CD 1969-2008 using biopsy report data from Sweden's 28 pathology departments. CD was equalled to villous atrophy (Marsh histopathology grade III). Each patient was matched on age, sex, calendar year and county of residence to up to five reference individuals ( n=144,342) from the general population. We then used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for future HZ (defined as having a hospital-based inpatient or outpatient record of this diagnosis in the Swedish Patient Register).
RESULTS: During follow-up, 154 (0.53%) individuals with CD and 499 (0.35%) reference individuals developed HZ. Among individuals aged ≥60 years, 1.06% of CD individuals and 0.85% of reference individuals had a lifetime record of HZ. Overall, CD was associated with a 1.62-fold increased risk of HZ (95% CI=1.35-1.95), and was seen also when we considered comorbidity with lymphoproliferative disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, thyroid disease, rheumatoid disease and excluded individuals with a record of dermatitis herpetiformis. The increased risk remained significant after more than five years of follow-up (1.46; 1.16-1.84) Conclusions: CD is associated with HZ, the increased relative risk persists over time from celiac diagnosis but the absolute risk is small.","['Ludvigsson JF', 'Choung RS', 'Marietta EV', 'Murray JA', 'Emilsson L']",2018,46,8,Scand J Public Health,"Ludvigsson JF, et al.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of the University of Chicago Celiac Center clinic charts from January 2002 to October 2014. Demographics, serologic testing, intestinal biopsies, and extraintestinal symptoms at presentation, 12, 24, and >24 months were recorded. Extraintestinal symptoms included abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgias, psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty, osteoporosis, and infertility.
RESULTS: A total of 737 patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease or skin biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis were included. Patients lost to follow-up, or with insufficient data were excluded leaving 328 patients (157 pediatrics younger than 18 years). For pediatrics, the female to male ratio was 2:1 and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.9 years. For adults, 4:1 and 40.6 years old. Extraintestinal symptom rates were similar in children (60%) and adults (62%). Short stature (33%), fatigue (28%), and headache (20%) were most common in children. Iron deficiency anemia (48%), fatigue (37%), and headache/psychiatric disorders (24%) were common in adults. Children had faster/higher rates of symptom resolution compared with adults. Twenty-eight percent of children with unresolved short stature on a GFD were found to have other comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Children and adults with celiac disease have similar rates of extraintestinal manifestations. In children short stature, fatigue, and headache were most common, whereas anemia, fatigue, and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children on a strict GFD showed faster and higher rates of symptom resolution as compared to adults. Unresponsive children with short stature must be assessed for comorbidities.","['Jericho H', 'Sansotta N', 'Guandalini S']",2017,65,1,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Jericho H, et al.

28618730,Possible triggering factors and comorbidities in newly diagnosed autoimmune bullous diseases.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The distribution and the demographic, etiological, and clinical features of autoimmune bullous diseases (ABDs) vary according to geographic regions of the world. The limited number of reported studies in Turkey are mostly retrospective and generally include only pemphigus. The aim of our study was to evaluate the demographic data, clinical features, associated triggering factors, and comorbidities in patients newly diagnosed with ABDs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive and prospective study, the demographic data, inhabited regions, smoking and drinking habits, presence of comorbidities, and specific and general potential triggering factors of ABDs considered by the patients were examined. Furthermore, the distribution of lesions and autoimmune bullous skin disorder intensity scores were recorded.
RESULTS: Of the total 59 ABD patients, 26 (44.1%) were diagnosed with pemphigus, 25 (42.4%) were diagnosed with pemphigoid, and 8 (13.5%) were diagnosed with dermatitis herpetiformis. Although there were some differences between the subgroups of ABDs, the onset of the disease was associated with a triggering factor (stress, foods, physical trauma, chemical agents, ultraviolet rays, medications, infections, malignancies, and pregnancy, in a decreasing frequency) in 96.6% of the patients. Autoimmune diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were found to be statistically significantly higher in the pemphigoid group compared to the pemphigus and dermatitis herpetiformis groups.
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of triggering factors and comorbidities before starting treatment may assist in controlling the disease more swiftly and reducing the side effects of treatment in the management of ABDs. However, to evaluate the frequency and significance of our findings in order to determine whether they are statistically significant or not, we suggest a multicenter prospective clinical trial, which would include control groups and a higher number of patients for each of the disease groups and clinical subtypes.","['Akarsu S', 'Özbağçivan Ö', 'Dolaş N', 'Aktan Ş']",2017,47,3,Turk J Med Sci,"Akarsu S, et al.

Furthermore, the risk of fractures and bone mineral density (BMD) in DH remain under-described, and recommendations for systematic screening for osteoporosis in DH are lacking. To describe the characteristics of DH in a large French cohort and evaluate the association between BMD and features of osteoporosis. Patients were recruited from the French Association of Gluten Intolerants (AFDIAG) and a single university dermatology department. A telephone questionnaire was used to record features of DH, history of fractures, calcium intake, treatment, and the gluten-free diet (GFD). Serum calcium and 25(OH) vitamin D3+D2 levels, as well as BMD, were measured. We included 53 patients (27 men) with a median age of 49 years (range: 23-86). Median disease duration before inclusion was 14 years (range: 2-55); 51 patients (96%) were adherent to a GFD and had no digestive symptoms.

28514243,Celiac Disease Symptom Resolution: Effectiveness of the Gluten-free Diet.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the gluten-free diet (GFD) on gastrointestinal (GI) and extra-intestinal (EI) symptom resolution and identify predictors for persistence of symptoms in all celiac patients at the University of Chicago.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2002 to 2015. GI symptoms included abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, failure to thrive/weight loss, nausea, reflux, and vomiting. EI symptoms included abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgia, psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty, osteoporosis, and infertility.
RESULTS: A total of 554 patients (227 children) with celiac disease (CeD) were included. Abdominal pain, diarrhea and failure to thrive were the most common GI symptoms in children whereas diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain were most common in adults. Short stature, fatigue, and headache were the most common EI symptoms in children whereas iron deficiency anemia, fatigue, and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children had significantly higher rates of EI and GI symptom resolution as compared to adults, with greater rates of improvements in GI versus EI symptoms at more than 24 months. Long duration of symptoms, female sex, and non-adherence to a GFD were the most important significant predictors of failure to clinically improve.
CONCLUSIONS: On a strict GFD, children report greater rates of both GI and EI symptom resolution as compared to adults with greater rates of improvement in GI over EI symptoms. Early recognition of CeD and close attention to diet adherence may help in symptom resolution.","['Sansotta N', 'Amirikian K', 'Guandalini S', 'Jericho H']",2018,66,1,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Sansotta N, et al.

BACKGROUND: The term pemphigus refers to a group of autoimmune blistering diseases mediated by auto-antibodies directed against desmoglein proteins. The differentiation between the various bullous diseases is important for treatment and prognosis. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy is still the gold standard in differentiating these diseases.
METHODS: Patients with clinical diagnosis of vesiculobullous dermatitis from pemphigus group were included in the study. We retrospectively analyzed histopathologic and direct immunofluorescence results from skin or mucosal samples over 15-year period.
RESULTS: 81 patients were included. The accordance was good in pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus herpetiformis, but low in pemphigus vegetans, pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus erythematosus. No accordance was in Hailey-Hailey disease and Grover´s disease. Uncommon result in our analysis included: intraepidermal IgG and IgM depositions at DIF in one Grover´s disease patient.

28390814,"Meeting Report of the Pathogenesis of Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Meeting in Munich, September 2016.","Autoimmune blistering diseases are a heterogeneous group of about a dozen complex disorders that are characterized by intraepidermal (pemphigus) and subepidermal blistering (pemphigoid diseases and dermatitis herpetiformis). The Pathogenesis of Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Meeting, organized by the Departments of Dermatology in Lübeck and Marburg and the Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Munich, was held in September 2016 in Munich. The meeting brought together basic scientists and clinicians from all continents dedicating their work to autoimmune blistering diseases. Considerable advances have been made in describing incidences and prevalences of these diseases and linking comorbidities with autoantibody reactivities and clinical variants, for example, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor-associated noninflammatory bullous pemphigoid. Although new entities are still being described, diagnosis of most autoimmune blistering diseases can now be achieved using standardized and widely available serological test systems. Various experimental mouse models of pemphigus and pemphigoid disease are increasingly being used to understand mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance and to evaluate more specific treatment approaches for these disorders, such as molecules that target autoreactive T and B cells and anti-inflammatory mediators, that is, dimethyl fumarate, phosphodiesterase 4, and leukotriene B4 inhibitors in pemphigoid disorders, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells in pemphigus. Very recent experimental data about the immunopathology and the determinants of autoantibody formation and keratinocyte susceptibility in pemphigus were discussed. With regard to cellular mechanisms leading to the loss of cell-cell adhesion, new ideas were shared in the field of signal transduction. Major steps were taken to put the various partly contradictory and controversial findings about the effects of pemphigus autoantibodies and other inflammatory mediators into perspective and broaden our view of the complex pathophysiology of this disease. Finally, two investigator-initiated multicenter trials highlighted doxycycline and dapsone as valuable medications in the treatment of bullous pemphigoid.","['Schmidt E', 'Spindler V', 'Eming R', 'Amagai M', 'Antonicelli F', 'Baines JF', 'Belheouane M', 'Bernard P', 'Borradori L', 'Caproni M', 'Di Zenzo G', 'Grando S', 'Harman K', 'Jonkman MF', 'Koga H', 'Ludwig RJ', 'Kowalczyk AP', 'Müller EJ', 'Nishie W', 'Pas H', 'Payne AS', 'Sadik CD', 'Seppänen A', 'Setterfield J', 'Shimizu H', 'Sinha AA', 'Sprecher E', 'Sticherling M', 'Ujiie H', 'Zillikens D', 'Hertl M', 'Waschke J']",2017,137,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Schmidt E, et al.

28350748,Short article: Mortality and differential diagnoses of villous atrophy without coeliac antibodies.,"OBJECTIVE: Villous atrophy (VA) of the small bowel is mainly related to coeliac disease (CD), whose diagnosis is made on the basis of positive endomysial/tissue transglutaminase antibodies while on a gluten-containing diet in the vast majority of patients. However, VA can also occur in other conditions whose epidemiology is little known. Our aim was to study the epidemiology and clinical features of these rare enteropathies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data of all the patients with VA directly diagnosed in our centre in the last 15 years were collected and statistically analysed.
RESULTS: Between September 1999 and June 2015, 274 patients were diagnosed with VA. A total of 260 patients were also positive to coeliac antibodies; the other 14 had VA, but no IgA endomysial antibodies: five had common variable immunodeficiency, three had dermatitis herpetiformis, two had IgA deficiency associated with CD, one had abdominal lymphoma, one had unclassified sprue, one had olmesartan-associated enteropathy and one had seronegative CD. Mortality was 6.0 deaths per 100 person years (95% confidence interval: 2.2-16) in patients with VA but negative coeliac antibodies, whereas only 0.2 deaths per 100 person years (95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.6) occurred in coeliac patients.
CONCLUSION: Patients with VA and negative endomysial antibodies are rare. However, these forms of VA identify specific causes that can be diagnosed. These patients are affected by a very high mortality.","['Schiepatti A', 'Biagi F', 'Fraternale G', 'Vattiato C', 'Balduzzi D', 'Agazzi S', 'Alpini C', 'Klersy C', 'Corazza GR']",2017,29,5,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Schiepatti A, et al.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the inpatient burden and comorbidities of PAIBD.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2012, which contained a representative 20% sample of all US hospitalizations.
RESULTS: The most common PAIBD with a primary admission was pemphigus (8.0 per million), whereas the most common secondary diagnosis of PAIBD was dermatitis herpetiformis (DH; 9.6 per million). Bullous pemphigoid (BP) was inversely associated with being female and having government or no insurance but positively associated with Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity and more chronic conditions. Pemphigus was associated with being female, Hispanic, having government or no insurance, and having a higher number of chronic conditions. DH was inversely associated with non-White race but positively associated with having government insurance and more chronic conditions. BP was associated with dialysis, hypertension, and diabetes. Pemphigus was associated with osteoarthritis, renal failure, hypothyroidism, and weight loss. DH was associated with herpes simplex virus infection, rheumatoid arthritis, and fungal, viral, and other skin infections.

OBSERVATIONS: A man in his 80s with DH not controlled by gluten-free diet (with poor adherence), dapsone, and conventional immune-suppressing agents responded to treatment with rituximab according to the lymphoma protocol (4 weekly infusions of 375 mg/m2). Thirteen months after treatment, the patient had achieved complete resolution of pruritus and clinical manifestations of the disease, as well as normalization of antibodies against epidermal and tissue transglutaminases. He achieved complete clinical and serological remission and has remained symptom-free up to 18 months following treatment.

28010761,Research Techniques Made Simple: Mouse Models of Autoimmune Blistering Diseases.,"Autoimmune blistering diseases are examples of autoantibody-mediated, organ-specific autoimmune disorders. Based on a genetic susceptibility, such as a strong HLA-class II association, as yet unknown triggering factors induce the formation of circulating and tissue-bound autoantibodies that are mainly directed against adhesion structures of the skin and mucous membranes. Compared with other autoimmune diseases, especially systemic disorders, the pathogenicity of autoimmune blistering diseases is relatively well described. Several animal models of autoimmune blistering diseases have been established that helped to uncover the immunological and molecular mechanisms underlying the blistering phenotypes. Each in vivo model focuses on specific aspects of the autoimmune cascade, from loss of immunological tolerance on the level of T and B cells to the pathogenic effects of autoantibodies upon binding to their target autoantigen. We discuss current mouse models of autoimmune blistering diseases, including models of pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Pollmann R', 'Eming R']",2017,137,1,J Invest Dermatol,Pollmann R and Eming R.

27845514,Are antiepidermal transglutaminase antibodies titre correlated with dermatitis herpetiformis lesions during the disease follow-up?,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized by the presence of antitissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies in patient sera. In 2002, antiepidermal transglutaminase (eTG) antibodies have been identified in DH patients. Nowadays, their role is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate any association between presence/absence of anti-eTG antibodies and cutaneous manifestations during the follow-up.
METHODS: Anti-eTG and anti-tTG antibodies from 13 patients on gluten-free diet (GFD) were studied during follow-up on ELISA. Cutaneous manifestations baseline differences among age, gender, anti-eTG IgA, anti-tTG IgA, and treatment groups were tested by the Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Fisher's Exact Test. In order to investigate the associations of cutaneous manifestations with age, gender, anti-eTG IgA, anti-tTG IgA, and treatment groups the mixed-effects (ME) model was performed. To test whether the cutaneous manifestations in treatment groups were different according to the anti-eTG levels, an exploratory interaction analysis was carried out using the ME Model.
RESULTS: Seven patients (53.85%) had an anti-eTG value greater than 22 AU/mL, while six (46.15%) were classified as anti-eTG value <22 AU/mL. A significant correlation between anti-eTG antibodies and cutaneous manifestations was observed. No significant cutaneous manifestations differences existed in treatment groups according to the anti-eTG antibodies levels. Anti-tTG antibodies resulted negative in every patient serum.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-eTG antibodies persist much longer after the elimination of gluten from the patients diet compared to anti-tTG antibodies and seem to be a valid marker for monitoring the disease during the follow-up.","['Cozzani E', 'Pappalardo F', 'Gasparini G', 'Gallo F', 'Drago F', 'Parodi A']",2018,153,5,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Cozzani E, et al.

27792210,Animal models to study non-celiac gluten sensitivity.,"Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), sometimes known as non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS), has recently received much attention, both scientific as well as from the alternative medical community. Over the past 5 years, there are over 200 publications on NCGS indexed on the PubMed database, the gluten-free market has been growing bigger, and it is clear that the number of consumers who are on a gluten-free diet (GFD) possibly because of a suspicion for NCGS appears to grow even faster. Nevertheless, despite these three rising events, many questions about NCGS remain unresolved. It is likely that NCGS represents a heterogeneous group of disorders linked by a common response to a GFD. It is still not fully understood how gluten, and likely other wheat proteins and components, could activate and drive the pathophysiology of NCGS. As a result, there are still no clear biomarkers, no robust clinical diagnostic criteria, nor a conclusive definition for NCGS. This heterogeneity can be approached by reducing the variables, in particular those of human behaviour and placebo effect, by studying animal models to address specific biological effects of wheat and/or gluten-related proteins. Herein we review the animal models and their potential to be used to advance our understanding of these disorders and potentially address their prevention and treatment.","['Amnuaycheewa P', 'Murray JA', 'Marietta EV']",2017,63,1,Minerva Gastroenterol Dietol,"Amnuaycheewa P, et al.

27760369,Autoimmunity to heat shock proteins and vitamin D status in patients with celiac disease without associated dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Inflammation-induced heat shock proteins (HSPs) and hypovitaminosis D have been reported to impact immune responses and to be associated with autoimmune diseases including celiac disease (CD), a gluten-sensitive enteropathy mediated by autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (TG2). Recently, we provided evidence for a role of autoantibodies to HSPs in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), an inflammatory skin disease induced by underlying latent CD. In this study, we aimed at investigating the humoral autoimmune response to HSPs and vitamin D status in CD patients (n=15) presenting without the cutaneous disease manifestation. In comparison with healthy controls (n=15), circulating autoantibodies against HSP40, HSP60, and HSP90 were increased in these patients, and these autoantibodies, including anti-HSP70, correlated with serum anti-TG2 autoantibodies. Deficient and insufficient vitamin D serum levels were found in 8 out of 15 CD patients and 11 out of 15 healthy controls, and the vitamin D status showed no relationship with levels of circulating anti-TG2 or anti-HSP autoantibodies in the patients. Our results preliminarily suggest a pronounced anti-HSP autoimmune response in CD that is linked to pathophysiological processes in the gut independently of both a potential concomitant disease-related extra-intestinal inflammatory manifestation in the skin and the vitamin D status. Future studies on larger groups of patients are needed to confirm the present data and to further clarify whether autoimmunity towards HSPs is primarily related to underlying CD or skin inflammation in DH patients.","['Tukaj S', 'Görög A', 'Kleszczyński K', 'Zillikens D', 'Kárpáti S', 'Kasperkiewicz M']",2017,173,,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,"Tukaj S, et al.

27767273,Incidence of autoimmune bullous diseases in Serbia: a 20-year retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: While most previous surveys on the clinico-epidemiological features of autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) have predominantly focused on a single disease entity or just one disease group, there have been only few studies examining the incidence of various AIBDs. In the present study, we set out to determine the spectrum of AIBDs, to estimate the incidence of the most common AIBDs, and to examine their temporal trends in Central Serbia over a period of 20 years.
METHODS: We retrospectively recruited 1,161 new AIBD cases diagnosed in Central Serbia during the period from January 1991 to December 2010. The diagnosis was based on strict clinical, histological, and immunohistological evaluation.
RESULTS: The incidence rates were: 4.35 per million population/year (pmp/year) for pemphigus, 4.47 pmp/year for pemphigoid, 1.42 pmp/year for dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), 0.25 pmp/year for linear IgA disease, and 0.08 pmp/year for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. In the period observed, age-adjusted incidence rates significantly increased for pemphigus and particularly for pemphigoid, whereas they decreased, albeit not significantly, for DH.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study evaluates the incidence rates of the entire spectrum of AIBDs in Serbia, and examines their temporal trends over a 20-year period. To the best of our knowledge, our finding of similar incidence rates for pemphigus and pemphigoid has previously not been reported.","['Milinković MV', 'Janković S', 'Medenica L', 'Nikolić M', 'Reljić V', 'Popadić S', 'Janković J']",2016,14,10,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Milinković MV, et al.

Bei der vorliegenden Studie war es unser Ziel, das gesamte Spektrum der AIBD zu betrachten, die Inzidenz der häufigsten AIBD zu ermitteln und die zeitlichen Trends ihres Auftretens in Zentralserbien über einen Zeitraum von 20 Jahren zu untersuchen.
METHODEN: Wir rekrutierten retrospektiv 1161 AIBD-Fälle, die in Zentralserbien von Januar 1991 bis Dezember 2010 neu diagnostiziert wurden. Die Diagnose stützte sich auf eine strikte klinische, histologische und immunhistologische Beurteilung.
ERGEBNISSE: Folgende Inzidenzraten wurden für die einzelnen Erkrankungen ermittelt: 4,35 pro eine Million Einwohner/Jahr (pME/Jahr) für Pemphigus, 4,47 pME/Jahr für Pemphigoid, 1,42 pME/Jahr für Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), 0,25 pME/Jahr IgA-Dermatose und 0,08 pME/Jahr für Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.

27713973,"Effects of enzyme activities during steeping and sprouting on the solubility and composition of proteins, their bioactivity and relationship with the bread making quality of wheat flour.","The aim was to determine the effect of steeping and sprouting on wheat grain proteins and the functional consequences in this regard. The solubility of proteins and the polypeptide composition of albumins, globulins, gliadins and glutenins were determined, as well as the content of non-protein nitrogen and free sulfhydryl groups (-SH), and the activity of peroxidase (POD) and lipoxygenase (LOX). In addition, the pasting viscosity of flour and protein bioactivity such as antioxidant capacity and immunoreactivity were evaluated. The increase of non-protein nitrogen and free -SH groups by about 62.09 and 96.7%, respectively, as well as the decrease of albumin + globulin polypeptides with a molecular weight over 85.94 kDa and between 85.94-48.00 kDa by about 34 and 8.7%, respectively, were the most notable changes observed in the flour from whole sprouted wheat that clearly point to the intensive protein hydrolysis. The reduction of disulfide bonds and increased concentrations of free -SH groups significantly modify the visco-elastic properties of gliadins and glutenins causing pasting viscosity reduction. However, sprouted wheat flour could be considered as a potential food ingredient because of its improved antioxidant capacity that is a result of protein hydrolysis inter alia. As protein modification induced by steeping may have beneficial effects on the antigenicity of the glutenin fraction, this kind of wheat pretreatment can represent a putative strategy in the dietary modulation of diseases related to glutenin immunoreactivity, e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Žilić S', 'Janković M', 'Barać M', 'Pešić M', 'Konić-Ristić A', 'Hadži-Tašković Šukalović V']",2016,7,10,Food Funct,"Žilić S, et al.

29328564,Pemphigus herpetiformis - a case report of a rare form of pemphigus and review of the literature.,"INTRODUCTION: Pemphigus herpetiformis is the rare variant of pemphigus with characteristic clinical features, histopathological findings different from the convectional pemphigus, and immunological findings consistent with pemphigus.
CASE REPORT: We presented a 65-year-old woman with initial pruritus followed by pruritic urticarial papules and plaques, some with annular rings of tense vesicles on the periphery, on the trunk and extremities, with no mucous lesions. Histopathological examination demonstrated spongiosis and intraepidermal vesicles in the mid or subcorneal epidermis in some biopsy specimen, with neutrophil and eosinophil infiltrate. Direct immunoflorescent microscopy revealed intercellular IgG deposition, most prominent in the upper layers of epidermis. Indirect immunoflorescent microscopy showed intercellular binding of IgG autoantibodies in the patient’s sera. Initially the patient was threated with systemic corticosteroids and azathioprine, but dapson provided complete clinical remission.
CONCLUSION: This entity was established 40 years ago, and around 100 patients have been reported worldwide. It is important to be aware of this particular form of pemphigus because clinical presentation, course of the disease and therapeutic approach are different from conventional forms of pemphigus.","['Stojković-Filipović J', 'Lekić B', 'Milčić D', 'Milinković MV']",2016,73,10,Vojnosanit Pregl,"Stojković-Filipović J, et al.

27499257,Dermatitis herpetiformis: a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an itchy blistering skin disease with predilection sites on elbows, knees, and buttocks. Diagnosis is confirmed by showing granular immunoglobulin A deposits in perilesional skin. DH is one manifestation of coeliac disease; the skin symptoms heal with gluten free diet (GFD) and relapse on gluten challenge. Of the first-degree relatives, 5% may be affected by either condition. Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is the autoantigen in coeliac disease and epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) in DH. Both diseases conditions exhibit TG2-specific autoantibodies in serum and small bowel mucosa; patients with DH have IgA-TG3 in the skin. There are some divergencies between these two phenotypes. One-fourth of DH patients do not have small bowel mucosal villous atrophy, but virtually all have coeliac-type inflammatory changes. The skin symptoms respond slowly to GFD. The incidence of coeliac disease is increasing, whereas the opposite is true for DH. A female predominance is evident in coeliac disease, while DH may be more common in males. Coeliac disease carries the risk of small intestinal T-cell lymphoma; in DH B-cell lymphomas at any site may prevail. Adult coeliac disease carries a slightly increased elevated mortality risk, whereas in DH, the relative mortality rate is significantly decreased. Key messages Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease; both conditions are genetically determined and gluten-dependent. Gastrointestinal symptoms and the degree of villous atrophy are less obvious in dermatitis herpetiformis than in coeliac disease. Both show tissue transglutaminase (TG2) specific autoantibodies in serum and small bowel mucosa. In addition, TG3-targeted IgA antibodies are found in the skin of DH patients Both conditions carry an increased elevated risk of lymphoma, in coeliac disease small intestinal T-cell lymphoma, in dermatitis herpetiformis mainly B-cell lymphoma at various sites. Coeliac disease is currently eight times more common that DH; the incidence of DH is decreasing in contrast to that of coeliac disease, where it is increasing.","['Collin P', 'Salmi TT', 'Hervonen K', 'Kaukinen K', 'Reunala T']",2017,49,1,Ann Med,"Collin P, et al.

27480555,[An analysis of clinical features of celiac disease patients in different ethnic].,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical features of different racial patients with celiac disease (CD) and analyze the disease prevalence, diagnosis and treatment in Chinese population.
METHODS: All the patients were diagnosed as CD and enrolled in Beijing United Family Hospital between January 2005 and July 2015.Clinical data including nationality, age, symptoms, endoscopic and pathological findings, outcome were collected and compared in patients from different countries.
RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were enrolled including 63 Caucasians, 18 Asian patients and 6 Middle East patients.The peak age of disease onset was 40-60 years old.Patients with typical symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and weight loss only accounted for 20.7%(18/87) and 9.2%(8/87) respectively.Some patients presented with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating [32.2%(28/87)], even constipation [5.7%(5/87)].13.8%(12/87) patients were previously diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.The incidence of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation between Asians and Caucasians had no statistical significance (P>0.05); but the proportions of weight loss, growth retardation, iron deficiency anemia and dermatitis herpetiformis in Asian group were significantly higher than that in Caucasian group (P<0.05). IgA type of anti-gliadin antibody (AGA), endomysium antibody (EMA) and tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) were dominant autoimmune antibodies in patients with CD, which accounted for 58.6%(51/87), 44.8%(39/87) and 36.8%(32/87) respectively.The endoscopy showed that the lesion of CD was mainly located in small intestine, with reducing severity from the proximal to the distal small intestine.The lesions of duodenal bulb and descending duodenum appeared more significant in Asian group.Accordingly pathological intestinal atrophy and the degree of intraepithelial lymphocytosis were more severe in Asian patients.All 87 cases took the gluten-free diet (GFD). Eighty-one cases received serological follow up and 8 with endoscopic intestinal biopsy.The celiac disease antibodies in 47 patients turned negative from 6-9 months after GFD treatment, while 34 patients turned negative from 12-18 months after GFD.All patients reported disease remission to some extent.After 1 year GFD treatment, the pathology of endoscopic intestinal biopsy in 8 patients showed significant improvement of villous atrophy and lymphocyte infiltration.
CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with typical clinical manifestations are not the majority.Serological celiac disease antibodies (AGA, EMA and tTGA) have a high diagnostic value.GFD treatment is effective on majority of celiac patients.Clinical manifestations, endoscopy, intestinal pathology, and response to GFD in Chinese patients are not the same as Caucasians.Clinicians need to pay attention to the differential diagnosis.","['Geng W', 'Qiao XB', 'Ji KY', 'Wang HF', 'Yang AM']",2016,55,8,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,"Geng W, et al.

27440075,Decreased fibrinolytic potential and morphological changes of fibrin structure in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Recently, high prevalence of cryofibrinogenaemia has been observed in plasma of untreated dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) patients, and the pathological IgA and TG3 deposits in the papillary dermis were found to co-localize with fibrin and fibrinogen.
OBJECTIVE: To study the fibrinolytic potential in plasma of untreated, dapsone and or/gluten-free diet treated DH patients as well as the in vitro effect of dapsone on the fibrinolytic profile.
METHOD: Plasma samples of 23 DH patients, 19 healthy subjects and 5 pemphigus vulgaris patients were investigated by a turbidimetric-clot lysis assay. Out of them 5 DH plasma samples representing different fibrinolytic parameters, and 3 healthy controls were selected for parallel fibrin clot preparation. The clot fibrin structure was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the diameters of 900 fibrin fibres were determined in each clot.
RESULTS: A significantly prolonged clot lysis time was detected in untreated DH patients. The turbidity values of DH plasma clots indicated an altered fibrin structure that was also confirmed by SEM: significantly thicker fibrin fibers were observed in untreated, TG3 antibody positive DH patients compared to healthy controls, whereas the fiber diameters of dapsone-treated patients were similar or thinner than the control values. In line with the structural changes of fibrin, the fibrinolytic profile of 5 DH patients under dapsone treatment approached the control values.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the fibrinolytic potential was impaired in the plasma of untreated DH patients, whereas dapsone corrected the fibrinolytic defect. These data suggest a pathogenic role for plasma-derived factors in the development of skin symptoms and add a new aspect to the long-known beneficial, symptomatic effect of dapsone in active DH.","['Görög A', 'Németh K', 'Szabó L', 'Mayer B', 'Silló P', 'Kolev K', 'Kárpáti S']",2016,84,1,J Dermatol Sci,"Görög A, et al.

27321352,Nutritional therapy - Facing the gap between coeliac disease and gluten-free food.,"The market of gluten-free bakery products is considerably growing since better diagnostic methods allow identifying an increasing number of people suffering coeliac disease and other gluten-related disorders such as dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten ataxia, wheat allergy and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. The only and safe treatment available nowadays for these types of disorders is to follow a strict and permanent lifelong gluten-free diet. Beside the people needing to follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons, a new segment of consumers has arisen who consume gluten-free products as a lifestyle choice. Among the bakery products, bread is a major staple food consumed daily all over the world. The dough and bread quality characteristics (such as gas retaining ability, mixing tolerance, resistance to stretch and extensibility and crumb structure) are mostly attributed to the presence of gluten. Despite the improved quality of gluten-free breads in the last number of years, most products on the market are still described as low quality product. In addition to the low overall quality of gluten-free products, the nutritional value of a large number of them is quite poor. In this context, this review gives an overview on the consumers, which need to follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons. The trends in this gluten-free bakery segment will also be reviewed based on the current analysis of marketing studies. An overview of the major ingredients used in gluten-free bread products will be given. The choice of the ingredients discussed in this paper is based on a comprehensive study of the leading gluten-free breads available on the market, as well as a detailed study of the scientific literature. The impact of the various ingredients on bread-making process and bread quality is also part of this review. Major emphasis will be placed on the application of sourdough as a means to improve gluten-free bread quality.","['Foschia M', 'Horstmann S', 'Arendt EK', 'Zannini E']",2016,239,,Int J Food Microbiol,"Foschia M, et al.

27273303,"[Celiac disease : Pathogenesis, clinics, epidemiology, diagnostics, therapy].","Celiac disease is induced by the consumption of gluten containing cereals (wheat, spelt, barley, rye). With a prevalence of ~ 1 %, it is the most common non-infectious chronic inflammatory intestinal disease worldwide. It manifests in all age groups, either classically with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and growth failure or weight loss, more commonly with indirect consequences of malabsorption, such as anaemia and osteoporosis, or with associated autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis or dermatitis herpetiformis. The pathogenesis of celiac disease is well explored. Gluten, the cereal storage protein, is not completely digested and reaches the intestinal mucosa where it activates inflammatory T cells, which cause atrophy of the resorptive villi. This T‑cell activation requires a genetic predisposition (the molecules HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 on antigen-presenting immune cells). Moreover, the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (TG2) which is released in the mucosa increases the immunogenicity of the gluten peptides by a deamidation reaction. The test for serum antibodies to the autoantigen TG2 is one of the best diagnostic markers in medicine, which in combination with endoscopically obtained biopsies, secures the diagnosis of celiac disease. Despite these tools celiac disease is severely underdiagnosed, with 80-90 % of those affected being undetected. The untreated condition can lead to grave complications. These include the consequences of malabsorption, cancers (especially intestinal T‑cell lymphoma), and likely also the promotion of autoimmune diseases. The therapy of celiac disease, a strict gluten-free diet, is difficult to maintain and not always effective. Alternative, supporting pharmacological therapies are urgently needed and are currently in development.",['Schuppan D'],2016,59,7,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"Schuppan D.

27265071,Inflammatory and glandular skin disease in pregnancy.,"A switch from cell-mediated to humoral immunity (helper T 1 [Th1] to helper T 2 [Th2] shift) during gestation plays a key role in placental immune tolerance. As a result, skin diseases that are Th2 mediated often worsen, whereas skin diseases that are Th1 mediated often improve during gestation. Also, due to fluctuations in glandular activity, skin diseases involving sebaceous and eccrine glands may flare, whereas those involving apocrine glands may improve during pregnancy. Despite these trends, inflammatory and glandular skin diseases do not always follow the predicted pattern, and courses are often diverse. We review the gestational course of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (atopic eruption of pregnancy), psoriasis, impetigo herpetiformis, urticaria, erythema annulare centrifugum, pityriasis rosea, sarcoidosis, Sweet syndrome, and erythema nodosum, as well as glandular skin diseases, including acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, perioral dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Fox-Fordyce disease, hyperhidrosis, and miliaria.

In this study the burden of DH was evaluated prospectively in 52 patients newly diagnosed with DH using a study questionnaire and a validated Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) questionnaire. The PGWB scores were compared with those of 110 healthy controls. Quality of life was significantly (p < 0.001) lower among patients with DH at the time of diagnosis, but after 1 year on a gluten-free diet their quality of life was at same level as that of the controls. The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms was shown to significantly increase the burden of untreated DH. We conclude that there is a significant burden related to untreated, but not to treated, DH, and the burden is even greater among DH patients with gastrointestinal symptoms.","['Pasternack C', 'Kaukinen K', 'Kurppa K', 'Mäki M', 'Collin P', 'Hervonen K', 'Reunala T', 'Huhtala H', 'Kekkonen L', 'Salmi T']",2017,97,1,Acta Derm Venereol,"Pasternack C, et al.

Reports of other autoimmune skin disease in this setting are rare. We sought to expand the spectrum of cutaneous immune-mediated effects related to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In this report, we describe two unusual cutaneous reactions related to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, namely bullous pemphigoid (BP) and dermatitis herpetiformis. The development of BP and dermatitis herpetiformis in the context of checkpoint inhibitor therapy is consistent with previous investigations supporting the importance of effector and regulatory T cells in the pathogenesis of these diseases.","['Mochel MC', 'Ming ME', 'Imadojemu S', 'Gangadhar TC', 'Schuchter LM', 'Elenitsas R', 'Payne AS', 'Chu EY']",2016,43,9,J Cutan Pathol,"Mochel MC, et al.

27136959,The Decreasing Prevalence of Severe Villous Atrophy in Dermatitis Herpetiformis: A 45-Year Experience in 393 Patients.,"GOALS: We analyzed from our prospectively collected series of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) whether small-bowel histologic findings are changing and how serum tissue transglutaminase (TG2) IgA antibodies correlate to mucosal damage.
BACKGROUND: DH is an extraintestinal manifestation of celiac disease presenting with itchy blistering rash and pathognomonic IgA deposits in the skin. Prominent gastrointestinal symptoms are rare, and small-bowel findings range from severe villous atrophy (SVA) and partial villous atrophy (PVA) to normal mucosa with inflammatory changes.
METHODS: The cohort included 393 patients (214 male and 179 female) with DH having small-bowel biopsies performed at Tampere University Hospital since 1970. The small-bowel findings were calculated in the three 15-year periods, and in the last period they were correlated with serum IgA class TG2 antibody levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The prevalence of SVA decreased significantly (P=0.032), from 42% in the first study period to 29% in the last study period. A concomitant increase was seen in PVA, from 33% to 41%, and normal villous architecture, from 25% to 30%. The patients with SVA (P<0.001) and PVA (P=0.046) had significantly higher TG2 antibody levels than those with normal villous architecture.
CONCLUSIONS: This long-term study in patients with DH disclosed a significant decrease in the occurrence of SVA. Serum IgA TG2 antibody levels correlated to damage in the small bowel. The trend toward milder small-bowel histology in DH suggests that a similar pattern could occur in the pool of undiagnosed celiac disease from which DH develops.","['Mansikka E', 'Hervonen K', 'Salmi TT', 'Kautiainen H', 'Kaukinen K', 'Collin P', 'Reunala T']",2017,51,3,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Mansikka E, et al.

27136107,Utility of Direct Immunofluorescence Studies in Subclassification of Autoimmune Sub-Epidermal Bullous Diseases: A 2-Year Study in a Tertiary Care Hospital.,"OBJECTIVE: Sub-epidermal bullous disorders belong to immunobullous diseases which develop as a result of autoantibody action against epidermal basement membrane proteins. Clinically, they are tense bullae and do not rupture easily. They are classified into various forms based on histopathology and direct immunofluorescence patterns. This study was undertaken to assess the incidence of various sub-epidermal bullous disorders and the utility of direct immunofluorescence in accurately classifying them, and to study the intensity and pattern of immunofluorescence in various sub-epidermal bullous disorders Material and Method: A 2-year study of 38 cases of sub-epidermal bullous disorders sent for direct immunofluorescence studies formed the study group. The specimens were processed as per standard protocols. The clinical details were obtained from case files and requisition sent for histopathological and direct immunofluorescence studies.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were diagnosed to have sub-epidermal bullous disorders over the period of 2 years. Twenty five cases of Bullous Pemphigoid, 5 cases of Dermatitis Herpetiformis, 3 cases of Linear IgA Bullous disorder, 2 cases of Bullous Systemic Lupus Erythematoses and 1 case each of Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita, Cicatricial Pemphigoid and Pemphigus Gestationis was diagnosed. Positive direct immunofluorescence was seen in 91.3% of the cases.
CONCLUSION: Histopathology alone cannot classify sub-epidermal bullous disorders and direct immunofluorescence studies are mandatory in all of them. Bullous Pemphigoid needs to be distinguished from Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita which requires Salt split direct immunofluorescence studies. Dermatitis Herpetiformis, Bullous Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Linear IgA Bullous disorder show more or less similar histological picture with neutrophilic microabscess. Direct immunofluorescence studies help in the majority of cases but further testing such as immunoblotting, immunoelectron microscopy or indirect immunofluorescence becomes essential in cases with overlapping features.","['Jain S', 'Basavaraj V', 'Vimala MG']",2016,32,2,Turk Patoloji Derg,"Jain S, et al.

27088957,"Clinical, demographic and immunopathological spectrum of subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases at a tertiary center: A 1-year audit.","BACKGROUND: The subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases are a subset of immunobullous diseases encountered less frequently in the Indian population. There is a paucity of data on the prevalence, demographic and clinicopathological spectrum of various subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases from India.
AIM: To determine the demographic and clinicopathological profile of subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases in Indian patients, presenting to the Immunobullous Disease Clinic of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.
METHODS: Patients seen from November 2013 to November 2014 who fulfilled the preset diagnostic criteria of subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases were identified from case records. Data regarding demographic characteristics, clinical profile, immunopathological findings and treatment were collected from the predesigned proforma.
RESULTS: Of 268 cases of autoimmune bullous diseases registered, 50 (18.7%) were subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases. Bullous pemphigoid was most frequently seen in 20 (40%) cases, followed by dermatitis herpetiformis in 14 (28%), mucous membrane pemphigoid in 6 (12%), chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood / linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis in 5 (10%), lichen planus pemphigoides in 3 (6%), pemphigoid gestationis and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita in 1 (2%) case each. None of the patients had bullous systemic lupus erythematosus.
LIMITATIONS: We could not perform direct and indirect immunofluorescence using salt-split skin as a substrate and immunoblotting due to non-availability of these facilities. Therefore, misclassification of subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases in some cases cannot be confidently excluded.
CONCLUSION: Subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases are not uncommon in Indian patients. Bullous pemphigoid contributes maximally to the burden of subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases in India, similar to that in the West, although the proportion is lower and disease onset is earlier. Dermatitis herpetiformis was observed to have a higher prevalence in our population, compared to that in the West and the Far East countries. The prevalence of other subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases is relatively low. Detailed immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies on larger patient numbers would help better characterize the pattern of subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases and their features in Indian patients.","['De D', 'Khullar G', 'Handa S', 'Saikia UN', 'Radotra BD', 'Saikia B', 'Minz RW']",2016,82,3,Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol,"De D, et al.

27026081,Serum transglutaminase 3 antibodies correlate with age at celiac disease diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: Transglutaminase (TG)2 is the autoantigen in celiac disease, but also TG3 antibodies have been detected in the serum of celiac disease patients.
AIMS: To investigate the correlations between serum TG3 antibodies and clinical and histological manifestations of celiac disease and to assess gluten-dependency of TG3 antibodies.
METHODS: Correlations between serum TG3 antibody levels measured from 119 adults and children with untreated coeliac disease and the demographic data, clinical symptoms, celiac antibodies, histological data and results of laboratory tests and bone mineral densities were tested. TG3 antibodies were reinvestigated in 97 celiac disease patients after 12 months on a gluten-free diet (GFD).
RESULTS: TG3 antibody titers were shown to correlate with the age at celiac disease diagnosis. Further, negative correlation with TG3 antibodies and intestinal γδ+ cells at diagnosis and on GFD was detected. Correlations were not detected with the clinical manifestation of celiac disease, TG2 or endomysial autoantibodies, laboratory values, severity of mucosal villous atrophy, associated diseases or complications. TG3 antibody titers decreased on GFD in 56% of the TG3 antibody positive patients.
CONCLUSION: Serum TG3 antibody positivity in celiac disease increases as the diagnostic age rises. TG3 antibodies did not show similar gluten-dependency as TG2 antibodies.","['Salmi TT', 'Kurppa K', 'Hervonen K', 'Laurila K', 'Collin P', 'Huhtala H', 'Saavalainen P', 'Sievänen H', 'Reunala T', 'Kaukinen K']",2016,48,6,Dig Liver Dis,"Salmi TT, et al.

26990286,Extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease: 33-mer gliadin binding to glutamate receptor GRINA as a new explanation.,"We propose a biochemical mechanism for celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity that may rationalize many of the extradigestive disorders not explained by the current immunogenetic model. Our hypothesis is based on the homology between the 33-mer gliadin peptide and a component of the NMDA glutamate receptor ion channel - the human GRINA protein - using BLASTP software. Based on this homology the 33-mer may act as a natural antagonist interfering with the normal interactions of GRINA and its partners. The theory is supported by numerous independent data from the literature, and provides a mechanistic link with otherwise unrelated disorders, such as cleft lip and palate, thyroid dysfunction, restless legs syndrome, depression, ataxia, hearing loss, fibromyalgia, dermatitis herpetiformis, schizophrenia, toxoplasmosis, anemia, osteopenia, Fabry disease, Barret's adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, urinary incontinence, recurrent miscarriage, cardiac anomalies, reduced risk of breast cancer, stiff person syndrome, etc. The hypothesis also anticipates better animal models, and has the potential to open new avenues of research.","['Garcia-Quintanilla A', 'Miranzo-Navarro D']",2016,38,5,Bioessays,Garcia-Quintanilla A and Miranzo-Navarro D.

26940855,The frequency of mucosal-associated invariant T cells is selectively increased in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a novel subset of innate-like T-cells that are enriched in mucosal tissues. Their presence in human skin has only recently been recognised. We describe the expression of skin-tropic molecules on human skin MAIT cells at steady state and investigate their contribution to various dermatoses with known T-cell involvement.
METHODS: To examine the expression of skin-tropic molecules by MAIT cells at steady state, we performed a flow cytometric analysis of blood and skin samples from healthy donors. To investigate any potential wider contribution of MAIT cells to skin disease, we examined psoriasis, alopecia areata and dermatitis herpetiformis biopsies using immunofluorescent staining to identify the proportion of T-cells expressing MAIT cell surface markers.
RESULTS: We found that MAIT cells constituted a small population of T-cells in normal human skin, similar to the percentage found in peripheral blood. Like other skin T-cells, skin MAIT cells expressed high levels of the skin-associated markers, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen and CD103. In psoriasis and alopecia areata the proportion of MAIT cells was similar to that found in normal skin, but in dermatitis herpetiformis it was significantly elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of skin-tropic molecules by skin MAIT cells is consistent with their resident status in normal human skin. Our results suggest that MAIT cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Li J', 'Reantragoon R', 'Kostenko L', 'Corbett AJ', 'Varigos G', 'Carbone FR']",2017,58,3,Australas J Dermatol,"Li J, et al.

In this study we collected 20 such patients, none of whom showed cutaneous vasculitis histopathologically. Oral dapsone and topical steroids were effective. Various serological tests detected no autoantibodies or autoantigens. Direct immunofluorescence for various complement components revealed deposition only of C3 and C5-C9, indicating that no known complement pathways were involved. Studies of in situ hybridization and micro-dissection with quantitative RT-PCR revealed a slight reduction in expression of C3 in patient epidermis. These patients may represent a new disease entity, for which we propose the term ""granular C3 dermatosis"". The mechanism for granular C3 deposition in these patients is unknown, but it is possible that the condition is caused by autoantibodies to skin or aberrant C3 expression in epidermal keratinocytes.","['Hashimoto T', 'Tsuruta D', 'Yasukochi A', 'Imanishi H', 'Sekine H', 'Fujita T', 'Wanibuchi H', 'Gi M', 'Kárpáti S', 'Sitaru C', 'Zone JJ', 'Endo D', 'Abe S', 'Nishino T', 'Koji T', 'Ishii N']",2016,96,6,Acta Derm Venereol,"Hashimoto T, et al.

26831462,Prospects of Developing Medicinal Therapeutic Strategies and Pharmaceutical Design for Effective Gluten Intolerance Treatment.,"Gluten intolerance is an umbrella term for gluten-related disorders manifested in health decline as a result of the gluten ingestion. The spectrum of gluten-related disorders includes three major groups: autoimmune (mainly, Celiac Disease, CD, also known as Celiac Sprue, dermatitis herpetiformis, or gluten-sensitive ataxia), allergic (wheat allergy, WA), and non-autoimmune non-allergic (non-celiac gluten sensitivity, NCGS, or gluten sensitivity, GS). Pathogenesis and diagnostics of CD and WA are well established in contrast to NCGS, pathogenicity of which is still poorly understood and its symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed since most of the NCGS cases are currently identified via the process of CD and WA exclusion. By now, the only one proven effective way for CD treatment is gluten-free diet (GFD). However, such an increasingly gaining popularity diet is apparently unsuitable for NCGS treatment because in this case gluten does not always arise as the major or exclusive culprit of gastrointestinal disorder. Furthermore, it is some physicians' opinion that GFD can be deficient in fiber and in other vitamins and minerals. In many cases, GFD is commercially inaccessible for the most needy, whereas strict adherence to the diet is complicated by the presence of small amounts of the gluten components in some foods and even medicines. In this regard, a number of research groups and pharmaceutical companies are extensively developing alternative medicinal approaches to GFD for effective gluten intolerance treatment. This review summarizes our understanding of gluten-related disorders, possible mechanisms of gluten intolerance activation and advantages of gluten intolerance medicinal treatment using novel drug candidates obtained with a proper pharmaceutical design.","['Savvateeva LV', 'Zamyatnin AA']",2016,22,16,Curr Pharm Des,Savvateeva LV and Zamyatnin AA.

26811692,Spectrum of autoimmune vesiculobullous diseases in Iran: a 13-year retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune bullous diseases (ABDs) represent a group of rare, acquired disorders characterized by overlapping features with involvement of the skin and mucous membranes, resistance to treatment, and potential lethality that comprise pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid (BP), epidermolysis bullosa, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis.
AIM: The main aim of this study was to identify the epidemiologic characteristics and clinical courses of these common diseases in Hamadan, Iran. Few surveys have been carried out to demonstrate the whole spectrum of ABDs in the literature. Notably, in Hamadan we are the first.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 13-year retrospective study was designed to evaluate all of documented data obtained from hospitalized patients with ABDs at Farshchian Hospital from October 1999 to October 2012. We collected information on epidemiologic data, clinical aspects, histologic findings, and therapy prescribed. Data were analyzed using SPSS.
RESULTS: Of 168 patients, 78% had pemphigus. The age of patients at presentation ranged from 1 month to 115 years, with a mean of 47.5±19.93 years. Mucosal or skin involvement of ABDs was statistically significant (P<0.001). The incidence of ABDs differed significantly based on anatomic location (P=0.003). We documented three deaths.
CONCLUSION: Compared to previous literature, our findings showed equal epidemiologic properties in Iran. Although pemphigus was the most common ABD followed by BP, it is expected that in line with the global trend, an increase in BP will be driven by population aging in Iran.","['Sobhan M', 'Farshchian M', 'Tamimi M']",2016,9,,Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol,"Sobhan M, et al.

26711431,Literature-based immunization recommendations for patients requiring immunosuppressive medications for autoimmune bullous dermatoses.,"Autoimmune bullous diseases, such as pemphigus, pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis, are uniquely associated with vulnerability in the mucocutaneous barrier against infection. The management of immunobullous diseases is complex and may at times require immunosuppressive medications. Iatrogenic immunosuppression may increase susceptibility to vaccine-preventable illnesses. Currently, there are no guidelines to assist the clinician treating patients with immunobullous disease regarding the delivery of various vaccinations. The aim of this review is to provide recommendations for immunization in the unique setting of immunobullous disease. Recommendations are based on careful review of the literature in other conditions requiring iatrogenic immunosuppression, as well as the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Immunization with nonlive vaccines appears to be a safe and effective strategy for preventing infection in the particularly susceptible patient with immunobullous disease. Opportunities for live vaccine administration may become available at lower levels of immune suppression or during clinical remission when immunosuppressive regimens can be reduced. Anticipatory vaccination before the initiation of iatrogenic immunosuppression is ideal.

26686016,Bullous diseases: Kids are not just little people.,"Bullous diseases may be rare; however, this does not preclude the clinician from being familiar with their manifestations and treatment. After ruling out infection, genetically inherited blistering diseases are more likely to be the cause of blistering or erosions in the neonatal period, whereas immunobullous diseases are more common in adults. Published literature on immunobullous disorders reflects information gleaned from case reports and open-label case series; prospective studies and evidence-based treatments are limited. Although there may be overlapping clinical features, significant clinical differences exist between adults and children. Evidence-based treatment guidelines are limited, and information from the adult literature cannot be readily generalized to the pediatric population. This paper reviews the approach to blistering conditions and the differences among bullous pemphigoid, linear immunoglobulin A disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus vulgaris, and paraneoplastic pemphigus in adult versus pediatric patients.","['Marathe K', 'Lu J', 'Morel KD']",2015,33,6,Clin Dermatol,"Marathe K, et al.

The presence and localization of immune reactants in this disorder are reviewed. A retrospective study on 72 biopsies from 71 patients with DH was performed. Deposits of IgG, IgA, IgM, C'3, C1q, and fibrinogen in skin using a DIF test were analyzed. Granular IgA was observed at the dermal-epidermal junction in 65 biopsies and in the fibers of the papillary dermis in 72 samples. IgG, IgM, C'3, C1q, and fibrinogen were detected in the same locations in lower percentages. IgA was present in the vessels of the papillary dermis in 33 biopsies and in the reticular dermis in 10, followed by fibrinogen, C'3, IgM, and IgG. IgA and IgM were detected in the elastic fibers in 17 and 5 samples, respectively. IgA was observed in 19 cases in the arrector pili muscles, and in a few cases, C'3, IgM, and IgG. IgA and other immune reagents were present in the fibers around hair follicles and in the basement membrane of sweat glands and ducts.

26572994,Utility of direct immunofluorescence testing for IgA in patients with high and low clinical suspicion for dermatitis herpetiformis.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing for the characteristic immunoglobulin A deposits of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) in patients stratified into high and low clinical suspicion subgroups.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the results of H&E and DIF testing in 77 cases of suspected DH and separated them into high and low clinical suspicion subgroups based on clinical impression at the time of biopsy.
RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of routine (H&E) histologic evaluation were 0.75 and 0.951, respectively. Although there were 13 cases of DH (of 36 total cases) in the high clinical suspicion subgroup, there were only three (of 41 total cases) in the low clinical suspicion subgroup. In the high clinical suspicion subgroup, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.9, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.846. Alternatively, the PPV was 0.6 and the NPV was 1.0 for the low clinical suspicion subgroup. Histologic false negatives did occur, but all were in patients within the high clinical suspicion subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: It is anticipated that the NPV and PPV will vary due to differing clinical practice characteristics; however, in patients with a low clinical suspicion for DH, these data argue that it may be reasonable to first perform a biopsy for routine histologic evaluation before requesting DIF analysis.","['Bresler SC', 'Granter SR']",2015,144,6,Am J Clin Pathol,Bresler SC and Granter SR.

26498608,Celiac Disease: Diagnosis.,"Historically the diagnosis of celiac disease has relied upon clinical, serological, and histological evidence. In recent years the use of sensitive serological methods has meant an increase in the diagnosis of celiac disease. The heterogeneous nature of the disorder presents a challenge in the study and diagnosis of the disease with patients varying from subclinical or latent disease to patients with overt symptoms. Furthermore the related gluten-sensitive disease dermatitis herpetiformis, while distinct in some respects, shares clinical and serological features with celiac disease. Here we summarize current best practice for the diagnosis of celiac disease and briefly discuss newer approaches. The advent of next-generation assays for diagnosis and newer clinical protocols may result in more sensitive screening and ultimately the possible replacement of the intestinal biopsy as the gold standard for celiac disease diagnosis.","['Byrne G', 'Feighery CF']",2015,1326,,Methods Mol Biol,Byrne G and Feighery CF.

26452305,Symptoms and findings in adult-onset celiac disease in a historical Danish patient cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: The presentation of celiac disease (CD) has changed over the past decades. We aimed to describe the incidence of CD and its complications at diagnosis in a historical cohort in a well-defined population in Denmark.
METHODS: We included all patients aged 15+ years, who lived in Aarhus County, Denmark, and who were diagnosed with CD between January 2008 and August 2013. Data regarding gastrointestinal symptoms, anthropometrics, biochemistry, and bone mineral density were retrieved from patient records.
RESULTS: A total of 93 patients with a valid CD diagnosis were identified, corresponding to an incidence rate of 6.4 per 100,000 person-years. At diagnosis, diarrhea and weight loss occurred in 54% and 47% patients, respectively. In total, 30% had anemia; 40%, iron deficiency; 20%, folate deficiency; and 17%, vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 34%. In 28%, bone mineral density was determined during the first year after diagnosis. Of these, 54% had osteopenia and 12% osteoporosis. After introduction of a gluten-free diet, 28% had normalized transglutaminase antibody levels after 6 months, and 56% did after 12 months. Diabetes mellitus type 1 was present in 7%; dermatitis herpetiformis, in 3%; and thyroid dysfunction, in 5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Only half of newly diagnosed CD patients presented with classic gastrointestinal symptoms. Anemia and vitamin deficiencies were common. Bone mineral density was determined in less than a third of the patients, and osteoporosis occurred in 12% of these. Serologic markers of CD normalized in approximately half of patients during the first year after the diagnosis.","['Schøsler L', 'Christensen LA', 'Hvas CL']",2016,51,3,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Schøsler L, et al.

METHODS: TRPV4 protein in normal skin tissues and lesions of PV, BP, DH, and EBA were detected with immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The positivity rate of TRPV4 protein expression was 61.90% in PV, 81.81% in BP, 72.22% in DH, and 68.42% in EBA. TRPV4-positive rates in these lesions were significantly lower than the rate in normal skin tissues (93.33%) and also differed significantly among these lesions (PV<EBA<DH<BP).

26391853,Retrospective Study on Autoimmune Blistering Disease in Paediatric Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBDs) are rare in children and their prevalence in Singapore is unclear. We aimed to investigate the clinical and immunopathologic characteristics of children diagnosed with AIBDs in Singapore.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and histology databases at the National Skin Centre in Singapore were searched to identify patients younger than 18 years old diagnosed with an AIBD from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2012. Patient demographic characteristics, presentation, triggers, investigations, treatments, and disease course were analyzed.
RESULTS: Twelve patients with AIBDs were identified; five (41.7%) had linear immunoglobulin A disease (LAD); two (16.7%) each had pemphigus vulgaris (PV), bullous pemphigoid, and bullous systemic lupus erythematosus; and one (8.3%) had pemphigus foliaceus. Four (33.3%) were female and eight (66.7%) male. The mean age of onset was 8.7 years (range 2-17 years). Most patients were treated with steroids and adjuvant immunosuppressants. Intravenous rituximab was used effectively in a patient with recalcitrant PV. The mean follow-up was 2.35 years (range 0.17-7.33 years). As of the last follow-up, four (33.3%) patients were in complete remission off therapy, two (16.7%) were in complete remission on therapy, four (33.3%) were in partial remission on therapy, and two (16.7%) were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with the existing literature, our study shows that LAD is the most common cause of AIBDs in children. Although common in the West, dermatitis herpetiformis was not identified in the current study. Intravenous rituximab may be considered in recalcitrant childhood PV, but vigilant monitoring for side effects is crucial. Immunohistopathologic evaluation is important and repeat biopsies may be of value in patients with atypical disease courses.","['Kong YL', 'Lim YL', 'Chandran NS']",2015,32,6,Pediatr Dermatol,"Kong YL, et al.

26389946,Cutaneous Manifestations of Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: Clinical Histological and Immunopathological Features.,"BACKGROUND: The dermatological manifestations associated with intestinal diseases are becoming more frequent, especially now when new clinical entities, such as Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS), are identified. The existence of this new entity is still debated. However, many patients with diagnosed NCGS that present intestinal manifestations have skin lesions that need appropriate characterization.
METHODS: We involved 17 patients affected by NCGS with non-specific cutaneous manifestations who got much better after a gluten free diet. For a histopathological and immunopathological evaluation, two skin samples from each patient and their clinical data were collected.
RESULTS: The median age of the 17 enrolled patients affected by NCGS was 36 years and 76% of them were females. On the extensor surfaces of upper and lower limbs in particular, they all presented very itchy dermatological manifestations morphologically similar to eczema, psoriasis or dermatitis herpetiformis. This similarity was also confirmed histologically, but the immunopathological analysis showed the prevalence of deposits of C3 along the dermo-epidermal junction with a microgranular/granular pattern (82%).
CONCLUSIONS: The exact characterization of new clinical entities such as Cutaneous Gluten Sensitivity and NCGS is an important objective both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, since these are patients who actually benefit from a GFD (Gluten Free Diet) and who do not adopt it only for fashion.","['Bonciolini V', 'Bianchi B', 'Del Bianco E', 'Verdelli A', 'Caproni M']",2015,7,9,Nutrients,"Bonciolini V, et al.

26304430,Application of the rat liver lysosome assay to determining the reduction of toxic gliadin content during breadmaking.,"Enriched caricain was able to detoxify a major proportion of the gliadin in wholemeal wheat dough by allowing it to react for 5h at 37 °C during the fermentation stage. A reduction of 82% in toxicity, as determined by the rat-liver lysosome assay, was achieved using 0.03% enzyme on weight of dough. Without enzyme, only 26% reduction occurred. The difference in reduction of toxicity achieved is statistically significant (p < 0.01). The results are very similar to those obtained in our previous work using an immuno assay and the same enzyme preparation. They confirm the value of caricain as a means of reducing the toxicity of gliadin and open the way for enzyme therapy as an adjunct to the gluten free diet. This approach should lead to better control over the elimination of dietary gluten intake in conditions such as coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Cornell HJ', 'Stelmasiak T', 'Small DM', 'Buddrick O']",2016,192,,Food Chem,"Cornell HJ, et al.

26287240,"Intestinal Microbiota and Celiac Disease: Cause, Consequence or Co-Evolution?","It is widely recognized that the intestinal microbiota plays a role in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in numerous chronic conditions. Most studies report intestinal dysbiosis in celiac disease (CD) patients, untreated and treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD), compared to healthy controls. CD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are also known to have a different microbiota compared to patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and controls, suggesting that the microbiota is involved in disease manifestation. Furthermore, a dysbiotic microbiota seems to be associated with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms in treated CD patients, suggesting its pathogenic implication in these particular cases. GFD per se influences gut microbiota composition, and thus constitutes an inevitable confounding factor in studies conducted in CD patients. To improve our understanding of whether intestinal dysbiosis is the cause or consequence of disease, prospective studies in healthy infants at family risk of CD are underway. These studies have revealed that the CD host genotype selects for the early colonizers of the infant's gut, which together with environmental factors (e.g., breast-feeding, antibiotics, etc.) could influence the development of oral tolerance to gluten. Indeed, some CD genes and/or their altered expression play a role in bacterial colonization and sensing. In turn, intestinal dysbiosis could promote an abnormal response to gluten or other environmental CD-promoting factors (e.g., infections) in predisposed individuals. Here, we review the current knowledge of host-microbe interactions and how host genetics/epigenetics and environmental factors shape gut microbiota and may influence disease risk. We also summarize the current knowledge about the potential mechanisms of action of the intestinal microbiota and specific components that affect CD pathogenesis.","['Cenit MC', 'Olivares M', 'Codoñer-Franch P', 'Sanz Y']",2015,7,8,Nutrients,"Cenit MC, et al.

26267424,Quality of Life and Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Long-Term Treated Dermatitis Herpetiformis Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study in Finland.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Both conditions are treated with a restrictive life-long gluten-free diet (GFD). Treated celiac disease patients have been shown to have more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and inferior quality of life compared with healthy controls, but evidence regarding quality of life in DH is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate whether long-term GFD-treated DH patients suffer from persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and if they experience a drawdown in quality of life.
METHODS: Gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life were assessed in 78 long-term GFD-treated DH patients using the validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, Psychological General Well-Being and Short Form 36 Health Survey questionnaires. The findings were compared with 110 healthy controls, population-based reference values and 371 treated celiac disease controls.
RESULTS: The median age of the DH patients at the time of the study was 57 years, and 51 % were male. Significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms or quality of life were not detected when treated DH patients were compared with healthy controls, but treated DH patients had less severe gastrointestinal symptoms and increased quality of life compared with celiac disease controls. Female DH patients had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced vitality compared with male DH patients. The presence of skin symptoms and the adherence to or duration of GFD did not have any influence on gastrointestinal symptoms or quality of life.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term GFD-treated DH patients do not suffer from the burden of dietary treatment and have a quality of life comparable to that of controls.","['Pasternack C', 'Kaukinen K', 'Kurppa K', 'Mäki M', 'Collin P', 'Reunala T', 'Huhtala H', 'Salmi T']",2015,16,6,Am J Clin Dermatol,"Pasternack C, et al.

26260366,Extraintestinal manifestations of coeliac disease.,"Coeliac disease is a common disorder that can arise at any age and typically presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms. The disease is thought to be underdiagnosed, in part owing to the fact that coeliac disease is often characterized by associated conditions and extraintestinal manifestations that can misdirect and impede diagnosis. Some of these manifestations are direct consequences of autoimmunity, such as dermatitis herpetiformis or gluten ataxia, whereas others are indirectly related to inflammation and/or malabsorption including anaemia, osteoporosis, short stature and delayed puberty. Any organ from the central nervous system to joints, liver or teeth can be affected. In some cases, extraintestinal symptoms are the only clinical manifestations of coeliac disease or occur in conjunction with diarrhoea and malabsorptive symptoms. An increased awareness among medical practitioners of the variety of extraintestinal manifestations of coeliac disease is essential to improve diagnosis and treatment.","['Leffler DA', 'Green PH', 'Fasano A']",2015,12,10,Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Leffler DA, et al.

This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence on the use of acupuncture as a primary treatment modality for dermatologic conditions.
METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register was performed. Studies were limited to clinical trials, controlled studies, case reports, comparative studies, and systematic reviews published in the English language. Studies involving moxibustion, electroacupuncture, or blood-letting were excluded.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Among these, 16 were randomized controlled trials, 6 were prospective observational studies, and 2 were case reports. Acupuncture was used to treat atopic dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus, acne, chloasma, neurodermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, hyperhidrosis, human papillomavirus wart, breast inflammation, and facial elasticity. In 17 of 24 studies, acupuncture showed statistically significant improvements in outcome measurements compared with placebo acupuncture, alternative treatment options, and no intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture improves outcome measures in the treatment of dermatitis, chloasma, pruritus, urticaria, hyperhidrosis, and facial elasticity. Future studies should ideally be double-blinded and standardize the control intervention.","['Ma C', 'Sivamani RK']",2015,21,9,J Altern Complement Med,Ma C and Sivamani RK.

26111459,Associations of coeliac disease with coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"AIMS: Clinical experience suggests that atherosclerotic disease is common in individuals with coeliac disease, but epidemiological studies have had contradicting findings. To summarise the currently available evidence, we systematically reviewed and analysed observational studies of the association of coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis with coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke.
DATA SYNTHESIS: We searched for studies comparing CHD or stroke outcomes with individuals with and without coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis. Three investigators independently searched electronic databases, identified relevant studies and extracted data. Study-specific results were combined in random-effects meta-analyses, and heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic and meta-regression. Twenty-one studies were included in our systematic review and 18 in the meta-analyses. For CHD, the pooled hazard ratio for incident disease was 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 1.19) and the overall standardised mortality ratio was 1.21 (0.99, 1.49). For stroke and brain haemorrhage, the corresponding estimates were 1.10 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.21) and 1.43 (0.97, 2.10), respectively. There was moderate to considerable heterogeneity among the study-specific estimates. In addition, many estimates were based on small numbers of outcomes and they had limitations in terms of adjustment for potential confounders.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analyses lend some support to an association between coeliac disease and CHD or cerebrovascular disease, but the evidence base was heterogeneous and had limitations. Our systematic review highlighted a need in this area for adequately powered prospective studies with appropriate adjustment for potentially confounding factors.","['Heikkilä K', 'Koskinen OA', 'Agarwal A', 'Tikkinen KAO', 'Mäki M', 'Kaukinen K']",2015,25,9,Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,"Heikkilä K, et al.

26084552,Dermatitis Herpetiformis Refractory to Gluten-free Dietary Treatment.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering skin disease, which is regarded as an extra-intestinal manifestation of coeliac disease. Refractory cases of coeliac disease, that do not respond to a gluten-free diet and which carry an increased risk of lymphoma, are well-known in coeliac disease. To determine whether refractory cases of DH with active rash and persistent small bowel atrophy occur we analysed our series of 403 patients with DH. Seven (1.7%) patients, who had been on a gluten-free diet for a mean of 16 years, but who still required dapsone to treat the symptoms of DH, were identified. Of these, one patient died from mucinous adenocarcinoma before re-examination. At re-examination skin immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits were found in 5/6 refractory and 3/16 control DH patients with good dietary response. Small bowel mucosa was studied at re-examination from 5 refractory and 8 control DH patients and was normal in all 5 refractory and 7/8 control DH patients. One refractory DH patient died from adenocarcinoma, but no lymphoma developed in any of the patients. This study documents for the first time refractory DH, in which the rash is non-responsive to a gluten-free diet, but the small bowel mucosa heals. This differs from refractory coeliac disease, in which the small bowel mucosa does not heal on a gluten-free diet.","['Hervonen K', 'Salmi TT', 'Ilus T', 'Paasikivi K', 'Vornanen M', 'Laurila K', 'Lindfors K', 'Viiri K', 'Saavalainen P', 'Collin P', 'Kaukinen K', 'Reunala T']",2016,96,1,Acta Derm Venereol,"Hervonen K, et al.

26060110,Preventing complications in celiac disease: our experience with managing adult celiac disease.,"Celiac disease is, as we know it, rather than being a rare and incurable disease until the 1950's, both quite common in screening studies and readily treatable. Three conditions are triggered by gluten consumption: celiac disease, the skin rash dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten ataxia. We describe our follow up for out clinic management, as evidence based data about such an approach are lacking in current literature. No food, beverages or medications containing any amount of gluten can be taken. Compliance is often difficult especially when patients are asymptomatic. We control a cohort, in daily practice, of over 700 adult patients. The majority of patients manage the diet without any problems. We describe our follow up in general, for serology, laboratory and histology. Forty percent of our newly diagnosed celiac patients do have a BMI over 25 kg/m(2). An appropriate attitude for this problem is lacking. The problem of slowly weaning off Dapsone over 5-10 years in DH is recognized. The bone density is checked in all newly diagnosed celiac patients. We control, if necessary, by telephone and lab controls done in local cities and see our patients only every two years face-to-face for follow up. The main question is if the adherence to a GFD, quality of life and prevention of complications is improved by visiting a dedicated celiac clinic. We hope to standardize this attitude on evidence data in the years to come.","['Mulder CJ', 'Wierdsma NJ', 'Berkenpas M', 'Jacobs MA', 'Bouma G']",2015,29,3,Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol,"Mulder CJ, et al.

26060104,Adaptive diagnosis of coeliac disease.,"Coeliac disease has for a long time simply been regarded as a gluten-dependent enteropathy and a duodenal biopsy was required in all patients for the diagnosis. It is now accepted that autoimmunity against transglutaminase 2 is an earlier, more universal and more specific feature of coeliac disease than histologic lesions. Moreover, high serum levels of combined anti-transglutaminase 2 and anti-endomysium antibody positivity have excellent predictive value for the presence of enteropathy with villous atrophy. This makes the histology evaluation of the gut no longer necessary in well defined symptomatic paediatric patients with compatible HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 background. The biopsy-sparing diagnostic route is not yet recommended by gastroenterologists for adults, and certain clinical circumstances (immunodeficiency conditions, extraintestinal manifestations, type-1 diabetes mellitus, age less than 2 years) may require modified diagnostic approaches. Coeliac patients with preserved duodenal villous structure do exist and these need a more extended evaluation by immunologic and molecular biology tools.","['Korponay-Szabó IR', 'Troncone R', 'Discepolo V']",2015,29,3,Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol,"Korponay-Szabó IR, et al.

26059085,Dermatitis herpetiformis: pathognomonic transglutaminase IgA deposits in the skin and excellent prognosis on a gluten-free diet.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an itchy, blistering skin disease with sites of predilection at the elbows, knees and buttocks. Although DH is mostly asymptomatic, all patients exhibit small bowel villous atrophy or at least coeliac-type inflammatory changes. Deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the papillary dermis is a key diagnostic feature of DH. Epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) is the antigen for IgA deposited in the skin, and tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is the antigen for IgA deposited in the small bowel mucosa. Clinically silent, but immunologically active coeliac disease in the gut appears to result in IgA TG3 antibody complexes aggregated into DH skin. The prevalence of DH in northern Europe is high (30-75/100,000), but its incidence is decreasing, possibly due to increased recognition of subclinical coeliac disease. The rash and small bowel heal on a gluten-free diet, which is a life-long treatment. The risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is increased, but in patients with DH who adhere strictly to a gluten-free diet long-term prognosis is excellent.","['Reunala T', 'Salmi TT', 'Hervonen K']",2015,95,8,Acta Derm Venereol,"Reunala T, et al.

26009711,Role of direct immunofluorescence in dermatological disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) test for tissue-bound autoantibodies, has been found to be of value in the diagnosis of several dermatological disorders. The location and pattern of deposition of immunoreactants helps in classifying various immune-mediated diseases.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the concordance between the clinical, histopathological and DIF diagnosis in bullous and nonbullous lesions of the skin, and thus determine the impact of immunofluorescence on diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 215 skin biopsies performed in suspected immune-mediated vesiculobullous disease, vasculitis or dermatosis, were studied. Histopathological examination was done along with DIF study for deposits of immunoglobulin G(IgG), IgA, IgM, and C3.
RESULTS: Direct immunofluorescence was positive in 103/215 cases. There was very good concordance between the clinical, histological and DIF results (observed agreement = 93.4%, κ =0.90, with 95% confidence interval = 0.86-0.94). The overall sensitivity of DIF in immune-mediated skin disorders was 98.0%. DIF was positive in 52/53 cases (98.1%) in the pemphigus group and 24/25 (96.0%) bullous pemphigoid cases. None of the clinically suspected cases of dermatitis herpetiformis showed DIF positivity. A positive lupus band test was seen in 9/9 (100%) cases of lupus erythematosus. DIF was positive in 10/10 (100%) clinically suspected cases of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. In 110 cases, negative DIF results helped to rule out immune-mediated vesiculobullous disorders, lupus erythematosus and vasculitis, and the final diagnosis was made on the basis of the clinical features and/or histopathology.
CONCLUSION: Direct immunofluorescence is a useful supplement for the accurate diagnosis of immune-mediated dermatological disorders, and helps to classify various autoimmune bullous disorders. When the clinical features/histopathology are inconclusive, the diagnosis often can be made on the basis of the DIF findings alone. A combination of the clinical features, histopathology and DIF usually gives the best results.","['Mysorekar VV', 'Sumathy TK', 'Shyam Prasad AL']",2015,6,3,Indian Dermatol Online J,"Mysorekar VV, et al.

25999753,The diagnosis and treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an inflammatory cutaneous disease with a chronic relapsing course, pruritic polymorphic lesions, and typical histopathological and immunopathological findings. According to several evidences, DH is considered the specific cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, and the most recent guidelines of celiac disease have stated that, in celiac patients with a proven DH, a duodenal biopsy is unnecessary for the diagnosis. In this review, the most recent data about the diagnosis and the management of DH have been reported and discussed. In particular, in patients with clinical and/or histopathological findings suggestive for DH, the finding of granular IgA deposits along the dermal-epidermal junction or at the papillary tips by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assay, together with positive results for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody testing, allows the diagnosis. Thereafter, a gluten-free diet should be started in association with drugs, such as dapsone, that are able to control the skin manifestations during the first phases of the diet. In conclusion, although DH is a rare autoimmune disease with specific immunopathological alterations at the skin level, its importance goes beyond the skin itself and may have a big impact on the general health status and the quality of life of the patients.","['Antiga E', 'Caproni M']",2015,8,,Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol,Antiga E and Caproni M.

25980533,Heat shock protein 90: a pathophysiological factor and novel treatment target in autoimmune bullous skin diseases.,"The chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a cell stress-inducible molecule that regulates activity of many client proteins responsible for cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis, has been proposed as an important therapeutic target in patients with malignancies. More recently, its active participation in (auto)immune processes has been recognized as evidenced by amelioration of inflammatory disease pathways through pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 in rodent models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on own current research results, this viewpoint essay provides important insights that Hsp90 is also involved as a notable pathophysiological factor in autoimmune blistering dermatoses including epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, bullous pemphigoid and possibly dermatitis herpetiformis. The observed in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo efficacy of anti-Hsp90 treatment in experimental models of autoimmune bullous diseases and its underlying multimodal anti-inflammatory mechanisms of interference with key contributors to autoimmune-mediated blister formation supports the introduction of selective non-toxic Hsp90 inhibitors into the clinical setting for the treatment of patients with these disorders.","['Tukaj S', 'Zillikens D', 'Kasperkiewicz M']",2015,24,8,Exp Dermatol,"Tukaj S, et al.

25942026,High-yield biopsy technique for subepidermal blisters.,"Dermatologists often perform 2 biopsies in patients with widespread tense blisters: one for light microscopy and another for direct immunofluorescence (DIF). Biopsy techniques recommended for blistering diseases with tense blisters are discussed, and illustrations demonstrate an alternative approach utilizing a single punch biopsy. A single punch biopsy is more cost effective and provides the same diagnostic information as the standard 2-biopsy approach for subepidermal blisters plus additional salt-split skin-like diagnostic information. A limitation for bisecting the single punch biopsy specimen is a potential complete separation of the epidermis from the dermis. The single punch biopsy technique is a simple cost-effective method for obtaining necessary diagnostic information when sampling tense blisters in patients with blistering diseases.","['Braswell MA', 'McCowan NK', 'Schulmeier JS', 'Brodell RT']",2015,95,4,Cutis,"Braswell MA, et al.

25925916,Extraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease.,"Case finding for celiac disease (CD) is becoming increasingly common practice and is conducted in a wide range of clinical situations ranging from the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms to failure to thrive in children, prolonged fatigue, unexpected weight loss and anemia. Case finding is also performed in associated conditions, such as autoimmune thyroid disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and type 1 diabetes, as well as in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, unexplained neuropsychiatric disorders and first-degree relatives of patients with diagnosed CD. This aggressive active case finding has dramatically changed the clinical characteristics of newly diagnosed patients. For instance, higher numbers of patients who present with extraintestinal symptoms are now being diagnosed with CD. Current recommendations state that due to a high risk for complications if the disease remains undiagnosed, patients with extraintestinal symptoms due to CD require appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Despite criticism regarding the cost-effectiveness of case finding in CD, such an aggressive approach has been considered cost-effective for high-risk patients. The diagnosis of CD among patients with extraintestinal symptoms requires a high degree of awareness of the clinical conditions that carry a high risk for underlying CD. Also, understanding the correct use of specific serology and duodenal histology is key for an appropriate diagnostic approach. Both procedures combined are able to confirm diagnosis in the vast majority of cases. However, in certain circumstances, serology and even duodenal histology cannot confirm or rule out CD. A common cause of negative IgA serology is IgA deficiency. For such eventuality, IgG-based serological tests can help confirm the diagnosis. Importantly, some histologically diagnosed cases still remain seronegative despite exclusion of IgA deficiency. On the other hand, duodenal histology may be normal despite the presence of CD-specific antibodies and active CD. This has been clearly demonstrated in some cases of untreated dermatitis herpetiformis, but may also be due to the patchy condition of CD or lesions that are not adequately recognized by nonexpert endoscopists and/or pathologists. The effectiveness of agluten-free diet depends on the clinical end point addressed. A good example is the outcome of bone loss. While risk for fracture normalizes after the first year of dietary treatment, bone parameters measured by densitometry may not be normalized in the long-term follow-up. Moreover, it is still unclear how far an early gluten-free diet will positively affect associated autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis.","['Pinto-Sánchez MI', 'Bercik P', 'Verdu EF', 'Bai JC']",2015,33,2,Dig Dis,"Pinto-Sánchez MI, et al.

25922672,The gluten-free diet and its current application in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: A gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently the only available therapy for coeliac disease (CD).
OBJECTIVES: We aim to review the literature on the GFD, the gluten content in naturally gluten-free (GF) and commercially available GF food, standards and legislation concerning the gluten content of foods, and the vitamins and mineral content of a GFD.
METHODS: We carried out a PubMed search for the following terms: Gluten, GFD and food, education, vitamins, minerals, calcium, Codex wheat starch and oats. Relevant papers were reviewed and for each topic a consensus among the authors was obtained.
CONCLUSION: Patients with CD should avoid gluten and maintain a balanced diet to ensure an adequate intake of nutrients, vitamins, fibre and calcium. A GFD improves symptoms in most patients with CD. The practicalities of this however, are difficult, as (i) many processed foods are contaminated with gluten, (ii) staple GF foods are not widely available, and (iii) the GF substitutes are often expensive. Furthermore, (iv) the restrictions of the diet may adversely affect social interactions and quality of life. The inclusion of oats and wheat starch in the diet remains controversial.","['Ciacci C', 'Ciclitira P', 'Hadjivassiliou M', 'Kaukinen K', 'Ludvigsson JF', 'McGough N', 'Sanders DS', 'Woodward J', 'Leonard JN', 'Swift GL']",2015,3,2,United European Gastroenterol J,"Ciacci C, et al.

25906282,Human Dermatitis After Skin Exposure to Jacobaea vulgaris and Spectrum of Health Hazards Induced by This Plant to Humans and Livestock.,"Jacobaea vulgaris is a biennial or perennial herb, reaching up to 200 cm, with pinnatifid leaves and numerous yellow flowerheads borne in flat-topped corymbs. The blooming season starts in June and lasts till September. The weed prefers waysides, railway embankments, pastures, and wastelands. While considered an indigenous herb of Europe and Western Asia, it is also widely found in North and South Americas, South Africa, India, Siberia, New Zealand, and Australia, where it poses a serious threat for agriculture and local ecosystems in the absence of natural insects and pathogen species. Although the plant was utilized in Early Modern Europe as a medicine for various purposes, it contains numerous harmful ingredients. Sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) are responsible for allergic dermatitis and phototoxic properties of the sap, while pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) pose a serious threat to livestock after ingestion. Jacobaea vulgaris has been regarded as a noxious weed since the 19th century. In the present day, its eradication from pastures is regulated by law in many countries. Nevertheless, migrant workers might not be conscious that this weed is dangerous. In the summer of 2012, a young migrant male farm worker was seen in the University Dermatology Out-Patient Clinic in Poznan due to acute blistering Jacobaea vulgaris-induced dermatitis clinically resembling dermatitis herpetiformis (cutaneous manifestation of gluten intolerance). The biological/chemical/mechanical control of the plant in farmlands, as well as education at an early age about poisonous and injurious herbs, is advisable for preventing potentially serious health hazards, particularly to urban dwellers accidentally exposed to those plants at their urban stands.","['Pietkiewicz P', 'Gornowicz-Porowska J', 'Bowszyc-Dmochowska M', 'Dmochowski M']",2015,20,2,J Agromedicine,"Pietkiewicz P, et al.

Tm is an ancient wheat suitable for production of palatable baked goods that contains gluten devoid of strongly immunostimulatory epitopes and potentially safe for celiac disease (CD) patients as suggested by in vitro and ex vivo studies.
METHODS: Protocol involved 60-day administration of 100 g/day Tm water biscuits to CD patients in remission on gluten-free diet. Symptoms Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire (GSRS) and CD-related serology were assessed at time (T) 0, T30 and T60 days, and duodenal biopsy was obtained at T0 and T60.
RESULTS: Eight patients (F/M: 6/2, median age 26) were enrolled. One patient was excluded at T0 because of positive serology, and two patients dropped out because of symptoms recurrence. In the five patients completing the study, there was no difference in GSRS score at T0 to T60. All patients had Marsh II lesion at T0, four had Marsh III and one had recurrence of dermatitis herpetiformis at T60. CD-related antibodies converted from negative to positive at T60 in three patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that Tm is toxic for CD patients as judged on histological and serological criteria, but it was well tolerated by the majority of patients, suggesting that Tm is not a safe cereal for celiacs, but that it may be of value for patients with gluten sensitivity or for prevention of CD.","['Zanini B', 'Villanacci V', 'De Leo L', 'Lanzini A']",2015,54,6,Eur J Nutr,"Zanini B, et al.

25705622,"Beyond the Intestinal Celiac Mucosa: Diagnostic Role of Anti-TG2 Deposits, a Systematic Review.","AIM: To review the existing literature on the role and significance of intestinal transglutaminase 2 immunoglobulin A deposits (TG2 deposits) in patients with overt celiac disease (CD), potential celiac disease (PCD), and other autoimmune or gluten-related conditions.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies published in English, evaluating presence and characteristics of TG2 deposits in subjects with overt CD, PCD, gluten-related diseases [dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), gluten-ataxia (GA)], autoimmune disorders (type-1 diabetes), and other conditions. Studies were identified through a MEDLINE search (1950-2013).
RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included in the review. Eleven studies were performed in children. Overall TG2 deposits were present in 100% of adults with overt CD, while in children prevalence ranged from 73.2 to 100%. Six studies with an established definition of PCD were considered, prevalence of deposits ranging from 64.7 to 100%. A single study followed-up PCD patients with repeated biopsies and identified presence of intestinal deposits as the best marker to reveal progression toward villous atrophy. Two studies investigated presence of deposits in DH, reporting prevalence between 63 and 79%. A single study documented TG2 deposits in 100% of patients with GA. In children with type-1 diabetes (T1D), positivity of intestinal TG2 deposits ranged from 25 to 78%.
CONCLUSION: Transglutaminase 2 IgA deposits seem to be a constant feature in overt CD patients and are frequently detectable in other gluten-related conditions (DH and GA). The vast majority of PCD patients express TG2 deposits at the intestinal level, but no sufficient data are available to exactly define their prognostic role as a marker of evolution toward overt CD. The frequent finding of TG2 deposits in the intestinal mucosa of patients with T1D is an interesting observation deserving further evaluation.","['Gatti S', 'Rossi M', 'Alfonsi S', 'Mandolesi A', 'Cobellis G', 'Catassi C']",2014,1,,Front Med (Lausanne),"Gatti S, et al.

25660831,Zinc is the modulator of the calcium-dependent activation of post-translationally acting thiol-enzymes in autoimmune diseases.,"UNLABELLED: Post-translational modifications of proteins can generate antigenic conformations that may cause autoimmune diseases in persons with specific HLA-haplotypes. Monocytes and macrophages, attracted to an inflamed site, can release post-translationally acting enzymes, such as transglutaminases and peptidylarginine deiminases. In vivo, the activation of these enzymes is crucial for the further course of event. Our hypothesis is that zinc modulates the activation of these calcium-dependent thiol-enzymes. Persons with celiac disease carry antibodies against deamidated dietary gluten and against transglutaminase type 2. Similarly, antibodies against citrulline-containing peptides and against peptidylarginine deiminase are detected in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, in two major autoimmune diseases, antibodies are detected against post-translationally modified proteins and against the thiol-enzymes responsible for catalyzing the modifications. In vitro, physiological concentrations of zinc reversibly inhibit the calcium-dependent activation of transglutaminases. Zinc attenuates the calcium-induced increase in affinity between transglutaminase 2 and serum from patients with celiac disease. Peptidylarginine deiminases are also inhibited by zinc. Moreover, zinc is rapidly redistributed in animals when an infection is induced. This pathway starting with an unspecific inflammation and ending up with an immune reaction against a specific tissue constitutes a theme with variations in other autoimmune diseases, such as dermatitis herpetiformis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. Inhibitors against transglutaminases and peptidylarginine deiminases have a great pharmacological potential. Interestingly, a large portion of the population may have been exposed to such an inhibitor. The primary metabolite of ethanol, acetaldehyde, can probably function as an irreversible inhibitor of these enzymes by forming a hemithioacetal with the thiol group of the active site. Not surprisingly, epidemiological studies have shown that alcohol is beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. We predict that a similar situation will be observed in multiple sclerosis. The affinity of chelators such as EDTA and EGTA for Zn(2+) is three orders of magnitude greater than that for Ca(2+). This frequently overlooked complication imposes problems in biomedical research since a restoration of the zinc level can never be achieved in a blood sample which has been anti-coagulated by calcium chelators. The new synthetic direct thrombin inhibitors may offer a better way of preventing coagulation in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-translational modifications are of potential interest in autoimmune diseases. The in vivo activation of calcium-dependent thiol-enzymes catalyzing these alterations, such as the transglutaminases and the peptidylarginine deiminases, is crucial for this pathway. According to our hypothesis, zinc is the modulator of this key function.","['Stenberg P', 'Roth B']",2015,84,4,Med Hypotheses,Stenberg P and Roth B.

25639558,Celiac disease evolving into dermatitis herpetiformis in patients adhering to normal or gluten-free diet.,"OBJECTIVE: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous form of celiac disease affecting ∼ 17% of celiac disease patients. The aim was to determine how often celiac disease precedes the development of DH, and what is the impact of gluten-free diet (GFD) in this phenotype change.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our prospectively collected DH series from 1970 comprised 514 patients. We analyzed all DH patients who at least 2 years earlier had been diagnosed with celiac disease. DH diagnosis was confirmed by showing immunoglobulin A deposits in dermis. Serological and small bowel mucosal findings were analyzed, and the strictness of GFD treatment before and after the diagnosis of DH was evaluated.
RESULTS: Twenty (4%) DH patients had a prior diagnosis of celiac disease. The median time interval between celiac disease and DH detection was 9.5 years. Before DH appeared 4 patients had been on a normal gluten-containing diet, 10 had dietary lapses on a GFD, and 6 were on a strict GFD. Celiac autoantibodies were positive in 7 out of 19 patients, and 5 out of 7 undergoing small bowel biopsy had partial villous atrophy. Following DH diagnosis the rash was controlled after a median of 6 months on a strict GFD.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with celiac disease may develop DH by time. This is most often an indicator of poor adherence to GFD, and a rigorous dietary intervention is necessary. In the majority of cases, DH will be detected without prior celiac disease diagnosis, but the physicians should recognize this phenotype alteration.","['Salmi TT', 'Hervonen K', 'Kurppa K', 'Collin P', 'Kaukinen K', 'Reunala T']",2015,50,4,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Salmi TT, et al.

25600350,Pemphigus herpetiformis: a case series and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Pemphigus herpetiformis (PH) is a rare subtype of pemphigus that presents challenges in diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of PH.
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all patients diagnosed and treated for PH in an immunobullous referral center between September 2007 and June 2013.
RESULTS: Eight patients were identified with a diagnosis of PH. All presented initially with pruritus. Clinical disease was manifest as either urticated erythematous plaques or a vesiculobullous eruption. Histological evaluation demonstrated eosinophilic spongiosis in all patients with acantholysis in half of cases (n = 4/8). Peripheral eosinophilia was noted in three of eight (37.5%) patients. In all cases, direct immunofluorescence showed intercellular deposition of immunoglobulin G in the epidermis. All patients required high-dose corticosteroid initially. All patients treated with dapsone or sulfasalazine (n = 4) achieved at least partial control. Other effective treatments included intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 2), azathioprine (n = 2), and leflunomide (n = 1). Rituximab was ineffective in two patients.
CONCLUSION: The clinical and histological features of PH develop over time and with treatment, making distinction between pemphigus subtypes challenging and delay in diagnosis common. Diagnosis of PH requires a high index of suspicion and is made on clinical grounds (urticated erythema) in the context of compatible histology and immunofluorescence findings. Treatment may be challenging, although efficacy of sulfonamide derivatives appears to offer a therapeutic effect.","['Laws PM', 'Heelan K', 'Al-Mohammedi F', 'Walsh S', 'Shear NH']",2015,54,9,Int J Dermatol,"Laws PM, et al.

27057091,Tissue Factor in Dermatitis Herpetiformis and Bullous Pemphigoid: Link between Immune and Coagulation System in Subepidermal Autoimmune Bullous Diseases.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) are skin diseases associated with eosinophilic and neutrophilic infiltrations. Although chemokines are critical for the selective accumulation and activation of various leukocyte subsets in the inflammatory process, there are few findings concerning inflammatory cells and production of coagulation factors in blistering diseases. Skin biopsies were taken from 14 patients with DH, 27 with BP, and 20 control subjects. The localization and expression of tissue factor (TF) in skin lesions and perilesional skin were studied by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by Western Blot. Moreover the plasma concentrations of TF were measured by immunoassays. D dimers, fibrinogen, and selected coagulation parameters were measured by routine methods. Expression of TF in the epidermis and in inflammatory influxed cells in dermis was detected in skin biopsies from BP patients. Examined TF expression was detected in perilesional skin of all BP patients too. The expression of TF was not observed in biopsies from healthy people and DH patients. The findings of the study show an increased expression of tissue factor in the lesional and perilesional skin of patients with bullous pemphigoid. The difference in chemokine pattern expression and variations in the cellular infiltration in BP and DH cause variable expression of TF.","['Zebrowska A', 'Wagrowska-Danilewicz M', 'Danilewicz M', 'Wieczfinska J', 'Pniewska E', 'Zebrowski M', 'Waszczykowska E', 'Wozniacka A', 'Eusebio M', 'Pietruczuk M', 'Pawliczak R']",2015,2015,,Mediators Inflamm,"Zebrowska A, et al.

25526342,Dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune bullous disease, which represents the cutaneous manifestation of gluten sensitivity, in the setting of celiac disease. Although classical DH is characterized clinically by grouped, vesicles on an erythematous base, primary lesions often are absent owing to the intense, associated pruritus. Instead, many cases present only with erythematous erosions with numerous overlying excoriations. As in celiac disease, the core pathogenic mechanisms of DH are likely mediated by immunoglobulin A class autoantibodies against one of several transglutaminase enzymes. As the production of these autoantibodies is directly correlated with gastrointestinal exposure to gliadin, which is an alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten, a gluten-free diet represents the cornerstone of a DH management regimen. In cases refractory to dietary management alone, dapsone is the first-line agent for the treatment of DH, although many other agents have been anecdotally reported as effective.","['Yost JM', 'Hale CS', 'Meehan SA', 'McLellan BN']",2014,20,12,Dermatol Online J,"Yost JM, et al.

25465638,Regulatory T cells as well as IL-10 are reduced in the skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and celiac disease (CD) are considered as autoimmune diseases that share a defined trigger (gluten) and a common genetic background (HLA-DQ2/DQ8). However, the pathogenesis of DH is not fully understood and no data are available about the immune regulation in such a disease.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess if alterations in the pattern of the immune response and, in particular, impairments of regulatory T (Tregs) cells may contribute to the phenotypic differences between DH and CD.
METHODS: We investigated the presence of Tregs cell markers, in the skin, the duodenum and the blood of patients with DH by immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. As controls, we included patients with bullous pemphigoid, patients with CD without skin lesions, as well as healthy subjects (HS).
RESULTS: In the skin of DH patient, we found a significantly lower proportion of FOXP3(+) Tregs and IL-10(+) cells than in HS (p < 0.001 for both cell populations). In duodenal samples, no differences where found in the proportion of Tregs between patients with DH and patients with CD without skin manifestations. Finally, the frequency of CD25(bright)FOXP3(+) cells within the CD4(+) subset was significantly reduced in CD patients either with or without DH with respect to HS (p = 0.029 and p = 0.017, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that a reduction of Tregs may play a major role in the skin, leading to a defective suppressive function and thus to the development of the lesions. By contrast, no differences could be detected about Tregs between patients with DH and patients with CD in the duodenum, suggesting that the mechanisms of the intestinal damage are similar in both diseases.","['Antiga E', 'Quaglino P', 'Pierini I', 'Volpi W', 'Lami G', 'Bianchi B', 'Del Bianco E', 'Renzi D', 'Baroni G', 'Novelli M', 'Ponti R', 'Papini M', 'Di Lollo S', 'Calabrò AS', 'Fabbri P', 'Caproni M']",2015,77,1,J Dermatol Sci,"Antiga E, et al.

25433099,[Is gluten the great etiopathogenic agent of disease in the XXI century?].,"INTRODUCTION: Gluten is a glycoprotein present in some cereals. The incidence of disorders related to gluten, including the EC, is increasing, even pathologies far from an etiology or treatment with GF D.
AIMS: Review the scientific literature related to the ingestion of gluten and pathogenesis of different diseases.
METHODS: A literature search in major scientific database.
RESULTS: We obtained from the following diseases, gluten ataxia, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depressive disorders, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, dermatitis herpetiformis and epilepsy, studies in which either a determination of gliadin was refered or a treatment, with/without gluten, was applied and evaluated.
CONCLUSION: The ingestion of gluten seems to be related to disease, when there is no EC, SGNC or wheat allergy. Suspicions about the benefit of GF D as a complementary treatment is borne in semi-clinical trials and cohorts, either as a causal factor in the pathogenesis, or improvement of symptoms.","['San Mauro Martín I', 'Garicano Vilar E', 'Collado Yurrutia L', 'Ciudad Cabañas MJ']",2014,30,6,Nutr Hosp,"San Mauro Martín I, et al.

25404189,The changing clinical profile of celiac disease: a 15-year experience (1998-2012) in an Italian referral center.,"BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is a multiform, challenging condition characterized by extremely variable features. Our goal was to define clinical, serological and histopathological findings in a large cohort of celiacs diagnosed in a single referral center.
METHODS: From January 1998 to December 2012, 770 patients (599 females, median age 36 years, range 18-78 years) were diagnosed as celiacs at St. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Bologna, Italy). The clinical phenotypes were classified as: 1) classical (malabsorption syndrome); 2) non-classical (extraintestinal and/or gastrointestinal symptoms other than diarrhea); 3) subclinical. Serology, duodenal histology, comorbidities, response to gluten-free diet and complications were evaluated.
RESULTS: Disease onset was symptomatic in 610 patients (79%), while 160 celiacs showed a subclinical phenotype. In the symptomatic group the non-classical prevailed over the classical phenotype (66% vs 34%). Diarrhea was found in 27%, while other gastrointestinal manifestations were bloating (20%), aphthous stomatitis (18%), alternating bowel habit (15%), constipation (13%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (12%). Extraintestinal manifestations included osteopenia/osteoporosis (52%), anemia (34%), cryptogenic hypertransaminasemia (29%) and recurrent miscarriages (12%). Positivity for IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies was detected in 97%. Villous atrophy was found in 87%, while 13% had minor lesions consistent with potential celiac disease. A large proportion of patients showed autoimmune disorders, i.e. autoimmune thyroiditis (26.3%), dermatitis herpetiformis (4%) and diabetes mellitus type 1 (3%). Complicated celiac disease was very rare.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the clinical profile of celiac disease changed over time with an increasing rate of non-classical and subclinical phenotypes.","['Volta U', 'Caio G', 'Stanghellini V', 'De Giorgio R']",2014,14,,BMC Gastroenterol,"Volta U, et al.

25400334,Mediators of mast cells in bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) are skin diseases associated with inflammation. However, few findings exist concerning the role of mast cells in autoimmune blistering disease. Skin biopsies were taken from 27 BP and 14 DH patients, as well as 20 healthy individuals. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the localization and mast cell expression of TNFα and MMP9 in skin lesions and perilesional skin. The serum concentrations of TNFα, MMP9, chymase, tryptase, PAF, and IL-4 were measured by immunoassay. TNFα and MMP9 expression in the epidermis and in inflammatory influxed cells in the dermis was detected in skin biopsies from patients. Although these mediators were found to be expressed in the perilesional skin of all patients, the level was much lower than that in lesional skin. Increased serum PAF levels were observed in BP patients. Mast cells may play an essential role in activating inflammation, which ultimately contributes to the tissue damage observed in BP and DH. Our findings suggest that differences in the pattern of cytokine expression directly contribute to variations in cellular infiltration in DH and BP.","['Zebrowska A', 'Wagrowska-Danilewicz M', 'Danilewicz M', 'Stasikowska-Kanicka O', 'Kulczycka-Siennicka L', 'Wozniacka A', 'Waszczykowska E']",2014,2014,,Mediators Inflamm,"Zebrowska A, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the immunofluorescence findings in patients diagnosed with autoimmune blistering skin diseases.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed immunofluorescence results encompassing a 10-year period.
RESULTS: 421 patients were included and divided into 2 groups: group 1- intraepidermal blistering diseases (n=277) and 2- subepidermal blistering diseases (n=144). For group 1, positive DIF findings demonstrated: predominance of IgG intercellular staining (ICS) and C3 for pemphigus foliaceus-PF (94% and 73% respectively), pemphigus vulgaris-PV (91.5%-79.5%) and paraneoplastic pemphigus-PNP (66%-33%); ICS IgA in 100% of IgA pemphigus cases, and IgG deposits in the basement membrane zone (BMZ) along with ICS in one Hailey-Hailey patient. The IIF findings revealed mean titers of 1:2.560 for PV and 1:1.280 for PF. For paraneoplastic pemphigus, IIF was positive in 2 out of 3 cases with rat bladder substrate. In group 2, positive DIF findings included multiple deposits at basement membrane zone for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita-EBA (C3-89%,IgG-79%,IgA-47%,IgM-21%) mucous membrane pemphigoid-MMP (C3,IgG,IgA,IgM-80%) and bullous pemphigoid-BP (C3-91%,IgG-39%,IgA-11%,IgM-6%), and IgA at basement membrane zone for IgA linear disease (99%) and dermatitis herpetiformis-DH (dermal papillae in 84.6%). For lichen planus pemphigoides, there was C3 (100%) and IgG (50%) deposition at basement membrane zone. indirect immunofluorescence positive findings revealed basement membrane zone IgG deposits in 46% of BP patients, 50% for EBA, 15% for IgA linear dermatosis and 50% for LPP. Indirect immunofluorescence positive results were higher for BP and EBA with Salt-Split skin substrate.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the importance of immunofluorescence assays in diagnosing autoimmune blistering diseases, and higher sensitivity for indirect immunofluorescence when Salt-split skin technique is performed.","['Arbache ST', 'Nogueira TG', 'Delgado L', 'Miyamoto D', 'Aoki V']",2014,89,6,An Bras Dermatol,"Arbache ST, et al.

25387490,"Dermatitis herpetiformis: pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment.","Researches on DH have shown that it is not just a bullous skin disease, but a cutaneous-intestinal disorder caused by hypersensitivity to gluten. Exposure to gluten is the starting point of an inflammatory cascade capable of forming autoantibodies that are brought to the skin, where they are deposited, culminating in the formation of skin lesions. These lesions are vesico-bullous, pruritic, and localized especially on elbows, knees and buttocks, although atypical presentations can occur. Immunofluorescence of perilesional area is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, but serological tests help in cases where it is negative. Patients who follow gluten-free diets have better control of symptoms on the skin and intestine, as well as lower risks of progression to lymphoma.

It is a heterogeneous disease that is caused by autoantibodies to the dermoepidermal junction, mainly type VII collagen. Similarities in histology and immunopathology exist between BSLE and other primary bullous dermatoses, namely dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), respectively. EBA and BSLE commonly share the same autoantibody to type VII collagen and heterogeneous clinical presentations, creating a diagnostic challenge. However, clinical presentation combined with histology, immunological testing, and concomitant diagnosis of SLE distinguish this entity from other similar dermatoses. Diagnosis of this disease is important given its coexistence with SLE and its many complications. New developments in IgG subtyping have shown subtle variations in IgG subtypes between EBA and BSLE. In addition, rituximab was recently found to be efficacious in recalcitrant cases of BSLE that do not respond to dapsone and immunosuppressants. We review the topic of BSLE with emphasis on clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic features, as well as new methods of diagnosis and treatment.","['Contestable JJ', 'Edhegard KD', 'Meyerle JH']",2014,15,6,Am J Clin Dermatol,"Contestable JJ, et al.

25139307,Factors associated with long diagnostic delay in celiac disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the factors associated with long diagnostic delay in celiac disease and the impact of the national Current Care Guidelines in reducing the delay.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This population-based study involved 825 adult celiac disease patients. The diagnosis was considered delayed when the interval between first symptoms and diagnosis was >10 years. The patients were asked about the duration and type of symptoms before diagnosis, time and site (tertiary, secondary, or primary care) of the diagnosis, family history of the disease, and presence of significant comorbidities. Analysis was performed by binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: Altogether, 261 (32%) out of 825 participants reported a diagnostic delay of >10 years. Female gender, neurological or musculoskeletal disorders and presence of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption were associated with prolonged delay. Male gender, diagnosis after the introduction of the first Current Care Guidelines in 1997, and being detected by serological screening, and family history of celiac disease were associated with a lower risk of delayed diagnosis. Factors not associated with the delay were site of diagnosis, age, and presence of dermatitis herpetiformis, type 1 diabetes, or thyroidal disease.
CONCLUSION: The number of long diagnostic delays in celiac disease has decreased over the past decades. The shift of diagnostics from secondary and tertiary care to primary care has not been detrimental. National guidelines together with increased awareness and active screening in at-risk groups of celiac disease are important in these circumstances.","['Fuchs V', 'Kurppa K', 'Huhtala H', 'Collin P', 'Mäki M', 'Kaukinen K']",2014,49,11,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Fuchs V, et al.

25071256,A Cross-sectional Study of Direct Immunofluorescence in the Diagnosis of Immunobullous Dermatoses.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune blistering diseases are a group of bullous disorders characterized by pathogenic antibodies directed at the target antigens, which are components of the desmosomes or adhesion complex at the dermoepidermal junction. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is invaluable in the diagnosis of these lesions.
AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of DIF in immunobullous dermatoses and to study the pattern of DIF. The study also aims to correlate DIF with clinical and histologic findings and to analyze discrepancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 100 biopsies received over a period of 2 years in the Department of Pathology were analyzed. DIF, histopathology and clinical data were reviewed.
RESULTS: Out of 100, 89 cases showed DIF patterns concordant with clinical/histologic diagnosis. The sensitivity of DIF was 94.44% (51/58) in the pemphigus and 84% (21/25) in the bullous pemphigoid (BP) group, 100% each in dermatitis herpetiformis (2/2) and linear IgA disease (1/1). A total of 11 histologically proven cases of immunobullous lesions were DIF negative-four (three of pemphigus vulgaris and one of BP) due to having no epidermis, three (cases of BP) owing to sampling/technical errors and the remaining four (cases of pemphigus vulgaris) due to being on treatment.
CONCLUSION: Immunofluorescence helps confirm the diagnosis of bullous lesions in which there is clinical and the histopathologic overlap. Sampling errors contributed to false negative (FN) results.","['Buch AC', 'Kumar H', 'Panicker N', 'Misal S', 'Sharma Y', 'Gore CR']",2014,59,4,Indian J Dermatol,"Buch AC, et al.

A variety of diseases such as lichen planus, pemphigus, pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA disease, lupus erythematosus, erythema multiformae manifest clinically as desquamative gingivitis. Of all the disease entities, Lichen Planus is a relatively common disorder affecting the skin and mucous membrane. Very often it has oral manifestations. These lesions of oral lichen planus (OLP) have myriad but distinct morphology. As they mimic other mucocutaneous disorders with regard to clinical appearance, many lesions of oral lichen planus go undiagnosed or are wrongly diagnosed. Reported here are two cases of desquamative gingivitis. One of these was diagnosed as erosive lichen planus based on the symptoms, clinical findings, histologic, and immunofluorescent examination.

24999842,Genome-wide association study of celiac disease in North America confirms FRMD4B as new celiac locus.,"We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1550 North American celiac disease cases and 3084 controls. Twelve SNPs, distributed across four regions (3p21.31, 4q27, 6q15, 6q25), were significantly associated with disease (p-value <1.0×10-7), and a further seven SNPs, across four additional regions (1q24.3, 10p15.1, 6q22.31, 17q21.32) had suggestive evidence (1.0×10-7 < p-value < 1.0×10-6). This study replicated a previous suggestive association within FRMD4B (3p14.1), confirming it as a celiac disease locus. All four regions with significant associations and two regions with suggestive results (1q24.3, 10p15.1) were known disease loci. The 6q22.31 and 10p11.23 regions were not replicated. A total of 410 SNPs distributed across the eight significant and suggestive regions were tested for association with dermatitis herpetiformis and microscopic colitis. Preliminary, suggestive statistical evidence for association with the two traits was found at chromosomes 3p21.31, 6q15, 6q25, 1q24.3 and 10p11.23, with future studies being required to validate the reported associations.","['Garner C', 'Ahn R', 'Ding YC', 'Steele L', 'Stoven S', 'Green PH', 'Fasano A', 'Murray JA', 'Neuhausen SL']",2014,9,7,PLoS One,"Garner C, et al.

24767184,Autoimmune blistering dermatoses as systemic diseases.,"Autoimmune blistering dermatoses are examples of skin-specific autoimmune disorders that can sometimes represent the cutaneous manifestation of a multiorgan disease due to potential common pathogenic mechanisms. As soon as a distinct autoimmune blistering dermatosis is diagnosed, it is imperative to consider its potential systemic involvement, as well as the autoimmune and inflammatory conditions that are frequently associated with it. In paraneoplastic pemphigus/paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome, the internal organs (particularly the lungs) are affected by the autoimmune injury. Pemphigus erythematosus may manifest with overlapping serologic and immunohistologic features of lupus erythematosus. In patients with bullous pemphigoid, there is a greater prevalence of neurologic disease, possibly caused by cross-reactivity of the autoantibodies with isoforms of bullous pemphigoid antigens expressed in the skin and brain. Anti-laminin 332 pemphigoid shows an increased risk for adenocarcinomas. Patients with anti-p200 pemphigoid often suffer from psoriasis. A rare form of pemphigoid with antibodies against the α5 chain of type IV collagen is characterized by underlying nephropathia. Particularly interesting is the association of linear IgA disease or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita with inflammatory bowel disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis is currently regarded as the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity. Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus is part of the clinical spectrum of systemic lupus erythematosus, a prototypic autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement.","['Vassileva S', 'Drenovska K', 'Manuelyan K']",2014,32,3,Clin Dermatol,"Vassileva S, et al.

24667576,Incidence and prevalence of celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis in the UK over two decades: population-based study.,"OBJECTIVES: Few studies have quantified the incidence and prevalence of celiac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) nationally and regionally by time and age groups. Understanding this epidemiology is crucial for hypothesizing about causes and quantifying the burden of disease.
METHODS: Patients with CD or DH were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 1990 and 2011. Incidence rates and prevalence were calculated by age, sex, year, and region of residence. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) adjusted for age, sex, and region were calculated with Poisson regression.
RESULTS: A total of 9,087 incident cases of CD and 809 incident cases of DH were identified. Between 1990 and 2011, the incidence rate of CD increased from 5.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8-6.8) to 19.1 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 17.8-20.5; IRR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.7-4.8). The incidence of DH decreased over the same time period from 1.8 per 100,000 to 0.8 per 100,000 person-years (average annual IRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.97). The absolute incidence of CD per 100,000 person-years ranged from 22.3 in Northern Ireland to 10 in London. There were large regional variations in prevalence for CD but not DH.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a fourfold increase in the incidence of CD in the United Kingdom over 22 years, with large regional variations in prevalence. This contrasted with a 4% annual decrease in the incidence of DH, with minimal regional variations in prevalence. These contrasts could reflect differences in diagnosis between CD (serological diagnosis and case finding) and DH (symptomatic presentation) or the possibility that diagnosing and treating CD prevents the development of DH.","['West J', 'Fleming KM', 'Tata LJ', 'Card TR', 'Crooks CJ']",2014,109,5,Am J Gastroenterol,"West J, et al.

24643797,"Evidence for a role of autoantibodies to heat shock protein 60, 70, and 90 in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.","Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are highly conserved immunomodulatory molecules upregulated when cells are exposed to stressful stimuli, such as inflammation. Their involvement in various autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune bullous diseases and celiac disease, has been increasingly recognized. To further study the role of Hsp in autoimmune bullous diseases, we have investigated for the first time the humoral autoimmune response to Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH; n = 26), bullous pemphigoid (BP; n = 23), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV; n = 16), the first representing a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. While in patients with active BP and PV, serum levels of autoantibodies against these Hsp did not differ from the corresponding age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 9-14); circulating autoantibodies against Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 were found to be increased at the active disease stage of DH. Further analysis of this latter patient subgroup showed that these anti-Hsp autoantibodies decreased in parallel with serum autoantibodies against epidermal and tissue transglutaminase during remission of skin lesions following a gluten-free diet, revealing significantly positive correlations. Although further studies on larger groups of patients will be needed to confirm the present data, our results support the notion that autoantibodies against Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90 deserve attention in the study of the mechanisms that promote the development and maintenance of DH and possibly also the underlying celiac disease as well as potential novel disease biomarkers.","['Kasperkiewicz M', 'Tukaj S', 'Gembicki AJ', 'Silló P', 'Görög A', 'Zillikens D', 'Kárpáti S']",2014,19,6,Cell Stress Chaperones,"Kasperkiewicz M, et al.

24637913,Transverse myelitis associated with an itchy rash and hyperckemia: neuromyelitis optica associated with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"IMPORTANCE: Neuromyelitis optica is associated with severe neurodisability if not recognized and treated promptly. Several autoimmune disorders are associated with this condition and may vary in their presentation. It is essential that clinicians are aware of the uncommon presenting features of neuromyelitis optica and associated autoimmune conditions.
OBSERVATIONS: A 53-year-old woman presented with nausea and vomiting and was noted to have an asymptomatic elevated creatinine kinase level, which improved with conservative management. She had a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to long-standing celiac disease that was managed with a gluten-free diet. She then presented with recurrent transverse myelitis and a vesicobullous rash over her arms and feet that was pruritic and excoriating. Skin biopsy results confirmed a clinical diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis and antibody test findings against aquaporin-4 were positive, leading to a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. She was treated with methylprednisolone sodium succinate, plasma exchange, and azathioprine and has remained in remission.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This report highlights the association of neuromyelitis optica with dermatitis herpetiformis, which can present even without clinical features of celiac disease. Nausea, vomiting, and asymptomatic hyperCKemia should be recognized as rare presenting features of neuromyelitis optica.","['Iyer A', 'Rathnasabapathi D', 'Elsone L', 'Mutch K', 'Terlizzo M', 'Footitt D', 'Jacob A']",2014,71,5,JAMA Neurol,"Iyer A, et al.

24609069,Body mass index and risk of autoimmune diseases: a study within the Danish National Birth Cohort.,"BACKGROUND: A possible aetiological link between obesity and certain autoimmune diseases (ADs) has been suggested. We investigated the associations between body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and 43 ADs.
METHODS: 75,008 women participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort were followed during a median time of 11 years. Diagnoses on ADs were retrieved from the Danish National Patient Register. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated adjusting for potential confounders (smoking, alcohol, parity and socio-occupational status).
RESULTS: During follow-up, 2430 women (3.2%) developed a total of 2607 new-onset ADs. Risk of any autoimmune disease was increased in obese women (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.46) compared with normal weight women (18.5-≤25 kg/m2). Obese women (BMI≥30 kg/m2) were at increased risk of sarcoidosis (HR 3.59; 95% CI, 2.31 to 5.57) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (HR 2.67; 95% CI, 1.71 to 4.17). Risk of dermatitis herpetiformis increased by 14% (95% CI, 1% to 30%) per BMI unit. Conversely, risk of celiac disease and Raynaud's phenomenon decreased by 7% (95% CI, 1% to 13%) and 12% (95% CI, 4% to 19%) per BMI unit, respectively. Further associations between BMI and risk of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease were suggested.
CONCLUSIONS: BMI was found to be associated with several Ads. This was most pronounced between obesity and risk of sarcoidosis and and risk of type 1 diabetes mellitus. These novel findings need confirmation and the possible role of adipose tissue-derived immunological changes in the development of autoimmune reactions needs consideration.","['Harpsøe MC', 'Basit S', 'Andersson M', 'Nielsen NM', 'Frisch M', 'Wohlfahrt J', 'Nohr EA', 'Linneberg A', 'Jess T']",2014,43,3,Int J Epidemiol,"Harpsøe MC, et al.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 68 patients to evaluate the clinical, histopathological and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) features in the diagnosis of cutaneous vesiculobullous disorders. The patients with vesiculobullous lesions were subjected to clinical examination regarding socio-demographic and clinical data. Two biopsy specimens were taken, one from intact vesicle for histopathological study and another from perilesional normal looking skin or oral mucosa for DIF.
RESULTS: Vesiculobullous lesions constituted 22.08% of total number of skin biopsies. The most common clinical diagnosis was pemphigus vulgaris (PV) in 36 cases, followed by bullous pemphigoid (BP) in 8 cases, pemphigus foliaceous (PF) in 6 cases, and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) in 4 cases. Characteristic histopathological features were present in 26 cases of PV, 9 cases of BP and 4 cases of PF, and 17.7% showed non- specific changes. DIF was positive in 24 cases of PV, 9 cases of BP and 3 cases of PF, and negative in 34.92% of cases.

24512514,A review of the current literature and a guide to the early diagnosis of autoimmune disorders associated with neuromyelitis optica.,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an immune-mediated neurological disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. A serum biomarker, aquaporin-4 IgG, the autoantibody against aquaporin-4 water channel, has been specifically associated with NMO and has assisted early recognition and prediction of relapses. Less commonly, a monophasic course, associated with antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein has been reported. Specific diagnostic criteria have been defined; however, some cases that do not fulfil these criteria (but are nevertheless associated with aquaporin-4 IgG) are classified as NMO spectrum disorder and follow the same relapsing course. An ever-growing list of autoimmune disorders, both organ-specific and non-organ-specific, have been associated in up to 20-30% of patients with NMO. These disorders, which may become symptomatic before or after the development of NMO, are often diagnosed long after the diagnosis of NMO, as symptoms may be wrongly attributed to NMO, its residual effects or medication side effects. In addition, autoantibodies can be found in patients with NMO without coexisting disease (up to 40% in some series) and maybe suggestive of a heightened humoral immune response. We present a comprehensive review of the current literature on autoimmune disorders co-existing with NMO and identified 22 autoimmune conditions (myasthenia gravis, coeliac disease, ulcerative colitis, sclerosing cholangitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune hypothyroidism, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pernicious anaemia, narcolepsy, pemphigus foliaceus, alopecia areata, psoriasis, scleroderma, dermatitis herpetiformis, polymyositis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, paraneoplastic disorders, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and autoimmune encephalitis).","['Iyer A', 'Elsone L', 'Appleton R', 'Jacob A']",2014,47,3,Autoimmunity,"Iyer A, et al.

24444577,Celiac disease: diagnosis and management.,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. It is triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a storage protein in wheat, rye, and barley, which are staples in many American diets. Celiac disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa, which leads to atrophy of the small intestinal villi and subsequent malabsorption. The condition may develop at any age. Intestinal manifestations include diarrhea and weight loss. Common extraintestinal manifestations include iron deficiency anemia, decreased bone mineral density, and neuropathy. Most cases of celiac disease are diagnosed in persons with extraintestinal manifestations. The presence of dermatitis herpetiformis is pathognomonic for celiac disease. Diagnosis is supported by a positive tissue transglutaminase serologic test but, in general, should be confirmed by a small bowel biopsy showing the characteristic histology associated with celiac disease. The presence of human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2, DQ8, or both is essential for the development of celiac disease, and can be a useful genetic test in select instances. Treatment of celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Dietary education should focus on identifying hidden sources of gluten, planning balanced meals, reading labels, food shopping, dining out, and dining during travel. About 5% of patients with celiac disease are refractory to a gluten-free diet. These patients should be referred to a gastroenterologist for reconsideration of the diagnosis or for aggressive treatment of refractory celiac disease, which may involve corticosteroids and immunomodulators.","['Pelkowski TD', 'Viera AJ']",2014,89,2,Am Fam Physician,Pelkowski TD and Viera AJ.

This enteropathy may appear at any age and is characterized by a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms that go well beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In young children, gastrointestinal presentations are common and include chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, and abdominal distention; however, extraintestinal manifestations are becoming increasingly more common. They include numerous conditions such as dermatitis herpetiformis, anemia, dental enamel hypoplasia, recurrent oral aphthae, short stature, osteoporosis, arthritis, neurologic problems, unexplained elevation of transaminase levels, and female infertility. Therefore, diagnosing celiac disease requires a high degree of suspicion, followed by correct screening and a confirmatory test with an intestinal biopsy. After diagnosis, a strict gluten-free diet must be followed, which in most cases will bring a marked improvement of symptoms. However, there are important compliance and quality-of-life problems, especially in adolescents.","['Guandalini S', 'Assiri A']",2014,168,3,JAMA Pediatr,Guandalini S and Assiri A.

26155144,"Cutaneous expressions of interleukin-6 and neutrophil elastase as well as levels of serum IgA antibodies to gliadin nonapeptides, tissue transglutaminase and epidermal transglutaminase: implications for both autoimmunity and autoinflammation involvement in dermatitis herpetiformis.","INTRODUCTION: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) seems to be a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of partially known origin. In light of its known biological functions and its involvement in tissue pathology in other disease states, particularly in nickel-induced allergic contact dermatitis coexisting with DH, it would appear that the central and peripheral response by neutrophils and their mediators (e.g. neutrophil elastase - NE) in DH may be partially mediated by interleukin-6 (IL-6). The aim of the study was to assess the role of IL -6 in DH lesions by examining the relationships between IL -6/NE cutaneous expression and levels of serum anti-nonapeptides of gliadin (npG) IgA, anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin A (IgA), anti-epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) IgA in DH.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 24 DH patients having IgA cutaneous deposition were studied. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections with quantitative digital morphometry was used to measure the intensity of IL -6 and NE cutaneous expressions. Levels of serum anti-npG IgA, anti-tTG IgA and anti-eTG IgA were evaluated with ELISA.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant correlation between the NE and IL -6 expression intensities. Our results revealed also a lack of correlations between NE/IL -6 expressions and levels of anti-npG IgA, anti-tTG IgA, anti-eTG IgA in DH. However, the IL -6 expression level was significantly lower than that of NE.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of correlations suggested no substantial interactions between IL -6, NE, IgA/npG, IgA/tTG or IgA/eTG in DH. Presented results might indicate the heterogenetic nature of DH pathogenesis suggesting further that both autoimmune and autoinflammatory phenomena may be involved in DH cutaneous pathology.","['Gornowicz-Porowska J', 'Bowszyc-Dmochowska M', 'Seraszek-Jaros A', 'Kaczmarek E', 'Pietkiewicz P', 'Dmochowski M']",2014,39,3,Cent Eur J Immunol,"Gornowicz-Porowska J, et al.

26120517,Modern diagnosis of celiac disease and relevant differential diagnoses in the case of cereal intolerance.,"At an incidence of 1:500, celiac disease (formerly sprue) is an important differential diagnosis in patients with malabsorption, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and food intolerances. Celiac disease can induce a broad spectrum of both gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease). A variety of oligo- and asymptomatic courses (e.g. anemia, osteoporosis, depression) through to refractory collagenic celiac disease are seen. In HLA-DQ2 and -8 predisposed individuals, celiac disease is provoked by contact with wheat gliadin fractions through a predominantly Th1 immune response and an accompanying Th2 response, which can eventually lead to villous atrophy. Using appropriate serological tests (IgA antibodies against tissue-transglutaminase, endomysium and deamidated gliadin peptides) under sufficient gluten ingestion, the diagnosis can be made more reliably today than previously. The same IgG-based serological tests should be used in the case of IgA deficiency. Diagnosis can either be made in children and adolescents with anti-transglutaminase titers exceeding ten times the standard for two of the above-mentioned serological markers and HLA conformity or it is made by endoscopy and histological Marsh classification in adults and in cases of inconclusive serology. If clinically tolerated, gluten challenges are indicated in patients that already have reduced gluten intake, in borderline serological results, discordance between serological and histological results or in suspected food allergy. The diagnosis of celiac disease needs to be definitive and robust before establishing a gluten-free diet, since lifelong abstention from gluten (gliadin < 20 mg/kg foodstuffs), cereal products (wheat, rye, barley and spelt) as well as from preparations and beverages containing gluten, is necessary. With effective elimination of gluten, the prognosis regarding complete resolution of small bowel inflammation is good. Refractory courses are seen only in rare cases, accompanied by enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma.","['Hahn M', 'Hagel AF', 'Hirschmann S', 'Bechthold C', 'Konturek P', 'Neurath M', 'Raithel M']",2014,23,2,Allergo J Int,"Hahn M, et al.

24355936,The diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease.,"BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an inflammatory disease of, the small intestine with a prevalence of roughly 0.5%-1%. Its symptoms arise in response to gluten consumption by genetically predisposed persons (HLA-DQ2/8). The autoantigen tissue transglutaminase (TG2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease.
METHOD: Selective review of pertinent literature, including guidelines from Germany and abroad.
RESULTS: Celiac disease can present at any age with gastrointestinal or extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., malabsorption or Duhring's dermatitis herpetiformis); it can also be found in association with other (auto-)immune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. Most cases are oligosymptomatic. The wide differential diagnosis includes food intolerances, intestinal infections, and irritable bowel syndrome, among other conditions. The definitive diagnosis requires the demonstration of celiac disease-specific autoantibody to TG2 (endomysium), which is over 90% sensitive and far over 90% specific, and the characteristic histologic lesions of the small-bowel mucosa and remission on a gluten-free diet.
CONCLUSION: An understanding of celiac disease ought to inform everyday clinical practice in all medical disciplines, because this is a common condition with diverse manifestations that can be effectively diagnosed and easily treated for the prevention of both acute and long-term complications. Patients should follow a strictly gluten-free diet for life.","['Schuppan D', 'Zimmer KP']",2013,110,49,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Schuppan D and Zimmer KP. The diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease.

Seventy-nine percent of untreated and 41% of the treated DH patients had TG2-specific IgA deposits in the small bowel, and the presence of the deposits showed a significant association with the degree of small bowel villous atrophy (p < 0.001). Other coeliac-disease related inflammatory markers were also investigated, and the density of small bowel mucosal intraepithelial γδ(+) T cells was increased in 91% of untreated and 73% of treated DH patients.

AIM: In autoimmune skin blistering diseases, autoantibodies seem to trigger several intracellular signaling pathways and we investigated the presence of the phosphorylated form of ribosomal protein S6-pS240 within autoimmune skin blistering diseases biopsies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized immunohistochemistry to evaluate the presence of S6-pS240 in lesional skin biopsies of patients affected by autoimmune skin blistering diseases including patients with an endemic and nonendemic pemphigus foliaceus (non EPF), with bullous pemphigoid (BP), pemphigus vulgaris (PV), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and the respective controls.
RESULTS: Most autoimmune bullous skin diseases biopsies stained positive for S6-pS240 around lesional blisters, including adjacent areas of the epidermis; and within upper dermal inflammatory infiltrates, and/or mesenchymal-endothelial cell junctions within the dermis.
CONCLUSIONS: We document that S6-pS240 is expressed in lesional areas of skin biopsies from patients with autoimmune skin blistering diseases, as well as on eccrine glands and piloerector muscles.

There are few data comparing those with DH who present only with DH and those with DH who present mainly due to CD.
OBJECTIVE: We compared the prevalence of features usually associated with CD in those who presented with DH with patients in whom DH was part of a typical CD presentation.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of a prospectively maintained database of 1,050 patients with CD was analyzed. Only biopsy-diagnosed patients were analyzed for small bowel findings. All patients were included in the analysis of autoimmune diseases and lymphoma incidence. Small bowel biopsies were classified into mild and severe.
RESULTS: The prevalence of villous atrophy was significantly higher in the patients who presented with CD than in those who presented with DH alone (61.8 vs. 12.5%; p = 0.005). However, the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and lymphoma occurred at a similar rate in patients with DH and patients with CD without DH.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who present with CD and concurrent DH are more likely to have more severe pathology than those with predominantly DH, although nutritional deficiencies are similar between the two groups. It is important to screen for nutritional deficiencies in patients with DH, irrespective of the presence of typical CD manifestations.","['Krishnareddy S', 'Lewis SK', 'Green PH']",2014,15,1,Am J Clin Dermatol,"Krishnareddy S, et al.

It has been shown that a pattern of xenobiotic metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
AIM: To estimate whether the CYP2D6 genotype may be considered a predisposing factor in autoimmune bullous diseases induction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 72 patients with autoimmune bullous diseases: 37 with pemphigoid, 21 with pemphigus, and 14 with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). The CYP2D6 genotypes were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
RESULTS: Relative risk of DH development for particular genotype carriers expressed by odds ratio (OR) was statistically significantly higher for subjects with CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*4 (OR = 4.2; p = 0.0104) and 2-fold higher for subjects with CYP2D6*4 (OR = 2.3; p = 0.0351).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that the CYP2D6 oxidation polymorphism cannot be considered a risk factor for development of pemphigoid and pemphigus, however it might have an impact on dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Rychlik-Sych M', 'Baranska M', 'Waszczykowska E', 'Torzecka JD', 'Zebrowska A', 'Skretkowicz J']",2013,30,4,Postepy Dermatol Alergol,"Rychlik-Sych M, et al.

Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 groups: high-risk (based on presence of anemia, chronic diarrhea, unintentional weight loss, or dermatitis herpetiformis), low-risk (based on such factors as dyspepsia, abnormal liver function, ataxia, or chronic cough), nutrient deficiency (based on levels of iron, vitamins B12 and D, or folate), or screening (because they had type 1 diabetes or a family history of celiac disease). Patients with celiac disease were identified using the modified Marsh criteria (grades 1-3) for interpreting duodenal histology. We compared clinical category, serology profiles, and biopsy results between patients with and without celiac disease.
RESULTS: Celiac disease was diagnosed in 64 of 565 patients in the high-risk group (11%), 14 of 156 patients in the low-risk group (9%; P = .47 compared with high-risk group), 7 of 28 patients in the nutrient-deficiency group, and 3 of 3 patients in the screening group. Among 71 patients who tested positive for both antibodies (tTG and endomyseal antibodies), the positive predictive value for celiac disease was 97%; a negative test result for tTG had a negative predictive value of 98%. Among 708 patients with normal-looking biopsy samples, only 62 had celiac disease (9%). Among 44 patients with abnormal biopsy samples, 26 had celiac disease (59%).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a retrospective analysis, patients with and without celiac disease cannot be distinguished based on clinical features. Patients who present with symptoms of celiac disease should be tested for tTG, to identify candidates for duodenal biopsy analysis.","['Srinivas M', 'Basumani P', 'Podmore G', 'Shrimpton A', 'Bardhan KD']",2014,12,6,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Srinivas M, et al.

Thus, a wide differential must be considered before a definitive diagnosis of CD is made to ensure the patient receives appropriate treatment and follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: To describe conditions that can present similarly to contact dermatitis.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients referred to the Occupational Disease Specialized Program at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto between 2009 and 2011 for CD investigations but with a final diagnosis other than CD.
RESULTS: We report cases of 2 feet-1 hand syndrome, Dermatitis Herpetiformis, Sézary syndrome and two cases of Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris misdiagnosed as CD and referred for patch testing at our busy tertiary care centre. Failing to recognize these mimickers of CD resulted in a significant delay in diagnosis for the patients and resulting initiation of necessary intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to consider numerous mimickers before making a diagnosis of CD to ensure optimal outcome for patients.","['Velykoredko Y', 'Houle MC', 'Skotnicki S']",2013,17,6,J Cutan Med Surg,"Velykoredko Y, et al.

24068131,Review: dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) or Duhring-Brocq disease is a chronic bullous disease characterized by intense itching and burning sensation in the erythematous papules and urticarial plaques, grouped vesicles with centrifuge growth, and tense blisters. There is an association with the genotypes HLA DR3, HLA DQw2, found in 80-90% of cases. It is an IgA-mediated cutaneous disease, with immunoglobulin A deposits appearing in a granular pattern at the top of the dermal papilla in the sublamina densa area of the basement membrane, which is present both in affected skin and healthy skin. The same protein IgA1 with J chain is found in the small intestinal mucosa in patients with adult celiac disease, suggesting a strong association with DH. Specific antibodies such as antiendomysium, antireticulina, antigliadin and, recently identified, the epidermal and tissue transglutaminase subtypes, as well as increased zonulin production, are common to both conditions, along with gluten-sensitive enteropathy and DH. Autoimmune diseases present higher levels of prevalence, such as thyroid (5-11%), pernicious anemia (1-3%), type 1 diabetes (1-2%) and collagen tissue disease. The chosen treatment is dapsone and a gluten-free diet.","['Mendes FB', 'Hissa-Elian A', 'Abreu MA', 'Gonçalves VS']",2013,88,4,An Bras Dermatol,"Mendes FB, et al. Review: dermatitis herpetiformis.

24057059,Spectrum of autoantibodies for gastrointestinal autoimmune diseases in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.,"BACKGROUND: Organ-specific autoimmune diseases may appear in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Gastrointestinal symptoms are well documented in SLE and may be similar to those related to autoimmune gastrointestinal diseases.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to search for gastrointestinal organ-specific autoantibodies in 194 patients with systemic lupus and 103 healthy controls from Southern Brazil. Methods Anti-endomysium antibodies (IgA-EmA), anti-gastric parietal cells (GPC) antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA), anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and anti-LKM-1 (liver-kidney microsomal) were searched for using indirect immunofluorescence in the sera of patients and controls.
RESULTS: The total positivity of antibodies in SLE patients was 14.4% (28/194) and differed significantly from healthy individuals (0.97%; p<0.001). IgA-EmA was more common in lupus patients than in controls (11/194; p=0.009), and one of these patients had dermatitis herpetiformis. Clinical association revealed that IgA-EmA was more common in SLE patients with discoid lesions. The frequency of anti-GPC (p=0.10), ASMA (p=0.16) and AMA (p=0.55) did not differ significantly between groups. No patient presented LKM-1 autoantibodies. One patient presenting anti-GPC was diagnosed with atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia.
CONCLUSION: Only IgA-EmA was significantly associated with lupus and with the presence of discoid lesions. Until now, no obvious association with celiac disease has been found.","['Picceli VF', 'Skare TL', 'Nisihara R', 'Kotze L', 'Messias-Reason I', 'Utiyama SR']",2013,22,11,Lupus,"Picceli VF, et al.

23970818,IL-17 expression in dermatitis herpetiformis and bullous pemphigoid.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) are skin diseases associated with eosinophilic and neutrophilic infiltrations. Although cytokines are critical for the inflammatory process, there are single findings concerning concentration of IL-17 in bullous diseases. The goal of this study was to assess IL-17 expression in DH and BP patients. Skin biopsies were taken from 10 DH, 14 BP patients and from 10 healthy subjects. The localization and expression of IL-17 was studied by immunohistochemistry and the serum concentration was measured by immunoassays. Expression of IL-17 in the epidermis and in influxed cells in dermis was detected in skin biopsies. Expression of IL-17 was statistically higher in epidermis and infiltration cells in specimens from BP than from DH patients. Examined interleukin expression was detected in perilesional skin of all patients but it was much lower than in lesional skin. The expression of IL-17 was not observed in biopsies from healthy people. Serum level of IL-17 was statistically higher in BP and DH groups as compared to control group. Our results provide the evidence that IL-17 may play an essential role in activating and recruiting eosinophils and neutrophils, which ultimately contribute to the tissue damage in DH and BP.","['Zebrowska A', 'Wagrowska-Danilewicz M', 'Danilewicz M', 'Stasikowska-Kanicka O', 'Cynkier A', 'Sysa-Jedrzejowska A', 'Waszczykowska E']",2013,2013,,Mediators Inflamm,"Zebrowska A, et al.

23936873,Clinical features and symptom recovery on a gluten-free diet in Canadian adults with celiac disease.,"BACKGROUND: Celiac disease can present with mild or nongastrointestinal symptoms, and may escape timely recognition. The treatment of celiac disease involves a gluten-free diet, which is complex and challenging.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical features and symptom recovery on a gluten-free diet in a Canadian adult celiac population.
METHODS: All adult members (n=10,693) of the two national celiac support organizations, the Canadian Celiac Association and Fondation québécoise de la maladie coeliaque, were surveyed using a questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 5912 individuals (≥18 years of age) with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease and⁄or dermatitis herpetiformis completed the survey. The female to male ratio was 3:1, and mean (± SD) age at diagnosis was 45.2 ± 16.4 years. Mean time to diagnosis after onset of symptoms was 12.0 ± 14.4 years. Abdominal pain and bloating (84.9%), extreme weakness⁄tiredness (74.2%), diarrhea (71.7%) and anemia (67.8%) were the most commonly reported symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Many respondents continued to experience symptoms after being on a gluten-free diet for >5 years. Sex differences were reported in clinical features before diagnosis, recovery after being on gluten-free diet and perceived quality of life, with women experiencing more difficulties than men.
CONCLUSIONS: Delays in diagnosis of celiac disease in Canada remain unacceptably long despite wider availability of serological screening tests. Many patients report continuing symptoms despite adhering to a gluten-free diet for >5 years, with women experiencing more symptoms and a lower recovery rate than men. Awareness of celiac disease needs improvement, and follow-up with a physician and a dietitian is essential for all patients with celiac disease.","['Pulido O', 'Zarkadas M', 'Dubois S', 'Macisaac K', 'Cantin I', 'La Vieille S', 'Godefroy S', 'Rashid M']",2013,27,8,Can J Gastroenterol,"Pulido O, et al.

23859446,Does dermatitis herpetiformis result in bone loss as coeliac disease does? A cross sectional study.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: coeliac disease (CD) and its cutaneous manifestation, dermatitis herpetiformis are both (DH) gluten-sensitive diseases. Metabolic bone disease is common among patients with CD, even in asymptomatic forms. Data are scarce about bone density in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. The aim of our study was to compare bone mineral density (BMD) of celiac and dermatitis herpetiformis patients.
METHODS: 34 coeliac patients, 53 with dermatitis herpetiformis and 42 healthy controls were studied. The mean age was 38.0 +/- 12.1, 32.18 +/- 14.95, 35.33 +/- 10.41 years in CD, dermatitis herpetiformis, and healthy controls, respectively. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, the left femoral neck and radius were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Low bone density, osteopenia and osteoporosis were defined as a body mass density (BMD) T-score between 0 and -1, between -1 and -2.5, and under -2.5, respectively.
RESULTS: at lumbar region, consisting of dominantly trabecular compartment, a decreased BMD was detected in 49 % (n = 26) patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, 62 % (n = 21) of CD patients, and 29 % (n = 12) of healthy controls, respectively. Lower BMD were measured at the lumbar region in dermatitis herpetiformis and CD compared to healthy subjects (0.993 +/- 0.136 g/cm2 and 0.880 +/- 0.155 g/cm2 vs. 1.056 +/- 0.126 g/cm2; p < 0.01). Density of bones consisting of dominantly cortical compartment (femoral neck) did not differ in dermatitis herpetiformis and healthy subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: our results show that a low bone mass is also frequent among patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Bone mineral content in these patients is significantly lower in those parts of the skeleton which contain more trabecular than cortical bone.","['Lorinczy K', 'Juhász M', 'Csontos Á', 'Fekete B', 'Terjék O', 'Lakatos PL', 'Miheller P', 'Kocsis D', 'Kárpáti S', 'Tulassay Z', 'Zágoni T']",2013,105,4,Rev Esp Enferm Dig,"Lorinczy K, et al.

The spectrum of gluten-related disorders in the early 1980s was simple: CD and dermatitis herpetiformis. In the last few years, wheat allergy, gluten ataxia and noncoeliac gluten sensitivity have become new gluten-related topics. Adherence to GFDs in CD is limited and factors influencing adherence are poorly understood. Noncoeliac gluten sensitivity has stimulated the GFD food industry not only in Australia but all over the world.

23772962,Infection in autoimmune bullous diseases: a retrospective comparative study.,"Certain autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBD), including pemphigoid and pemphigus, confer increased infection risk. Infections have not been systematically studied in these conditions, however. Little is known about infection risk in these conditions, particularly dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). We aimed to characterize and compare infection patterns and risk factors in patients with pemphigoid, pemphigus, and DH. We retrospectively studied the medical records of Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents who had a diagnosis of AIBD between 1 January 1998 and 1 January 2011. Of 81 patients studied, 54 (67%) had pemphigoid, 11 (14%) had pemphigus and 16 (20%) had DH. Most patients studied developed at least one localized infection (72%) or one systemic infection (83%). Almost one-third of patients (31%) developed infections requiring hospitalization or contributing to death. All patients taking systemic corticosteroids experienced a localized or systemic infection during the follow-up period. Systemic infections were significantly less frequent in patients with DH than those with pemphigoid or pemphigus (P = 0.03), as were systemic infections requiring hospitalization or contributing to death (P = 0.002). Patients with DH were significantly less likely to require systemic corticosteroids (P < 0.001) and significantly more likely to receive dapsone (P = 0.002). The study design was retrospective and a limited number of patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients with AIBD frequently developed localized and systemic infections, a substantial portion of which contributed to hospitalization or death. Patients with DH experienced infections of lesser severity than patients with pemphigoid or pemphigus.","['Lehman JS', 'Khunger M', 'Lohse CM']",2013,40,8,J Dermatol,"Lehman JS, et al.

23743561,Men with celiac disease are shorter than their peers in the general population.,"OBJECTIVE: Late diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is increasingly common, the implications of which are largely unknown. Although short stature is a common sign of childhood CD, the data on the height of adult CD patients is conflicting. This study investigates the final height of men and women diagnosed with CD in adulthood and attempts to identify influencing factors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 585 adults at the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University, comparing their height with the control population (NHANES). Patients were included if they were older than 18 years of age at diagnosis and if baseline height and weight were available. In addition, we examined for differences in demographic and physical features, mode of presentation, and concomitant illnesses in shorter versus taller celiac patients.
RESULTS: Men (n=162) with CD diagnosed in adulthood were shorter than men in the general population (CD: 169.3 ± 10.5 vs. 177.3 ± 7.0 cm, P<0.01) whereas women (n=423) were not (CD: 166.3 ± 9.4 vs. 163.2 ± 6.7 cm). There were no statistically significant differences in age at diagnosis, BMI, concomitant autoimmune illnesses (hypothyroidism, type I diabetes, dermatitis herpetiformis), or mode of presentation in shorter versus taller CD patients of either sex. Hemoglobin was associated with short stature in CD men (short: 13.9 g/dl, tall: 14.6 g/dl; P=0.01), but not women (short: 12.9 g/dl, tall: 13.0 g/dl, P=0.41).
CONCLUSION: Short stature is a well described phenomenon in pediatric CD with the potential for 'catch-up growth' on a gluten-free diet. However, among adults with CD who had attained final height before diagnosis, we found that men, not women, are shorter relative to the general population.","['Sonti R', 'Lebwohl B', 'Lewis SK', 'Abu Daya H', 'Klavan H', 'Aguilar K', 'Green PH']",2013,25,9,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Sonti R, et al.

23715643,Pediatric and adult celiac disease: similarities and differences.,"Differences between children and adults in celiac disease (CD) presentation and epidemiology are reviewed here. Clinical manifestations, histological changes, serology, and response to gluten-free diet are similar. Differences exist in epidemiology, type of clinical presentations, coexisting diseases, complications, and association with obesity. CD is two to five times more common in children than in adults. Classical CD with gastrointestinal symptoms is more common in children whereas nonclassical CD dominates in adults. A gene dose phenomenon (double-dose HLA-DQB1 02 allele) is postulated to be responsible for this difference. Coexisting autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus type 1, Sjogren's syndrome, and dermatitis herpetiformis are more common in adults than in children (42 % vs. 5 %). The association of overweight/obesity and CD is stronger in adults than in children (22.5 % vs. 14 %). Besides poor compliance, pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, lymphocytic colitis, and microscopic colitis are considered responsible for nonresponsive CD in adults but not in children. Complications like refractory sprue and small intestinal neoplasms are seen exclusively in adults. Existing diagnostic criteria (modified ESPGHAN) are not suitable for diagnosing CD in adults as the majority of cases are either nonclassical or subclinical CD.",['Poddar U'],2013,32,5,Indian J Gastroenterol,Poddar U.

23677541,[Bullous autoimmune disorders in children].,"We review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and therapy of autoimmune bullous skin diseases of childhood, especially of the most common linear IgA dermatosis. In autoimmune bullous diseases, autoantibodies are formed against different adhesion molecules of the skin. These are not only pathophysiologically relevant, but also serve as basis for diagnosis and follow-up of these diseases. In case an autoimmune bullous disease is suspected, histopathology and immunohistopathology (direct immunofluorescence microscopy) as well as serological tests (indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, ELISA, immunoblot) should be performed. Therapy depends on the diagnosis. In IgA-mediated pathogenesis, dapsone can be successfully used. In IgG-mediated diseases, immunosuppression with corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents should be initiated, although only local therapy is sufficient to control a self-limiting pemphigus neonatorum. In dermatitis herpetiformis, a life-long gluten-free diet is recommended.","['Sárdy M', 'Kasperkiewicz M']",2013,64,6,Hautarzt,Sárdy M and Kasperkiewicz M. [Bullous autoimmune disorders in children].

23674144,Dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune, pleiomorphic, papulovesicular disorder associated with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. DH is characterized by subepidermal bullae on hematoxylin and eosin staining and granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the dermal papillae using the direct immunofluorescence method. Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and epidermal transgulatminase can be measured serologically, although biopsy is still required for definitive diagnosis of DH. Gluten free diet (GFD) is the first-line therapeutic approach that can alleviate both cutaneous and intestinal manifestations of this condition, while dapsone and sulfones target the skin eruption only. Combined therapy with GFD and dapsone is an initial treatment of choice to control the cutaneous manifestations of DH. This article will provide a comprehensive review of DH, including its epidemiology, clinical and pathological findings, diagnostic evaluation, and management.","['Plotnikova N', 'Miller JL']",2013,18,3,Skin Therapy Lett,Plotnikova N and Miller JL.

23634961,A comparison of general practitioners prescribing of gluten-free foods for the treatment of coeliac disease with national prescribing guidelines.,"BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is considered to affect approximately one in 100 people. In the UK, gluten-free (GF) foods can be prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) to treat this condition and there are national guidelines on the quantities of GF food an individual should receive on prescription. Information on actual prescribing behaviour by GPs, and how this compares with guideline recommendations, is scarce. The present study aimed to describe GPs prescribing practice of GF foods, within one locality in the UK, comparing this with national guidelines.
METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of GP electronic medical records for all patients with a gluten-sensitive enteropathy diagnosis and/or those prescribed GF food between April 2010 and March 2011 was carried out in 16 GP practices in the west of Scotland, serving a total of 85 667 patients.
RESULTS: Of 175 (0.18% of the total practice population) patients, 152 were identified with coeliac disease, eight with dermatitis herpetiformis and six with both conditions. A further nine patients received GF foods on prescriptions with no recorded diagnosis. There was a positive association between adherence to the prescribing guidelines and female sex (P < 0.0001) and (for those with a recorded diagnosis) increasing age (P = 0.001). There was no significant association between either socio-economic deprivation or co-morbidities and adherence to the prescribing guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: There was significant under prescribing of GF foods in those identified. Further research is required to establish whether these results are representative of wider practice in the UK.","['Martin U', 'Mercer SW']",2014,27,1,J Hum Nutr Diet,Martin U and Mercer SW.

In recent years, numerous autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases have been shown to present significant number depletion and/or function impairment of this subset. In the present study, we present a brief overview of the results obtained by our group in association with the centers belonging to the Italian Immunopathology Group, as to the expression levels and biological significance of circulating regulatory CD4+CD25+brightFOXP3+ T cells in a variety of immune-mediated skin diseases (such as psoriasis, scleroderma, bullous pemphigoid and GvHD), together with preliminary results achieved in patients with inflammatory bowel disease-related dermatoses. This review shows that this series of different cutaneous diseases characterised by an immune-mediated pathogenesis, share a significant down-regulation of circulating FOXP3+ Treg cells, whilst the treatment and the achievement of clinical response are generally associated with an opposite phenomenon with up-regulation of Treg cells. Future studies are mandatory to identify the effective role of these modifications in the disease pathogenesis as well as its relationship with the clinical response.","['Quaglino P', 'Ponti R', 'Novelli M', 'Savoia P', 'Fava P', 'Papini M', 'Bernengo MG']",2013,148,2,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Quaglino P, et al.

23588141,Clinical and immunopathological features of 159 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis: an Italian experience.,"AIM: The aim of this paper to report the main clinical and immunopathological findings of our case series of 159 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH).
METHODS: All DH patients that were diagnosed from 1995 to 2012 at the Section of Dermatology of the University of Florence were included in the study. Clinical data were collected for each patient. Moreover, histopathological examination on both the skin and the small bowel, direct immunofluorescence on perilesional skin as well as the search for anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminsase antibodies (tTG) were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 159 patients with a male predominance were enrolled. About 36% of the patients were below the age of 20. The most frequent clinical features seen in our DH patients were represented by figurate erythema, wheals, papules and scratching lesions, while the knees, elbows and buttocks were the most commonly involved sites. All the 22 patients that underwent a bowel biopsy showed the typical alterations found in celiac disease. Moreover, 100% of the patients showed granular IgA deposits at the papillary tips. Finally, anti-endomysium and anti-tTG antibodies were present in 90% and 96% of the patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We reported one of the largest case series of patients with DH from a single center. Our study confirmed most of the data from the Literature, and in particular the association of DH to histologically proven CD in all the biopsied cases. Another interesting finding of our study is the high prevalence of DH within pediatric patients, that is usually underreported.","['Antiga E', 'Verdelli A', 'Calabrò A', 'Fabbri P', 'Caproni M']",2013,148,2,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Antiga E, et al.

23496382,Celiac disease.,"Celiac disease, with a prevalence around 1% of the general population, is the most common genetically-induced food intolerance in the world. Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, this enteropathy may appear at any age, and is characterized by a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms. Among them, gastrointestinal presentations include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss or failure to thrive in children; but extra-intestinal manifestations are also common, and actually appear to be on the rise. They include a large variety of ailments, such as dermatitis Herpetiformis, anemia, short stature, osteoporosis, arthritis, neurologic problems, unexplained elevation of transaminases, and even female infertility. For the clinician interested in oral diseases, celiac disease can lead to delayed tooth eruption, dental enamel hypoplasia, recurrent oral aphthae. Diagnosing celiac disease requires therefore a high degree of suspicion followed by a very sensitive screening test: serum levels of the autoantibody anti-tissue transglutaminase. A positive subject will then be confirmed by an intestinal biopsy, and will then be put on a strict gluten-free diet, that in most cases will bring a marked improvement of symptoms. Newer forms of treatment which in the future will probably be available to the non-responsive patients are currently being actively pursued.","['Rivera E', 'Assiri A', 'Guandalini S']",2013,19,7,Oral Dis,"Rivera E, et al.

23478804,The duodenal microbiota composition of adult celiac disease patients is associated with the clinical manifestation of the disease.,"BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is classically manifested in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract but extraintestinal symptoms, such as dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), are also common. Besides several well-known shared genetic risk factors and an environmental trigger, gliadin, factors determining the clinical outcome of the disease are not known. In this study, the role of duodenal microbiota in the celiac disease outcome was studied by analyzing mucosa-associated microbiota in celiac disease patients with a variety of intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms.
METHODS: Microbiota in duodenal biopsy samples obtained from 33 patients with celiac disease with GI, DH, anemia, or mixed symptoms, as well as screen-detected asymptomatic celiac disease and 18 control subjects were analyzed using PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and a subset of samples additionally by the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: The composition and diversity of mucosal microbiota was associated with the manifestation of celiac disease when analyzed using PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The patients with celiac disease with GI symptoms or anemia had lower microbial diversity than those with DH. Moreover, the patients with GI symptoms had different intestinal microbiota composition and structure, dominated by Proteobacteria, in comparison to those with DH or control subjects (patients with dyspepsia). The relatively similar intestinal microbiota composition in the control subjects and those with DH was characterized by the high abundance of Firmicutes.
CONCLUSIONS: The two common outcomes of celiac disease, classical GI and extraintestinal manifestations, had marked differences on the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota. This association suggested that intestinal microbiota may have a role in the manifestation of the disease.","['Wacklin P', 'Kaukinen K', 'Tuovinen E', 'Collin P', 'Lindfors K', 'Partanen J', 'Mäki M', 'Mättö J']",2013,19,5,Inflamm Bowel Dis,"Wacklin P, et al.

CASE REPORT: We report an 18-year-old primigravida who presented with IH at nearly 30 weeks' gestation and was the first patient reported in mainland China. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly in spite of treatment with corticosteroids and antibiotics, so we decided to terminate the pregnancy by induction of labor. After vaginal delivery she developed fever and her skin lesions did not disappear naturally. Fortunately her symptoms were resolved with the treatment of antibiotics and acitretin, and at day 60 postpartum her skin lesions had completely disappeared.
CONCLUSION: Although IH is associated with high mortality and morbidity in both fetus and mother, a better prognosis could be achieved with an immediate diagnosis and proper treatment. The etiology of IH needs to be further explored and the process of diagnosis and therapy should be standardized.","['Gao QQ', 'Xi MR', 'Yao Q']",2013,226,1,Dermatology,"Gao QQ, et al.

23372207,Direct immunofluorescence in cutaneous vasculitis: experience from a referral hospital in India.,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous vasculitis is commonly recognized and biopsied, owing to ease of access. Most biopsies are also subjected to direct immunofluorescence (DIF), though the rates of positivity vary. This is an attempt to assess the utility of DIF and glean data that will help optimize the test.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic utility of DIF in cutaneous vasculitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of suspected cutaneous vasculitis submitted for DIF between 2004 and 2010 were included. Clinical data, histopathologic diagnosis, DIF findings and additional tests such as anti nuclear antibody (ANA), anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) (where done) were noted.
RESULTS: There were 198 patients in the study group, with a female predominance. Purpura was the commonest clinical presentation. Extracutaneous involvement was noted in 29% of patients' i.e., joint pain, abdominal pain and hematuria. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis was the commonest histologic diagnosis. DIF showed an overall positivity of 39% (n = 77) with C3 in 26% (n = 52) and IgA in 23% (n = 46) cases. Forty one cases of suspected Henoch Schonlein Purpura (HSP) showed IgA positivity. The timing of biopsy ranged from <3 days to six months, with 38% being done within seven days. DIF was positive in 86% of biopsies performed within seven days of onset of lesions. Sixty percent of patients with extracutaneous manifestations showed deposits. Vascular deposits were also noted in dermatitis herpetiformis, dematomyositis and prurigo.
CONCLUSION: DIF positivity is strongly influenced by the timing of the biopsy and the presence of extracutaneous features. Its clinical value is greatest in patients with HSP, being contributory in 90% of cases. Vascular deposits may be seen in non-vasculitic conditions and need clinicopathologic correlation.","['Nandeesh B', 'Tirumalae R']",2013,58,1,Indian J Dermatol,Nandeesh B and Tirumalae R.

PATIENTS/METHODS: CD was diagnosed in childhood by endoscopic duodenal biopsy in two monozygotic (MZ) female pairs (A1 and A2, B1 and B2) and one dizygotic (DZ) pair, in which the male (C1) had CD and the female (C2) was negative. The patients had periodic evaluations after a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 16 to 21 years. Nine first-degree relatives were screened by serological tests and when positive, referred for intestinal biopsies.
RESULTS: At diagnosis, all CD patients had the classic presentation. A1/A2: scalloped duodenal mucosa with atrophic areas, Marsh III-b, after 16 years of GFD was antiendomysium antibody (EmA) negative, normal mucosa. B1/B2 at diagnosis: mucosal atrophy, Marsh III-b, after 21 years was EmA negative, decreased folds. Patient C1: decreased folds, Marsh III-b, after 16 years was EmA positive, decreased folds, admitted to gluten ingestion. A1, A2, and B1 presented dermatitis herpetiformis. The father of A1/A2 and the mother of C1/C2 were celiac.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term follow-up of the patients allowed some observations such as the concordance for CD in MZ twins, both in relation to the time of onset and the severity of the disease. Also, the findings of serological, endoscopic, and histological analyses were similar. Dermatitis herpetiformis was present in patients with CD, with partial concordance in MZ twins.","['da Silva Kotze LM', 'Nisihara R', 'Kotze LR', 'da Rosa Utiyama SR']",2013,26,1-2,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,"da Silva Kotze LM, et al.

23317981,Cutaneous manifestations of gastrointestinal disease: part II.,"The gastrointestinal (GI) and cutaneous organ systems are closely linked. In part I of this continuing medical education article, the intricacies of this relationship were explored as they pertained to hereditary polyposis disorders, hamartomatous disorders, and paraneoplastic disease. Part II focuses on the cutaneous system's links to inflammatory bowel disease and vascular disorders. An in-depth analysis of inflammatory bowel disease skin findings is provided to aid dermatologists in recognizing and facilitating early consultation and intervention by gastroenterologists. Cutaneous signs of inflammatory bowel disease include fissures and fistulae, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, pyostomatitis vegetans, oral aphthous ulcers, cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, necrotizing vasculitis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Additional immune-mediated conditions, such as diverticulitis, bowel-associated dermatosis-arthritis syndrome, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, dermatitis herpetiformis, and Degos disease, in which the skin and GI system are mutually involved, will also be discussed. Genodermatoses common to both the GI tract and the skin include Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. Kaposi sarcoma is a neoplastic disease with lesions involving both the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. Acrodermatitis enteropathica, a condition of zinc deficiency, likewise affects both the GI and dermatologic systems. These conditions are reviewed with updates on the genetic basis, diagnostic and screening modalities, and therapeutic options.

23157646,Living with coeliac disease and a gluten-free diet: a Canadian perspective.,"OBJECTIVE: Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only treatment for coeliac disease. The gluten-free diet is complex, costly and impacts on all activities involving food, making it difficult to maintain for a lifetime. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet among Canadians with coeliac disease.
METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all members (n = 10 693) of both the Canadian Celiac Association and the Fondation québécoise de la maladie cœliaque in 2008.
RESULTS: The overall response rate was 72%. Results are presented for the 5912 respondents (≥18 years) reporting biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease and/or dermatitis herpetiformis. Two-thirds never intentionally consumed gluten. Women reported significantly greater emotional responses to a gluten-free diet but, with time, were more accepting of it than men. Difficulties and negative emotions were experienced less frequently by those on the diet for >5 years, although food labelling and eating away from home remained very problematic. Frustration and isolation because of the diet were the most common negative emotions experienced.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study quantifies the difficulties experienced, the strategies used and the emotional impact of following a gluten-free diet. It highlights the need to improve the training and education of dietitians, other health providers and the food service industry workers about coeliac disease and a gluten-free diet, with the aim of better helping individuals improve their adherence to a gluten-free diet and their quality of life.","['Zarkadas M', 'Dubois S', 'MacIsaac K', 'Cantin I', 'Rashid M', 'Roberts KC', 'La Vieille S', 'Godefroy S', 'Pulido OM']",2013,26,1,J Hum Nutr Diet,"Zarkadas M, et al.

Our aim is to verify anti-Neo-tTg IgA and IgG in adults with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH).
METHODS: Multi-centric retrospective evaluation of the IgA/G autoantibodies in sera of DH patients on a regular diet (n=40) and a gluten restricted diet (GRD, n=53) and control adults with autoimmune skin diseases (n=107) by ELISA.
RESULTS: The sensitivities of Celicheck Neo IgA/G (76%, 95% CI 67-84%) and the Neo tTg-A (85%, 95% CI 70-97%) ELISA were significantly greater than that of tTg-A (56%, 95% CI 46-67%), eTg-A (62%, 95% CI 52-72%), DGP-A (55%, 95% CI 55-65%), DGP-G (61%, 95% CI 51-71%), Glia-A (55%, 95% CI 45-65%) and Glia-G (56%, 95% CI 46-66%) ELISA. The specificities of all 8 ELISA were in the range of 90-100%. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) for the two Neo-tTg ELISA (0.863 and 0.949) were higher than the AUCs for ROCs of tTg, DGP and eTG ELISA (range between 0.657 and 0.783). The autoantibody levels of DH patients on a normal diet were significantly higher than those on GRD in the Celicheck Neo IgA/IgG, NeotTg-A; tTg-A and the eTg-A; ELISA (p<0.01) and of no significance in the DGP and Gliadin ELISA.
CONCLUSION: Neo-epitope IgA autoantibodies represent a new and sensitive serological marker of DH.","['Lytton SD', 'Antiga E', 'Pfeiffer S', 'Matthias T', 'Szaflarska-Poplawska A', 'Ulaganathan VK', 'Placek W', 'Fabbri P', 'Hall R', 'Caproni M']",2013,415,,Clin Chim Acta,"Lytton SD, et al.

23142684,The versatile role of gliadin peptides in celiac disease.,"The link between the gluten component of wheat and celiac disease (CD) was discovered in 1952 by a team of physicians from Birmingham, England. Villous atrophy was described by John W. Paulley in 1954. During the 1960s, other features of CD were elucidated; its hereditary nature was recognized in 1965, and in 1966, dermatitis herpetiformis was linked to gluten sensitivity. Following the discovery of a link between gluten and CD, it was demonstrated that gliadin, one of the two principal protein groups comprising gluten, plays a critical role in CD. It has since become clear that the different and crucial roles of gliadin in CD result from its ability to activate multiple signaling pathways that modulate CD pathology. Most of these pathways involve the host innate and adaptive immune responses, but some pathways are activated when gliadin interacts with the intestinal cellular compartment. This review covers the current knowledge of the role of gliadin peptides in CD disorders that are characterized by intraepithelial T-cells infiltration (IEL), production of autoantibodies, endosomal trafficking, alteration of intestinal barrier function and intestinal cell proliferation. In addition, it examines the ability of these characteristics to determine the main clinicopathological features of gluten sensitivity for the purpose of identifying new strategies, other than maintaining a gluten-free diet, to improve the management of CD patients in the future.","['De Re V', 'Caggiari L', 'Tabuso M', 'Cannizzaro R']",2013,46,6,Clin Biochem,"De Re V, et al.

23116305,Diagnostic utility of direct immunofluorescence findings around hair follicles and sweat glands in immunobullous disease.,"BACKGROUND: Inherent to some immunobullous disorders is potential for intraepidermal or dermal-epidermal junction fragility, a phenomenon that may compromise biopsy specimen integrity and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) interpretation. In these situations, cutaneous adnexal structures (e.g. hair follicles, sweat apparatus) usually remain intact. Whether periadnexal DIF findings are reliable in diagnosing immunobullous conditions is unknown.
METHODS: We evaluated 56 cutaneous specimens with diagnostic immunoglobulin (Ig) deposition patterns that contained adnexal structures. In a corollary study, we examined 145 hematoxylin-eosin-stained frozen specimens to determine biopsy factors associated with the presence of adnexal structures.
RESULTS: Periadnexal DIF findings offered diagnostic sensitivity in conditions with linear or cell-surface Ig deposition or lupus band. Periadnexal DIF findings were unreliable in dermatitis herpetiformis. Biopsy specimens from scalp and genitalia were most likely to contain folliculosebaceous units and sweat duct apparatus, respectively. Relative depth of biopsy correlated directly with the likelihood of identifying sweat duct apparatus but not folliculosebaceous units.
CONCLUSIONS: Periadnexal DIF findings may add diagnostic sensitivity in DIF evaluation of pemphigoid, pemphigus and lupus erythematosus. Pathologists can guide clinicians to biopsy certain anatomic sites and to obtain sufficient biopsy depth to increase the probability of capturing adnexal structures and, therefore, diagnostic yield from DIF specimens.","['Lehman JS', 'Camilleri MJ']",2013,40,2,J Cutan Pathol,Lehman JS and Camilleri MJ.

As the secretor status has been shown to be a major determinant for the gut microbial spectrum, assumed to be important in the gut immune homeostasis, we studied the association of rs601338-FUT2 with celiac disease (CelD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the Finnish population. Rs601338 was genotyped in CelD (n = 909), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) (n = 116), ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 496) and Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 280) patients and healthy controls (n = 2738). CelD showed significant genotypic [P = 0.0074, odds ratio (OR): 1.28] and recessive (P = 0.015, OR: 1.28) association with the rs601338-AA genotype. This was also found in the combined CelD+DH dataset (genotype association: P = 0.0060, OR: 1.28; recessive association: P < 0.011, OR: 1.28). The A allele of rs601338 showed nominal association with dominant protection from UC (P = 0.044, OR: 0.82) and UC+CD (P = 0.035, OR: 0.84). The frequency of non-secretors (rs601338-GG) in controls, CelD, DH, UC and CD datasets was 14.7%, 18%, 18.1%, 14.3% and 16.1%, respectively. No association was evident in the DH or CD datasets alone.

22991566,Gene expression profiling in dermatitis herpetiformis skin lesions.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disease associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (CD). In order to investigate the pathogenesis of skin lesions at molecular level, we analysed the gene expression profiles in skin biopsies from 6 CD patients with DH and 6 healthy controls using Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 arrays. 486 genes were differentially expressed in DH skin compared to normal skin: 225 were upregulated and 261 were downregulated. Consistently with the autoimmune origin of DH, functional classification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicates a B- and T-cell immune response (LAG3, TRAF5, DPP4, and NT5E). In addition, gene modulation provides evidence for a local inflammatory response (IL8, PTGFR, FSTL1, IFI16, BDKRD2, and NAMPT) with concomitant leukocyte recruitment (CCL5, ENPP2), endothelial cell activation, and neutrophil extravasation (SELL, SELE). DEGs also indicate overproduction of matrix proteases (MMP9, ADAM9, and ADAM19) and proteolytic enzymes (CTSG, ELA2, CPA3, TPSB2, and CMA1) that may contribute to epidermal splitting and blister formation. Finally, we observed modulation of genes involved in cell growth inhibition (CGREF1, PA2G4, and PPP2R1B), increased apoptosis (FAS, TNFSF10, and BASP1), and reduced adhesion at the dermal epidermal junction (PLEC1, ITGB4, and LAMA5). In conclusion, our results identify genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of DH skin lesions.","['Dolcino M', 'Cozzani E', 'Riva S', 'Parodi A', 'Tinazzi E', 'Lunardi C', 'Puccetti A']",2012,2012,,Clin Dev Immunol,"Dolcino M, et al.

We report two Japanese DH cases with typical clinical, histological and direct immunofluorescence features. However, no symptom of gluten-sensitive enteropathy was shown. The diagnosis was confirmed by eliminating other autoimmune blistering diseases by indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting. However, circulating immunoglobulin (Ig)A anti-endomysium, reticulin and gliadin antibodies were not detected. IgA antibodies to tissue and epidermal transglutaminases were also negative. One case was associated with lung cancer and the other one with autoimmune pancreatitis. On review of 17 cases of DH reported in Japan over the previous 10 years, including our cases, one case was associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, four with malignant neoplasms, two with autoimmune systemic disorders and one with psoriasis. Although our cases were typical of DH in clinical, histopathological and IgA deposit features, they showed different human leukocyte antigen haplotypes, no gluten-sensitive enteropathy and no DH-specific IgA antibodies, including those to epidermal and tissue transglutaminases. These results suggest that studies of unique characteristics in Japanese DH patients should facilitate further understanding of pathogenesis in DH.","['Shigeta M', 'Saiki M', 'Tsuruta D', 'Ohata C', 'Ishii N', 'Ono F', 'Hamada T', 'Dainichi T', 'Furumura M', 'Zone JJ', 'Karpati S', 'Sitaru C', 'Hashimoto T']",2012,39,12,J Dermatol,"Shigeta M, et al.

AIM: We undertook this study to compare the clinical spectrum of NDCD with that of diarrheal/classical celiac disease (CCD).
METHOD: This facility-based retrospective observational study included consecutive patients diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) (as per modified ESPGHAN criteria) from October 2009 to August 2011.
RESULTS: A total of 381 patients were diagnosed with CD during the study period. NDCD was present in 192 (51.8 %). NDCD had higher mean age at presentation (5.8 ± 2.8 vs. 6.9 ± 2.9 years respectively; p = 0.003) and longer duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (2.9 ± 1.7 years vs. 3.6 ± 2.2 years; p = 0.02) as compared to CCD. In the NDCD group, the most frequent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were recurrent abdominal pain [122 (63.5 %)] and abdominal distension [102 (53.1 %)] followed by constipation [48 (25 %)], vomiting [76 (39.6 %)] and recurrent oral ulcers [89 (46.4 %)]. Vomiting and constipation were more frequently seen in NDCD as compared to CCD (p < 0.001 in both). Commonly enumerated extraintestinal manifestations in NDCD included failure to thrive [109 (56.8 %)], isolated short stature [36 (18.8 %)], persistent anemia [83 (43.2 %)] and hepatomegaly/splenomegaly or both [56 (29.2 %)]. Associated comorbidities included autoimmune thyroiditis [11 (5.7 %)], type 1 diabetes mellitus [8 (4.2 %)], bronchial asthma [23 (11.9 %)], idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis [4 (2.1 %)], Down's syndrome [3 (1.6 %)], alopecia areata [6 (3.1 %)], polyarthritis [2 (1.0 %)], dermatitis herpetiformis [6 (3.1 %)] and chronic liver disease [6 (3.1 %)]. The number of patients with a Marsh score IIIb and above of duodenal biopsy was significantly more in the CCD group (p < 0.001).

Its exact etiology and pathogenesis are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and chronological changes in the histopathology of prurigo pigmentosa in Korean patients and to assess the etiology of this condition. We reviewed the medical records, clinical photographs and biopsy specimens from 50 patients diagnosed with prurigo pigmentosa. Mean age at diagnosis was 23.7 years (range, 15-61 years). Prurigo pigmentosa started as urticarial papules or plaques, changing first to papulovesicles and then to reticulated brownish macules. The most frequent sites were the back and chest, especially depressed areas such as the central back and inter-mammary area. Dietary change was suspected as a cause of prurigo pigmentosa in 17 patients. Histopathologically, early-stage lesions had dermatitis herpetiformis-like features; fully-developed lesions displayed impetigo-like or acute, generalized, exanthematous, pustulosis-like features; and late lesions presented with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation-like features. Oral minocycline, with or without dapsone, was effective in inhibiting the appearance of new lesions, but did not prevent recurrence. Prurigo pigmentosa is not rare in Korea, is apparently associated with dietary modification and preferentially involves the depressed regions of the trunk.","['Kim JK', 'Chung WK', 'Chang SE', 'Ko JY', 'Lee JH', 'Won CH', 'Lee MW', 'Choi JH', 'Moon KC']",2012,39,11,J Dermatol,"Kim JK, et al.

The male-to-female ratio was 2 : 1. The mean age at onset was 43.8, and 13 years earlier for female patients. More than half of these Japanese DH patients showed granular IgA deposition in the papillary dermis, and another one-third showed fibrillar IgA deposition. The male patients with granular IgA deposition were 10 years older than those with fibrillar deposition. Whereas patients with granular IgA deposition showed typical distribution of the skin lesions, the predilection sites of DH tended to be spared in patients with fibrillar IgA deposition. Only 3 patients had definite gluten-sensitive enteropathy. There was a statistical difference in the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR9 between the granular group and controls among Japanese. No patients had HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8, which is frequently found in Caucasian DH patients. The absence of HLA-DQ2/DQ8, the inability to identify celiac disease in most cases, the predominance of fibrillar IgA, and the unusual distribution of clinical lesions in Japanese patients suggest that Japanese DH may be a subset of DH patients and have a pathogenesis which is different from that currently proposed in Caucasian DH patients.","['Ohata C', 'Ishii N', 'Hamada T', 'Shimomura Y', 'Niizeki H', 'Dainichi T', 'Furumura M', 'Tsuruta D', 'Hashimoto T']",2012,2012,,Clin Dev Immunol,"Ohata C, et al.

22778762,The expression of selected proapoptotic molecules in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The role of the process of apoptosis is investigated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases; however at present, there is not much information about its role in dermatitis herpetiformis. Skin biopsies were taken from 18 DH patients and from 10 healthy subjects. The localization and expression of Bax, Fas, FasL, TRAIL, TRAIL-R in skin lesions, and perilesional skin were studied by immunohistochemistry. Expression of Bax, Fas, and Fas ligand was detected in the keratinocytes in skin biopsies from DH patients. Expression of TRAIL and TRAIL receptor was confirmed in epidermis, infiltration cells, and some fibroblasts. The expression of examined molecules in biopsies from healthy people was observed only in single cells. There were statistically significant differences between lesional, perilesional, and healthy skin of control group in Bax expression analysis and between lesional skin and control group in Fas, FasL, and TRAIL expression. There were statistically significant differences between control group and perilesional skin in Bax and FasL expression. Our results show that selected proapoptotic molecules may take part in pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis, but the role of apoptosis in this process is not clear.","['Agnieszka Z', 'Anna EP', 'Malgorzata WD', 'Marian D', 'Anna SJ', 'Cynkier A', 'Elzbieta W']",2012,2012,,Clin Dev Immunol,"Agnieszka Z, et al.

22708883,Reduced mortality in dermatitis herpetiformis: a population-based study of 476 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extra-intestinal manifestation of coeliac disease and most patients adhere to a life-long gluten free diet (GFD). Increased mortality rates have been reported in coeliac disease but knowledge in DH is scanty.
OBJECTIVES: To survey the mortality rate and causes of death in a large cohort of patients with DH.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with DH (n = 476 consecutive patients) diagnosed from 1970 onwards at the Tampere University Hospital were analysed for causes of death during 1971-2010. A questionnaire survey on key aspects of health behaviour was performed in patients with DH and comparisons were made with the Finnish population.
RESULTS: The total number of deaths during 9079 person years followed up was 77 whereas 110 were expected. The standardized mortality rate (SMR) for all causes of death was significantly reduced, being 0·70 (95% CI 0·55-0·87), and similar in both sexes. The SMR was equal in the patients with DH with (0·73) and without (0·77) small bowel villous atrophy. The SMR was significantly reduced (0·38) for deaths due to cerebrovascular diseases. The SMR due to lymphoproliferative malignancies was significantly increased (6·86) in the first 5 years of follow-up but not thereafter. The questionnaire survey documented that 97·7% of the patients with DH adhered to a GFD. The patients reported significantly less hypercholesterolaemia and there were fewer current and past smokers compared with the age- and sex-matched control population.
CONCLUSIONS: The present long-term follow-up study of DH documented significantly reduced all-cause and cerebrovascular disease mortality. Strict adherence to a GFD, less smoking and hypercholesterolaemia may play a role in the observed health benefit.","['Hervonen K', 'Alakoski A', 'Salmi TT', 'Helakorpi S', 'Kautiainen H', 'Kaukinen K', 'Pukkala E', 'Collin P', 'Reunala T']",2012,167,6,Br J Dermatol,"Hervonen K, et al.

Besides the well-known association between celiac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), considered as the cutaneous manifestation of gluten-dependent enteropathy, is more frequently reported also the association with other mucocutaneous diseases. Among these there are both autoimmune, allergic, and inflammatory diseases, but also a more heterogeneous group called miscellaneous. The knowledge about pathogenic, epidemiological, clinical, and diagnostic aspects of CD is increasing in recent years as well as those about DH, but some aspects still remain to be defined, in particular the possible pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the association between both CD and DH and CD and other immunological skin diseases. The aim of this paper is to describe the skin diseases frequently associated with CD, distinguishing them from those which have a relationship probably just coincidental.","['Caproni M', 'Bonciolini V', ""D'Errico A"", 'Antiga E', 'Fabbri P']",2012,2012,,Gastroenterol Res Pract,"Caproni M, et al.

22672004,IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase autoantibodies: a sensible and sensitive marker for diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis in adult patients.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare gluten-sensitive blistering itchy skin disease, strictly related to coeliac disease (CD). Direct immunofluorescence, demonstrating IgA granular deposits localized either in the dermal papillae or along the dermo-epidermal junction, is currently the gold standard for diagnosis of DH. It has been shown that DH immunocomplexes contain epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) and that sera from patients with DH contain antibodies specifically directed against eTG.
OBJECTIVES: We studied the usefulness of serum eTG antibodies in discriminating between DH, CD and other gastrointestinal and dermatologic diseases.
METHODS: eTG antibodies were tested in 308 adult patients' sera: 44 patients with untreated dermatitis herpetiformis (UDH), 99 patients with untreated coeliac disease (UCD), 70 dermatological controls and 95 gastrointestinal controls.
RESULTS: In UDH eTG antibody levels were significantly higher than in DH patients on gluten-free diet, UCD, gastrointestinal controls and dermatological controls. In UCD eTG antibodies strongly correlated with tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies, whereas in UDH no significant correlation was observed.
CONCLUSION: Serum IgA eTG antibody determination can efficiently distinguish UDH from other dermatological itchy diseases and is highly sensitive to gluten-free diet.","['Borroni G', 'Biagi F', 'Ciocca O', 'Vassallo C', 'Carugno A', 'Cananzi R', 'Campanella J', 'Bianchi PI', 'Brazzelli V', 'Corazza GR']",2013,27,7,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Borroni G, et al.

22654688,Acupuncture and a gluten-free diet relieve urticaria and eczema in a case of undiagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis and atypical or extraintestinal celiac disease: a case report.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report is to describe the use of acupuncture and a gluten-free diet (GFD) for urticaria and severe eczema in a patient with undiagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis and atypical or extraintestinal celiac disease.
CLINICAL FEATURES: A 48-year-old woman presented with intense urticaria, eczema, worsening heartburn, chronic constipation, headaches, and an intense feeling of heat for 4 months. Results of punch biopsies of the skin lesions and laboratory tests were inconclusive. After the acupuncture sessions reported here ended, human leukocyte antigen blood typing revealed celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis-associated human leukocyte antigen DQ-8. Results of an endoscopy and colonoscopy were negative.
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient received 3 acupuncture treatments a week for 12 weeks. The patient's symptoms began in March 2008. She began using topical and oral steroids and felt that her symptoms were not responding. Acupuncture began in July 2008. At the end of the first 12 treatments, during which she was using topical and oral steroids, the urticaria and constipation resolved completely; and she had temporary relief from the heartburn. It is thought that the urticaria and constipation resolved because of the acupuncture as that was the only change. At the end of the second 12 treatments, during which time she had started Optifast, a GFD, the heartburn, headache, and eczema resolved. At the end of the third 12 treatments, all her symptoms remained resolved. Steroid treatment was discontinued after the first 12 treatments.

22611420,Chronic gastritis in dermatitis herpetiformis: a controlled study.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous small studies suggest that chronic atrophic gastritis is common in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). We here examined the frequency and topography of chronic gastritis in 93 untreated DH subjects and in 186 controls with dyspepsia.
METHODS: Specimens were drawn from the gastric corpus and antrum and examined for atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and Helicobacter pylori. Duodenal biopsies were taken.
RESULTS: Atrophic corpus gastritis was more frequent in DH than in controls (16.0% and 2.7%, resp., P < 0.001); atrophy in the antrum was rare in both groups (3.2% and 1.1%, P = 0.34). Intestinal metaplasia was present in 13 (14.0%) DH and 12 (6.5%) control patients (P = 0.038) and H. pylori in 17 (18.3%) and 17 (9.3%) (P = 0.028), respectively. Small-bowel villous atrophy was seen in 76% of the DH patients, equally in patients with and without chronic gastritis. One DH patient with atrophic gastritis developed gastric cancer.
CONCLUSION: In DH, chronic atrophic gastritis was common in the corpus, but not in the antrum. H. pylori will partly explain this, but corpus atrophy is suggestive of an autoimmune etiology. Atrophic gastritis may increase the risk of gastric cancer. We advocate performing upper endoscopy with sufficient histologic samples in DH.","['Alakoski A', 'Salmi TT', 'Hervonen K', 'Kautiainen H', 'Salo M', 'Kaukinen K', 'Reunala T', 'Collin P']",2012,2012,,Clin Dev Immunol,"Alakoski A, et al.

22580504,[Retrospective evaluation of the ten-year experience of a single coeliac centre].,"UNLABELLED: Coeliac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy, sprue) is a chrocic disorder of the small bowel leading to malabsorption.
AIMS: charts of all patients with coeliac disease treated at the 2nd Department of Medicine, Semmelweis University were evaluated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively analysed the results of a total of 132 patients with coeliac disease (107 females and 25 males; mean age, 37 years; median, 35 years; range, 19-78 years) attending the centre between 1999 and 2010. The authors routinely performed the following investigations in patients with suspected coeliac disease: multiple biopsies taken from the duodenum, tissue transglutaminase antibody or endomysial antibody based serology, body mass index calculation, osteodensitometry, evaluation of disorders associated with coeliac disease, family history for coeliac disease, and implementation of family-screening for coeliac disease given the agreement of the index patients.
RESULTS: Histological samples were available in 101 cases, and distributions of data according to the Marsh-classification were as follows: negative in 9%, M3a in 27%, M3b in 18%, and M3c in 46% of cases, respectively. Serological results were available in 117 cases. 93/117 (79%) showed seropositivity. Body mass index was calculated for 95 patients, and the mean value for males was 22.4 kg/m² (range, 17-30.3 kg/m²), whereas the mean value for females was 20.7 kg/m² (range, 15.2-30.4 kg/m²). Osteodensitometry was performed in 90 patients; 45 patients (50%) proved normal, 31 (34%) had osteopenia, and 15 (26%) had osteoporosis. Coeliac disease associated disorders were present in 45/132 patients (34%; 6 males). Associated disorders were as follows: 15 dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, 15 thyroid diseases (5 hypo- and 10 hyperthyroidism), 6 Crohn's disease, 3 selective IgA-deficiency, 2 endometrioses, 1 systemic lupus erythematosus, 1 myasthenia gravis, and 1 type-1 diabetes mellitus. Sixty-four of the 132 index patients brought 133 first-degree relatives for family screening (serology), where 26/133 (19.5%; 17 females) first-degree relatives proved to suffer from coeliac disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The age distribution of this cohort demonstrates that coeliac disease can present at any age. Similarly to those of other coeliac disease centres, female predominance is significant. Histology usually showed advanced villous atrophy. Serological results were usually in conjunction with the histological results and proved to be useful for monitoring dietary compliance and for accomplishing family screening. The mean body mass index values were in the normal range confirming that adult patients with coeliac disease are usually not malnourished. The 20% prevalence of coeliac disease among first-degree relatives underlines the necessity of family screening.","['Juhász M', 'Kocsis D', 'Zágoni T', 'Miheller P', 'Herszényi L', 'Tulassay Z']",2012,153,20,Orv Hetil,"Juhász M, et al.

22572887,Animal models to study gluten sensitivity.,"The initial development and maintenance of tolerance to dietary antigens is a complex process that, when prevented or interrupted, can lead to human disease. Understanding the mechanisms by which tolerance to specific dietary antigens is attained and maintained is crucial to our understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases related to intolerance of specific dietary antigens. Two diseases that are the result of intolerance to a dietary antigen are celiac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Both of these diseases are dependent upon the ingestion of gluten (the protein fraction of wheat, rye, and barley) and manifest in the gastrointestinal tract and skin, respectively. These gluten-sensitive diseases are two examples of how devastating abnormal immune responses to a ubiquitous food can be. The well-recognized risk genotype for both is conferred by either of the HLA class II molecules DQ2 or DQ8. However, only a minority of individuals who carry these molecules will develop either disease. Also of interest is that the age at diagnosis can range from infancy to 70-80 years of age. This would indicate that intolerance to gluten may potentially be the result of two different phenomena. The first would be that, for various reasons, tolerance to gluten never developed in certain individuals, but that for other individuals, prior tolerance to gluten was lost at some point after childhood. Of recent interest is the concept of non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which manifests as chronic digestive or neurologic symptoms due to gluten, but through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. This review will address how animal models of gluten-sensitive disorders have substantially contributed to a better understanding of how gluten intolerance can arise and cause disease.","['Marietta EV', 'Murray JA']",2012,34,4,Semin Immunopathol,Marietta EV and Murray JA.

That can affect any organ or system, with a wide range of clinical manifestations of variable severity"". Thus, in recent years, clinical picture of celiac disease has changed the old paradigm--bowel disease with villous atrophy and malnutrition, being replaced with the new paradigm--multi-organ autoimmune disease, affecting many organs and systems throughout but with more less specific symptoms, which undiagnosed leads to delayed diagnosis, at a late-onset disease and long-term major complications as the risk of cancer. According to this consensus ""the serological diagnosis of celiac disease is based on high sensitivity and specificity tests"", but in line with changing clinical features of celiac disease, its diagnosis has undergone significant changes in recent years.

Altogether, sera from 80 Slavic individuals were examined. There were negligible differences between cutoff points obtained by the ELISAs manufacturer and those in this study. There were statistically significant correlations between levels of anti-tTG/anti-npG IgA in both DH group and the group of IgA/neutrophil-mediated non-DH dermatoses. There was no such correlation in healthy controls. It seems that IgA autoantibodies to tTG and npG in the IgA/neutrophil-mediated DH are produced in the coordinated way implying their causal relationship.","['Gornowicz-Porowska J', 'Bowszyc-Dmochowska M', 'Seraszek-Jaros A', 'Kaczmarek E', 'Dmochowski M']",2012,2012,,ScientificWorldJournal,"Gornowicz-Porowska J, et al.

22516148,Increased prevalence of transglutaminase 6 antibodies in sera from schizophrenia patients.,"Gluten can cause extraintestinal manifestations with or without gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated antitissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) autoantibodies. Organ-specific gluten reaction involves immune response toward other transglutaminase (TG) isoforms including tTG3 (expressed in the skin, leading to dermatitis herpetiformis) and tTG6 (expressed in the brain, causing gluten ataxia). This analysis focuses on tTG6 antibodies, which have never been studied before in schizophrenia (SZ) and its relationships to tTG2 and to antigliadin antibodies. We previously showed an increased prevalence of tTG2 antibodies in gluten sensitive SZ patients compared with healthy controls (HC) that was not paralleled by an increased prevalence of antiendomysial antibody. To elucidate this discrepancy, we examined those tTG2 positive SZ patients for the presence of tTG6 antibody. We also searched for tTG6 antibodies in our sample of antigliadin (AGA) positive and AGA and tTG2 negative SZ patients. Seventy-four tTG2 positive SZ patients were compared with 148 age and gender-matched HC. Of the 74 tTG2 positive SZ patients, 16 were positive for tTG6 IgA for a prevalence of 22%. Only 4 HC were positive for tTG6 IgA for a prevalence of 2.7%. Among the AGA positive SZ patients, the prevalence of tTG6 IgA was 21.3% while 13.1% of the AGA and tTG2 negative SZ patients were positive for tTG6 IgA. The HC had a prevalence of 6%.

However, direct immunofluorescence studies demonstrated IgG and C3 linear deposition along the basement membrane zone, compatible with bullous pemphigoid.

22379467,Untreated celiac disease in a patient with dermatitis herpetiformis leading to a small bowel carcinoma.,"Usually, celiac disease has a benign course, though the overall morbidity and mortality have increased. Treatment with a gluten-free diet restores the damaged intestinal mucosa. In rare cases a small bowel adenocarcinoma develops. Unfortunately, the clinical presentation is not always recognized and prognosis is bad. We present a 69-year-old man with a history of dermatitis herpetiformis who presented to our tertiary center for a second opinion for a suspected gastric motility disorder. This diagnosis was based on the combination of upper abdominal pain for over 2 years and repetitive episodes of vomiting. Immediately after referral, celiac disease was diagnosed and a gluten-free diet was started. In the next half year of follow-up, additional anemia and weight loss developed and eventually a small bowel adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. Revision of a small bowel follow-through, which had been performed 2 years earlier, showed that the tube had been positioned just distal from the process. Therefore, this diagnosis had not been made at that time. Unfortunately, curative therapy was not possible and the patient died a few months later. In conclusion, all patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have a gluten-sensitive enteropathy and should be treated with a gluten-free diet. Next to this it is important to notice that patients with celiac disease have an increased risk of developing a small bowel malignancy. Unexplained upper abdominal pain, weight loss and anemia should lead to additional investigations to exclude a small bowel malignancy in these patients. At last, the diagnosis of a small bowel carcinoma is difficult. Together with the radiologist, the optimal techniques for visualization of this malignancy should be considered.","['Derikx MH', 'Bisseling TM']",2012,6,1,Case Rep Gastroenterol,Derikx MH and Bisseling TM.

22345659,The Oslo definitions for coeliac disease and related terms.,"OBJECTIVE: The literature suggests a lack of consensus on the use of terms related to coeliac disease (CD) and gluten.
DESIGN: A multidisciplinary task force of 16 physicians from seven countries used the electronic database PubMed to review the literature for CD-related terms up to January 2011. Teams of physicians then suggested a definition for each term, followed by feedback of these definitions through a web survey on definitions, discussions during a meeting in Oslo and phone conferences. In addition to 'CD', the following descriptors of CD were evaluated (in alphabetical order): asymptomatic, atypical, classical, latent, non-classical, overt, paediatric classical, potential, refractory, silent, subclinical, symptomatic, typical, CD serology, CD autoimmunity, genetically at risk of CD, dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten, gluten ataxia, gluten intolerance, gluten sensitivity and gliadin-specific antibodies.
RESULTS: CD was defined as 'a chronic small intestinal immune-mediated enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals'. Classical CD was defined as 'CD presenting with signs and symptoms of malabsorption. Diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, weight loss or growth failure is required.' 'Gluten-related disorders' is the suggested umbrella term for all diseases triggered by gluten and the term gluten intolerance should not to be used. Other definitions are presented in the paper.
CONCLUSION: This paper presents the Oslo definitions for CD-related terms.","['Ludvigsson JF', 'Leffler DA', 'Bai JC', 'Biagi F', 'Fasano A', 'Green PH', 'Hadjivassiliou M', 'Kaukinen K', 'Kelly CP', 'Leonard JN', 'Lundin KE', 'Murray JA', 'Sanders DS', 'Walker MM', 'Zingone F', 'Ciacci C']",2013,62,1,Gut,"Ludvigsson JF, et al.

22343786,Incidence and presentation of reported coeliac disease in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan: the next 10 years.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a continued increase in the incidence of coeliac disease (CD) in the population of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan between 1996 and 2005 compared with previous data for 1981-1995, and to describe the presenting features during this time.
DESIGN: Retrospective case-finding study using pathology, dietetic and clinical records held in hospitals and general practice within Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. All local consultants including those at private hospitals were contacted. Incidence rates were calculated using the Welsh Assembly Government's mid-year estimates.
RESULTS: In total, 347 newly diagnosed cases of CD (42 children, 305 adults) were detected. Compared with previous published data, incidence rates in adults per 100 000 have increased from 3.08 at the end of 1995 to 11.13 in 2005. In children, the disease incidence has trebled to 6.89 per 100 000. There have been some changes in presenting symptoms, with a marked preponderance of abdominal pain and bloating in women (P<0.05). There has been a 14-fold increase in the numbers of patients undergoing coeliac serology testing from 1996 to 2005, associated with an increased absolute number of new cases. However, the proportion of new cases diagnosed compared with numbers of serological tests performed decreased from 5.8 to 1.1%.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of CD in children and adults has markedly increased. One of the most striking features of our data in adult CD is the increasing frequency of abdominal pain and bloating in the female cohort. Incorporation of antibody testing into clinical guidelines is likely to result in a wider spectrum of individuals with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms being investigated and diagnosed with CD in the future.","['Hurley JJ', 'Lee B', 'Turner JK', 'Beale A', 'Jenkins HR', 'Swift GL']",2012,24,5,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Hurley JJ, et al.

22313950,Spectrum of gluten-related disorders: consensus on new nomenclature and classification.,"A decade ago celiac disease was considered extremely rare outside Europe and, therefore, was almost completely ignored by health care professionals. In only 10 years, key milestones have moved celiac disease from obscurity into the popular spotlight worldwide. Now we are observing another interesting phenomenon that is generating great confusion among health care professionals. The number of individuals embracing a gluten-free diet (GFD) appears much higher than the projected number of celiac disease patients, fueling a global market of gluten-free products approaching $2.5 billion (US) in global sales in 2010. This trend is supported by the notion that, along with celiac disease, other conditions related to the ingestion of gluten have emerged as health care concerns. This review will summarize our current knowledge about the three main forms of gluten reactions: allergic (wheat allergy), autoimmune (celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten ataxia) and possibly immune-mediated (gluten sensitivity), and also outline pathogenic, clinical and epidemiological differences and propose new nomenclature and classifications.","['Sapone A', 'Bai JC', 'Ciacci C', 'Dolinsek J', 'Green PH', 'Hadjivassiliou M', 'Kaukinen K', 'Rostami K', 'Sanders DS', 'Schumann M', 'Ullrich R', 'Villalta D', 'Volta U', 'Catassi C', 'Fasano A']",2012,10,,BMC Med,"Sapone A, et al.

22288441,The long-term risk of malignancy following a diagnosis of coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis: a cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: People with coeliac disease are known to be at increased risk of malignancy; however, long-term risks of malignancy beyond 10-15 years are largely unstudied.
AIM: To estimate how long an increased risk of malignancy among coeliac disease patients persists following diagnosis and treatment, using data from a cohort with an average follow-up of 25 years.
METHODS: People with coeliac disease diagnosed in the Lothian region of Scotland, United Kingdom, were followed up from January 1970 or the date of coeliac disease diagnosis (whichever was later) until the first occurrence of death, emigration, cancer diagnosis or the end of 2004. Standardised incidence ratios were calculated to compare the cancer incidence rates among this group with those from the population of Scotland.
RESULTS: Overall, the risk of any malignancy in coeliac disease patients compared with the general population was increased 40% [standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.41; 95% CI 1.09-1.78]. An increased risk for cancer overall persisted for up to 15 years, beyond which no overall increase in malignancy risk was observed, although the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma remained raised beyond 15 years (SIR = 5.15; 95% CI 1.40-13.2). In total, there were 14 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the cohort, providing an overall incidence of 1.3 per 1000 person-years.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall risk of malignancy in coeliac patients declines with time after diagnosis and is not significantly increased after 15 years. Most of the increased risk can be attributed to the development of haematological malignancies, despite their very low absolute rate of occurrence.","['Grainge MJ', 'West J', 'Solaymani-Dodaran M', 'Card TR', 'Logan RF']",2012,35,6,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,"Grainge MJ, et al.

22272909,Interactions between inflammation and coagulation in autoimmune and immune-mediated skin diseases.,"Inflammation and coagulation systems are simultaneously activated in autoimmune and immune-mediated skin disorders, and the cross-talk that amplifies and maintains their activation seems to have both local and systemic implications. This interplay occurs in bullous pemphigoid (BP), the prototype autoimmune blistering disease in which eosinophil recruitment and thrombin generation locally contribute to the formation of bullae and inflammatory tissue damage. Moreover, the systemic activation of coagulation may explain the increased thrombotic risk observed in BP patients. Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronically relapsing immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, also involves the local and systemic activation of coagulation, which means that a prothrombotic state could theoretically develop, although the incidence of thrombosis is not increased in AD patients probably because of their young age. In psoriasis, a erythematous-squamous inflammatory immune-mediated skin disorder, the activation of coagulation seems to be mainly systemic and related to systemic inflammation, thus potentially contributing to the disease-related increase in cardiovascular risk in this disease. The activation of coagulation has also been suggested an additional pathomechanism in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a chronic-relapsing autoimmune skin disease associated with gluten sensitivity and celiac disease, but its precise role has not yet been defined. Taken together, these data provide the rationale for controlled clinical trials aimed at evaluating the usefulness of anticoagulant treatment in autoimmune skin disorders to counteract the local and systemic effects of coagulation activation.","['Marzano AV', 'Tedeschi A', 'Polloni I', 'Crosti C', 'Cugno M']",2012,10,5,Curr Vasc Pharmacol,"Marzano AV, et al.

22264139,A case of recurrent impetigo herpetiformis treated with systemic corticosteroids and narrowband UVB.,"Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare pustular eruption with usual onset during the third trimester of pregnancy. The disease tends to remit after delivery, but may recur in subsequent pregnancies. Here we present a recurrent case of impetigo herpetiformis with earlier onset and poor response to corticosteroids in the subsequent pregnancy. She had widespread, erythematosquamous patches with tiny superficial pustules in the third trimester of her first pregnancy. Histopathological and clinical findings were consistent with impetigo herpetiformis. She was treated with systemic prednisolone and had a healthy baby without any complication. Three years later, the patient presented with impetigo herpetiformis again in the second trimester of her second pregnancy. After six weeks of oral prednisolone treatment, the lesions improved, but there were still new pustule formations and narrowband ultraviolet B treatment was added. Skin eruption cleared and she had a healthy baby in the 38th week of her second pregnancy. The corticosteroid dose was tapered gradually and stopped after delivery. Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial in impetigo herpetiformis because of the risk of maternal and fetal complications. When prednisolone is not enough to control the eruption alone, narrowband UVB can safely be added to the treatment.","['Bozdag K', 'Ozturk S', 'Ermete M']",2012,31,1,Cutan Ocul Toxicol,"Bozdag K, et al.

22237879,"Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity: when gluten free is not a fad.","As the gluten-free diet (GFD) gains in popularity with the general public, health practitioners are beginning to question its real health benefits. For those patients with celiac disease (CD), the GFD is considered medical nutrition therapy, as well as the only proven treatment that results in improvements in symptomatology and small bowel histology. Those with wheat allergy also benefit from the GFD, although these patients often do not need to restrict rye, barley, and oats from their diet. Gluten sensitivity is a controversial subject, where patients who have neither CD nor wheat allergy have varying degrees of symptomatic improvement on the GFD. Conditions in this category include dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and neurologic diseases such as gluten-sensitive ataxia and autism. It is important for patients and healthcare practitioners to understand the differences between these conditions, even though they may all respond to a GFD. Patients with CD can experience comorbid nutrition deficiencies and are at higher risk for the development of cancers and other autoimmune conditions. Those with wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity are thought not to be at higher risk for these complications. Defining the symptoms and biochemical markers for gluten-sensitive conditions is an important area for future investigations, and high-quality, large-scale randomized trials are needed to prove the true benefits of the GFD in this evolving field.",['Pietzak M'],2012,36,1 Suppl,JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr,"Pietzak M.

22214930,Recognition of epidermal transglutaminase by IgA and tissue transglutaminase 2 antibodies in a rare case of Rhesus dermatitis.,"Tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) is an intestinal digestive enzyme which deamidates already partially digested dietary gluten e.g. gliadin peptides. In genetically predisposed individuals, tTG2 triggers autoimmune responses that are characterized by the production of tTG2 antibodies and their direct deposition into small intestinal wall. The presence of such antibodies constitutes one of the major hallmarks of the celiac disease (CD). Epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) is another member of the transglutaminase family that can also function as an autoantigen in a small minority of CD patients. In these relatively rare cases, eTG triggers an autoimmune reaction (a skin rash) clinically known as dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Although the exact mechanism of CD and DH pathogenesis is not well understood, it is known that tTG2 and eTG share antigenic epitopes that can be recognized by serum antibodies from both CD and DH patients. In this study, the confocal microscopy examination of biopsy samples from skin lesions of two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with dermatitis (Table 1, Fig. 1 and 2) was used to study the affected tissues. In one animal (EM96) a spectral overlap of IgA and tTG2 antibodies (Fig. 3) was demonstrated. The presence of double-positive tTG2+IgA+ cells was focused in the deep epidermis, around the dermal papillae. This is consistent with lesions described in DH patients. When EM96 was placed on a gluten-free diet, the dermatitis, as well as tTG2+IgA+ deposits disappeared and were no longer detectable (Figs. 1-3). Dermatitis reappeared however, based on re-introduction of dietary gluten in EM96 (not shown). In other macaques including animal with unrelated dermatitis, the tTG2+IgA+ deposits were not detected. Gluten-free diet-dependent remission of dermatitis in EM96 together with presence of tTG2+IgA+ cells in its skin suggest an autoimmune, DH-like mechanism for the development of this condition. This is the first report of DH-like dermatitis in any non-human primate.","['Sestak K', 'Mazumdar K', 'Midkiff CC', 'Dufour J', 'Borda JT', 'Alvarez X']",2011,,58,J Vis Exp,"Sestak K, et al.

22207426,Evaluation of clinical and histopathologic/direct immunofluorescence diagnosis in autoimmune vesiculobullous dermatitis: utility of direct immunofluorescence.,"OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune bullous diseases are heterogeneous diseases and the differentiation between the various bullous disease is important for treatment and prognosis. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy is still the gold standard in differentiating these diseases. Our aim was to determine the diagnostic accordance between clinical and histopathological/direct immunofluorescence diagnosis of patients with autoimmune vesicolulobullous skin diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 197 cases with clinical diagnosis of vesiculobullous dermatitis was included in the study. The slides stained with H&E were retrospectively re-evaluated for histopathological diagnosis, and had already been evaluated with direct immunofluorescence microscopy. Data were analyzed using the Scientific Package for Social Sciences software. Results were evaluated using Kappa statistics.
RESULTS: The clinical and histopathological/direct immunofluorescence accordance for cases ranged from 0% to 100% (Kappa value=0.29). The accordance was 58.8% in pemphigus vulgaris, 53.8% in pemphigus foliaceus, 37.9% in bullous pemphigoid and, 5.2% in dermatitis herpetiformis. Cases of limited numbers in our study were linear IgA bullous dermatitis in 2 cases, Grover's disease in 1 case, epidermolysis bullosa acquisata in 5 cases and, Hailey-Hailey disease in 1 case. The percentages of accordance in these cases were 50%, 100%, 40% and, 0%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The accordance was good in pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus and bullous pemphigoid, but low in dermatitis herpetiformis. Based on our results, we recommend direct immunofluorescence microscopy to be added to light microscopy for the definitive diagnosis of autoimmune blistering disease.

22182376,Spectrum of autoimmune bullous diseases in Iran: a 10-year review.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune bullous diseases (ABDs) are potentially devastating bullous dermatoses of the skin and mucosae characterized by the presence of tissue-bound and circulating antibodies directed against disease-specific target antigens. These diseases comprise two major subgroups of subepidermal autoimmune bullous disorders and pemphigus, based on the level of blister formation. Although they occur worldwide, the relative frequencies of different ABDs show wide geographical variation. Most epidemiological studies on ABDs have focused on single diseases or a group of diseases; published surveys studying the whole spectrum of diseases are scarce.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the relative frequencies of different ABDs in patients presenting to the Bullous Diseases Research Center, Tehran, Iran.
METHODS: Medical files for all newly diagnosed patients with ABD presenting to the Center between March 1997 and February 2006 were examined. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were not included.
RESULTS: A total of 1402 patients were diagnosed with ABD during the study period. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) was the most common ABD (81.2%), followed by bullous pemphigoid (BP) (11.6%), pemphigus foliaceus (PF) (4.4%), pemphigoid gestationis (0.7%), mucous membrane pemphigoid (0.7%), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (0.5%), linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) disease (0.4%), paraneoplastic pemphigus (0.2%), IgA pemphigus (0.2%), and pemphigus erythematosus (0.1%). The mean age at diagnosis and male : female ratio were 43.4 years and 1 : 1.39, 42.2 years and 1 : 1.34, and 59.4 years and 1 : 1.36 for PV, BP, and PF, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Pemphigus vulgaris was the most frequent ABD according to our study; cases of PV outnumbered those of BP by a ratio of almost 8 : 1. This finding contrasts with those of studies conducted in Western European countries, in which BP predominates. There was a female predominance in most subtypes of ABD. Mean age at onset of PV and BP was lower than in Europe. In view of its large population of PV patients, Iran should be considered a suitable field for future clinical trials.","['Daneshpazhooh M', 'Chams-Davatchi C', 'Payandemehr P', 'Nassiri S', 'Valikhani M', 'Safai-Naraghi Z']",2012,51,1,Int J Dermatol,"Daneshpazhooh M, et al.

Although these disorders share some common features, each disease is unique in its clinical presentation, histopathology, and immunofluorescence patterns, which allows for accurate diagnosis and disease-specific treatment strategy. Treatment of these disorders is complex and requires expert knowledge of disease pathogenesis. We review common treatment approaches for each of these disorders.","['Culton DA', 'Diaz LA']",2012,30,1,Clin Dermatol,Culton DA and Diaz LA. Treatment of subepidermal immunobullous diseases.

22137227,Dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic, polymorphic, pruritic skin disease that develops mostly in patients with latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy. DH patients usually present with skin manifestations only and are not aware of the underlying small-bowel problems. Owing to the granular immunoglobulin (Ig) A deposition at the tips of the papillary dermis and to the subepidermal blister formation associated with neutrophilic accumulations underlying the basement membrane, DH is considered to be an autoimmune blistering disease. Contrary to the other bullous disorders, DH patients have no circulating autoantibodies binding to the cutaneous basement membrane components or to other adherent structures of the skin, but they have gluten-induced IgA autoantibodies against transglutaminase (TG) 2 and TG3. The serum IgA against tissue TG2 is a most specific and sensitive serologic marker of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and is equivalent to the perviously described IgA endomysium antibodies. DH could be a cutaneous IgA-epidermal TG3 immunocomplex disease, developing only in a few patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy as a second gluten-dependent disease. The main treatment of DH today is a strict, life-long gluten-free diet. Untreated DH patients should be regularly monitored for malabsorption and lymphomas. Associated autoimmune diseases are more common among DH patients. Family screening for gluten sensitivity is also strongly suggested.",['Kárpáti S'],2012,30,1,Clin Dermatol,Kárpáti S.

The initial histologic diagnosis was invasive squamous cell carcinoma. On follow-up, the patient developed lymphangitic tumor spread in the right leg, associated with right inguinal lymphadenopathy and lesions in vulva and flank. Reevaluation of the toe lesion led to a revised diagnosis of eccrine porocarcinoma.

22106118,Leukocytoclastic vasculitis as the presenting feature of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis is an autoimmune disease typically characterized by pruritic vesicles located on the extensor surfaces. Classic disease consists of neutrophils in the dermal papillae. Additional histopathologic findings include fibrin deposition and edema within the dermal papillae. Subepidermal vesicles also may be present. Direct immunofluorescence demonstrates granular IgA in the dermal papillae.
OBSERVATIONS: A 58-year-old man with tender and pruritic erythematous macules and papules ranging from 2 to 6 mm in diameter had bilateral knee, elbow, forearm, scalp, and neck involvement. Petechiae also were present on the hands, thigh, knee, and ankle. A biopsy specimen initially demonstrated leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The results of workup for systemic vasculitis were negative. Subsequent biopsy specimens and direct immunofluorescence showed histologic evidence of dermatitis herpetiformis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis in the setting of an elevated serum IgA antitissue transglutaminase level. Marked improvement of the lesions was observed with a reduction of gluten in the patient's diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should consider the possibility of dermatitis herpetiformis in patients with petechiae and leukocytoclastic vasculitis because leukocytoclastic vasculitis may be a prominent feature of dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Naylor E', 'Atwater A', 'Selim MA', 'Hall R', 'Puri PK']",2011,147,11,Arch Dermatol,"Naylor E, et al.

22106117,IgA anti-p200 pemphigoid.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-p200 pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune subepidermal blistering disorder. Clinically, it may resemble bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, or dermatitis herpetiformis. Immunologically, anti-p200 pemphigoid is characterized by the development of IgG antibodies directed against a basement membrane zone protein with a molecular weight of 200 kDa.
OBSERVATIONS: We report the first case, to our knowledge, of anti-p200 pemphigoid associated with IgA antibodies and having clinical features resembling pemphigus herpetiformis or dermatitis herpetiformis localized on traumatized areas. Histopathological examination of lesional skin showed dermal-epidermal separation and microabscesses composed of neutrophils in the dermal papillae. Direct immunofluorescence disclosed the presence exclusively of linear in vivo-bound IgA along the basement membrane zone. With the use of laser scanning confocal microscopy, in vivo-bound IgA was localized above collagen type IV and colocalized with laminin 332. Indirect immunofluorescence showed circulating IgA antibodies against basement membrane zone at a titer of 1:160 that reacted with the floor of an artificial blister of salt-split skin. Western immunoblot analysis using dermal extract confirmed the reactivity of circulating IgA antibodies with the 200-kDa antigen corresponding to laminin γ1; however, immunoblotting using recombinant protein of 107 amino acid C-terminus of laminin γ1 was negative for circulating IgA antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy disclosed the reactivity of circulating IgA autoantibodies within the lower lamina lucida.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case fulfilling the immunopathological criteria for anti-p200 pemphigoid associated with IgA antibodies and having unusual clinical features.","['Wozniak K', 'Hashimoto T', 'Fukuda S', 'Ohyama B', 'Ishii N', 'Koga H', 'Dainichi T', 'Kowalewski C']",2011,147,11,Arch Dermatol,"Wozniak K, et al.

22095181,A case of bullous pemphigoid in infancy treated with local corticosteroids.,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an immune-mediated subepidermal vesiculobullous eruption, whose true incidence is unknown, but it is considered extremely rare in children, with a usually indolent course and rare relapses. Diagnosis is often belated, because of the invasive assessment with biopsy for typical immune-pathologic findings to differentiate it from Dermatitis Herpetiformis and Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), more common in children. A 4-year-old girl presented with one year history of erythematous-edematous and erythematous-bullous eruptions on the genitalia, periocular regions, dorsal and palmo-plantar surfaces. At onset erosions of the month and lips where considered a primary herpes simplex infection from the pediatrician, but repeated courses of systemic antivirals were completely ineffective, while application of a antibiotic-steroidal cream was of partial benefit. Histopathology showed a dermo-epidermal blistering, with a marked eosinophilic infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence showed a characteristic positive linear IgG and C3 band at the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Complete hematic-chemical and instrumental examinations gave normal results, excluding associated pathologies. Due to paucity of lesions and good response to local treatment with moderate potency cortisones, in agreement with the parents, no systemic therapy was started. No recurrence occurred in the 2 year follow-up after complete remission. The case is reported for the rarity of the childhood form, and the importance of the differential diagnosis for management and treatment. Good response to topical treatment is stressed, avoiding the risks of long-term systemic drug administration.","['Atzori L', 'Pau M', 'Podda R', 'Manieli C', 'Aste N']",2011,146,6,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Atzori L, et al.

22041881,Ritodrine-induced pustular eruptions distinctly resembling impetigo herpetiformis.,"A 27-year-old nulligravida woman without a history of dermatosis was hospitalized for threatened preterm labor at 29 weeks' gestation; therefore, continuous infusion of ritodrine hydrochloride was started. At 31 weeks' gestation, erythematous plaques appeared and spread over the body surface; therefore, a topical steroid preparation was applied. At 32 weeks' gestation, the eruptions developed into irregular annular areas of erythema with multiple pustules accompanied by severe itching, and oral prednisolone treatment was started. Bacterial cultures of the pustules were negative, and a crural cutaneous biopsy revealed Kogoj's spongiform pustules. Based on the clinicopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis was impetigo herpetiformis, which causes cutaneous symptoms closely resembling pustular psoriasis in pregnant females without a history of psoriasis. To rule out ritodrine-induced pustular eruptions, the ritodrine infusion was stopped and treatment with an MgSO(4) preparation was started at 33 weeks' 3 days' gestation; however, the uterine contractions could not be suppressed. Because of the patient's highly edematous, severely painful feet, a cesarean section was performed the same day. Within several days of delivery, the eruptions began to resolve, and no recurrence was observed after treatment with oral prednisolone was stopped 31 days after delivery. On the basis of a positive patch test for ritodrine, we diagnosed pustular drug eruptions caused by ritodrine hydrochloride. Although ritodrine-induced pathognomonic cutaneous eruptions are rare, we would like to emphasize that ritodrine can cause drug-induced pustular eruptions distinctly resembling life-threatening impetigo herpetiformis.","['Kuwabara Y', 'Sato A', 'Abe H', 'Abe S', 'Kawai N', 'Takeshita T']",2011,78,5,J Nippon Med Sch,"Kuwabara Y, et al.

22032403,Dermatitis herpetiformis in China: a report of 22 cases.,"BACKGROUND: Although dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a relatively common disease in Caucasian populations, it is very rare in the Far East, including China.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical, histological and immunopathological characteristics of Chinese patients with DH.
METHODS: The clinical data and serum samples of patients with DH diagnosed at Shandong Provincial Institute of Dermatology and Venereology from 2006 to 2010 were collected. Anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies were tested using indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay respectively. Biopsies of small intestine were performed in those patients who had given informed consent.
RESULTS: The study group consisted of 22 patients with DH. The male to female ratio was 2.1:1; the average age was 44 years. Five patients reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Dapsone was used to treat 14 patients, who achieved rapid relief. Direct immunofluorescence showed granular IgA deposits at the papillary tips and/or basement membrane zone in 95.5% (21/22) patients. Fibrillar IgA deposition limited to the papillary tips was also seen in one patient (4.5%). IgA antibodies against EMA and tTG were found in 50% (8/16) and 62.5% (10/16) of patient sera respectively. Small-intestinal biopsies of two patients confirmed the presence of coeliac disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical, histological and immunopathological characteristics of Chinese patients with DH are similar to those seen in Caucasian populations. The positive rates of anti-EMA and anti-tTG antibodies were lower compared with those seen in Western countries. DH is not extremely rare in China and should be actively investigated.","['Zhang F', 'Yang B', 'Lin Y', 'Chen S', 'Zhou G', 'Wang G', 'Chen X', 'Zhang Y', 'Tian H', 'Yu M', 'Shi Z', 'Zhang D']",2012,26,7,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Zhang F, et al.

21959324,Do gastroenterologists adhere to diagnostic and treatment guidelines for celiac disease?,"AIM: Our group hypothesized that significant variation exists between suggested clinical guidelines, the clinical practices of practicing gastroenterologists and academic experts in celiac disease (CD).
METHOD: We designed 4 CD vignettes comparing experts and practicing gastroenterologists. Practicing gastroenterologists (n=169) were surveyed during Digestive Disease Week 2009 and experts (n=22) answered e-mail surveys. Ratings for answers in each vignette was done using a 9-point RAND Appropriateness Scale (RAS) with endorsement defined as RAS score of 7 to 9. We also calculated the RAND ""Disagreement Index"" (DI) was calculated, with DI>1.0 indicated extreme variation.
RESULTS: A total of 169 practicing gastroenterologists and 22 experts were included. Differences in all vignette answers were present. Differences were seen for use of IgA anti-endomysial antibodies (P=0.0241), human leukocyte antigen DQ2/8 testing (P=0.0325), gluten challenge (P<0.0001), and oat consumption (P<0.0001). There were differences in recommendations for biopsy review (P=0.0479) and management of dermatitis herpetiformis (P=0.0025). Experts consistently endorsed CD screening in patients with type 1 diabetes, Down and Turner syndromes, and relatives of CD patients compared with practicing physicians (P=0.0054, 0.0003, <0.0001, 0.0304). Experts endorsed CD screening for atypical presentations (delayed puberty, elevated transaminases, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, and infertility).

21955378,Autoimmune bullous skin diseases. Part 1: Clinical manifestations.,"Autoimmune bullous skin diseases are characterized by autoantibodies against adhesion molecules of the skin. Pemphigus is a disorder with an intraepidermal loss of adhesion and is characterized by fragile blisters and erosions. Pemphigus vulgaris often shows extensive lesions of the oral mucosa, while pemphigus foliaceus is commonly restricted to cutaneous involvement with puff pastry-like scale formation. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is obligatorily associated with malignancies and often presents as hemorrhagic stomatitis with multiforme-like exanthems. IgA pemphigus typically presents with pustules and annular plaques but not with mucosal involvement. The clinical spectrum of the pemphigoids includes tense blisters, urticarial plaques, and prurigo- like eczematous lesions. Pemphigoid gestationis mostly occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy and mucous membrane pemphigoid primarily involves the oral mucosa and conjunctivae and leads to scarring. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis manifests with tense blisters in a ""cluster of jewels""-like pattern in childhood and is more heterogeneous in adulthood. Classical epidermolysis bullosa acquisita shows extensive skin fragility. Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy and manifests clinically with severe itching and papulovesicles on the extensor surfaces of the extremities and the lumbosacral area. The intention of the review is to demonstrate the heterogeneous clinical spectrum of autoimmune bullous disorders.","['Kneisel A', 'Hertl M']",2011,9,10,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,Kneisel A and Hertl M.

Recently, a novel serologic assay using deamidated gliadin-analogous fusion peptides (GAF3X) showed high diagnostic sensitivity in patients with CD.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the anti-GAF3X enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to compare it with a panel of classic CD-related serologic tests in patients with DH.
METHODS: Antibodies against nGli, GAF3X, and tTG were determined by separate ELISA tests and against endomysium by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in 45 patients with DH and 52 control patients (30 patients with bullous pemphigoid and 22 patients with linear IgA disease). A total of 24 patients with DH underwent intestinal biopsies to confirm underlying CD.
RESULTS: Antibodies to nGli were detected in 26 (58%) (IgA) and 24 (53%) (IgG), to GAF3X in 38 (84%) (IgA) and 36 (80%) (IgG), to tTG in 35 (78%) (IgA), and to endomysium in 32 (71%) (IgA) patients with DH. Combined testing of IgA and IgG antibodies to GAF3X detected 7 of 10 (70%) IgA-anti-tTG-negative patients with DH and together with the IgA-anti-tTG ELISA showed the highest serologic hit rate (93%) for CD.
LIMITATIONS: Intestinal biopsies were not performed in all patients with DH.
CONCLUSION: The novel anti-GAF3X ELISA shows a higher sensitivity to detect CD-associated autoantibodies in patients with DH compared with tests using nGli, tTG, or endomysium as substrates.","['Kasperkiewicz M', 'Dähnrich C', 'Probst C', 'Komorowski L', 'Stöcker W', 'Schlumberger W', 'Zillikens D', 'Rose C']",2012,66,4,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Kasperkiewicz M, et al.

21755296,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and gluten-sensitive enteropathy: estimate of risk using meta-analyses.,"OBJECTIVES: Gluten-sensitive enteropathy, including coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and particularly enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATCL). We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the association.
METHODS: Fifty-four risk estimates (range 0.28-300) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Potential sources of variation were examined using sensitivity analyses and meta-regression.
RESULTS: Thirty-one estimates with gluten-sensitive enteropathy diagnosed by serology then biopsy, serology alone, or recorded in medical notes accounted for half the variation in risks, giving a pooled estimate of 4.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.72-5.26, I2 = 0%). Men and women had similar pooled risks. Risks were largest when these conditions were diagnosed using biopsy and lowest when self-reported. Study design, comparison population, geography or gluten-sensitive enteropathy type explained less of the variation. EATCL estimates ranged from 6 to 200; an association with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was also observed (pooled risk estimate = 1.97, 95% CI 1.23-3.15).
CONCLUSIONS: Where gluten-sensitive enteropathy was diagnosed using modern techniques, NHL risk was increased fourfold. At this level, one in 2,000 persons with gluten-sensitive enteropathy develops NHL each year. In addition to EATCL, DLBCL and possibly other subtypes may be linked to these conditions, and these weaker associations could be investigated in large population-based cohorts with biological samples.","['Kane EV', 'Newton R', 'Roman E']",2011,22,10,Cancer Causes Control,"Kane EV, et al.

21712975,The diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune blistering skin diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune blistering skin diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with autoantibodies that are directed against desmosomal structural proteins (in pemphigus diseases) or hemidesmosomal ones (in pemphigoid diseases and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita), or else against epidermal/ tissue transglutaminases (in dermatitis herpetiformis). Knowledge of the clinical presentation of these disorders and of the relevant diagnostic procedures is important not just for dermatologists, but also for general practitioners, ophthalmologists, ENT specialists, dentists, gynecologists, and pediatricians.
METHODS: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed. There are no existing guidelines available in Germany.
RESULTS: The recently developed sensitive and specific assays for circulating autoantibodies in these diseases now enable a serological diagnosis in about 90% of cases. The incidence of autoimmune blistering skin diseases in Germany has doubled in the last 10 years, to a current figure of about 25 new cases per million persons per year, because of improved diagnostic techniques as well as the aging of the population. Accurate and specific diagnosis is the prerequisite for reliable prognostication and appropriate treatment. For severe and intractable cases, more effective treatments have recently become available, including immunoadsorption, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, and combinations of the above.
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic assessment of autoimmune blistering skin diseases can be expected to improve in the near future as new serological testing systems are developed that employ recombinant forms of the target antigens. The treatments currently in use still need to be validated by prospective, controlled trials.","['Schmidt E', 'Zillikens D']",2011,108,23,Dtsch Arztebl Int,"Schmidt E and Zillikens D.

21707494,The rationale of targeting neutrophils with dapsone during glioblastoma treatment.,"Data from past research is presented showing that neutrophils are active participants in new vessel formation in normal physiology, in proliferating human endometrium, in non-cancer pathologies as in the pannus of rheumatoid arthritis, and in various cancers, among them glioblastoma. These data show that interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a major chemokine attracting neutrophil infiltrates in these states. Since the old anti-Hansen's disease drug dapsone inhibits neutrophil migration along an IL-8 gradient towards increasing concentrations, and is used therapeutically for this attribute to good effect in dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid and rheumatoid arthritis, we suggest dapsone may deprive glioblastoma of neutrophil-mediated growth promoting effects. We review past research showing that vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, is carried predominantly intracellularly within neutrophils--only 2% of circulating VEGF is found free in serum. Based on the available evidence summarized by the authors, dapsone has a strong theoretical potential to become a useful anti-VEGF, anti-angiogenic agent in glioblastoma treatment.","['Kast RE', 'Scheuerle A', 'Wirtz CR', 'Karpel-Massler G', 'Halatsch ME']",2011,11,8,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,"Kast RE, et al.

21696690,Letter: Pemphigus herpetiformis of age of onset at 6 years.,"INTRODUCTION: Pemphigus herpetiformis is a rare entity that combines the clinical features of dermatitis herpetiformis with the immunologic and histological features of pemphigus. It generally affects adults and pediatric cases are uncommon. We report a case of pemphigus herpetiformis in a 6-year-old girl treated successfully with dapsone.
OBSERVATION: A 6-year-old girl presented with a pruritic, erythematous and vesiculous eruption. Histological examination showed acantholysis of the medial and superficial parts of the epidermis. Direct immunofluorescence study revealed cell surface immunoglobulin G and C3 deposits and staining on the dermo-epidermal junction. The child was diagnosed as having pemphigus herpetiformis.
DISCUSSION: Pemphigus herpetiformis produces clinically a pruritic and atypical eruption that resembles dermatitis herpetiformis, with standard histology and immunofluorescence patterns recalling those of pemphigus. Considered to have a good prognosis, it responds well to dapsone and/or to low dose oral corticosteroids. The age range of onset varies from 31 to 81 years according to studies, without a male or female predilection. This is a report of a 6-year-old girl presenting with pemphigus herpetiformis, successfully treated with dapsone for two years with no relapse.","['Moutran R', 'Maatouk I', 'Stephan F', 'Halaby E', 'Abadjian G', 'Tomb R']",2011,17,6,Dermatol Online J,"Moutran R, et al.

21640850,Autoimmune blistering diseases of the skin.,"Autoimmune skin diseases represent a heterogeneous group of disorders with grossly diverging clinical manifestations but partly shared underlying immunological mechanisms. They may affect the skin as an isolated organ or among systemic diseases. In addition unspecific cutaneous symptoms or drug-induced unwanted effects can be seen and have to be carefully dissected from an exacerbations of the underlying disease. Growing pathogenic knowledge has elucidated serological and clinical pictures heterogeneity and at the same time increased the therapeutic armentarium for these partly life-threatening diseases. In this review, the focus is on autoimmune bullous diseases with the skin as the major target which involve antigens of epidermis, basal membrane or dermis. Among these the pemphigoid and pemphigus group may be differentiated from dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Interestingly, pathogenetically relevant antibody responses of IgA subtype can be found in any of the first three groups. Their clinical picture as well as therapeutic response are distinctly different from the other mainly IgG mediated subsets. Though systemic corticosteroids are still the mainstay of therapy, differential approaches using diverse adjuvant drugs are available. Immunoserological data may help characterize subsets and monitor clinical diseases as well as therapeutic response.","['Sticherling M', 'Erfurt-Berge C']",2012,11,3,Autoimmun Rev,Sticherling M and Erfurt-Berge C.

21619684,Development of an ELISA for sensitive and specific detection of IgA autoantibodies against BP180 in pemphigoid diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Pemphigoids are rare diseases associated with IgG, IgE and IgA autoantibodies against collagen XVII/BP180. An entity of the pemphigoid group is the lamina lucida-type of linear IgA disease (IgA pemphigoid) characterized by IgA autoantibodies against BP180. While for the detection of IgG and IgE autoantibodies specific to collagen XVII several ELISA systems have been established, no quantitative immunoassay has been yet developed for IgA autoantibodies. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop an ELISA to detect IgA autoantibodies against collagen XVII in the sera of patients with pemphigoids.
METHODS: We expressed a soluble recombinant form of the collagen XVII ectodomain in mammalian cells. Reactivity of IgA autoantibodies from patients with IgA pemphigoid was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analysis. ELISA test conditions were determined by chessboard titration experiments. The sensitivity, specificity and the cut-off were determined by receiver-operating characteristics analysis.
RESULTS: The optimized assay was carried out using sera from patients with IgA pemphigoid (n = 30) and healthy donors (n=105). By receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, an area under the curve of 0.993 was calculated, indicating an excellent discriminatory capacity. Thus, a sensitivity and specificity of 83.3% and 100%, respectively, was determined for a cut-off point of 0.48. As additional control groups, sera from patients with bullous pemphigoid (n=31) and dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 50), a disease associated with IgA autoantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase, were tested. In 26% of bullous pemphigoid patients, IgA autoantibodies recognized the ectodomain of collagen XVII. One of 50 (2%) of dermatitis herpetiformis patients sera slightly topped the cut-off value.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed the first ELISA for the specific and sensitive detection of serum IgA autoantibodies specific to collagen XVII in patients with pemphigoids. This immunoassay should prove a useful tool for clinical and translational research and should essentially improve the diagnosis and disease monitoring of patients with IgA pemphigoid. Moreover, our findings strongly suggest that IgA pemphigoid and IgG bullous pemphigoid represent two ends of the clinical spectrum of an immunological loss of tolerance against components of hemidesmosomes, which is mediated by both IgG and IgA autoantibodies.","['Csorba K', 'Schmidt S', 'Florea F', 'Ishii N', 'Hashimoto T', 'Hertl M', 'Kárpáti S', 'Bruckner-Tuderman L', 'Nishie W', 'Sitaru C']",2011,6,,Orphanet J Rare Dis,"Csorba K, et al.

21570155,Can direct immunofluorescence testing still be accurate if performed on biopsy specimens after brief inadvertent immersion in formalin?,"BACKGROUND: Direct immunofluorescence is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune, vesiculobullous, and connective tissue diseases. Michel medium is typically indicated for transport, but clinicians may inadvertently place samples into formalin.
OBJECTIVE: We set out to determine the amount of time that specimens can remain in 10% buffered formalin and still retain their diagnostic properties.
METHODS: Biopsy samples were examined from cases with established diagnoses of bullous pemphigoid (n = 12), dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 6), and pemphigus vulgaris (n = 6) and exposed to formalin for time points ranging from 2 minutes to 4 hours.
RESULTS: We found that immunoreactants were detectable in the majority of samples when subjected to 2 minutes of formalin exposure. Dermatitis herpetiformis and pemphigoid samples retained immunogenicity for 10 minutes, whereas pemphigus showed reduced immunogenicity for all samples studied. A nonimmunologic nuclear fluorochroming pattern was noted in some of the specimens after formalin immersion.
LIMITATIONS: Sample size, only examining 3 disease processes, and samples already having been in Michel medium were the major limitations in the study.
CONCLUSION: In direct immunofluorescence studies, formalin exposure to biopsy specimens causes two types of artifactual changes: (1) the shortest exposure (2 minutes) causes complete loss of diagnostic markers of pemphigus; and (2) prolonged exposure changes tissue to a form that allows fluorescein-labeled antibodies to give fluorochroming reactions of nuclei (which can be mistaken for in vivo antinuclear antibody reactions of lupus erythematosus). After time intervals of 10 minutes to 2 hours, direct immunofluorescence studies of proven cases of bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis retained variable levels of specific reactivity.","['Arbesman J', 'Grover R', 'Helm TN', 'Beutner EH']",2011,65,1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Arbesman J, et al.

21517799,Prevalence and incidence of dermatitis herpetiformis: a 40-year prospective study from Finland.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an external manifestation of coeliac disease presenting with blistering rash and pathognomonic cutaneous IgA deposits. Better knowledge of subclinical forms and serological testing has resulted in a sharp increase in the incidence and prevalence of coeliac disease.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of DH and analyse whether the incidence of DH changed when the occurrence of coeliac disease increased.
METHODS: All 477 patients with DH diagnosed from 1970 onwards at the Tampere University Hospital were analysed for prevalence in 2009. The incidence of DH was calculated in three 10-year periods from the year 1980.
RESULTS: The prevalence of DH was 75·3 per 100,000 which is eight times lower than the prevalence of coeliac disease in our area. The annual incidence of DH in the whole period was 3·5 per 100,000, and in the three 10-year periods 5·2, 2·9 and 2·7 per 100,000, respectively. The decrease in incidence between the first and second 10-year period was significant (P<0·001). The male to female ratio of DH was 1·1:1. The mean age at diagnosis increased significantly during the study, in men from 35·3 to 51·1 years and in women from 36·3 to 45·8 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows the highest prevalence of DH reported to date. Although the overall incidence of DH was also high, a significant decrease occurred in the 1990s, which is in contrast to the incidence of coeliac disease.","['Salmi TT', 'Hervonen K', 'Kautiainen H', 'Collin P', 'Reunala T']",2011,165,2,Br J Dermatol,"Salmi TT, et al.

We evaluated the coagulation activation in patients with BP (63), chronic urticaria (CU; 20), atopic dermatitis (AD; 14), cutaneous drug reactions (CDRs; six), psoriasis (20), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH; four) and primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL; five), and in 40 healthy controls. Prothrombin fragment F1+2 and d-dimer (coagulation markers) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in all plasma samples and BP blister fluid. Skin TF expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in the patients and 20 controls. F1+2 and d-dimer levels were higher in BP plasma than in control plasma (P = 0·0001 for both), and dramatically high in blister fluid; both correlated positively with disease severity, esinophil counts and anti-BP180 antibodies (P = 0·006-0·0001). Plasma F1+2 and d-dimer levels were higher in the CU, AD and CDR patients than in controls (P = 0·0001 for all), but normal in the psoriasis, DH and CTCL patients. Skin TF was expressed in the BP (P = 0·0001), CU (P = 0·0001), AD (P = 0·001) and CDR patients (P = 0·01), but not in the psoriasis, DH or CTCL patients. Co-localization confocal microscopy studies confirmed eosinophils as the source of TF in 10 BP patients. The coagulation cascade is activated in BP and other eosinophil-mediated skin disorders, but not in non-eosinophil driven conditions. This hypercoagulability may contribute to inflammation, tissue damage and, possibly, thrombotic risk.","['Marzano AV', 'Tedeschi A', 'Berti E', 'Fanoni D', 'Crosti C', 'Cugno M']",2011,165,1,Clin Exp Immunol,"Marzano AV, et al.

21462831,IgG-F-actin antibodies in celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Anti-actin antibodies are found in 52-85% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis and in 22% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. In patients with celiac disease, anti-actin antibodies correlate with the degree of villous atrophy. Studies on their involvement in celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis in Romania have not been done. The purpose of this study was to evaluate of the quality of IgG anti-F-actin antibodies (IgG-AAA) tests compared with IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-TgA) having IgA endomysial antibody (IgA-EmA) as gold standard in celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis and to see if there is any relationship between them. The study included 70 pediatric patients with celiac disease under gluten-free diets and 10 adult patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, during 2010. The IgG-AAA antibodies levels were determined by ELISA. Assessing the qualities of IgG-AAA compared to IgA-TgA, we obtained the following values sensitivity (Se) 27.8%, specificity (Sp) 79.4%, respectively Se 88.9%, Sp 79.4% in celiac disease and Se 33.3%, Sp 100%, respectively Se 100%, Sp 100% in dermatitis herpetiformis. Also, there was a prevalence of 24.3% and 30% of IgG-AAA in the two groups of patients, but no statistically significant associations were found. Therefore, we concluded that IgG-AAA can not replace IgA-TgA in children patients with celiac disease under gluten-free diets and in adult patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. AAA-IgG serum activity in both diseases exist, but without a relationship of association with them.","['Samaşca G', 'Băican A', 'Pop T', 'Pîrvan A', 'Miu N', 'Andreica M', 'Cristea V', 'Dejica D']",2010,69,4,Roum Arch Microbiol Immunol,"Samaşca G, et al.

21397152,[Dermatitis herpetiformis: a review].,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare auto-immune bullous disease characterized by its almost constant association to gluten sensitivity.
OBJECTIVE: Review of literature about epidemiology, physiopathology, clinical data and treatment of DH.
METHODS: Research on Medline and Embase database without any time limit until April 2010. Because of the lack of randomized therapeutic trials in DH, retrospective series and case reports have been analyzed.
RESULTS: DH is related to auto-antibodies against epidermal transglutaminase, which belongs to the same family as tissue transglutaminase, the auto-antigen of celiac disease. Physiopathology is complex, occurring in HLA DQ2 or DQ8 predisposed patients, and implies gluten, immunological reaction in the intestinal wall then in the skin. DH and celiac disease may be encountered in the same family. DH is characterized by a very pruritic microvesicular eruption typically located on elbows, knees and buttocks. Digestive manifestations of celiac disease occur in 15% of cases. Direct immunofluorescence is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, showing granular IgA±C3 deposits in the papillary dermis. Circulating IgA and IgG antiendomysium and antitransglutaminase antibodies are detected in almost all patients at the acute phase and follow the clinical course of the disease. Gastro-intestinal endoscopy with multiple duodenal biopsies shows partial or complete villous atrophy in two thirds of cases, intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltrate in the other cases. Other auto-immune diseases may be associated in 10-20% of cases. The main long-term risk is the occurrence of T or B nodal or intestinal tract lymphoma in 2% of cases (relative risk close to 6 in several studies, but not admitted by all authors), especially if adherence to gluten-free diet is not strict. Treatment is based on dapsone, which is quickly efficient on cutaneous manifestations, but not on the digestive involvement and on strict and definitive gluten-free diet, which cures villous atrophy and reduces the risk of lymphoma.
CONCLUSION: DH is associated to a gluten enteropathy and its physiopathology is better known. Even if the risk of secondary lymphoma seems little, most of the authors recommend a definitive gluten-free diet.",['Ingen-Housz-Oro S'],2011,138,3,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Ingen-Housz-Oro S.

The experience of Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Spain, between 1995 and 2010 and a review of the literature].","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic bullous disease that is currently considered a cutaneous expression of gluten hypersensitivity. The aim of this study was to analyze and describe the clinical, histological, and immunopathological characteristics of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis assessed at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Spain between 1995 and 2010.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Demographic, clinical, serologic, and histopathological data were reviewed for 33 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients at the time of disease onset was 30 years and the majority were men. Associated autoimmune disease was present in 49% of patients. In 6 patients, celiac disease was diagnosed before dermatitis herpetiformis. Although excoriations were the most predominant lesions, 9 patients had blisters. Histological findings in skin lesions were compatible with dermatitis herpetiformis in 46% of cases. The most frequently observed staining pattern by indirect immunofluorescence was the presence of granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the basement membrane (62%). More than 80% of intestinal biopsies were compatible with celiac disease. Antibodies linked to gluten sensitivity were observed in 79% of patients. Only 1 malignant tumor was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Notable findings were the frequent presence of bullous lesions, the high prevalence of celiac disease, and the positive findings on intestinal biopsy, all of which are suggestive of late diagnosis. Our findings confirm the lack of specificity of conventional histology in dermatitis herpetiformis and the association of the disease with other immunological disorders.","['Fuertes I', 'Mascaró JM', 'Bombí JA', 'Iranzo P']",2011,102,9,Actas Dermosifiliogr,"Fuertes I, et al.

21335491,Dermatitis herpetiformis sera or goat anti-transglutaminase-3 transferred to human skin-grafted mice mimics dermatitis herpetiformis immunopathology.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized by deposition of IgA in the papillary dermis. However, indirect immunofluorescence is routinely negative, raising the question of the mechanism of formation of these immune deposits. Sárdy et al. (2002. J. Exp. Med. 195: 747-757) reported that transglutaminase-3 (TG3) colocalizes with the IgA. We sought to create such deposits using passive transfer of Ab to SCID mice bearing human skin grafts. IgG fraction of goat anti-TG3 or control IgG were administered i.p. to 20 mice. Separately, sera from seven DH patients and seven controls were injected intradermally. Biopsies were removed and processed for routine histology as well as direct immunofluorescence. All mice that received goat anti-TG3 produced papillary dermal immune deposits, and these deposits reacted with both rabbit anti-TG3 and DH patient sera. Three DH sera high in IgA anti-TG3 also produced deposits of granular IgA and TG3. We hypothesize that the IgA class anti-TG3 Abs are directly responsible for the immune deposits and that the TG3 is from human epidermis, as this is its only source in our model. These deposits seem to form over weeks in a process similar to an Ouchterlony immunodiffusion precipitate. This process of deposition explains the negative indirect immunofluorescence results with DH serum.","['Zone JJ', 'Schmidt LA', 'Taylor TB', 'Hull CM', 'Sotiriou MC', 'Jaskowski TD', 'Hill HR', 'Meyer LJ']",2011,186,7,J Immunol,"Zone JJ, et al.

21242397,Paraneoplastic pemphigus herpetiformis with IgG antibodies to desmoglein 3 and without mucosal lesions.,"BACKGROUND: Pemphigus herpetiformis (PH) is a rare clinical entity that combines the clinical features of dermatitis herpetiformis and the immunopathologic features of pemphigus. The target antigen is usually desmoglein 1, with exceptional cases manifesting autoantibodies against desmoglein 3. More recently, it has been found that many patients with PH also demonstrate autoantibodies against desmocollin. The association of PH with a malignant neoplasm is rare.
OBSERVATIONS: We describe a patient with PH and a lung neoplasm. Immunologic studies demonstrated IgG antibodies to desmoglein 3 and to an unknown 178-kDa protein but no antibodies to desmocollin.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of PH with a thoracic malignant neoplasm has been reported in only 4 previous cases, and the neoplasm could be responsible for the unusual immunologic profile in the patient described herein. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PH with an associated neoplasm in which only anti-desmoglein 3 antibody was detected.","['Prado R', 'Brice SL', 'Fukuda S', 'Hashimoto T', 'Fujita M']",2011,147,1,Arch Dermatol,"Prado R, et al.

21211654,Eosinophil extracellular DNA traps in skin diseases.,"BACKGROUND: In the skin, eosinophils are found in a broad spectrum of diseases, including infectious diseases.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated whether eosinophil extracellular traps, structures containing DNA in association with eosinophil granule proteins able to bind and kill bacteria, are present in the skin under various pathologic conditions.
METHODS: Immunofluorescence staining was performed on sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded skin biopsy tissues of 25 different eosinophilic skin diseases by using propidium iodide and an antibody to eosinophil cationic protein. Slides were evaluated by laser scanning microscopy.
RESULTS: Eosinophils releasing DNA together with eosinophil cationic protein were detected in infectious skin diseases such as ectoparasitosis and larva migrans. Further, we observed the extracellular DNA structures in allergic/reactive diseases (Wells syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome, positive reaction of atopy patch test, allergic contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity) and in autoimmune diseases (bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus foliaceus, dermatitis herpetiformis). The average number of eosinophils releasing DNA in the skin was usually below 10%, although in Wells syndrome the proportion was up to 30%. In areas with clusters of eosinophils, up to 50% of the eosinophils were seen to generate eosinophil extracellular traps.
CONCLUSION: Eosinophil extracellular traps are seen in both infectious and noninfectious inflammatory skin diseases and are particularly common in Wells syndrome.","['Simon D', 'Hoesli S', 'Roth N', 'Staedler S', 'Yousefi S', 'Simon HU']",2011,127,1,J Allergy Clin Immunol,"Simon D, et al.

In this case report we discuss a 28-year-old pregnant woman, G3P1011, with a history of impetigo herpetiformis in the first pregnancy, who presented with generalized pustular lesions at 30 weeks' gestation. Her disease responded poorly to corticosteroids and was more severe than in the previous pregnancy. She delivered prematurely at 34 weeks' gestation and then received aggressive postpartum treatment with methotrexate, resulting in a dramatic response. This case supports the current understanding that recurrent impetigo herpetiformis in subsequent pregnancy tends to be more severe and to have an earlier onset. Additionally, it provides additional evidence that methotrexate may be used as an alternative treatment for impetigo herpetiformis in the case of a poor response to corticosteroids.","['Luewan S', 'Sirichotiyakul S', 'Tongsong T']",2011,37,6,J Obstet Gynaecol Res,"Luewan S, et al.

21079050,Remission in dermatitis herpetiformis: a cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the percentage of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) who experience at least 2 years of remission and to identify factors associated with DH remission.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: National Institutes of Health (NIH).
PATIENTS: Patients seen at the NIH during the 1972-2010 period who had clinical findings consistent with DH, whose normal skin showed the presence of granular IgA deposits at the dermoepidermal junction on direct immunofluorescence (DIF) examination, whose age of disease onset was known, who had DH for at least 2 years, and who were followed up for at least 3 years after the initial NIH visit.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Remission, defined as absence of skin lesions and symptoms of DH for more than 2 years while not taking sulfones (dapsone or sulfoxone), sulfapyridine, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, or oral steroids and not adhering to a gluten-free diet.
RESULTS: Among 86 patients, in 10 (12%) the disease underwent remission (95% confidence interval, 6%-20%). Factors associated with DH remission included DH age of onset at 39 years or older vs onset at ages 8 to 38 years (unadjusted P = .02; adjusted P = .07) and DH onset year between 1960 and 1972 vs onset between 1935 and 1959 or after 1972 (P = .02 for global comparison of 4 onset-year groups).
CONCLUSIONS: Dermatitis herpetiformis can go into remission. Clinicians should attempt to wean patients with well-controlled DH from a gluten-free diet and/or use of sulfones or other therapies to determine if the DH might have remitted. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenesis and course of this disease and may serve to guide long-term management of patients with DH.","['Paek SY', 'Steinberg SM', 'Katz SI']",2011,147,3,Arch Dermatol,"Paek SY, et al.

Course and prognosis for mother and child].,"Chronic inflammatory dermatoses during pregnancy can take varying courses in mother and child. The dominant Th2-response characteristic for pregnancy may explain why atopic eczema or lupus erythematosus may deteriorate while psoriasis vulgaris may improve. In contrast, impetigo herpetiformis frequently shows a severe course. Lupus erythematosus and other autoantibody-triggered dermatoses like pemphigus vulgaris pose an increased risk for the child because of placental transfer of autoantibodies with specific skin changes or systemic manifestations of the disease as well as placental insufficiency, growth retardation and premature birth. Such risks are not associated with linear IgA dermatosis. A severe pityriasis rosea during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of abortion or premature delivery. Early diagnosis and individually adjusted therapy of skin diseases is mandatory to avoid any risk for mother or child.","['Renner R', 'Sticherling M']",2010,61,12,Hautarzt,Renner R and Sticherling M.

In recent years, increasing information has been published about the effect of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients on bullous skin diseases. Some factors are believed to be inducers (thiol and phenol-containing foods in pemphigus), whereas others are believed to be protective (antioxidants in cutaneous porphyrias). This contribution reviews the evidence in the literature of the role of various dietary factors in bullous diseases, including the nonautoimmune and the deficiency dermatoses. Additional studies and new investigations are needed to provide a better understanding of the specific associations of dietary factors with bullous diseases and better management for patients affected by these conditions.","['Fedeles F', 'Murphy M', 'Rothe MJ', 'Grant-Kels JM']",2010,28,6,Clin Dermatol,"Fedeles F, et al.

However, a few remarks are warrantable. For example: the prevalence rates for coeliac disease of 0.5 to 1.3% of the total Dutch population are disputable and the definition of 'clinical suspicion of coeliac disease' calls for clarification.

Coeliac disease has a high prevalence: 0.5 - 1.3%. The disease has a broad spectrum of symptoms, frequently also outside the gastrointestinal tract. Relatives of patients and persons with autoimmune diseases, microscopic colitis, IgA deficiency and syndromes of Down, Turner and Williams have an increased risk of coeliac disease. Detection is carried out by determination of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and endomysium. Testing for IgA antibodies to gliadin is only recommended in children younger than 2 years. Absence of HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 indicates that coeliac disease is most unlikely. The diagnosis should be confirmed by small bowel biopsy. Single biopsy following gluten ingestion is sufficient for diagnosis at all ages. After the diagnosis, patients should be referred to a dietician. Additionally, a yearly follow-up by a paediatrician or internal medical specialist with appropriate gastroenterology specialisation is recommended.","['Nieuwenhuis WP', 'Kneepkens CM', 'Houwen RH', 'de Beer HJ', 'Mulder CJ', 'Mearin ML']",2010,154,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Nieuwenhuis WP, et al.

20806175,[Autoimmune bullous skin disorders].,"Autoimmune bullous skin disorders are rare, potentially fatal disorders of skin and mucous membranes which are associated with IgG or IgA autoantibodies against distinct adhesion molecules of the epidermis and dermal epidermal basement membrane zone, respectively. These autoantibodies lead to a loss of skin adhesion which shows up clinically as the formation of blisters or erosions. In pemphigus, loss of adhesion occurs within the epidermis while in the pemphigoids, linear IgA dermatosis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and dermatitis herpetiformis, loss of adhesion takes place within or underneath the basement membrane zone. The autoantigens of these disorders are largely identified and characterized. Making the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous skin diseases is based on histology and direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin and the serological detection of autoantibodides by indirect immunofluorescence and recombinant autoantigens. Therapeutically, systemic treatment with glucocorticoids is combined with immunosuppressive adjuvants which allow for the fast reduction of systemic steroids. A prospective trial in pemphigus showed that adjuvant treatment with azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide, respectively, led to a significant reduction of the cummulative dose of systemic steroids until complete clinical remission was achieved. In bullous pemphigoid, topical treatment with clobetasol led to complete clinical remissions without major side effects seen when glucocorticoids were applied systemically. Therapeutic depletion of B cells by rituximab as a second line therapy has significantly improved the overall prognosis of pemphigus.

20693891,Update on mucosal immunoglobulin A in gastrointestinal disease.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent findings dealing with the involvement of mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the gut barrier function and various gastrointestinal diseases. New information will be discussed in the context of previous knowledge in this field.
RECENT FINDINGS: The epithelial barrier function seems to be central in many mucosal disorders because it is decisive for host-microbial interactions and penetration of soluble antigens into the lamina propria. Secretory IgA contributes to the barrier function and recent evidence strongly supports the notion that such antibodies are involved in immunological homeostasis.
SUMMARY: Inflammatory bowel disease involves a break of tolerance to the commensal microbiota. Aberrations in the mucosal IgA system may, therefore, be part of the inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis. In gluten-induced enteropathy, however, it has been suggested that a mucosal IgA response may promote the progression of celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis by enhancing the uptake of gluten peptides and inhibiting the enzyme activity of tissue transglutaminase. A mucosal IgA response may also promote gastritis by protecting Helicobacter pylori from complement attack. In food allergy, several facets of the epithelial barrier function may show deficiency, including secretory IgA.",['Brandtzaeg P'],2010,26,6,Curr Opin Gastroenterol,Brandtzaeg P.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 43 adult CD patients (18 with a typical and 15 with an atypical clinical presentation, and 10 with dermatitis herpetiformis, DH) and 86 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We administered the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire at diagnosis and after 1, 12 and 24 months of a GFD.
RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis CD patients showed significantly lower SF-36 scores than controls; this figure was observed in women but not in men. At baseline, both typical and atypical CD patients had lower SF-36 scores than controls, while DH patients showed a SF-36 profile comparable to that of controls. During a GFD the SF-36 scores improved continuously in CD patients and in the female subgroup, becoming similar to those of matched controls at 1-year follow-up. After gluten withdrawal typical and atypical CD patients improved their SF-36 scores and reached values comparable to those of controls.
CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, CD patients perceived a poor HRQoL; this figure appears to be mostly associated with female gender. In all subgroups of CD patients with a low HRQoL at diagnosis, the GFD allowed progressive restoration of HRQoL perception.","['Tontini GE', 'Rondonotti E', 'Saladino V', 'Saibeni S', 'de Franchis R', 'Vecchi M']",2010,82,4,Digestion,"Tontini GE, et al.

20453680,Novel screening assay performance in pediatric celiac disease and adult dermatitis herpetiformis.,"OBJECTIVES: : Several serologic assays are commercially available to aid in the diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). Our objective in this study was to assess the performance of a novel combined antigen-screening assay for GSE.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: : Deidentified sera from 111 pediatric patients suspected of having celiac disease (CD), 130 adults diagnosed with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and 77 pediatric and 49 adult normal controls were included in the study. Sera from 10 patients submitted to our laboratory for GSE testing with IgA deficiency and IgG antibodies against 1 or more of the traditional serologic markers associated with GSE were also included. All sera were screened for antibodies (IgA and IgG) against tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in a single test well. In addition, all sera were assessed for each individual marker and isotype using separate EIAs.
RESULTS: : The IgA/IgG anti-tTG/DGP EIA screen was 92.6% sensitive and 94.3% specific in pediatric CD and detected 1 patient (Marsh 3c) who was IgA anti-tTG negative; this patient was not IgA deficient (<7.0 mg/dL). All 10 IgA-deficient sera gave positive results by the tTG/DGP EIA screen. Sensitivity and specificity of the tTG/DGP EIA screen in retrospective and prospective DH were 65% and 100% versus 62% and 100%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: : The new IgA/IgG anti-tTG/DGP EIA screen was slightly more sensitive than IgA anti-tTG alone in pediatric CD. This novel screening assay may allow the current recommendation of measuring total serum IgA in suspected GSE patients to be eliminated.","['Jaskowski TD', 'Donaldson MR', 'Hull CM', 'Wilson AR', 'Hill HR', 'Zone JJ', 'Book LS']",2010,51,1,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Jaskowski TD, et al.

20300788,Gluten T cell epitope targeting by TG3 and TG6; implications for dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten ataxia.,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is well characterized as the main autoantigen of celiac disease. The ability of TG2 to deamidate and crosslink gluten peptides is essential for the gluten-dependent production of TG2 specific autoantibodies. In patients with primarily extraintestinal manifestation of gluten sensitivity the repertoire of autoantibodies may be different. In dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), TG3 appears to be the target autoantigen whereas in gluten ataxia (GA) autoantibodies reactive with TG6 are present. A functional role for TG3 and TG6 in these diseases has yet to be described. It is also not known whether these enzymes can use gluten peptides implicated in the pathology as substrates. We here report that similar to TG2, TG3 and TG6 can specifically deamidate gluten T cell epitopes. However, the fine specificities of the enzymes were found to differ. TG2 can form covalent complexes with gluten by iso-peptide and thioester bonds. We found that both TG3 and TG6 were able to complex with gluten peptides through thioester linkage although less efficiently than TG2, whereas TG6 but not TG3 was able to form iso-peptide linked complexes. Our findings lend credence to the notion that TG3 and TG6 are involved in the gluten-induced autoimmune responses of DH and GA.","['Stamnaes J', 'Dorum S', 'Fleckenstein B', 'Aeschlimann D', 'Sollid LM']",2010,39,5,Amino Acids,"Stamnaes J, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To identify associations, complications, and cause of death in Brazilian patients.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients were studied: 23 adolescents and 134 adults, 79.6% females, 20.4% males, 75.8% at the time of diagnosis and 24.2% on a gluten-free diet, follow-up between 1 and 40 years. The diagnosis of celiac disease was based on histologic findings and the presence of serologic auto-antibodies markers for celiac disease. Specific tests were done according to clinical suspicion of associations. Bone mineral density was determined by dual energy x-rays in 53 patients upon diagnosis. The data regarding associations, complications, and causes of death were obtained by interviews and from the patient's charts.
RESULTS: Associations: atopy (22.3%), depression (17.2%), thyroid disorder (15.9%), dermatitis herpetiformis (11.5%), diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 (4.5%) and tumors (4.5%).
COMPLICATIONS: Anemia and osteopenia/osteoporosis in all groups; increased number of spontaneous abortion. Four patients (4.5%) died (one from lymphoma, one with diabetes type 1, one from acute meningitis and one due to suicide).

In this Review we focus on the papers that have addressed this issue so far. We evaluated mortality rates in different forms of celiac disease, such as symptomatic celiac disease, unrecognized celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and refractory celiac disease. We also evaluated the role of possible protective factors, such as adherence to a gluten-free diet, early diagnosis and severity of clinical presentation. Finally, we noticed that the mortality rate for celiac disease seems to be higher in Southern than in Northern Europe and seems to correlate with 'national' gluten consumption.

23074399,Clinical utility of serologic testing for celiac disease in ontario: an evidence-based analysis.,"UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVE OF ANALYSIS: The objective of this evidence-based evaluation is to assess the accuracy of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease in subjects with symptoms consistent with this disease. Furthermore the impact of these tests in the diagnostic pathway of the disease and decision making was also evaluated. CELIAC DISEASE: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The immunological response is triggered by ingestion of gluten, a protein that is present in wheat, rye, and barley. The treatment consists of strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients with celiac disease may present with a myriad of symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, among others.
SEROLOGIC TESTING IN THE DIAGNOSIS CELIAC DISEASE: There are a number of serologic tests used in the diagnosis of celiac disease. Anti-gliadin antibody (AGA)Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG)Anti-deamidated gliadin peptides antibodies (DGP)Serologic tests are automated with the exception of the EMA test, which is more time-consuming and operator-dependent than the other tests. For each serologic test, both immunoglobulin A (IgA) or G (IgG) can be measured, however, IgA measurement is the standard antibody measured in celiac disease.
DIAGNOSIS OF CELIAC DISEASE: According to celiac disease guidelines, the diagnosis of celiac disease is established by small bowel biopsy. Serologic tests are used to initially detect and to support the diagnosis of celiac disease. A small bowel biopsy is indicated in individuals with a positive serologic test. In some cases an endoscopy and small bowel biopsy may be required even with a negative serologic test. The diagnosis of celiac disease must be performed on a gluten-containing diet since the small intestine abnormalities and the serologic antibody levels may resolve or improve on a GFD. Since IgA measurement is the standard for the serologic celiac disease tests, false negatives may occur in IgA-deficient individuals.
INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE: The incidence and prevalence of celiac disease in the general population and in subjects with symptoms consistent with or at higher risk of celiac disease based on systematic reviews published in 2004 and 2009 are summarized below.
INCIDENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION: ADULTS OR MIXED POPULATION: 1 to 17/100,000/year
CHILDREN: 2 to 51/100,000/yearIn one of the studies, a stratified analysis showed that there was a higher incidence of celiac disease in younger children compared to older children, i.e., 51 cases/100,000/year in 0 to 2 year-olds, 33/100,000/year in 2 to 5 year-olds, and 10/100,000/year in children 5 to 15 years old.
PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION: The prevalence of celiac disease reported in population-based studies identified in the 2004 systematic review varied between 0.14% and 1.87% (median: 0.47%, interquartile range: 0.25%, 0.71%). According to the authors of the review, the prevalence did not vary by age group, i.e., adults and children.
PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN HIGH RISK SUBJECTS: Type 1 diabetes (adults and children): 1 to 11%AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE: 2.9 to 3.3%FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES OF PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE: 2 to 20% PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN SUBJECTS WITH SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH THE DISEASE: The prevalence of celiac disease in subjects with symptoms consistent with the disease varied widely among studies, i.e., 1.5% to 50% in adult studies, and 1.1% to 17% in pediatric studies. Differences in prevalence may be related to the referral pattern as the authors of a systematic review noted that the prevalence tended to be higher in studies whose population originated from tertiary referral centres compared to general practice.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests in the diagnosis celiac disease?What is the clinical validity of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease? The clinical validity was defined as the ability of the test to change diagnosis.What is the clinical utility of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease? The clinical utility was defined as the impact of the test on decision making.What is the budget impact of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease?What is the cost-effectiveness of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease?
LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on November 13(th), 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1(st) 2003 and November 13(th) 2010. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist, then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. Inclusion Criteria Inclusion CriteriaExclusion CriteriaStudies that evaluated diagnostic accuracy, i.e., both sensitivity and specificity of serology tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease.Study population consisted of untreated patients with symptoms consistent with celiac disease.Studies in which both serologic celiac disease tests and small bowel biopsy (gold standard) were used in all subjects.Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, prospective observational studies, and retrospective cohort studies.At least 20 subjects included in the celiac disease group.English language.Human studies.Studies published from 2000 on.Clearly defined cut-off value for the serology test.

POPULATION: The population consisted of adults and children with untreated, undiagnosed celiac disease with symptoms consistent with the disease.
SEROLOGIC CELIAC DISEASE TESTS EVALUATED: Anti-gliadin antibody (AGA)Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG)Anti-deamidated gliadin peptides antibody (DGP)Combinations of some of the serologic tests listed above were evaluated in some studiesBoth IgA and IgG antibodies were evaluated for the serologic tests listed above.
OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: SensitivitySpecificityPositive and negative likelihood ratiosDiagnostic odds ratio (OR)Area under the sROC curve (AUC)Small bowel biopsy was used as the gold standard in order to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of each serologic test.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) for the different serologic tests were calculated using a bivariate, binomial generalized linear mixed model. Statistical significance for differences in sensitivity and specificity between serologic tests was defined by P values less than 0.05, where ""false discovery rate"" adjustments were made for multiple hypothesis testing. The bivariate regression analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.; Cary, NC, USA). Using the bivariate model parameters, summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves were produced using Review Manager 5.0.22 (The Nordiac Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2008). The area under the sROC curve (AUC) was estimated by bivariate mixed-efects binary regression modeling framework. Model specification, estimation and prediction are carried out with xtmelogit in Stata release 10 (Statacorp, 2007). Statistical tests for the differences in AUC estimates could not be carried out. The study results were stratified according to patient or disease characteristics such as age, severity of Marsh grade abnormalities, among others, if reported in the studies. The literature indicates that the diagnostic accuracy of serologic tests for celiac disease may be affected in patients with chronic liver disease, therefore, the studies identified through the systematic literature review that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of serologic tests for celiac disease in patients with chronic liver disease were summarized. The effect of the GFD in patiens diagnosed with celiac disease was also summarized if reported in the studies eligible for the analysis.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: PUBLISHED SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: Five systematic reviews of studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of serologic celiac disease tests were identified through our literature search. Seventeen individual studies identified in adults and children were eligible for this evaluation.

20025595,Current treatment of autoimmune blistering diseases.,"Autoimmune bullous diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that can be subdivided according to the level of split formation in the intraepidermal blistering pemphigus diseases and subepidermal bullous disorders, latter including pemphigoid diseases, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and dermatitis herpetiformis. In the majority of autoimmune bullous disorders, disease activity can be sufficiently controlled by systemic corticosteroids in combination with further immunosuppressants/immunomodulants such as dapsone, doxycycline, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil. In contrast, in pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, treatment is challenging and only in a minority of patients, conventional immunosuppressive therapy induces clinical remission. Since only a few years ago, only cyclophosphamide and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin were available as potent second-line therapies. Meanwhile, immunoadsorption and the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab have been established as further therapeutic options. Here, both conventional therapies and novel treatment regimens for autoimmune blistering diseases are discussed.","['Kasperkiewicz M', 'Schmidt E']",2009,6,4,Curr Drug Discov Technol,Kasperkiewicz M and Schmidt E.

20022983,New serology assays can detect gluten sensitivity among enteropathy patients seronegative for anti-tissue transglutaminase.,"BACKGROUND: Some patients with celiac disease (CD) may be seronegative with the commonly used test for IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies. Our aim was to explore whether newer assays incorporating synthetic deamidated gliadin-related peptides (DGPs) or other TG isoenzymes as antigen are useful for detecting gluten sensitivity in IgA anti-tTG-seronegative patients.
METHODS: We assayed serum samples obtained at diagnosis from (a) anti-tTG-seronegative patients with a CD-like enteropathy (n = 12), (b) skin biopsy-proven dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) patients (n = 26), and (c) IgA anti-tTG-positive CD patients (n = 26). All patients had typical total IgA concentrations. All patients underwent intestinal biopsy and serum testing for (a) detection of IgA and IgG isotypes of both anti-DGP and anti-tTG in a single assay (tTG/DGP Screen; INOVA Diagnostics), (b) simultaneous detection of both IgA and IgG anti-DGP antibody isotypes (DGP Dual; INOVA Diagnostics), and (c) detection of antibodies to transglutaminase 3 (TG3) or transglutaminase 6 (TG6).
RESULTS: All anti-tTG-seropositive patients also tested positive in anti-DGP assays. Overall, tTG/DGP Screen detected 6 (31.6%) of the 19 anti-tTG seronegatives, and anti-DGP Dual produced positive results in 5 (26.3%) of these cases. Whereas both assays detected 2 anti-tTG-negative DH patients with partial villous atrophy, they were positive in only 2 of the 5 cases with no histologically discernible mucosal damage. Testing for antibodies to TG3 and TG6 identified 7 (36.8%) of the 19 anti-tTG-negative patients, 5 of which were also positive for anti-DGP.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of anti-DGP with tTG/DGP Screen or anti-DGP Dual, or detection of antibodies to other TG isoenzymes, enhances the sensitivity for detecting gluten sensitivity among non-IgA- deficient, anti-tTG-seronegative patients with CD-like enteropathy.","['Sugai E', 'Hwang HJ', 'Vázquez H', 'Smecuol E', 'Niveloni S', 'Mazure R', 'Mauriño E', 'Aeschlimann P', 'Binder W', 'Aeschlimann D', 'Bai JC']",2010,56,4,Clin Chem,"Sugai E, et al.

19919655,Fibrillar IgA deposition in dermatitis herpetiformis--an underreported pattern with potential clinical significance.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis has characteristic clinical and histopathologic findings. A fibrillar pattern of IgA deposition on direct immunofluorescence in dermatitis herpetiformis is underreported. Here, we describe three patients with the fibrillar pattern of IgA deposition on direct immunofluorescence examination that initially misled diagnosis in one of the three. Interestingly, two of the three patients lacked anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies but had a clinical course typical of dermatitis herpetiformis. Dermatitis herpetiformis may have a fibrillar rather than granular pattern of IgA deposition on direct immunofluorescent microscopy, and patients with this pattern of immunoglobulin deposition may lack circulating autoantibodies.","['Ko CJ', 'Colegio OR', 'Moss JE', 'McNiff JM']",2010,37,4,J Cutan Pathol,"Ko CJ, et al.

19878401,"Clinical, histological and immunpathological findings in 32 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring.","BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic severely pruritic dermatosis. It is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. The aim of our study was to collect clinical, histological and immunopathological data on patients who were treated in the University Departments of Dermatology in Würzburg and Lübeck from 1996 to 2008.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 32 patients. Only patients with positive findings on direct immunofluorescence microscopy were included in this study.
RESULTS: All patients demonstrated skin lesions in the predilection areas of knees, elbows, gluteal region and scalp. The male to female ratio was 1.5 : 1 and the average age was 43 years. The interval between the first symptoms and diagnosis ranged from 6 weeks to 20 years. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy showed that granular IgA deposits were more often found continuously along the dermal-epidermal junction rather than focally in the tips of the dermal papillae. Results of small intestinal biopsies were available from 29 patients and confirmed the presence of celiac disease in all cases. None of the patients reported gastrointestinal symptoms. IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and epidermal transglutaminase were found in 88% and 94% of patient sera, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The detection of IgA autoantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase is the most sensitive serological test in the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis. Our observations confirm that patients with dermatitis herpetiformis usually do not demonstrate apparent gastrointestinal symptoms.","['Rose C', 'Bröcker EB', 'Zillikens D']",2010,8,4,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Rose C, et al.

23480432,In vitro and in vivo models of celiac disease.,"UNLABELLED: Background : Celiac disease is an autoimmune intestinal disease that develops in genetically susceptible individuals upon the ingestion of gluten. In vitro and in vivo models have addressed the roles of the following five elements in the pathogenesis of celiac disease: i) A tight association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. ii) A strong B-cell response to the autoantigen tissue transglutaminase that preferentially reacts with certain gluten peptides and that is almost exclusively IgA. iii) An adaptive inflammatory immune response to gluten peptides that are antigenically presented on HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. iv) An improved antigenic presentation of most gluten peptides and a stronger T-cell response after their deamidation by tissue transglutaminase; and v) An increased risk for autoimmune diseases associated with celiac disease, such as dermatitis herpetiformis and type 1 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the different in vitro and in vivo models of celiac disease, their contributions to our understanding of the pathogenesis of celiac disease and the alternative therapies that have been tested using these models.
CONCLUSION: These models, especially the animal models, are continuously being developed. They have contributed greatly to the development of alternative therapies for celiac disease and are being used increasingly to test their effectiveness and potential.","['Marietta EV', 'Schuppan D', 'Murray JA']",2009,4,11,Expert Opin Drug Discov,"Marietta EV, et al.

19863700,C3d immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed tissue is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid of the skin.,"BACKGROUND: Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing is an important procedure in the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous dermatoses. We investigated the expression of C3d in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of autoimmune bullous dermatoses.
METHODS: The immunohistochemical expression of C3d in bullous pemphigoid (BP) (n = 32), pemphigoid gestationis (PG) (n = 3), pemphigus (n = 14), dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring (DHD) (n = 10), linear immunoglobulin A (IgA) dermatosis (n = 4), mixed forms of BP and linear IgA dermatosis (n = 2), and 44 controls was analyzed on formalin-fixed tissue.
RESULTS: Thirty-one of 32 cases (97%) of BP and 3 out of 3 cases (100%) of PG showed a linear positivity of C3d along the basement membrane. Only 3 out of 14 (21%) cases of pemphigus showed an intraepidermal intercellular expression of C3d. The two mixed forms of linear IgA dermatosis and BP showed a linear positivity of C3d along the basement membrane. All cases of DHD, linear IgA dermatosis and all of the controls were negative for C3d.
CONCLUSIONS: C3d immunohistochemistry is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of BP and PG of the skin with a sensitivity of at least 97%. Mixed forms of linear IgA dermatosis, and BP, DHD and linear IgA dermatosis can only be identified by DIF. A positive result may prompt serologic confirmation of BP without further need for DIF.","['Pfaltz K', 'Mertz K', 'Rose C', 'Scheidegger P', 'Pfaltz M', 'Kempf W']",2010,37,6,J Cutan Pathol,"Pfaltz K, et al.

19841593,Prediction of clinical and mucosal severity of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis by quantification of IgA/IgG serum antibodies to tissue transglutaminase.,"OBJECTIVES: We analysed whether the quantification of autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase could be used to predict mucosal destruction and disease severity in patients with gluten sensitivity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy patients with coeliac disease (CD), comprising 52 children with severe malabsorption (group I), 59 children with mild symptoms (group II), 59 adults (group III), 134 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and 131 disease controls, were studied. Serial serum samples of patients in groups I and II on a gluten-free diet were also included. Serum levels of antibodies against recombinant tissue transglutaminase were determined with ELISA using standard curves for quantification of antibodies.
RESULTS: Immunoglobulin (Ig)A antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TGA) were detected in all of the patients with CD and in 95% of the DH patients. The IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA levels were higher in group I (P < 0.001). The IgG-TGA levels and positivity rate in group I (100%) were higher than in group II (81%), group III (73%), and the DH group (67%). Elevated IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA levels in combination predicted a more severe small intestinal atrophy (P < 0.0001) with a specificity of 99% for Marsh IIIb-IIIc (flat) lesions. The kinetics of the IgA-TGA decrease during diet differed between groups I and II.
CONCLUSIONS: High levels of IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA antibodies were associated with the grade of mucosal villous atrophy and a more severe clinical presentation. The combined measurement of IgA-TGA and IgG-TGA enables a noninvasive prediction of small intestinal villous atrophy with high accuracy, and may reduce the need for a biopsy in patients with suspected CD.","['Dahlbom I', 'Korponay-Szabó IR', 'Kovács JB', 'Szalai Z', 'Mäki M', 'Hansson T']",2010,50,2,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Dahlbom I, et al.

However, it may cause severe adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity syndrome, which is characterized by fever, skin rash, hepatitis and lymphadenopathy. We report a 44-year-old female Korean patient with dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) that presented as a bullous skin eruption. The patient had a 1-year history of urticarial vasculitis, treated with antihistamines, prednisolone and dapsone. Although the skin lesions improved, she reported fever, nausea, abdominal pain, jaundice, fatigue and skin rashes. On physical examination, there were generalized erythematous macules and purpura with facial oedema that developed into vesicles on the upper limbs. Histological examination of a skin biopsy of a vesicular lesion found subepidermal oedema with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, including eosinophils in the dermis. Indirect immunofluorescence testing using normal foreskin as substrate revealed IgG deposits in the basement membrane zone. Circulating autoantibodies against antigens of 190 and 230 kDa were found by immunoblotting analysis using epidermal extracts.

19670701,Expression of selected adhesion molecules in dermatitis herpetiformis and bullous pemphigoid.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) are autoimmune diseases characterized by destruction of the basement membrane zone (BMZ) and anchoring fibres by autoantibodies and infiltration. Adhesion molecules can take part in these phenomena. Skin biopsies were taken from 13 patients with DH, 21 with BP, and from 10 healthy subjects. The localization and expression of E and L selectins and beta1, beta3, beta4 integrins were studied by immunohistochemistry. Expression of selectins was detected mainly in the skin leukocytes in all samples. Expression of beta1, beta3 integrins was detected mainly in basal keratinocytes. Expression of beta 4 integrin was irregular and detected mainly in the blister. Our results suggest that integrins and selectins may play an important role in the destruction of BMZ in DH and BP. The elucidation of the role of adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of bullous diseases may be helpful in the development of new targeted therapies.","['Zebrowska A', 'Waszczykowska E', 'Wagrowska-Danilewicz M', 'Danilewicz M', 'Erkiert-Polguj A', 'Pawliczak R', 'Sysa-Jedrzejowska A']",2009,60,1,Pol J Pathol,"Zebrowska A, et al.

An association of CS with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type 1 is rare, with only two prior cases reported. Here we describe a 45-year-old man with no prior medical history who presented initially with microhaematuria, subnephrotic proteinuria and hypocomplementaemia. A renal biopsy revealed MPGN type 1 with negative serologic workup for secondary causes. The patient was treated conservatively with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Several months later, he developed daily non-bloody diarrhoea and was found to have worsening hypoalbuminaemia, hypophosphataemia and severe iron deficiency anaemia. A diagnosis of CS was established based on elevated tTGA (IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase) antibody and positive IgA antiendomysial antibody titres. Proteinuria resolved completely following the initiation of a gluten-free diet, without the use of immunosuppressive therapy and despite tapering of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. This case illustrates that CS-associated MPGN may precede overt clinical evidence of coeliac disease and may respond to gluten-free diet, without resort to immunosuppressive therapy.","['Jhaveri KD', ""D'Agati VD"", 'Pursell R', 'Serur D']",2009,24,11,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Jhaveri KD, et al.

19595389,Introduction of oats in the diet of individuals with celiac disease: a systematic review.,"Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease, triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by ingested gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and other closely related cereal grains. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet for life. This paper presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on the safety of pure oats for individuals with celiac disease, which historically has been subject to debate. Limitations identified within the scientific database include: limited data on long-term consumption, limited numbers of participants in challenge studies, and limited reporting about the reasons for withdrawals from study protocols. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that a small number of individuals with celiac disease may be intolerant to pure oats and some evidence from in vitro studies suggests that an immunological response to oat avenins can occur in the absence of clinical manifestations of celiac disease as well as suggesting that oat cultivars vary in toxicity. Based on the majority of the evidence provided in the scientific database, and despite the limitations, Health Canada and the Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) concluded that the majority of people with celiac disease can tolerate moderate amounts of pure oats. The incorporation of oats into a gluten-free diet provides high fiber and vitamin B content, increased palatability, and beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. However, it is recommended that individuals with celiac disease should have both initial and long-term assessments by a health professional when introducing pure oats into a gluten-free diet.","['Pulido OM', 'Gillespie Z', 'Zarkadas M', 'Dubois S', 'Vavasour E', 'Rashid M', 'Switzer C', 'Godefroy SB']",2009,57,,Adv Food Nutr Res,"Pulido OM, et al.

OBJECTIVE: This article outlines the clinical and pathological features of blistering skin conditions with a particular focus on bullous impetigo, dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid and porphyria cutanea tarda.
DISCUSSION: Infections, contact reactions and drug eruptions should always be considered. Occasionally blistering may represent a cutaneous manifestation of a metabolic disease such as porphyria. Although rare, it is important to be aware of the autoimmune group of blistering diseases, as if unrecognised and untreated, they can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Early referral to a dermatologist is important as management of blistering skin conditions can be challenging.",['Welsh B'],2009,38,7,Aust Fam Physician,Welsh B. Blistering skin conditions.

In the majority of autoimmune bullous disorders, disease activity can be sufficiently controlled by systemic corticosteroids in combination with further immunsuppressants/-modulants such as dapsone, doxycycline, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate. In contrast, in pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and EBA, treatment is challenging and conventional immunosuppressive therapy induces clinical remission only in a minority of patients.

19505219,An evaluation of dapsone gel 5% in the treatment of acne vulgaris.,"BACKGROUND: Oral dapsone has been available for over 60 years. Its first clinical use was discovered in 1945, when it was found to be efficacious in inhibiting the progression of leprosy. The combined antibacterial and anti-inflammatory pharmacologic activities of dapsone have made it a widely investigated drug, particularly for use in refractory and unusual dermatologic conditions. However, the possibility of significant hematological side effects, even at low doses, has limited its use. Currently, oral dapsone has FDA approval for the treatment of leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis. The potential of oral dapsone to treat acne vulgaris is well established, but the risks of serious side effects have made it an undesirable drug for use in the relatively healthy acne population. Recently, a topical formulation of dapsone (Aczone, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris.
OBJECTIVE/METHODS: The aims of this study were to review the published literature on dapsone pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and to evaluate the gel's efficacy and safety in treating acne vulgaris, and finally to provide personal insight into its future as a topical agent for acne vulgaris.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies indicate dapsone gel 5% is effective in treating mild to moderately severe acne. It is well tolerated, with pharmacokinetic evidence indicating topical dosing in comparison to oral administration significantly reduces systemic concentrations of the drug, and therefore risk of serious side effects. Data suggests that dapsone gel 5% has the potential to become an established topical drug for the treatment of acne vulgaris. However, studies comparing the clinical effectiveness of the dapsone gel 5% to other available topical antiacne drugs are needed as are studies accessing its usefulness and safety when combined with other acne pharmaceuticals.","['Pickert A', 'Raimer S']",2009,10,9,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Pickert A and Raimer S.

Their classification is based on the location of the blister: intraepidermal and subepidermal. Patients produce autoantibodies against self-specific structures of the skin detectable by immunofluorescence techniques, immunoblotting and ELISA. Recent advances in molecular and cellular biology have brought to knowledge these self-antigens, against which patients are sensitized, and which are found in epidermis or in the dermo-epidermal junction. These are low incidence, but high morbidity diseases that may be fatal.

In DH, but not in CD or controls, a higher proportion of IgA1-ISC (40%) than IgA2-ISC (25%) expressed the skin HR, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen. In gluten enteropathy circulating plasmablasts are more mature, but decreased in number, and have distorted homing profiles.

19420944,Body mass index and prevalence of skin diseases in adults with untreated coeliac disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Coeliac disease (CD) is associated with immune-mediated skin diseases such as dermatitis herpetiformis and others. The objective of the study was to investigate the relation of body mass index (BMI), as an index of absorptive status, with the prevalence of skin diseases in adults with untreated CD.
METHODS: Anthropometry, gastro-intestinal symptoms, nutritional indices and immune-mediated skin diseases (dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, aphthosis and alopecia) at diagnosis were analysed.
RESULTS: 223 men and 924 women with untreated CD (aged 20-60 years) were included, the commonest skin disease was dermatitis herpetiformis (18.4 and 6.9%, respectively), the rarest one was alopecia (1.8 and 2.1%). The BMI was positively associated with male gender, age at diagnosis and nutritional indices, negatively with diarrhoea and dyspepsia (p < 0.001). A BMI difference of 3.5 (1 standard deviation) was related to an excess prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis (odds ratio, OR = 1.46, 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.23-1.72) and of psoriasis (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.10-1.79) but not of other immunological disorders. Findings were similar in analyses by gender or age group and controlled for gender and age. The relation of BMI to dermatitis herpetiformis was linear over the whole BMI range, also excluding overweight patients. The relation of BMI to psoriasis was flat for low-to-normal BMI and explained only by overweight patients.
CONCLUSION: In CD at diagnosis, the BMI is positively related to the prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis and psoriasis, not to that of other immune-mediated skin diseases.","['Zingone F', 'Bucci C', 'Tortora R', 'Santonicola A', 'Cappello C', 'Franzese MD', 'Passananti V', 'Ciacci C']",2009,80,1,Digestion,"Zingone F, et al.

19384060,The utility of the DNA microarray scanner to simplify the immunofluorescence evaluation of autoimmune bullous diseases.,"A DNA microarray scanner was used as a digital fluorescence microscope to simplify the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous diseases. Frozen sections of skin biopsies were taken from 3 patients with bullous pemphigoid and 1 patient each with lichen planus pemphigoides, linear immunoglobulin (Ig) A disease, and dermatitis herpetiformis. After incubation with cyanine-labeled antibodies, the tissues were scanned at 5-mum resolution using an instrument originally designed to study gene expression. The microarray scanner's large field of view, unlike that of fluorescence microscopy, allowed a view of the entire specimen, considerably easing the orientation of tissue. All images were diagnostic and included a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone (BMZ) using anti-IgG and anti-C3 in all cases of bullous pemphigoid, a linear pattern of IgG along the BMZ in lichen planus pemphigoides, and a linear pattern of IgA along the BMZ in linear IgA dermatosis. IgA deposition along dermal papillary tips was seen in dermatitis herpetiformis, but a granular pattern was indiscernible at the 5-mum resolution. The advantages of the microarray scanner over standard fluorescence microscopy include speed, technical ease, large field of view, potential for visualizing multiple antibodies simultaneously in a tissue, and convenience of digital image archiving.","['Iwamoto S', 'Iwamoto AT', 'Cha J', 'Clark T', 'Lu M', 'Breen C', 'Bhawan J', 'Falanga V']",2009,31,3,Am J Dermatopathol,"Iwamoto S, et al.

19344979,Autoantibodies against epidermal transglutaminase are a sensitive diagnostic marker in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a normal or gluten-free diet.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a cutaneous manifestation of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease). Patients with DH demonstrate circulating IgA antibodies against epidermal transglutaminase (eTG) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG). It has been suggested that eTG is the autoantigen of DH.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the autoimmune response to eTG and tTG in patients with DH on a normal or gluten-free diet (GFD).
METHODS: Sera from 52 patients with DH were studied for the presence of IgA antibodies to eTG and tTG by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. In 38 patients, serum was obtained before initiation of a GFD, whereas 14 patients had been on a GFD for at least 2 years.
RESULTS: Autoantibodies against eTG were detected in 36 of 38 patients (95%) and those against tTG in 30 of 38 patients (79%) with DH on a normal diet. Of 14 patients on a long-term GFD, 7 patients were free of DH lesions and did not require dapsone treatment. None of these patients showed circulating antibodies against eTG or tTG. The remaining 7 patients on a GFD were not able to stop taking dapsone. All these patients demonstrated anti-eTG antibodies, whereas only 3 of them showed additional reactivity against tTG.
LIMITATION: Autoantibody levels against eTG and tTG before and after introduction of a GFD were not examined in the same patients.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that antibodies to eTG are the most sensitive serologic marker in treated and untreated patients with DH and confirm the central role of eTG in the pathogenesis of this disease.","['Rose C', 'Armbruster FP', 'Ruppert J', 'Igl BW', 'Zillikens D', 'Shimanovich I']",2009,61,1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Rose C, et al.

19192160,Research in practice: diagnosis of subepidermal autoimmune bullous disorders.,"Subepidermal autoimmune bullous disorders are a heterogeneous group of diseases that are associated with autoantibodies to hemidesmosomal proteins (pemphigoid group, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita) or epidermal/tissue transglutaminase (dermatitis herpetiformis). Characterization of the target antigens has led to the description of novel entities such as anti-p200 pemphigoid and has greatly facilitated the diagnosis of these diseases. Precise identification of target antigens is of therapeutic relevance since treatment options may greatly differ between these disorders. By the use of various in vitro and in vivo systems, the pathogenic relevance of autoantibodies to different hemidesmosomal constituents, including BP180 (type XVII collagen), laminin 332 (laminin 5), alpha6beta4 integrin, and type VII collagen has been demonstrated.

19170813,"Prospective analysis of the incidence of autoimmune bullous disorders in Lower Franconia, Germany.","BACKGROUND: Only limited epidemiologic data are available on autoimmune bullous diseases. Improved diagnostic tools should have led to an increased incidence. To test this hypothesis, all patients with autoimmune bullous disorders who were treated in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Würzburg, Germany, between January 2001 and June 2002 were analysed prospectively.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Epidemiologic data of patients diagnosed with an autoimmune bullous disease during this time period were registered and statistically evaluated. Diagnosis was based on the clinical picture and specific immunopathological findings. Only patients from Lower Franconia, a well-defined administrative region of Southern Germany, were included into this study.
RESULTS: During the study period, 41 patients with an autoimmune bullous disease were diagnosed, including 27 with bullous pemphigoid, 4 with pemphigoid gestationis and mucous membrane pemphigoid, 2 with dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA disease, and 1 with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and pemphigus vulgaris, respectively. The highest incidence was calculated for bullous pemphigoid (13.4 per 1 million inhabitants per year) followed by pemphigoid gestationis (2.0) and mucous membrane pemphigoid (2.0). Patients with mucous membrane pemphigoid were found to have the highest mean age at disease onset (76 years) followed by patients with bullous pemphigoid (74 years).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study on the incidence of autoimmune bullous disorders. Subepidermal blistering autoimmune diseases were shown to be more frequent than previously reported for Central Europe. This is most likely due to improved diagnostic tools for and increased awareness of these diseases.","['Bertram F', 'Bröcker EB', 'Zillikens D', 'Schmidt E']",2009,7,5,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Bertram F, et al.

19150172,"A case of stiff-person syndrome, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.","Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are involved in the pathophysiology of stiff-person syndrome (SPS) and type 1 diabetes. GAD catalyses the conversion of glutamate to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA acts as a neurotransmitter between neurones, while in pancreatic beta cells it plays an integral role in normal insulin secretion, hence the clinical presentation of muscular spasms in SPS and insulin deficiency in diabetes. Despite this apparent major overlap in pathophysiology, SPS only rarely occurs in individuals with type 1 diabetes. We report the case of a 41-year-old man presenting with a simultaneous diagnosis of both these conditions. His case is unusual in that it is the first reported case in the literature of these conditions occurring in someone with celiac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis. We discuss why SPS and type 1 diabetes co-exist in only a minority of cases and speculate on the underlying mechanism of the association with CD and dermatitis herpetiformis in our patient.","[""O'Sullivan EP"", 'Behan LA', 'King TF', 'Hardiman O', 'Smith D']",2009,111,4,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,"O'Sullivan EP, et al.

We investigated the familial aggregation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis/juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JRA/JIA), hypothyroidism, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and alopecia areata (AA) among individuals in families with celiac disease (CD). Family history information, obtained from questionnaires from the University of California Irvine Celiac Disease study, was reviewed for reports of RA, JRA/JIA, hypothyroidism, IDDM, and AA in celiac disease cases and their first-degree relatives. Reports of disease were compared with prevalence data from the literature and analyzed by calculating the standardized ratio (SR) with 95% confidence limits. We analyzed: (1) subjects with confirmed celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis (205 probands and 203 affected first-degree relatives) and (2) first-degree relatives of celiac disease cases (n=1272). We found a significantly increased number of cases, relative to the expected number, of IDDM in both groups and hypothyroidism among subjects with celiac disease. JRA/JIA was increased among first-degree relatives of celiacs. These results indicate that the presence of IDDM within our celiac disease families may be due to shared genetic susceptibility predisposing to these diseases or autoimmune diseases in general.","['Neuhausen SL', 'Steele L', 'Ryan S', 'Mousavi M', 'Pinto M', 'Osann KE', 'Flodman P', 'Zone JJ']",2008,31,2,J Autoimmun,"Neuhausen SL, et al.

CASES REPORTS: Two patients, respectively, aged 24 and 21, presented erythematous, pustular and extensive plaques for which the diagnosis of hepetiformis impetigo was clinically and histologically posed. For the first patient, the lesions appeared in the two pregnancies and were more severe and foetal repercussions (oligoamnios and hypotrophy) during the second pregnancy. For the second patient, the pregnancy was complicated with premature interruption of the membrane, giving birth to a deed fetus and causing an aggravation of the cutaneous lesions. The treatment was oral steroid followed by acitretin for the first patient, however, for the second patient; the treatment was by local steroid associated with UVB during the pregnancy. Then, acitrétine was used and was efficient.
CONCLUSION: Our two cases show the importance of gynaecological control in order to avoid complications which can be sometimes fatal. They also show the importance of local steroid associated with UVB which constitute another therapeutic alternative in the treatment of hepetiformis impetigo.","['Masmoudi A', 'Abdelmaksoud W', 'Ghorbel S', 'Amouri H', 'Mseddi M', 'Bouassida S', 'Zahaf A', 'Guermazi M', 'Boudaya S', 'Turki H']",2008,37,8,J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris),"Masmoudi A, et al.

18627702,Asymptomatic palmar pits: clinical evaluation of six cases and review of the literature.,"BACKGROUND: Palmar pits are intriguing and are found in association with diverse dermatologic conditions. Some are innocuous, whereas others have sinister implications.
OBJECTIVE: Six cases of asymptomatic palmar pits are described, and the literature is reviewed in brief.
METHOD AND RESULTS: Of the six patients, five were male and one was female, with a mean age of 63.5 years. In all six patients, the palmar pits were noticed incidentally during a cutaneous examination for some other unrelated dermatoses, except in one in whom the pits were the reason for visiting a dermatologist. The number of pits varied from one to nine. Dupuytren contracture was observed in five patients. Sole involvement was seen in only one patient. None had overlying hyperkeratosis or associated symptoms relating to palmar pits.
CONCLUSIONS: Palmar pits may have sinister implications in conditions such as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or Cowden syndrome. The association of palmar pits and Dupuytren contracture seems to be common but is underreported. Palmar pits may be the clinical cutaneous sign of systemic diseases and may sometimes provide a diagnostic clue to other dermatoses.

18503599,Elevation of IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase antibodies in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a papulovesicular eruption caused by ingestion of gluten. It is characterized by the deposition of IgA in the dermal papillae. IgA antibodies directed at tissue transglutaminase (TG2) are elevated in gluten-sensitive diseases including DH and coeliac disease (CD). More recently, antibodies directed at epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) were identified in patients with DH, and this may be the dominant autoantigen in this disease.
OBJECTIVES: To measure IgA antibodies to TG3 and TG2 in patients with DH and CD, and control populations.
METHODS: Serum IgA antibodies against TG2 and TG3 were measured from adults with DH, adults and children with CD, patients with psoriasis, adult Red Cross blood donors, and paediatric controls.
RESULTS: Patients with DH and CD had elevated levels of IgA anti-TG2 antibodies compared with control populations. The levels in the patients with DH and adults with CD were similar. IgA anti-TG2 antibodies were higher in the children with CD compared with adults with DH and CD, and with control populations. Patients with DH and adults with CD had elevated levels of IgA anti-TG3 antibodies compared with children with CD and control populations. There was a trend towards higher levels in the patients with DH compared with adults with CD.
CONCLUSIONS: IgA antibodies to TG3 are elevated in patients with DH and adults with CD. The progressive expansion of the epitope-binding profile of IgA antitransglutaminase antibodies in patients with CD may explain the development of DH in patients with undiagnosed CD during their adult life.","['Hull CM', 'Liddle M', 'Hansen N', 'Meyer LJ', 'Schmidt L', 'Taylor T', 'Jaskowski TD', 'Hill HR', 'Zone JJ']",2008,159,1,Br J Dermatol,"Hull CM, et al.

METHODS: Children with suspected CD and positive EMA (>or=1/10) undergoing small bowel biopsy during 1996 to 2002, were investigated (n=133). Data registered were: year and month of birth, timing of the first biopsy, sex, heredity for CD, dermatitis herpetiformis and diabetes mellitus and outcome of the anti-gliadin antibody test (AGA). The case group, with EMA positivity and normal histology (n=39; 59% female, mean age at the first biopsy 7.3 years, range 1.4-16), was compared with the disease control group, with positive EMA and a biopsy suggestive and further on diagnosed as CD (n=94; 56% female; mean age 7.6 years at the first biopsy, range 0.70-17).
RESULTS: AGA positivity and heredity for CD were found to predict the outcome of a pathological jejunal mucosa. Nineteen of the 39 children in the case group were rebiopsied of whom 11 had developed an enteropathy during a follow-up period of 2-7 years (median 4.5 years).
CONCLUSIONS: EMA positivity in the absence of small bowel enteropathy could be a very early predictor for later overt CD, and necessitates further follow-up, especially if the child is AGA positive and there is a family history of CD.","['Grodzinsky E', 'Fälth-Magnusson K', 'Högberg L', 'Jansson G', 'Laurin P', 'Stenhammar L']",2008,97,7,Acta Paediatr,"Grodzinsky E, et al.

18447142,Cold urticaria and celiac disease.,"Cold urticaria can be associated with blood and thyroid disorders, drugs, or infections. Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by permanent gluten intolerance. It is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as chronic idiopathic urticaria. Nevertheless, association with cold urticaria has not yet been described. A boy aged 3 years 8 months presented local urticaria-angioedema when exposed to cold temperatures. An ice cube test was positive and iron deficiency anemia was demonstrated. He later developed legume intolerance, rhinoconjunctivitis related to pollen sensitization, and asthma. Due to persistence of cold urticaria symptoms and refractory anemia, a test for immunoglobulin A autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase and an intestinal biopsy were performed. Results of both tests were compatible with celiac disease.A study of human leukocyte antigen indicated a high risk phenotype (HLA, DR6/DR7; DQA 0501, 0201; DQB 0301, 0201). After 7 months of a gluten-free diet, the boy's anemia resolved and he is free of symptoms when exposed to cold. This is a first description of the possibility of an association between celiac disease and cold urticaria. A poor course of cold urticaria in the absence of evidence of another underlying condition should lead to suspicion of celiac disease.","['Pedrosa Delgado M', 'Martín Muñoz F', 'Polanco Allué I', 'Martín Esteban M']",2008,18,2,J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol,"Pedrosa Delgado M, et al.

18431060,A history of coeliac disease.,"Coeliac disease may have an ancient history dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The first clear description was given by Samuel Gee in 1888. He suggested that dietary treatment might be of benefit. In the early 20th century various diets were tried, with some success, but without clear recognition of the toxic components. The doctoral thesis of Wim Dicke of 1950 established that exclusion of wheat, rye and oats from the diet led to dramatic improvement. The toxicity was shown to be a protein component, referred to as gluten. Dicke's colleagues, Weijers and Van de Kamer, showed that measurement of stool fat reflected the clinical condition. Early studies were in children but stool fat measurements documented that the condition could be recognised in adults. Histological abnormalities of the lining of the small intestine were demonstrated beyond doubt by Paulley in 1954 and techniques of per-oral biopsy described by Royer in 1955 and Shiner in 1956 afforded reliable diagnosis. Concurrence in monozygotic twins suggested a genetic component, confirmed by studies of HLA antigens. Additional, non-genetic factors seem likely. Circulating antibodies suggest an immunological mechanism of damage and provide non-invasive screening tests. Lymphoma, adenocarcinoma and ulceration of the small intestine and a range of immunological disorders are associated. A relationship with dermatitis herpetiformis was suggested by Samman in 1955 and established by Shuster and Marks in 1965 and 1968. The Coeliac Society (now Coeliac UK) was founded in 1968 and similar societies now exist across the world. They provide an extremely valuable service. Present problems include definition of the tolerated levels of gluten, whether oats are toxic for some or all coeliacs and the likelihood that the condition is relatively common and frequently without classical symptoms. Hope for the future is that more convenient methods of treatment will follow better understanding.",['Losowsky MS'],2008,26,2,Dig Dis,Losowsky MS. A history of coeliac disease.

18400063,Searching for foreign antigens as possible triggering factors of autoimmunity: Torque Teno virus DNA prevalence is elevated in sera of patients with bullous pemphigoid.,"OBJECTIVE: The Torque Teno virus (TTV), a member of virus genus Anellovirus has been shown to be commonly present in humans, yet without detectable pathogenicity. Recent studies imply that TTV may contribute to provoke autoimmune progresses in systemic lupus erythematosus and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. We aimed to study the presence of TTV in a group of patients with autoimmune bullous diseases with a further goal to identify long-lasting foreign antigen, such as TTV as possible triggers of skin-specific autoimmunity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed in silico research to study similarities between known TTV sequences and antigens of bullous pemphigoid (BP), pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Basic Local Alignment Search Tool results showed matching regions for the major BP antigens BP180 and BP230, PV antigen desmoglein 3 and DH antigen transglutaminase 3 and disclosed overlapping, antigen-predicted sequences only for BP180 regions. We also assessed the prevalence of TTV in these disorders and compared them with the results from two healthy blood donor groups (group 1: sex- and age-matched for the general bullous group, n = 95; group 2: sex- and age-matched for BP, n = 50). Furthermore, we assayed lymphocytes from four TTV DNA and BP180 NC16A blot-positive BP patients and three controls in a standard lymphocyte transformation test with a TTV peptide from the conserved ORF(Open Reading Frame)1/N22 region.
RESULTS: We found that the detection rate of TTV was comparable with that in healthy controls in the group of PV (19/33); whereas detection rates in DH showed a slight, but not significant tendency for elevation (17/20). Contrary, the TTV prevalence in BP patients was significantly elevated (group 1: 36/40 vs group 2: 31/50, P < 0.032). Lymphocytes from all four virus-positive BP patients heavily reacted to TTV peptide while two of the three healthy controls have shown not to recognize the viral sequences. Only the TTV carrier healthy control had a minor reaction at lowest peptide concentration.

18358192,[Smoking and the skin].,"Smoking is the main modifiable cause of disease and death in the developed world. Tobacco consumption is directly linked to cardiovascular disease, chronic bronchitis, and many malignant diseases. Tobacco also has many cutaneous effects, most of which are harmful. Smoking is closely associated with several dermatologic diseases such as psoriasis, pustulosis palmoplantaris, hidrosadenitis suppurativa, and systemic and discoid lupus erythematosus, as well as cancers such as those of the lip, oral cavity, and anogenital region. A more debatable relationship exists with melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, basal cell carcinoma, and acne. In contrast, smoking seems to protect against mouth sores, rosacea, labial herpes simplex, pemphigus vulgaris, and dermatitis herpetiformis. In addition to the influence of smoking on dermatologic diseases, tobacco consumption is also directly responsible for certain dermatoses such as nicotine stomatitis, black hairy tongue, periodontal disease, and some types of urticaria and contact dermatitis. Furthermore, we should not forget that smoking has cosmetic repercussions such as yellow fingers and fingernails, changes in tooth color, taste and smell disorders, halitosis and hypersalivation, and early development of facial wrinkles.",['Just-Sarobé M'],2008,99,3,Actas Dermosifiliogr,Just-Sarobé M.

HS1,2-A contains binding sites for several transcription factors. There are four known alleles, that is, (*)1, (*)2, (*)3, and (*)4, which differ in their lengths in transcription factor binding. We showed that in celiac disease the frequency of the (*)2 allele is increased. Both dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and psoriasis can be associated with different frequencies with celiac disease. Thus, we further investigate the frequency of allele (*)2 in DH, plaque psoriatic, and psoriatic arthritis patients. HS1,2-A allele frequencies were investigated in 37 DH, 61 plaque psoriatic, 28 psoriatic arthritis patients, and 265 healthy donors, age- and sex-matched, from the same geographical area. The frequency of the (*)2 allele changes from 0.39 in controls to 0.63 in DH, 0.59 in plaque psoriasis and 0.75 in psoriatic arthritis (P between 10(-4)-10(-5)).

18315580,"No increase in risk of fracture, malignancy or mortality in dermatitis herpetiformis: a cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis forms part of the same spectrum of gluten-sensitive disorders as coeliac disease yet may have different risks of morbidity and mortality.
AIMS: To quantify the risks of fracture, malignancy and mortality in people with dermatitis herpetiformis compared with the general population.
METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database, we identified 846 people with dermatitis herpetiformis and 4225 age-, gender- and practice-matched controls. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios.
RESULTS: Comparing people with dermatitis herpetiformis to the general population, the overall hazard ratio for any fracture was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.77-1.52). The overall hazard ratio for any malignancy was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.73-1.49); there was no increased risk of gastrointestinal (HR: 1.6; 95% CI: 0.67-3.67) or lymphoproliferative cancers (HR: 1.6; 95% CI: 0.44-6.06). A reduction in risk of breast cancer was not statistically significant (HR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.03-1.39). The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.70-1.23).
CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the fivefold increase in risk seen in coeliac disease, we found no increased risk of lymphoproliferative cancer and no increase in fracture, malignancy or mortality in people with dermatitis herpetiformis compared with the general population. It is not clear whether differences in degree of intestinal inflammation or other reasons account for this.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 100 DIFs on suspected VBL of skin. DIF, histology and clinical data were reviewed. 73/100 cases showed DIF patterns concordant with clinical/histologic diagnosis. The sensitivity of DIF was 88% in Pemphigus group (39/ 44), 82% in Bullous Pemphigoid (BP) (23/28), and 20% in Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) (1/5).18 cases of histologically proven VBL were negative and of these, 4 had no epidermis. The remaining 9 cases were discordant with clinical/histologic features, including 4 BP and 5 DH, whose histology was non-specific and will be discussed in detail. One case of DH showed an aberrant vasculitic pattern. DIF is of great value in the diagnosis of VBL, specially in clinical/histologic dilemmas. In DH, neither biopsy nor DIF were very useful and response to therapy was the standard. Sampling errors contributed to false negative results.

18301806,Celiac disease.,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder caused by the continued ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye, by predisposed individuals. With the development of highly sensitive serologic tests, this has become an increasingly recognized disease with prevalence as high as 1% in certain patient populations, such as Caucasian females. Almost all celiac patients carry the human leukocyte antigen DQ2/DQ8 gene. Much has recently been discovered about the role of the innate immune system in exposing genetically vulnerable patients to the pathogenic gliadin fraction of gluten. The ""classical"" presentation of chronic diarrhea and malabsorption is now a rarity. Due to earlier detection and increased awareness, celiac disease now presents with a myriad of ""atypical"" signs and symptoms such as iron-deficiency anemia and osteoporosis. Associated conditions include T-cell lymphoma, dermatitis herpetiformis, autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis requires serologic confirmation with either antiendomysial or antitransglutaminase antibodies as well as histologic confirmation from endoscopic small bowel biopsy. The only effective treatment necessitates a lifelong, continual adherence to a gluten-free diet.",['Scherer JR'],2008,44,1,Drugs Today (Barc),Scherer JR. Celiac disease.

18258668,Haptoglobin polymorphism: a novel genetic risk factor for celiac disease development and its clinical manifestations.,"BACKGROUND: Haptoglobin (Hp) alpha-chain alleles 1 and 2 account for 3 phenotypes that may influence the course of inflammatory diseases via biologically important differences in their antioxidant, scavenging, and immunomodulatory properties. Hp1-1 genotype results in the production of small dimeric, Hp2-1 linear, and Hp2-2 cyclic polymeric haptoglobin molecules. We investigated the haptoglobin polymorphism in patients with celiac disease and its possible association to the presenting symptoms.
METHODS: We studied 712 unrelated, biopsy-proven Hungarian celiac patients (357 children, 355 adults; severe malabsorption 32.9%, minor gastrointestinal symptoms 22.8%, iron deficiency anemia 9.4%, dermatitis herpetiformis 15.6%, silent disease 7.2%, other 12.1%) and 384 healthy subjects. We determined haptoglobin phenotypes by gel electrophoresis and assigned corresponding genotypes.
RESULTS: Hp2-1 was associated with a significant risk for celiac disease (P = 0.0006, odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.20-1.98; prevalence 56.9% in patients vs 46.1% in controls). It was also overrepresented among patients with mild symptoms (69.2%) or silent disease (72.5%). Hp2-2 was less frequent in patients than in controls (P = 0.0023), but patients having this phenotype were at an increased risk for severe malabsorption (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.60-3.07) and accounted for 45.3% of all malabsorption cases. Celiac and dermatitis herpetiformis patients showed similar haptoglobin phenotype distributions.
CONCLUSIONS: The haptoglobin polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to celiac disease and its clinical presentations. The predominant genotype in the celiac population was Hp2-1, but Hp2-2 predisposed to a more severe clinical course. The phenotype-dependent effect of haptoglobin may result from the molecule's structural and functional properties.","['Papp M', 'Foldi I', 'Nemes E', 'Udvardy M', 'Harsfalvi J', 'Altorjay I', 'Mate I', 'Dinya T', 'Varvolgyi C', 'Barta Z', 'Veres G', 'Lakatos PL', 'Tumpek J', 'Toth L', 'Szathmari E', 'Kapitany A', 'Gyetvai A', 'Korponay-Szabo IR']",2008,54,4,Clin Chem,"Papp M, et al.

18077767,Myosin IXB gene region and gluten intolerance: linkage to coeliac disease and a putative dermatitis herpetiformis association.,"BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease is caused by dietary gluten, which triggers chronic inflammation of the small intestine in genetically predisposed individuals. In one quarter of the patients the disease manifests in the skin as dermatitis herpetiformis. Recently, a novel candidate gene, myosin IXB on chromosome 19p13, was shown to be associated with coeliac disease in the Dutch and Spanish populations. The same gene has previously been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis risk, making myosin IXB a potential shared risk factor in these inflammatory disorders.
METHODS: In this study, previously reported myosin IXB variants were tested for genetic linkage and association with coeliac disease in 495 Hungarian and Finnish families and in an additional 270 patients and controls.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results show significant linkage (logarithm of odds (LOD) 3.76, p = 0.00002) to 19p13 which supports the presence of a genuine risk factor for coeliac disease in this locus. Myosin IXB variants were not associated with coeliac disease in this study; however, weak evidence of association with dermatitis herpetiformis was found. The association could not explain the strong linkage seen in both phenotypes, indicating that the role of other neighbouring genes in the region cannot be excluded. Therefore, more detailed genetic and functional studies are required to characterise the role of the myosin IXB gene in both coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Koskinen LL', 'Korponay-Szabo IR', 'Viiri K', 'Juuti-Uusitalo K', 'Kaukinen K', 'Lindfors K', 'Mustalahti K', 'Kurppa K', 'Adány R', 'Pocsai Z', 'Széles G', 'Einarsdottir E', 'Wijmenga C', 'Mäki M', 'Partanen J', 'Kere J', 'Saavalainen P']",2008,45,4,J Med Genet,"Koskinen LL, et al.

18063505,Dermatitis herpetiformis and vitiligo.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare immunobullous disorder of the skin that is associated with gluten hypersensitivity. Subepidermal IgA-type antibody deposition against tissue transglutaminase leads to dense neutrophilic microabscess and eventually into vesicles in dermal papillae, which may occasionally merge into bullae. Being a subepidermal vesiculobullous disorder, DH is frequently associated with postinflammatory pigmentary changes, particularly hypopigmentation. However, the association of DH with true vitiligo is extremely rare. Here, we report a 21-year-old male with vitiligo and comorbid DH, and review the literature. This new case had severely pruritic, papular and papulovesicular lesions that were localized symmetrically and partly confined to the pre-existing vitiliginous areas. The skin biopsy specimen taken from an erythematous papule on the elbow showed characteristic findings of DH and vitiligo. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of the perilesional skin revealed granular IgA deposition of dermal papillae. There are only 10 reports in the literature of DH and vitiligo comorbidity.","['Karabudak O', 'Dogan B', 'Yildirim S', 'Harmanyeri Y', 'Anadolu-Brasie R']",2007,70,11,J Chin Med Assoc,"Karabudak O, et al.

17948135,Consumption of pure oats by individuals with celiac disease: a position statement by the Canadian Celiac Association.,"The treatment of celiac disease is a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for life. In the past, oats were considered to be toxic to individuals with celiac disease and were not allowed in a gluten-free diet. However, recent evidence suggests that oats that are pure and uncontaminated with other gluten-containing grains, if taken in limited quantities, are safe for most individuals with celiac disease. For adults, up to 70 g (1/2 to 3/4 cup) of oats per day and for children, up to 25 g (1/4 cup) per day are safe to consume. These oats and oat products must fulfill the standards for a gluten-free diet set by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada. The Canadian Celiac Association, in consultation with Health Canada, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, has established requirements for growing, processing, and purity testing and labelling of pure oats. These strategies have led to the production of pure, uncontaminated oats for the first time in Canada. Oats and oat products that are safe for consumption by individuals with celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are now commercially available in Canada.","['Rashid M', 'Butzner D', 'Burrows V', 'Zarkadas M', 'Case S', 'Molloy M', 'Warren R', 'Pulido O', 'Switzer C']",2007,21,10,Can J Gastroenterol,"Rashid M, et al.

We describe a series of patients with DH, focusing on associated disorders (particularly celiac disease), incidence of lymphoma, histopathology, and sensitivity of direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing and serologic testing with antiendomysium antibodies for the diagnosis of DH.
METHODS: The medical records of 264 patients with DH diagnosed between 1970 and 1996 were reviewed retrospectively. In addition, the records of six patients evaluated before the advent of DIF testing between 1932 and 1969 were reviewed.
RESULTS: Established celiac disease was present in 12.6% of patients with DH, autoimmune systemic disorders in 22.2%, malignant neoplasms in 10.4%, sarcoidosis in four patients, and ulcerative colitis in six patients. Lymphoproliferative disorders were found in seven patients. The histopathologic examinations showed a marked predominance of neutrophils in the inflammatory infiltrate. DIF testing was positive in 92.4% of the patients tested. Indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated circulating antiendomysial antibodies in the sera of 40 of the 63 patients tested (63.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of patients with DH from a single institution, patients had a low incidence of symptomatic gluten-sensitive enteropathy, low risk of lymphoproliferative disorders, and associations with other systemic autoimmune disorders. The value of DIF testing in the diagnosis of DH was confirmed. The detection of antiendomysial antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence was less sensitive than indicated by other reports.","['Alonso-Llamazares J', 'Gibson LE', 'Rogers RS']",2007,46,9,Int J Dermatol,"Alonso-Llamazares J, et al.

17804560,Gluten ataxia: passive transfer in a mouse model.,"Gluten sensitivity is an autoimmune disease that usually causes intestinal atrophy resulting in a malabsorption syndrome known as celiac disease. However, gluten sensitivity may involve several organs and is often associated with extraintestinal manifestations. Typically, patients with celiac disease have circulating anti-tissue transglutaminase and anti-gliadin antibodies. When patients with gluten sensitivity are affected by other autoimmune diseases, other autoantibodies may arise like anti-epidermal transglutaminase in dermatitis herpetiformis, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies in thyroiditis, and anti-islet cells antibodies in type 1 diabetes. The most common neurological manifestation of gluten sensitivity is ataxia, the so-called gluten ataxia (GA). In patients with GA we have demonstrated that anti-gliadin and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies cross-react with neurons but that additional anti-neural antibodies are present. The aim of the present article is to review the knowledge on animal models of gluten sensitivity, as well as reviewing the role of anti-neural antibodies in GA.","['Boscolo S', 'Sarich A', 'Lorenzon A', 'Passoni M', 'Rui V', 'Stebel M', 'Sblattero D', 'Marzari R', 'Hadjivassiliou M', 'Tongiorgi E']",2007,1107,,Ann N Y Acad Sci,"Boscolo S, et al.

17762854,Transglutaminase autoantibodies in dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac sprue.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with intestinal gluten sensitivity. Epidermal transglutaminase (TGe) and closely related tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are considered to be autoantigens in DH, because a majority of DH patients have IgA specific for TGe and for tTG. It is unknown where and how these autoantigen-specific IgAs are generated in DH. Results reported in this paper on nine DH patients on a gluten containing diet demonstrate that the levels of circulating anti-tTG IgA and anti-TGe IgA in DH are correlated with each other and that both appear to be correlated with the degree (extent) of enteropathy. An analysis of 15 untreated celiac sprue (CS) patients demonstrated that approximately 33% of CS patients had elevated levels of anti-TGe IgA. These results would indicate that intestinal damage is associated with the production of anti-tTG IgA and anti-TGe IgA in DH patients.","['Marietta EV', 'Camilleri MJ', 'Castro LA', 'Krause PK', 'Pittelkow MR', 'Murray JA']",2008,128,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Marietta EV, et al.

17655376,"Pharmacokinetics of dapsone gel, 5% for the treatment of acne vulgaris.","BACKGROUND: Oral dapsone has been available for over 60 years and has been used to treat severe acne vulgaris; however, the oral formulation is known to cause dose-dependent haematological reactions and is currently indicated only for diseases such as dermatitis herpetiformis and Hansen's disease. A gel formulation of dapsone was recently developed to treat acne vulgaris. As dapsone is administered topically, it was expected that systemic absorption would be considerably lower than that observed with oral dapsone therapy, thereby avoiding any adverse haematological effects.
OBJECTIVE: To report the pharmacokinetic profile of topically applied dapsone gel, 5% in the treatment of acne vulgaris.
STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Three prospective, open-label studies enrolled a total of 548 subjects with acne vulgaris: two phase I pharmacokinetic studies (crossover and drug interaction) and one phase III long-term safety study. In the crossover study (n = 18), topical dapsone gel applied twice daily for a total of 14 days to 22.5% of the body surface area was compared with a single dose of oral dapsone 100mg (the typical clinical dose). In the drug-interaction study (n = 24), oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole monotherapy, topical dapsone gel monotherapy and the two in combination were used twice daily for 7, 21 and 7 days, respectively. In the long-term safety study (n = 506), topical dapsone gel was applied twice daily to acne-affected areas for up to 12 months. Blood samples were drawn at various timepoints in each study to assess drug and metabolite concentrations. Systemic concentrations of dapsone, N-acetyl dapsone, dapsone hydroxylamine, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were determined, according to the study design.
RESULTS: In the crossover study, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours for dapsone was 417.5 ng x h/mL after 2 weeks of dapsone gel therapy (n = 10), compared with an AUC from time zero to infinity of 52,641 ng x h/mL after a single dose of oral dapsone; this represents a 126-fold lower systemic exposure for dapsone gel at typical therapeutic doses. In the drug-interaction study, the AUC from 0 to 12 hours for dapsone was 221.52 ng x h/mL after 3 weeks of dapsone gel monotherapy compared with 320.3 ng x h/mL after 1 week of coadministration with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In the long-term safety study, the mean plasma dapsone concentrations ranged from 7.5 to 11 ng/mL over 12 months. Overall, total systemic exposures to dapsone and its metabolites were approximately 100-fold less for dapsone gel than for oral dapsone, even in the presence of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. There were no reports of any haematological adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of dapsone gel in various settings ranging from 2 weeks to 12 months resulted in systemic exposures to dapsone and its metabolites that were approximately 100-fold less than those after oral dapsone at a therapeutic dose level. The concentrations of dapsone and its metabolites reached steady state and did not increase during prolonged treatment.","['Thiboutot DM', 'Willmer J', 'Sharata H', 'Halder R', 'Garrett S']",2007,46,8,Clin Pharmacokinet,"Thiboutot DM, et al.

We hypothesized that the mucosal immune response to gluten is responsible for the elevated serum IL-8. Six DH patients were studied while on a gluten-free diet (GFD), whereas four continued on a normal diet. Patients were followed for a mean 2.2 years and serum IL-8 was analyzed. Small bowel biopsies from five DH patients on normal diets, two DH patients on GFD, and six subjects with no small bowel abnormalities were analyzed for IL-8 mRNA. Serum IL-8 levels normalized in five of six patients on GFD and decreased in one, whereas serum IL-8 levels showed no statistically significant change in DH patients on normal diets. Small bowel biopsies from DH patients on normal diets had increased expression of IL-8 mRNA compared to normal subjects, whereas patients on a GFD showed no significant increase in small bowel mRNA. No significant IL-8 mRNA was detected in normal skin biopsies from patients with DH. These observations suggest that the IL-8 in the serum of patients with DH originates from the small bowel as a mucosal immune response to gluten ingestion.","['Hall RP', 'Benbenisty KM', 'Mickle C', 'Takeuchi F', 'Streilein RD']",2007,127,9,J Invest Dermatol,"Hall RP, et al.

The aim of this case-control study was to assess prevalence of enamel hypoplasia, recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), dermatitis herpetiformis and atrophic glossitis in an Italian cohort of patients with CD.
METHODS: Fifty patients with CD and fifty healthy subjects (age range: 3-25 years), matched for age, gender and geographical area, were evaluated by a single trained examiner. Diagnosis of oral diseases was based on typical medical history and clinical features. Histopathological analysis was performed when needed. Adequate univariate statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Enamel hypoplasia was observed in 26% cases vs 16% in controls (p > 0.2; OR = 1.8446; 95% CI = 0.6886: 4.9414). Frequency of RAS in the CD group was significantly higher (36% vs 12%; p = 0.0091; OR = 4.125; 95% CI = 1.4725: 11.552) in CD group than that in controls (36% vs 12%). Four cases of atrophic glossitis and 1 of dermatitis herpetiformis were found in CD patients vs 1 and none, respectively, among controls.

17521373,Immunopathology and molecular diagnosis of autoimmune bullous diseases.,"Autoimmune bullous diseases are associated with autoimmunity against structural components maintaining cell-cell and cell matrix adhesion in the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus diseases are characterized by autoantibodies against the intercellular junctions and intraepithelial blisters. In pemphigoid diseases and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, sub-epidermal blistering is associated with autoantibodies targeting proteins of the hemidesmosomal anchoring complex. The autoantigens in autoimmune blistering diseases have been extensively characterized over the past three decades. In general, the pathogenicity of autoantibodies, already suggested by clinical observations, has been conclusively demonstrated experimentally. Detection of tissue-bound and circulating serum autoantibodies and characterization of their molecular specificity is mandatory for the diagnosis of autoimmune blistering diseases. For this purpose, various immunofluorescence methods as well as immunoassays, including immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoprecipitation have been developed. This review article describes the immunopathological features of autoimmune bullous diseases and the immunological and molecular tests used for their diagnosis and monitoring.","['Mihai S', 'Sitaru C']",2007,11,3,J Cell Mol Med,Mihai S and Sitaru C.

17414431,Histopathology of anti-p200 pemphigoid.,"Anti-p200 pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by circulating and tissue-bound antibodies against a 200-kd glycoprotein (p200) of the human dermis. We reviewed 10 lesional biopsies from seven patients with anti-p200 pemphigoid in an attempt to define typical histopathologic features of this disease. All biopsy specimens showed subepidermal blistering and a moderate to dense inflammatory infiltrate in the upper dermis. Immunohistochemical analysis localized type IV collagen to the dermal side of the blister, suggesting that split formation occurred within the lamina lucida of the cutaneous basement membrane. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed almost exclusively of neutrophils in six biopsies and contained a mixture of neutrophils and eosinophils in the remaining four. In three specimens, microabscess formation in the papillary dermis adjacent to the blister cavity was noted. Neutrophilic and eosinophilic spongiosis was found in five and three biopsies, respectively. We conclude that histopathology of anti-p200 pemphigoid is characterized by subepidermal blistering and a superficial inflammatory infiltrate, which is usually dominated by neutrophils but occasionally contains significant numbers of eosinophils. While this microscopic picture mimics that of linear IgA disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, or bullous pemphigoid, it should also alert a histopathologist to the possibility of anti-p200 pemphigoid and prompt immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies for definite diagnosis or exclusion of this autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease.","['Rose C', 'Weyers W', 'Denisjuk N', 'Hillen U', 'Zillikens D', 'Shimanovich I']",2007,29,2,Am J Dermatopathol,"Rose C, et al.

17373979,Co-localization of IgA and TG3 on healthy skin of coeliac patients.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), the skin's expression of coeliac disease (CD), is induced by the presence of IgA antibodies and epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) as the main autoantigen, stored in the papillary dermis and on the vessel walls.
AIMS: To evaluate the presence of IgA and TG3 deposits, considered to be the first step in inducing DH, in healthy skin of coeliac patients without cutaneous manifestations.
METHODS: Punch biopsies were taken from 11 consecutive coeliac patients, two with DH and nine without cutaneous manifestations, three of whom were adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and evaluated for the presence of deposits in the upper dermis and vessel walls by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: In coeliac patients affected by DH we found the presence of IgA and TG3 deposits mainly on the upper dermis, but also in vessel walls. In all coeliac patients without DH and also in those patients who were following a strict GFD, we found widely variable deposits of IgA and TG3 in both the papillary dermis and the vessel walls, although a lower intensity of the fluorescence signal was detected than with coeliac patients affected by DH. Double immunostaining with anti-IgA and anti-TG3 antibodies showed a strong co-localization in the upper dermis in patients with DH and a weaker co-localization in those without DH.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the presence of IgA and TG3 deposits in the healthy skin of coeliac patients, which are considered to play a central role in the pathogenesis of DH.","['Cannistraci C', 'Lesnoni La Parola I', 'Cardinali G', 'Bolasco G', 'Aspite N', 'Stigliano V', 'Picardo M']",2007,21,4,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Cannistraci C, et al.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the possibility of treating all severe skin manifestations of DH by a GFD only.
METHODS: Seventy-two patients with DH were subdivided in two groups: group A (18 patients) underwent a GFD and received dapsone; group B (54 patients) underwent a GFD. Patients were subdivided into slight, moderate and severe forms.
RESULTS: A total of 88.9% of patients treated with dapsone and a GFD (group A) had remission of skin manifestations and the remaining 11.1% were improved. In group B, 87% of patients showed complete remission of skin manifestations after 18 months of a GFD; 13% showed improvement.

17339147,Using desmoglein 1 and 3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as an adjunct diagnostic tool for pemphigus.,"BACKGROUND: Pemphigus is an acquired autoimmune intraepidermal blistering disease that is divided into 2 major subtypes: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). Patients with pemphigus have circulating anti-desmoglein (Dsg)1 and/or anti-Dsg3 IgG autoantibodies. Recently, a novel commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against Dsg1 and Dsg3 has been established and found to be extremely sensitive and specific. To date, the usefulness of Dsg1 and Dsg3 ELISA in the diagnosis of pemphigus in the Taiwanese population has never been reported.
METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 143 patients, including 20 patients with PV, 9 patients with PF, 72 patients with bullous pemphigoid, 1 patient with dermatitis herpetiformis and 41 patients with non-autoimmune blistering diseases. They were tested for anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3 reactivity by ELISA.
RESULTS: Seventeen of 20 PV sera (85%) exceeded the cut-off value of Dsg3 ELISA, and 9 of 9 PF sera (100%) exceeded the cut-off value of Dsg1 ELISA, while only 1 (0.88%) and 3 (2.6%) of 114 non-pemphigus sera exceeded the cut-off values of Dsg3 and Dsg1 ELISAs, respectively. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of Dsg3 ELISA were 85% and 99.1%, while the sensitivity and specificity of Dsg1 ELISA were 100% and 97.4%, respectively. The correlation between ELISA scores and disease activity along the time course was examined in 6 PV patients and 1 PF patient, and the result was equivocal.
CONCLUSION: Dsg1 and Dsg3 ELISAs provide a simple, highly sensitive and specific method that can serve as a useful adjunct tool for the initial diagnosis of pemphigus.","['Huang CH', 'Chen CC', 'Wang CJ', 'Chang YT', 'Liu HN']",2007,70,2,J Chin Med Assoc,"Huang CH, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To analyse the new onset or aggravation of skin lesions in patients with a rheumatic disease during treatment with TNF-alpha antagonists.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of 35 of 150 patients with a long history of rheumatic disease, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew's disease) and psoriatic arthritis, to test for the development of cutaneous manifestations during anti-TNF-alpha (infliximab, adalimumab or etanercept) treatment.
RESULTS: Chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema-like manifestations represented the majority of cases (16 of 35). Cutaneous infections caused by viral, bacterial and fungal agents were also observed in many patients (13 of 35). Skin diseases such as dermatitis herpetiformis, leucocytoclastic vasculitis and alopecia occurred in single cases only.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a broad, diverse clinical spectrum with a majority of chronic inflammatory and infectious skin diseases. However, we did not identify individual risk factors and a discontinuation of the anti-TNF-alpha treatment was not necessary if adequate dermatological treatment was performed. The onset of cutaneous side-effects in anti-TNF-alpha-based treatments should be determined by nationwide registries.","['Lee HH', 'Song IH', 'Friedrich M', 'Gauliard A', 'Detert J', 'Röwert J', 'Audring H', 'Kary S', 'Burmester GR', 'Sterry W', 'Worm M']",2007,156,3,Br J Dermatol,"Lee HH, et al.

Pregnancy-specific skin conditions include pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy, prurigo of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, impetigo herpetiformis, and pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy are the most common of these disorders. Most skin conditions resolve postpartum and only require symptomatic treatment. However, there are specific treatments for some conditions (e.g., melasma, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, impetigo herpetiformis, pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy). Antepartum surveillance is recommended for patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, impetigo herpetiformis, and pemphigoid gestationis.","['Tunzi M', 'Gray GR']",2007,75,2,Am Fam Physician,Tunzi M and Gray GR.

17253133,Dermatitis herpetiformis: no evidence of bone disease despite evidence of enteropathy.,"The majority of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have small intestinal enteropathy that may result in bone loss. The objective of this study was to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) in DH and to examine whether dietary treatment or degree of the small intestinal lesion correlate with BMD. Twenty-five patients with DH (18 men) were investigated. Detailed dietary assessment and duodenal biopsies were performed on all patients before entry into the study. BMD at lumbar spine and femur was determined by DXA scan. Bone biomarkers, vitamin D, and parathyroid status were assessed. Twenty patients had enteropathy. None of the patients had hypovitaminosis D or secondary hyperparathyroidism. Resorption and formation markers were within normal limits. BMD Z-scores were not significantly different from expected (-0.38; CI, -0.84 to 0.07) and femur (0.46; CI, -0.06 to 0.97). There was no relationship between BMD Z-scores and the severity of the degree of enteropathy. We conclude that enteropathy of differing severity is present in 80% of patients with DH, but this is not associated with bone disease.","['Abuzakouk M', 'Barnes L', ""O'Gorman N"", ""O'Grady A"", 'Mohamed B', 'McKenna MJ', 'Freaney R', 'Feighery C']",2007,52,3,Dig Dis Sci,"Abuzakouk M, et al.

17245213,Diagnosis of celiac disease in clinical practice: physician's alertness to the condition essential.,"GOALS: We have for several years been training health personnel to recognize celiac disease, and have advocated serologic screening in risk groups. The aim was to establish whether this approach would offer an alternative to population screening, which has yielded a prevalence of 1% in Finland.
BACKGROUND: The number of detected celiac disease cases is much lower than that obtained in serologic screening studies.
STUDY: Nationwide recommendations for the detection of celiac disease were published in 1998, and training of health personnel took place in 2001 to 2002. The prevalence of celiac disease was calculated from the national registry of patients receiving reimbursement for dietary costs, attested by physician's statement. In 1 of the 10 statements the diagnostic criteria and clinical manifestations were scrutinized.
RESULTS: The nationwide prevalence of celiac disease was 0.45%; 0.7% in the highest to 0.3% in the lowest area. The annual number of new patients increased from 5/100,000 in the early 1980s to 20/100,000 today. The percentage of patients found in risk groups (relatives of celiac disease patients, patients with extraintestinal symptoms or concomitant autoimmune disorders) was currently 16.3% in the high and 6.6% in the low prevalence area. Seventeen percent of patients had dermatitis herpetiformis, and its incidence was declining.
CONCLUSIONS: A maximal prevalence of 0.7% of celiac disease was ascertained; educating primary health care staff regarding the protean manifestations of the disease seemed to be the key issue. The increase in incidence implies that a prevalence of 1.0% is possible, rendering population screening unnecessary.","['Collin P', 'Huhtala H', 'Virta L', 'Kekkonen L', 'Reunala T']",2007,41,2,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Collin P, et al.

The pathogenesis of this dermatosis is unknown, although an Arthus-type reaction to bacterial and viral antigens seems involved. We describe a case of EED in a 9 year-old child suffering from recurrent pharyngotonsillitis induced by Streptococcus pyogenes. Clinical presentation of the dermatosis was atypical, with vesicles and bullae intermingled with red-purple papules and plaques distributed mainly over the extensor aspects of the extremities. Histopathological examination of a vesiculo-bullous lesion revealed a subepidermal bulla containing neutrophils and nuclear dust suggesting dermatitis herpetiformis. Fibrin in vessel walls was observed throughout the dermis. Direct immunofluorescence was negative. A prompt and complete response to sulphone therapy was obtained in conjunction with tonsillectomy. Clinicians should be aware of atypical presentations of EED in children with vesicles and bullae mimicking During's disease.","['Tomasini C', 'Seia Z', 'Dapavo P', 'Soro E', 'Addese C', 'Pippione M']",2006,16,6,Eur J Dermatol,"Tomasini C, et al.

17225447,Celiac disease serology in dermatitis herpetiformis. Which is the best option for detecting gluten sensitivity?,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a well-established gluten-sensitive skin disorder presenting variable degrees of enteropathy, constitutes a very useful model in order to assess the utility of the celiac disease (CD)-related serology in patients with mild intestinal damage.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore comparatively the performance of a panel of CD-related serologic tests in patients with DH.
METHODS: We assessed a series of 18 consecutive patients with skin biopsy proven DH presenting the overall spectrum of intestinal damage ranging from normal mucosa (n = 6) to total villous atrophy (TVA) (n = 6) through partial villous atrophy (PVA) (n = 6). Sera were obtained from all patients while consuming a gluten containing diet. Serologic tests were antiendomysial, anti-tissue transglutaminase and antigliadin antibodies, and newly developed tests detecting both antibody isotypes (IgA and IgG) against deamidated synthetic gliadin-derived peptides (a-GDP).
RESULTS: Serologic tests had a variable behaviour depending on the degree of enteropathy. While the majority of tests detected patients with TVA, only 50% of those with normal histology had positive assays. Patients with PVA had discordant results. Classical CD-specific tests were positive in only some patients with mild damage while all of them were identifed by a single assay detecting both isotypes of a-GDR CONCLUSION: The detection of a-GDP antibodies was the most reliable tool in order to identify gluten sensitivity in DH patients presenting a wide range of intestinal damage. Further studies should explore if these findings can be extrapolated to patients with CD having mild enteropathy.","['Sugai E', 'Smecuol E', 'Niveloni S', 'Vázquez H', 'Label M', 'Mazure R', 'Czech A', 'Kogan Z', 'Mauriño E', 'Bai JC']",2006,36,4,Acta Gastroenterol Latinoam,"Sugai E, et al.

17075969,Celiac disease.,"Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disorder, induced by the intake of gluten proteins present in wheat, barley and rye. Contrary to common belief, this disorder is a protean systemic disease, rather than merely a pure digestive alteration. CD is closely associated with genes that code HLA-II antigens, mainly of DQ2 and DQ8 classes. Previously, it was considered to be a rare childhood disorder, but is actually considered a frequent condition, present at any age, which may have multiple complications. Tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTG), appears to be an important component of this disease, both, in its pathogenesis and diagnosis. Active CD is characterized by intestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, and strongly positive tTG auto-antibodies. The duodenal biopsy is considered to be the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis, but its practice has significant limitations in its interpretation, especially in adults. Occasionally, it results in a false-negative because of patchy mucosal changes and the presence of mucosal villous atrophy is often more severe in the proximal jejunum, usually not reached by endoscopic biopsies. CD is associated with increased rates of several diseases, such as iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, several neurologic and endocrine diseases, persistent chronic hypertransami-nasemia of unknown origin, various types of cancer and other autoimmune disorders. Treatment of CD dictates a strict, life-long gluten-free diet, which results in remission for most individuals, although its effect on some associated extraintestinal manifestations remains to be established.",['Rodrigo L'],2006,12,41,World J Gastroenterol,Rodrigo L.

None of the six studies found any significant difference in the serology between the oats and control groups. Two studies, however, identified a significant difference (p<0.001; p = 0.039) in intraepithelial lymphocyte counts between the oats and control groups. Oats can be symptomatically tolerated by most patients with coeliac disease; however, the long-term effects of a diet containing oats remain unknown.

17053738,[Disulone and hepatosiderosis].,"BACKGROUND: Disulone (dapsone + iron oxalate) is a sulfone used in the treatment of numerous skin diseases. We report two cases of hepatosiderosis secondary to long-term administration of Disulone.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case n degrees 1. A 51-year-old man was treated with Disulone for a neutrophilic skin disease. After 17 years of treatment, elevated serum ferritin and free iron with hemolysis were found. Liver biopsy confirmed hepatosiderosis. A diagnosis of genetic hemochromatosis was ruled out by the absence of C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Case n degrees 2. A 52-year-old man receiving Disulone for dermatitis herpetiformis for 25 years presented elevated serum ferritin and free iron with hemolysis. Hepatic iron overload was confirmed by liver biopsy. The absence of C282Y mutation (HFE gene) ruled out a diagnosis of genetic hemochromatosis.
DISCUSSION: In our two cases, hepatosiderosis was noted after long-term administration of Disulone. This complication has been reported only rarely. In murine models, a relationship was found between prolonged administration of dapsone and hepatic iron overload as revealed by hemolysis. Although it is difficult to extrapolate this relationship to humans with any certainty, our patients had also chronic hemolysis and iron overload secondary to administration of Disulone. Moreover in France, dapsone is marketed in combination with iron oxalate, with the attendant risk of iron overload. These cases raise the question of the need for serum ferritin analysis during Disulone therapy.","['Darrieux L', 'Adamski H', 'Turlin B', 'Ollivier I', 'Polard E', 'Deugnier Y', 'Chevrant-Breton J']",2006,133,8-9 Pt 1,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Darrieux L, et al.

METHODS: Sera were compared from groups of patients with autoimmune diseases, diseases involving organ specific enhanced cell death, celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, diseases of non-autoimmune origin, and a group without known disease. IgA antibodies against TGc were detected using human antigen (produced recombinantly in bacterial or human cells) in different systems (non-commercial ELISA with buffers of differing NaCl concentrations, and anti-TGc sandwich ELISA). Anti-gliadin and anti-endomysium antibodies were also determined.
RESULTS: Many sera from patients with autoimmune disorders gave a positive signal in the human TGc ELISAs. The signal appeared related to minor impurities in the recombinant human TGc used and to raised serum IgA antibody levels rather than to the occurrence of TGc specific antibodies in these patients.

Using immunohistochemistry technique, we examined the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinases-1, -3, and -9 and the tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-1 in duodenal biopsies from 30 patients with celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. We demonstrated that the percentage of cells expressing these enzymes and their inhibitor in all patients was significantly greater than in the normal controls (P < 0.0001). This was evident even in patients with a minimal lesion but was most marked in patients with severe damage, mirroring the degree of inflammation in the small intestinal tissue.

METHODS: A 15 year-trend (1990 to 2004) in duodenal biopsy performed when undertaking upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was studied. We analysed the prevalence of celiac disease in the overall group, and in the subgroups with anaemia and/or chronic diarrhoea.
RESULTS: Duodenal biopsy was performed in 1033 of 13 678 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies (7.6%); an increase in the use of such was observed over the study period (1.9% in 1990-1994, 5% in 1995-1999 and 12.8% in 2000-2004). Celiac disease was diagnosed in 22 patients (2.2%), this being more frequent in women than in men (3% and 1% respectively). Fourteen out of 514 (2.7%) patients with anaemia, 12 out of 141 (8.5%) with chronic diarrhoea and 8 out of 42 (19%) with anaemia plus chronic diarrhoea had celiac disease. A classical clinical presentation was observed in 55% of the cases, 23% of the patients had associated dermatitis herpetiformis and 64% presented anaemia; 9% were diagnosed by familial screening and 5% by cryptogenetic hypertransaminasaemia.

16935926,Mutagenesis of the catalytic triad of tissue transglutaminase abrogates coeliac disease serum IgA autoantibody binding.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is an autoantigen in coeliac disease and the related disorder, dermatitis herpetiformis. The detection of autoantibodies directed against tTG is a highly specific marker of coeliac disease; however, it is unclear if there is a role for these autoantibodies in the disease process. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the catalytic triad of tTG is targeted by coeliac disease autoantibodies.
METHODS: A full-length wild-type recombinant tTG and a novel site-directed mutagenic variant lacking the catalytic triad were produced in Escherichia coli. Serum samples from 61 biopsy-proven coeliac disease and 10 dermatitis herpetiformis patients were tested for their recognition of both antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Although IgA autoantibodies from sera of patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis bound wild-type tTG well, a dramatic decrease in binding to the mutant tTG was observed with a mean reduction of 79% in coeliac disease and 58% in dermatitis herpetiformis samples. IgG anti-tTG antibodies did not show a similar pattern of reduction, with no overall difference in recognition of the wild-type or mutant tTGs.

16772832,Health-related quality of life in adult coeliac disease in Germany: results of a national survey.,"OBJECTIVE: No national survey on the present clinical spectrum and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with coeliac disease has been conducted in Germany until now.
METHODS: The German Coeliac Society DZG posted a set of questionnaires (self-developed socio-demographic and medical questionnaire, the Short Form Health Survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Giessen Symptom Check List) to 1000/18 355 of their members who were >/=18 years (every 18th member following consecutive postal codes of the membership directory).
RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-six usable questionnaires were returned (diagnosis proven by biopsy; 78% female, median age 45.5 years). The median interval between the first medical examination due to symptoms of coeliac disease and the final diagnosis was 1 year. Ninety-eight percent reported a reduction of initial symptoms, 85% an improvement of HRQOL with a median gain in weight of 8 kg after starting a gluten-free diet (median duration of 6 years). Sixty-seven percent adhered all the time to the dietary regimen and 26% adhered most of the time. The most frequent diseases associated with coeliac disease were osteoporosis (15%), oral aphtae (12%) and dermatitis herpetiformis (9%). Because of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms 26% of the patients met the modified Rome I criteria for irritable bowel symptom. Compared to representative samples from the German population, coeliac disease patients had higher scores for anxiety , fatigue, dyspeptic and musculoskeletal pain, and a reduced HRQOL in 9/10 scales of the SF-36 (all P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Despite being on a gluten-free diet German coeliac disease patients suffer from a high burden of general and extra-intestinal symptoms and a reduced HRQOL.","['Häuser W', 'Gold J', 'Stein J', 'Caspary WF', 'Stallmach A']",2006,18,7,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Häuser W, et al.

The disease can be clearly distinguished from the other subepidermal blistering eruptions by histologic, immunologic, and gastrointestinal criteria. Most patients have an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy GSE that is usually asymptomatic. Both enteropathy and the dermatologic findings disappear with a gluten-free diet, therefore, DH is thought to be the specific dermatologic finding of celiac disease CD. An association between CD and autoimmune disease has been documented in several studies. Similar associations have been reported in DH. We report a 46-year-old man with DH diagnosed more than 10 years previously who developed GSE, pernicious anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis in the following years.","['Aydog E', 'Yesilli O', 'Sever A', 'Usan H']",2006,27,6,Saudi Med J,"Aydog E, et al.

To date, no cases of IgA deficiency have been reported in DH. In contrast, IgA deficiency is found in 2% to 3% of patients with celiac disease, a rate 10 to 15 times higher than the normal population. We report 2 patients with DH who also have partial IgA deficiency. We evaluated the sera of these patients for the presence of IgA autoantibodies to endomysium, tissue transglutaminase, epidermal transglutaminase, and gliadin. Both patients were found to have IgA endomysial and tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and serologic markers for DH. Corresponding IgG autoantibodies were not useful serologic markers of DH in the setting of IgA deficiency, as they often are in celiac disease. We then screened 98 DH sera for total IgA levels and identified 1 additional case with IgA deficiency. In conclusion, DH may develop in patients with partial IgA deficiency, indicating that pathogenically directed IgA antibodies are likely sufficient for cutaneous IgA deposition in this disease.","['Samolitis NJ', 'Hull CM', 'Leiferman KM', 'Zone JJ']",2006,54,5 Suppl,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Samolitis NJ, et al.

16627018,Malignancies and mortality in patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis: 30-year population-based study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: To assess the long-term risks of malignant diseases and mortality in patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis in a centre, where the prevalence of these diseases is high. The risks have probably been overestimated, as patients with subtle forms have earlier remained undetected.
PATIENTS: The study comprised 17,245 person-years of follow-up in 1147 patients.
METHODS: The observed numbers of malignancies and causes of deaths were assessed, and compared to those expected, and standardised incidence ratio and standardised mortality ratio given.
RESULTS: The occurrence of all malignant conditions was equal to that in the population both in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis: standardised incidence ratios of 1.2 (95% confidence intervals 0.9-1.5) and 1.0 (0.6-1.5), respectively. Five patients with coeliac disease and seven with dermatitis herpetiformis had developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma; standardised incidence ratios of 3.2 (1.0-7.5) and 6.0 (2.4-12.4), respectively. Four patients with coeliac disease and one with dermatitis herpetiformis had enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, associated with inadequate dietary compliance. Mortality was increased (standardised mortality ratio 1.26; 1.00-1.55) in coeliac disease, but decreased in dermatitis herpetiformis (standardised mortality ratio 0.52; 0.36-0.72).
CONCLUSION: The overall prognosis in our patients was good. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma emerged in patients with undiagnosed or poorly treated coeliac disease. The mortality rate in dermatitis herpetiformis was even lower than in the population. Our data support the early diagnosis and dietary treatment of these conditions.","['Viljamaa M', 'Kaukinen K', 'Pukkala E', 'Hervonen K', 'Reunala T', 'Collin P']",2006,38,6,Dig Liver Dis,"Viljamaa M, et al.

16609761,Chronic urticaria: a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease.,"Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune-mediated disease of the small bowel that results in malabsorption. It classically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms including chronic diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal bloating and anorexia. It is becoming more frequently identified in asymptomatic patients with a diagnosis of deficiencies related to malabsorption of iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. It is increasingly identified as a cause for early or refractory osteoporosis. Occasionally, celiac disease presents with cutaneous manifestations alone. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a well-recognized cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. Other cutaneous manifestations include alopecia, angular stomatitis and aphthous ulcerations. Described here is a case of a 24-year-old woman who presented with intermittent urticaria and gastrointestinal complaints. She was found to have celiac disease on small-bowel biopsy. Both her gastrointestinal symptoms and urticaria resolved when she was put on a gluten-free diet, suggesting that her urticaria was a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease.","['Haussmann J', 'Sekar A']",2006,20,4,Can J Gastroenterol,Haussmann J and Sekar A.

16575390,"Cutaneous endothelial cell activation in normal skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis associated with increased serum levels of IL-8, sE-Selectin, and TNF-alpha.","The mechanisms that lead to the development of skin lesions in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) are not known. We hypothesized that an ongoing immune response in the gut of patients with DH would result in an increase in circulating cytokines and be associated with endothelial cell activation, creating a proinflammatory environment in the skin. Skin biopsies from the normal-appearing inner arm of 11 DH patients, with no active skin lesions, and 12 normal subjects were analyzed for E-selectin (E-sel) and ICAM-1 mRNA. DH patients' skin expressed markedly increased levels of E-sel mRNA. Mean E-sel mRNA expression in DH skin was 1,271 (range 63.78-5861) times greater than that of a control, normal skin (P<0.001) with no significant increased expression of ICAM-1 mRNA. Serum levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-sel), IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and serum IL-8 levels were significantly increased in patients with DH. These studies demonstrate that patients with DH have evidence of endothelial cell activation in the skin and systemic manifestations of the ongoing inflammation associated with the mucosal immune response. Endothelial cell activation may play a critical role in the development of skin lesions in patients with DH and may represent a common mechanism for cutaneous manifestations of inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases.","['Hall RP', 'Takeuchi F', 'Benbenisty KM', 'Streilein RD']",2006,126,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Hall RP, et al.

The prevalence and clinical presentation of classical and subclinical/silent CD in 298 consecutive diagnosed celiac patients are described.
METHODS: From 1988 to 2000 we diagnosed 298 celiac patients (81 M and 217 F, mean age 27.9 yrs, range 15-65 yrs, F/M ratio: 2.4). 167 patients were referred to us due to gastrointestinal symptoms, while 131 from other specialists due to unexplained or unresponsive disease. In most of the patients (266/298) we performed sorbitol H2-breath test, while all patients underwent both total IgA and AGA/EMA evaluation, followed by gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal histological examination.
RESULTS: 155 (52.01%) and 143 (47.98%) patients showed classical and subclinical/silent CD respectively. The prevalence of the classical form decreased from 100% (7/7 patients) in 1988 to 26.19% (14/49 patients) in 2000, while the subclinical/silent form increased from 0% (0/7 patients) in 1988 to 76.08% (35/49 patients) in 2000. The most frequent extraintestinal marker of subclinical CD were iron-deficiency anemia (25.21%), alopecia and dermatitis herpetiformis (9.56%), while first-degree relatives (35.71%), Hyperthyroidism (21.42%) and insulin-dependent diabetes (17.85%) were the most frequent in silent CD. As for malabsorption concern, it was present in 81.93% of patients with classical form, while it was present in 33.91% and in 14.28% of patients with subclinical and silent form of celiac disease respectively.

There are also some data that metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the development of skin lesions in DH, however their exact role in this process is not fully understood. The aim of the study was to investigate whether MMPs and their inhibitors are involved in pathogenesis of DH. Skin biopsies were taken from 13 patients with active DH and from 10 healthy subjects. The localization and expression of MMPs and TIMPs were examined by immunohistochemistry. MMPs expression was detected in basal keratinocytes and in the whole epidermis in all of the DH subjects. Neutrophils in microabscesses and in blister fluid were also positive for MMPs. Expression of TIMPs was moderate or weak in all examined biopsies.

16476935,Autoantibody targeting of brain and intestinal transglutaminase in gluten ataxia.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of autoantibody deposition against type 2 tissue transglutaminase (TG2; a reliable marker of the whole spectrum of gluten sensitivity) in the jejunal tissue and brain of patients with gluten ataxia and in control subjects.
METHODS: The authors evaluated jejunal biopsy samples from nine patients with gluten ataxia and seven patients with other causes of ataxia for the presence of TG2-related immunoglobulin deposits using double-color immunofluorescence. Autopsy brain tissue from one patient with gluten ataxia and one neurologically intact brain were also studied.
RESULTS: IgA deposition on jejunal TG2 was found in the jejunal tissue of all patients with gluten ataxia and in none of the controls. The intestinal IgA deposition pattern was similar to that seen in patients with overt and latent celiac disease and in those with dermatitis herpetiformis. Widespread IgA deposition around vessels was found in the brain of the patient with gluten ataxia but not the control brain. The deposition was most pronounced in the cerebellum, pons, and medulla.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies are present in the gut and brain of patients with gluten ataxia with or without an enteropathy in a similar fashion to patients with celiac disease, latent celiac disease, and dermatitis herpetiformis but not in ataxia control subjects. This finding strengthens the contention that gluten ataxia is immune mediated and belongs to the same spectrum of gluten sensitivity as celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Hadjivassiliou M', 'Mäki M', 'Sanders DS', 'Williamson CA', 'Grünewald RA', 'Woodroofe NM', 'Korponay-Szabó IR']",2006,66,3,Neurology,"Hadjivassiliou M, et al.

16466621,New insights into the autoantibody-mediated mechanisms of autoimmune bullous diseases and urticaria.,"The skin is a common target of cellular and/or antibody mediated pathological immune responses. Pemphigoids, pemphigus vulgaris and dermatitis herpetiformis are bullous disease due to autoantibodies targeting specific proteins of the skin. The pemphigoid autoantigens are the BP180 and the BP230 antigens, two components of the epithelial basement membrane zone. Additional antigenic targets reported in a portion of patients are laminin 5, the alpha6 subunit of the hemidesmosomal integrin alpha6beta4 and a glycoprotein termed p200. The epidermal and mucosal epithelial cells detachment (acantholysis) characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris is induced by autoantibodies directed against the desmoglein 3 and 1. The desmogleins are desmosomal cadherins, which play a major role in the cell-to-cell adhesion. Dermatitis herpetiformis is regarded as cutaneous phenotype of coeliac disease. A novel autoimmune hypothesis of coeliac disease links wheat gliadin and tissue transglutaminase (TG2) in the gut, which leads to T cell response and IgA autoantibody formation. In dermatitis herpetiformis skin the target for IgA deposition seems to be epidermal TG3. Urticaria is a complex syndrome caused by both immune and non-immune mechanisms. In a subsets of patients with chronic urticaria mast cell degranulation is induced by autoantibodies directed against the a-subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor, and/or the IgE.","['Blank M', 'Gisondi P', 'Mimouni D', 'Peserico A', 'Piaserico S', 'Shoenfeld Y', 'Reunala T', 'Zambruno G', 'Di Zenzo G', 'Girolomoni G']",2006,24,1 Suppl 40,Clin Exp Rheumatol,"Blank M, et al.

16466620,Role of cellular immunity in the pathogenesis of autoimmune skin diseases.,"The pathomechanism of most autoimmune skin diseases is still elusive; however, recent clinical and basic research is leading novel insights into the cellular and molecular biological underlying pathways. Several types of infectious skin diseases are infiltrated by significant number of gamma/delta T cells and similar observations have been made in selected immune-mediated skin conditions. In particular, a role for gamma/delta T cells has been suggested in discoid lupus erythematosus, contact dermatitis, herpetiformis dermatitis, necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis, and cutaneous lesions of systemic sclerosis. The pathogenesis of these diseases is different and this may suggest multiple potential functions of this subset of T cells in the immune system of the skin. Furthermore, most T cells infiltrating tissue and organs undergoing fibrosis have the potential to produce high levels of interleukin 4. This is particularly true for the CD8+ or CD4+ CD8+ double positive T-cell subsets. Furthermore, leukocyte recruitment is a key event in immunity and a better understanding of the signals involved in autoimmune diseases constitutes a valuable basis for the development of new strategies, which control leukocyte migration and function under pathological conditions.","['Alaibac M', 'Berti E', 'Chizzolini C', 'Fineschi S', 'Marzano AV', 'Pigozzi B', 'Riboldi E', 'Sozzani S', 'Kuhn A']",2006,24,1 Suppl 40,Clin Exp Rheumatol,"Alaibac M, et al.

16436335,Gluten intolerance and skin diseases.,"Gluten sensitivity with or without coeliac disease (CD) symptoms and intestinal pathology has been suggested as a potentially treatable cause of various diseases. CD is a chronic disease which improves on withdrawal of wheat gliadins and barley, rye and oat prolamins from the diet. There have been numerous reports linking CD with several skin conditions. A body of evidence shows that dermatitis herpetiformis is actually a cutaneous manifestation of CD. Autoimmune diseases, allergic diseases, psoriasis and miscellaneous diseases have also been described with gluten intolerance. Dermatologists should be familiar with the appraisal of gluten sensitive enteropathy and should be able to search for an underlying gluten intolerance (GI). Serological screening by means of antigliadin, antiendomysial and transglutaminase antibodies should be performed. HLA typing is often useful in association with serologic tests. Intestinal biopsy is usually needed to establish the diagnosis of CD or GI. Thus, gluten intolerance gives rise to a variety of dermatological manifestations which may benefit from a gluten-free diet.","['Humbert P', 'Pelletier F', 'Dreno B', 'Puzenat E', 'Aubin F']",2006,16,1,Eur J Dermatol,"Humbert P, et al.

16415383,Defining urticarial dermatitis: a subset of dermal hypersensitivity reaction pattern.,"BACKGROUND: Urticarial dermatitis may represent a useful term for a subset of a reaction pattern designated most commonly as dermal hypersensitivity by pathologists. The term is not commonly used, and requires definition to determine whether it is clinically relevant.
OBJECTIVES: To define urticarial dermatitis and distinguish it from other urticarial reaction patterns and to review the frequency with which dermatologists can recognize clinical settings that match the biopsy findings of urticarial dermatitis.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of clinical and/or histological diagnosis of urticarial dermatitis, applying strict histological criteria in a center using urticarial dermatitis as a diagnostic term in 190 archived reports.
SETTING: Tertiary referral dermatopathology service reporting for dermatological practices in Sydney, Australia.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The correlation between clinical and histological diagnoses of urticarial dermatitis and alternate diagnoses was analyzed. The frequency of positive immunofluorescence findings for bullous pemphigoid was determined in a subset of patients with urticarial dermatitis in whom this test was ordered to exclude prodromal bullous pemphigoid.
RESULTS: Urticarial dermatitis was the histological diagnosis in at least 1 biopsy result in 148 patients, and matched the provisional clinical diagnosis in 49 (33.1%) patients. Urticarial dermatitis was the only diagnosis provided in 21 patients. The main alternate clinical diagnoses provided were early bullous pemphigoid or dermatitis herpetiformis (47 patients [31.8%]), dermatitis (39 patients [26.4%]), drug reaction (35 patients [23.6%]), urticarial vasculitis (24 patients [16.2%]), and urticaria (12 patients [8.1%]). In 91 patients with a clinical diagnosis of urticarial dermatitis, the histological diagnosis in at least 1 biopsy result was matched in 49 patients (53.8%); other histological diagnoses included dermatitis (21 patients [23.1%]), papular urticaria (12 patients [13.2%]), drug reaction (6 patients [6.6%]), and urticaria (3 patients [3.3%]). Review of 38 direct immunofluorescent results for prodromal bullous pemphigoid and a biopsy finding of urticarial dermatitis revealed only 3 positive results (7.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Urticarial dermatitis seems to be a useful histological and clinical term for a subset of the dermal hypersensitivity reaction pattern. Although the clinical presentation is not restricted to a specific entity, eczema and drug reactions seem to be the most frequent clinical associations; and in a subset of patients, urticarial dermatitis remains as a recognizable reaction pattern. Urticarial dermatitis without eosinophilic spongiosis is not a reliable indicator for bullous pemphigoid, because the findings of immunofluorescence are often negative.","['Kossard S', 'Hamann I', 'Wilkinson B']",2006,142,1,Arch Dermatol,"Kossard S, et al.

16405713,Transglutaminases as diagnostically relevant autoantigens in patients with gluten sensitivity.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with gluten sensitivity, i. e. celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis have anti-endomysial antibodies recognizing transglutaminases, which are usually detected on appropriate tissue sections. It would be desirable to have available a reliable, tissue-independent serological diagnostic tool. We compared disease-specificity and sensitivity of tTG versus eTG-based detection systems for the diagnosis of anti-endomysial IgA-antibodies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 204 serum samples in duplicates with commercial human ELISA-kits: 54 healthy blood donors, 20 celiac disease, 29 dermatitis herpetiformis and 101 with other autoimmune dermatoses.
RESULTS: The tTG-based ELISA proved to be very disease-specific (100 %) and sensitive for the diagnosis of gluten sensitivity (95 % celiac disease; 96.6 % dermatitis herpetiformis). The eTG-based ELISA was also perfectly specific (100 %), but only 15 % of celiac disease-sera and 44.8 % of dermatitis herpetiformis-sera yielded positive results.
CONCLUSIONS: The human tTG-ELISA fulfills all criteria of a screening test and, because of being investigator-independent, inexpensive and highly reproducible, compares favorably with the current diagnostic gold standard (indirect immunofluorescence and biopsy) of celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. The low sensitivity of the eTG-ELISA may have technical reasons, but could theoretically also be linked to disease activity or indicate the existence of an as yet undefined disease subset. Studies are currently under way to address these issues.","['Heil PM', 'Volc-Platzer B', 'Karlhofer F', 'Gebhart W', 'Huber WD', 'Benesch T', 'Vogelsang H', 'Stingl G']",2005,3,12,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,"Heil PM, et al.

16388717,The role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Apoptosis is a form of cell death that is claimed to be involved in a number of chronic inflammatory and malignant skin diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate whether apoptosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of epidermal changes in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and, in particular, whether certain apoptosis-related markers such as Bax, Bcl-2, Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) take part in this process. For the detection of apoptotic nuclei, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling technique (TUNEL) was employed on cryostat sections. Skin lesions from six and perilesional skin from four DH patients were stained with monoclonal antibodies to Bax, Bcl-2, Fas and FasL. The same evaluation was also performed on three patients affected by bullous pemphigoid (BP) and in two healthy donors. Using TUNEL technique, a remarkable increase in the apoptotic rate within the epidermal compartment was observed in DH and BP patients in comparison with normal controls. In our immunohistochemical analysis, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was almost the same in the epidermis of perilesional/lesional DH, BP and healthy skin specimens. In DH and BP specimens both Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were increased in the dermal perivascular compartment. Fas showed a prevalently epidermal staining, both in DH and BP lesions, while FasL was distributed in perivascular and subjunctional dermis; some FasL+ cells infiltrated the DEJ and the basal layer of epidermis. This study allowed us to highlight conspicuous apoptotic phenomena in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes within lesional and perilesional skin of DH. We conclude that in DH, as well as in BP, apoptosis plays a role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous lesions in concert with other pathogenetic mechanisms.","['Caproni M', 'Torchia D', 'Antiga E', ""Degl'Innocenti D"", 'Barletta E', 'Baroni G', 'Santucci M', 'Fabbri P']",2005,18,4,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,"Caproni M, et al.

Even though the cutaneous lesions fit best with dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid or pemphigoid gestationis, the histologic examination revealed eosinophilic spongiosis, most compatible with some form of pemphigus. The identification of intercellular IgG deposition on direct immunofluorescence and circulating IgG pemphigus antibodies on indirect immunofluorescence microscopy led to diagnosis of pemphigus herpetiformis. This rare form of pemphigus does not often involve the oral mucosa. In our patient, the explanation is that she had antibodies against desmoglein 3 but not desmoglein 1.

16340631,Thyroid disorders in Brazilian patients with celiac disease.,"INTRODUCTION/AIM: Patients with celiac disease (CD) can develop a gluten related autoimmune disorder that affects not only the small intestine but other tissues as well. An increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases has been reported, particularly autoimmune thyroiditis. The aim of this study was to characterize thyroid disorders in patients with CD.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Fifty-two patients with CD (43 female, 9 male; mean age, 41.1 years) were studied. Nine were on a gluten-free diet (GFD). They were divided into four groups: Group 1, without thyroid involvement (n=30); Groups 2A-C, with thyroid involvement (n=22); Group 2A, subclinical hypothyroidism (n=11); Group 2B, clinical hypothyroidism (n=10); and Group 2C, other thyroid disorders (n=1). CD was confirmed by serologic and histologic criteria. Thyroid involvement was detected by measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO).
RESULTS: Increased levels of TSH and/or anti-TPO levels were detected in Groups 2A (21.1%) and 2B (19.2%). The patients of Group 2B presented clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism before the diagnosis of CD, and 5 of these patients were receiving levothyroxine. One woman (Group 2C; 1.92%) had a medullary carcinoma. There was statistical significance between the age when thyroid disease was diagnosed (current age) and the age of CD diagnosis between Groups 1 and 2B. Patients with thyroid involvement presented associated diseases such as diabetes mellitus (2), Down's syndrome (2), ulcerative colitis (1), and dermatitis herpetiformis (2).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated an increased prevalence of thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, 19.2%; and subclinical hypothyroidism, 21.2%), and other associated diseases in celiac patients, even on a GFD, increasing with the age of the patients. Screening for associated diseases is recommended for patients with CD, independent of age at diagnosis or treatment duration.","['da Silva Kotze LM', 'Nisihara RM', 'da Rosa Utiyama SR', 'Piovezan GC', 'Kotze LR']",2006,40,1,J Clin Gastroenterol,"da Silva Kotze LM, et al.

It frequently presents with atypical symptoms, as many as 80% of adult patients have no gastrointestinal troubles at all. The present estimated prevalence is 1:200 - 1:250. The diagnosis is based on criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition revised in 1990, above all on the detection of serum antibodies to endomysium and tissue transglutaminase. The five forms are distinguished: classic, subclinical, latent, potential and silent. Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are considered to be two identical forms of the gluten enteropathy manifestations.

15932521,Defective prevention of immune precipitation in autoimmune diseases is independent of C4A*Q0.,"Increased prevalence of C4 null alleles is a common feature of autoimmune diseases. We have shown previously that complement-dependent prevention of immune precipitation (PIP) is defective in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and correlated this defect with C4A*Q0 and low levels of the C4A isotype. To further clarify the role of C4A in the aetiology of SLE, we now extend our studies to other diseases which have been associated with C4A*Q0. The frequency of C4A*Q0 was increased in Icelandic patients with coeliac disease (0.50; P < 0.001), Grave's disease (0.30; P = 0.002) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (0.23; P = 0.04) and in British patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (0.42; P = 0.002) and this was reflected in low levels of C4A. In spite of this, PIP was normal in these patients, and in marked contrast to our previous observations on connective tissue diseases, PIP measurements in these patient groups correlated more strongly with levels of C4B (r = 0.51, P = 0.0000004) than C4A. Patients with increased levels of anti-C1q antibodies had significantly lower PIP than patients without such antibodies (P < 0.01) and a negative association of PIP with anti-C1q antibodies was also reflected in an increased prevalence (P = 0.006) and levels (P = 0.006) of anti-C1q antibodies in patients with subnormal PIP, as well as a negative correlation between PIP and anti-C1q antibodies (r = - 0.25, P = 0.02). These results show that the PIP defect cannot be explained by low levels of C4A alone and suggest that measurements of anti-C1q antibodies may be useful in future studies on the molecular cause of the PIP defect in autoimmune connective tissue disease.","['Arason GJ', 'Kolka R', 'Hreidarsson AB', 'Gudjonsson H', 'Schneider PM', 'Fry L', 'Arnason A']",2005,140,3,Clin Exp Immunol,"Arason GJ, et al.

Celiac disease is associated frequently with iron deficiency anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, selective IgA deficiency, thyroid disorders, diabetes mellitus, and various connective tissue disorders but is rarely associated with cardiomyopathy. We describe a patient with celiac disease associated with cardiomyopathy whose cardiac function improved substantially after treatment with a gluten-free diet. Cardiomyopathy associated with celiac disease is a serious and potentially lethal condition. However, with early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten-free diet, cardiomyopathy in patients with celiac disease may be completely reversible.","['Goel NK', 'McBane RD', 'Kamath PS']",2005,80,5,Mayo Clin Proc,"Goel NK, et al.

Three cases that responded well to sulfasalazine are presented. Two cases, who were unable to tolerate dapsone, had a rapid response to sulfasalazine, without apparent side-effects. The third case with dapsone-responsive blistering dermatoses, presumed to be dermatitis herpetiformis on the basis of serology, showed an excellent clinical response to sulfasalazine, but after 6 weeks of therapy had to cease it because of side-effects. Sulfasalazine is metabolized variably to sulfapyridine, a sulphonamide known to be an effective therapy for dermatitis herpetiformis but no longer available.

15841709,Gluten intolerance: gender- and age-related differences in symptoms.,"OBJECTIVE: Gluten intolerance is a common, immunologically mediated disorder with a widely variable clinical presentation that affects genetically predisposed subjects. Women seem to be more frequently affected although data on sex differences are poor. In this study the prevalence of different clinical pictures according to sex and age is analysed in a large series of patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1436 patients with gluten intolerance were retrospectively considered, diagnosed from January 1975 to August 2001 based on compatible small-bowel biopsy and response to a gluten-free diet, plus immunofluorescent detection of granular IgA in papillary derma for dermatitis herpetiformis. The clinical picture at onset (classic, non-classic, silent) and age at diagnosis (< or = 2 years, > 2 and < or = 14 years, > 14 years) was recorded; 362 parents of coeliac probands undergoing a familial screening were also studied. The relations among sex, age class and symptoms were analysed using the chi2 test with Yates's correction.
RESULTS: The overall female/male ratio was 2.3:1 but the inter-sex difference was significant only when the diagnosis was made in adulthood where a significant association between iron-deficiency anaemia as manifestation at onset in adult women (34% versus 7%) was found. Low weight, dyspepsia and hypertransaminasaemia were more common in adult men than women (20%, 14% and 7% versus 13%, 3% and 2%, respectively). Dermatitis herpetiformis was present more frequently in men (16% versus 9%). The prevalence of silent cases was 6% in men and 3% in women. Familial screening showed the same prevalence (9.3%) of current coeliac disease in fathers and mothers.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of coeliac disease is more frequent in women but physicians' awareness of sex- and age-related differences in clinical presentation could improve diagnostic performances in men.","['Bardella MT', 'Fredella C', 'Saladino V', 'Trovato C', 'Cesana BM', 'Quatrini M', 'Prampolini L']",2005,40,1,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Bardella MT, et al.

15825127,"Celiac disease in patients with an affected member, type 1 diabetes, iron-deficiency, or osteoporosis?","Celiac disease (CD) may be a much under recognized condition, in part because it is not considered in those patients at high risk or in clinical conditions that may be a manifestation of CD. Screening high-risk groups may reveal a higher prevalence than seen in the general population. Several diseases have been described to have an association with CD that may be greater than by chance alone. The presence of autoimmune conditions such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or a family history of CD or dermatitis herpetiformis may increase the risk of coexisting CD. The prevalence of CD may be increased in certain patient groups, including the following: osteoporosis or low bone mass or iron-deficiency anemia. Many studies, including population-based work, suggest a prevalence of CD of 3%-7% of T1DM and 4%-10% of first-degree family members. Anemia and osteoporosis are common in patients with newly diagnosed CD. Conversely, CD is common in referral populations with those conditions but makes a relatively small contribution to the overall community prevalence of anemia or postmenopausal osteoporosis. Most screen-found patients tend to have little or no gastrointestinal symptoms. In conclusion, significant reservoirs of CD can be found in some at-risk groups, such as those with T1DM, family members, and referred patients with osteoporosis and anemia.

15822038,"Permeability, zonulin production, and enteropathy in dermatitis herpetiformis.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized by variable degrees of enteropathy and increased intestinal permeability. Zonulin, a regulator of tight junctions, seems to play a key role in the altered intestinal permeability that characterizes the early phase of celiac disease. Our aim was to assess both intestinal permeability and serum zonulin levels in a group of patients with DH having variable grades of enteropathy.
METHODS: We studied 18 DH patients diagnosed on the basis of characteristic immunoglobulin (Ig)A granular deposits in the dermal papillae of noninvolved skin. Results were compared with those of classic celiac patients, patients with linear IgA dermatosis, and healthy controls.
RESULTS: According to Marsh's classification, 5 patients had no evidence of enteropathy (type 0), 4 patients had type II, 2 patients had type IIIb damage, and 7 patients had a more severe lesion (type IIIc). Intestinal permeability (lactulose/mannitol ratio [lac/man]) was abnormal in all patients with DH. Patients with more severe enteropathy had significantly greater permeability ( P < .05). The serum zonulin concentration (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for patients with DH was 2.1 +/- .3 ng/mg with 14 of 16 (87.5%) patients having abnormally increased values. In contrast, patients with linear IgA dermatosis had normal histology, normal intestinal permeability, and negative celiac serology.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased intestinal permeability and zonulin up-regulation are common and concomitant findings among patients with DH, likely involved in pathogenesis. Increased permeability can be observed even in patients with no evidence of histologic damage in biopsy specimens. Patients with linear IgA dermatosis appear to be a distinct population with no evidence of gluten sensitivity.","['Smecuol E', 'Sugai E', 'Niveloni S', 'Vázquez H', 'Pedreira S', 'Mazure R', 'Moreno ML', 'Label M', 'Mauriño E', 'Fasano A', 'Meddings J', 'Bai JC']",2005,3,4,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Smecuol E, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To study the occurrence and type of lymphoma in a large series of patients with DH and their first-degree relatives.
METHODS: The occurrence of lymphoma was studied in 1104 patients consecutively diagnosed with DH in two university hospitals during 1969-2001. A questionnaire was sent to 341 patients to examine the occurrence of lymphoma in their 1825 first-degree relatives. To analyse whether the DH patients with lymphoma had adhered to a gluten-free diet similarly to the patients without lymphoma, two age- and sex-matched patients with DH served as controls for each index case. Data on the gluten-free diet were collected from prospectively completed dietary forms and also from medical records.
RESULTS: Eleven (1%) patients contracted lymphoma 2-31 years after the diagnosis of DH. Eight had B-cell-type lymphoma, two enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and one remained unclassified due to missing material. Three (0.2%) of the first-degree relatives contracted lymphoma, all B-cell type. The 11 DH patients with lymphoma had adhered to a gluten-free diet significantly less strictly than the DH controls without lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents that patients with DH can have both B- and T-cell lymphoma. The DH patients with lymphoma had not adhered as strictly to the gluten-free diet as the control patients without lymphoma. The occurrence of lymphoma in the first-degree relatives was lower than in the patients with DH.","['Hervonen K', 'Vornanen M', 'Kautiainen H', 'Collin P', 'Reunala T']",2005,152,1,Br J Dermatol,"Hervonen K, et al.

15649195,"Immunoglobulin, complement and epidermal transglutaminase deposition in the cutaneous vessels in dermatitis herpetiformis.","BACKGROUND: Recently, epidermal transglutaminase (TG) has been identified within the papillary IgA granules in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Although IgA type autoantibodies to tissue and epidermal TGs are characteristic serological markers for DH, these antibodies do not bind to normal papillary skin structures.
AIMS: To test the possibility of IgA immune complex precipitation within the vessel walls as a first step in the pathogenesis of skin symptoms, we analysed immunoglobulin, complement, and epidermal TG deposition along the vascular system of DH skin.
METHODS: Punch biopsy specimen were taken from 116 DH patients' skin, and evaluated for the presence of vascular immune precipitates by direct immunofluorescence. Skin samples from 16 DH patients were also studied for tissue and epidermal TGs.
RESULTS: In 74 (64%) of the 116 DH skin studied, significant vascular staining accompanied the DH-specific granular IgA fluorescence (IgA and C3 in 39 patients; IgA alone in 18; IgA, C3 and IgM together in five; IgM alone in 12). In most cases (92%), the precipitates were detected in the small vessels of the papillary dermis; however, a subpapillary vascular fluorescence was also observed in a few patients (8%). Skin IgA colocalized with epidermal TG in the vessel walls and within the scattered papillary peri- and intervascular DH bodies. Tissue TG did not colocalize either with the immunoglobulins or with the complement precipitates of the dermis. Furthermore, we could not detect keratinocyte TG in the DH bodies nor in the vessel walls.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support possible immune complex precipitation in the vessel walls of DH skin and further confirm the significance of epidermal but not tissue TG in the pathomechanism of skin symptoms.","['Preisz K', 'Sárdy M', 'Horváth A', 'Kárpáti S']",2005,19,1,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Preisz K, et al.

We found a midaortic syndrome, characterized by severe stenosis of the infrarenal aorta, of both renal arteries (more pronounced on the right side) and of the inferior mesenteric artery. We assume that-after having excluded other possible pathogeneses-the underlying condition is a local vasculitis in the abdominal aorta and the renal and mesenteric arteries due to the chronic inflammation of untreated celiac disease. We performed a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty together with implantation of two stents into the infrarenal aorta and the right renal artery and started treating the celiac disease by dietary intervention.

It presents as a papulovesicular rash and is often associated with enteropathy. The rash resolves when the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet and/or dapsone. DH, as well as celiac disease, is tightly associated with DQ2 and DQ8. A novel mouse model for DH is described that utilizes the NOD background and the HLA-DQ8 transgene. The addition of DQ8 contributes sensitivity to gliadin, and the addition of the NOD background contributes to autoimmunity and pathogenesis. Fifteen NOD DQ8+ mice of 90 that were sensitized to gluten developed blistering pathology similar to that seen in DH. Neutrophil infiltration of the dermis, deposition of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction, and a complete reversal of the blistering phenomenon with the administration of a gluten-free diet with or without dapsone were observed. None of the 3 blistering mice examined had small-bowel pathology.

Definitive diagnosis of DH depends on the direct immunofluorescence finding of granular or fibrillar IgA deposits along the basement membrane zone of biopsied perilesional skin. We report an 11-year-old boy with an unusual presentation of DH characterized by a 7-month history of chronic urticaria-like skin lesions. He had evanescent, largely asymptomatic, urticarial wheals on his trunk, face, and extremities that were unresponsive to conventional therapy for urticaria. Skin biopsy specimen findings were consistent with DH and direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin was diagnostic. The patient had no symptoms of gluten-sensitive enteropathy at the time of diagnosis, and his skin lesions rapidly cleared with dapsone therapy. This patient serves to highlight an unusual presentation of childhood DH and the need to consider this diagnosis when evaluating chronic urticarial lesions in children.","['Powell GR', 'Bruckner AL', 'Weston WL']",2004,21,5,Pediatr Dermatol,"Powell GR, et al.

15301164,Why am I so itchy?,"BACKGROUND: Virtually all of us experience an itch at some time. However, for some people, an intense or persistent itch can cause considerable morbidity that often affects the entire family.
OBJECTIVE: This article gives an overview of the problem of itch, and discusses the assessment and management of atopic eczema, scabies, lichen planus and dermatitis herpetiformis.
DISCUSSION: A good history will nearly always provide the diagnosis. Examination can then be targeted at finding specific signs. The distribution of rash is important, as is examination of the nails and mouth. Simple but helpful investigations such as microscopy and skin biopsy can be carried out in the consulting room. If a patient presents with a very itchy rash, consider four main possibilities: eczema, scabies, lichen planus and dermatitis herpetiformis, with the first two being the most common. For chronic conditions such as eczema, structured follow up is essential.",['Clarke P'],2004,33,7,Aust Fam Physician,Clarke P. Why am I so itchy?.

15234014,Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Blistering eruptions are rare cutaneous manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) that may be caused by different mechanisms. Subepidermal clefting with frank vesiculation may occur in early lesions of chronic-, subacute-, and acute-cutaneous LE due to a severe vacuolar alteration of the dermoepidermal junction (DEJ), dermal edema, and lekocytoclastic vasculitis. An exaggerated example of such changes is rarely seen at the advancing edge of the annular plaques of subacute cutaneous LE with erythema-multiforme (EM)-like appearance, a condition formerly described as Rowell's syndrome. In a recently reported novel variant of LE-associated toxic epidermal necrolysis, dysregulated keratinocyte apoptosis has been proposed as an underlying mechanism. These vesiculobullous lesions are considered to be LE-specific. Blistering may also occur in LE in the context of a coexisting immunobullous disease. Pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid (BP), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis have been all reported in association with LE. Their differentiation relies upon characteristic clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic features (Table 1).

The aim of this study was to evaluate how the use of oats has been adopted. The use of oats and the effect of oats on symptoms and quality of life were investigated in 1,000 randomly selected members of the Celiac Society. Altogether, 710 patients responded: 423 (73%) with celiac disease and 70 (55%) with dermatitis herpetiformis were currently consuming oats. Patients appreciated the taste, the ease of use, and the low costs; 94% believed that oats diversified the gluten-free diet; 15% of celiac disease and 28% of dermatitis herpetiformis patients had stopped eating oats. The most common reasons for avoiding oats were fear of adverse effects or contamination. There is a market demand for oats, and celiac societies and dietitians should make efforts to promote the development of products free of wheat contamination.","['Peräaho M', 'Collin P', 'Kaukinen K', 'Kekkonen L', 'Miettinen S', 'Mäki M']",2004,104,7,J Am Diet Assoc,"Peräaho M, et al.

Cadherins are Ca++-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules which play an important role in the cellular connection between normal cells. P-cadherin is involved in the selective adhesion of epidermal cells, and is expressed only on the surfaces of the two basal layers. We examined the expression of P-cadherin in some autoimmune bullous skin diseases and Darier's disease using immunohistochemistry and found P-cadherin to be strongly upregulated. We believe the upregulation is compensatory to the primary pathophysiological events in the various bullous dermatoses.","['Kovács A', 'Schmidt E', 'Bégány A', 'Hunyadi J', 'Szegedi A']",2004,84,2,Acta Derm Venereol,"Kovács A, et al.

The majority of people with CD are symptom-free adults; the remainder are prone to a bewildering variety of signs and symptoms, ranging from infertility to type 1 diabetes. Many patients with undiagnosed CD spend years seeking help for complaints such as chronic tiredness or mild abdominal symptoms. In primary care, an appropriate target group to test for CD is people with anaemia (especially women), chronic tiredness, non-specific abdominal symptoms (including so-called ""irritable bowel syndrome""), or a family history of CD. The response to an appropriate gluten-free diet is often life-transforming for symptomatic patients. Positive serological tests for CD require confirmation by duodenal biopsy and, if confirmed, referral to a dietitian and a coeliac society, followed by a life-long gluten-free diet.",['Duggan JM'],2004,180,10,Med J Aust,Duggan JM.

15137480,[A great imitator for the allergologist: intolerance to gluten].,"Intolerance of gluten, resposible for Coeliac disease, is essentially shown by an auto-immune enteropathy, even if the cutaneous manifestation (herpetiform dermatitis) and perhaps certain neurological signs (cerebral syndrome, peripheral neuropathy) may be independent as well as associated with the intestinal illness. This affection is of immunological nature, occuring in a genetic field that predisposes to the illness (familial form: concordance of 70% in homozygote twins; 90% of patients show an HLA molecule of type DQ2, DQ8 in almost all the other cases. The exogenous factor is the gluten content contained in wheat, rye and barley, more precisely by the intermediary ""the prolamines"" which are the ""reactive"" element that induces a the same time an inflammatory reaction of type TH11 locally (expressed by the histological aspect of a duodenal biopsy evolving as villous atrophy) and a humoral response with production of anti-gliadine and anti-transglutaminase antibodies (the role of the latter enzyme is intervention in the local transformation of antigens to make them antigenic). It is an illness of adults as well as children and this point must now be emphasized. Recent epidemiological studies insist on a high prevalence (1/300 in Europe). Clinical expression, at the start very polymorphic and so misleading, before the appearance of the more classical signs of malabsorption and development, always feared, towards a lymphoma. These signs are haematological (anemia of various types, hyper platelets by hyposplenism, haemorrhagic signs) cutaneous (herpetiform dermatitis, cutaneous vasculitis) mucosal (aphtose), hepatic (cytolysis), neurophysical (fatigue, troubles of behaviour, cerebral syndrome, neuropathy) and osteo-articulitis (osteopenia, arthralgias, diffuse pains). The association of certain auto-immune illnesses must be emphasized (diabetes, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Gougerot disease, primitive biliary cirrhosis). To think early of the possibility of intolerance to gluten, is to give the means of a very easy diagnosis (measurement of anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium and anti-transglutaminase, and secondarily duodenal biopsy if necessary), and it is early elimination of gluten food which will make the various clinical manifestations disappear and so prevent the risk of evolution to a tumoral pathology.",['Rousset H'],2004,36,3,Eur Ann Allergy Clin Immunol,Rousset H.

In some, epithelial lymphocytosis was evident in gastric, colonic, or biliary ductal epithelium. In addition, other immune-mediated disorders, dermatitis herpetiformis, and autoimmune thyroid disease were common, suggesting a distinct clinical and pathologic phenotype in celiac disease that may predispose to malignant complications.

15082580,In vivo targeting of intestinal and extraintestinal transglutaminase 2 by coeliac autoantibodies.,"BACKGROUND: IgA class serum autoantibodies against type 2 (tissue) transglutaminase (TG2) bind to both intestinal and extraintestinal normal tissue sections in vitro, eliciting endomysial, reticulin, and jejunal antibody reactions. It is not known whether similar binding also occurs in coeliac patients in vivo, and may thereby contribute to disease manifestations.
AIMS: To investigate intestinal and extraintestinal coeliac tissues for the presence of in vivo bound TG2 specific IgA and its relation to small intestinal mucosal atrophy.
PATIENTS: We investigated jejunal samples with normal villous morphology from 10 patients with developing coeliac disease who subsequently progressed to a flat lesion, from 11 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, and from 12 non-coeliac controls. Six extrajejunal biopsy samples (liver, lymph node, muscle, appendix), obtained based on independent clinical indications from patients with active coeliac disease, were also studied.
METHODS: Double colour immunofluorescent studies for in situ IgA, TG2, and laminin were performed. IgA was eluted from tissue sections and tested for TG2 specificity by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: IgA (in one IgA deficient case IgG) deposition on extracellularly located TG2 was detected in jejunal and extrajejunal specimens of all coeliac patients, and also in seven of 11 dermatitis herpetiformis patients, of whom two had no circulating endomysial antibodies. IgA eluted from extraintestinal coeliac tissues was targeted against TG2.
CONCLUSIONS: Coeliac IgA targets jejunal TG2 early in disease development even when endomysial antibodies are not present in the circulation. Extraintestinal target sites of coeliac IgA further indicate that humoral immunity may have a pathogenetic role.","['Korponay-Szabó IR', 'Halttunen T', 'Szalai Z', 'Laurila K', 'Király R', 'Kovács JB', 'Fésüs L', 'Mäki M']",2004,53,5,Gut,"Korponay-Szabó IR, et al.

15033190,Dermatitis herpetiformis: close to unravelling a disease.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterised by granular IgA precipitates in the papillary dermis. In contrast to other autoimmune blistering diseases, where tissue-deposited and circulating autoantibodies recognise the same target within the skin, in dermatitis herpetiformis a serum IgA reacting with a component of the healthy papillary dermis has not been detected. Recently, the antigenic specificity of pathognomic skin-bound IgA has been clarified: the immune precipitates contain epidermal transglutaminase, an enzyme not previously detected in the papillary region of normal skin. Furthermore, serum IgA in dermatitis herpetiformis has been found to bind epidermal transglutaminase. These findings may relate to the fact, that dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease, which is characterised by IgA type autoantibodies to a closely related enzyme, tissue transglutaminase. The two transglutaminases are highly homologous, and therefore, cross reactivity of the two antibodies might explain why patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy, with or without skin disease, generally have serum autoantibodies to both enzymes. There is growing evidence that dermatitis herpetiformis should be considered as the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity developing in those patients with mild coeliac disease, who produce epidermal transglutaminase autoantibodies of high avidity and affinity. Both the skin and the small bowel diseases are gluten dependent and are strongly associated with HLA DQ with no genetic differences to explain the two phenotypes. The question should be asked whether the rash in dermatitis herpetiformis is a classic autoimmune blistering disease or whether it has an immune complex basis, which is the most likely alternative.",['Kárpáti S'],2004,34,2,J Dermatol Sci,Kárpáti S.

15017513,"Trends in the identification and clinical features of celiac disease in a North American community, 1950-2001.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Celiac disease is considered rare in North America. However, an increasing incidence and widening clinical spectrum have been reported in many countries, and serologic screening suggests a higher prevalence of minimally symptomatic disease. This study reports temporal trends in the incidence of celiac disease in Olmsted County, Minnesota.
METHODS: All county residents diagnosed with celiac disease between 1950 and 2001 were identified through the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Incidence rates were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution, and changes in incidence by calendar year, age, and gender were assessed by using Poisson regression.
RESULTS: Altogether, 82 new cases of celiac disease were identified during the 50-year period. There was a marked female predominance (P < 0.005), and the incidence rates increased with age (P < 0.001) and calendar period (P < 0.001). The overall annual incidence of celiac disease was 2.1 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-2.6) but increased from 0.9 per 100,000 (CI, 0.5-1.2) in 1950-1989 to 3.3 per 100,000 (95% CI, 2.2-4.4) in the 1990s. The incidence was 9.1 per 100,000 (95% CI, 5.2-13.0) in the final 2 years of the study. Serology prompted biopsy in a substantial proportion of recent diagnoses. Clinical features also changed over time, with less diarrhea and weight loss at presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: Celiac disease has increased recently in this well-characterized population. Milder clinical features and use of serology suggest an increased detection rate, although a true increase in incidence may have also occurred.

14870985,IgA autoimmune disorders: development of a passive transfer mouse model.,"IgA is present in the skin in several dermatoses, including dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and Henoch-Schoenlein purpura. The neutrophilic infiltration in the area of the IgA deposition suggests that IgA is responsible for the associated inflammatory events. The mechanism for this process is unproven, but is likely to involve IgA-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis with inhibition of chemotaxis by dapsone. Elucidation of the mechanism of IgA-mediated inflammation will require an animal model. We have established a model for linear IgA bullous dermatosis as a prototype disease to be studied. IgA mouse monoclonal antibodies against a linear IgA bullous dermatosis antigen have been passively transferred to SCID mice with human skin grafts. This has produced neutrophil infiltration and basement membrane vesiculation in 4 of 12 mice tested. We conclude that an animal model for the pathogenesis of IgA dermatoses with IgA deposition and inflammation can be produced by passive transfer of mouse IgA antibodies against a linear IgA antigen.","['Zone JJ', 'Egan CA', 'Taylor TB', 'Meyer LJ']",2004,9,1,J Investig Dermatol Symp Proc,"Zone JJ, et al.

14746628,The occurrence of type 1 diabetes in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and their first-degree relatives.,"BACKGROUND: The increased prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is well documented in patients with coeliac disease, whereas evidence is scanty in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of T1D in patients with DH and their first-degree relatives, and to study how DH patients with associated T1D respond to a gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment.
METHODS: A series of 1104 consecutive patients with DH was recorded and a specific questionnaire sent to 341 of these for familial disease surveillance. Sex- and age-matched patients with isolated DH served as controls in the diet treatment analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-five (2.3%) patients with DH were affected by T1D and three (3.0%) of their first-degree relatives also were affected by T1D, the frequencies being significantly higher than in the general population. Most DH patients with T1D and with isolated DH could adhere strictly to the GFD. The response was good or moderate in 84% of the DH patients with T1D and in 94% of the patients with isolated DH.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of T1D is increased in patients with DH and their first-degree relatives. The rash in DH patients with T1D responds to a GFD in a way similar to that seen in patients with isolated DH.","['Hervonen K', 'Viljamaa M', 'Collin P', 'Knip M', 'Reunala T']",2004,150,1,Br J Dermatol,"Hervonen K, et al.

14714019,[Dietary treatment of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis].,"Life-long gluten-free diet is the established therapy for coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. Diet therapy allows the intestinal mucosa to recover, improves nutrient malabsorption, osteoporosis and a weakened general condition. A gluten-free diet is without wheat, rye and barley and related products. Oats tested free of contamination by other cereals has recently been allowed for adult coeliac patients, but concern still remains regarding its general safety. Gluten-free flour mixes contain more starch and less proteins, vitamins, minerals and fibre compared to regular flour. Recently some questions have been raised as to the nutritional quality of the gluten-free diet. Successful therapy with gluten-free diet requires motivation and dietary counselling, including knowledge of the nutritional value of foods, labelling of prepackaged foods and practical training in cooking. The local chapters of the Norwegian Coeliac Society are active partners, as are the clinical nutritionists that work in most major hospitals. The physician making the diagnosis has a duty to see to it that all coeliac patients get adequate dietary counselling and management.","['Løvik A', 'Lundin KE']",2003,123,22,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,Løvik A and Lundin KE.

14632800,Long-term remission in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a normal diet.,"BACKGROUND: A life-long gluten-free diet is the treatment of choice for dermatitis herpetiformis, which is considered to be coeliac disease of the skin.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects on long-term remission of dermatitis herpetiformis in patients who underwent a gluten challenge and subsequently reintroduced dietary gluten.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 38 patients (14 male and 24 female) with biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis. They had followed a gluten-free diet for a mean of 8 years, achieving clinical remission and intestinal normalization. The patients were asked to reintroduce gluten in their diet and agreed to undergo skin and intestinal biopsies during the follow-up.
RESULTS: Of the 38 patients abandoning a gluten-free diet, 31 reported the onset of rash within an average of 2 months. Seven subjects (three males, mean age 15 years at challenge) experienced no clinical or histological relapses (median follow-up 12 years), and lost IgA immunoglobulin from the skin. The two series of patients differed in terms of age at diagnosis (mean age: 26.6 vs. 6 years), the use of dapsone (one of 31 vs. four of seven) and adherence to the gluten-free diet (strict compliance in 26 of 31 vs. none of seven).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the ingestion of small doses of gluten in childhood and/or the use of an anti-inflammatory drug may modify the immunological response inducing immune tolerance. We report long-term clinical and histological remissions in seven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis after the reintroduction of dietary gluten.","['Bardella MT', 'Fredella C', 'Trovato C', 'Ermacora E', 'Cavalli R', 'Saladino V', 'Prampolini L']",2003,149,5,Br J Dermatol,"Bardella MT, et al.

14561178,Eotaxins and CCR3 receptor in inflammatory and allergic skin diseases: therapeutical implications.,"Cell migration is mediated by a group of chemotactic cytokines called chemokines: low molecular weight molecules that have been shown as important leukocyte chemical attractants to sites of inflammation and infection. Eotaxin-1, also called CCL11, was first described in 1994, as a highly specific eosinophils chemokine. Many cell types including lymphocytes, macrophages, bronchial smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and eosinophils, are able to produce this chemokine, predominantly after cytokine stimulation, however little is known about its expression in human skin in vivo. Eotaxin-1 also regulates the chemiotaxis and, in some conditions, activation of basophils, mast cells and T lymphocytes. Chemokine receptors are named from their ligand families, thus the CC chemokine eotaxin-1 binds to the CCR3 receptor which is expressed on eosinophis, mast cells, Th2 type lymphocytes and even on keratinocytes. It seems that eotaxin-1 is one of the most important cytokines involved in tissue inflammation playing a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway diseases (asthma and rhinitis), in inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal allergic hypersensitivity and recently it has been proposed as a therapeutical target for these conditions. Our group has studied the role of eotaxin-1 in the pathogenesis of two skin conditions: dermatitis herpetiformis and AIDS-associated eosinophilic folliculitis, demonstrating that this chemokine, together with Th2 type cytokines (IL-13 and IL-4) is important in cell recruitment, inflammation and tissue damage; moreover eotaxin has proven to paly an important role in other skin conditions such as, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigoid gestationis, atopic dermatitis and allergic drug reactions Recent advances in the understanding of eotaxin-1-mediated mechanisms of chemotaxis in allergic and inflammatory conditions may predict that therapeutic antagonism is achievable. This paper will focus on the role that eotaxin and its receptor play in the pathogenetical mechanism in a number of dermatologic diseases, some of which, like atopic dermatitis, may benefit from the introduction of novel and more selective therapeutic options.","['Amerio P', 'Frezzolini A', 'Feliciani C', 'Verdolini R', 'Teofoli P', 'De Pità O', 'Puddu P']",2003,2,1,Curr Drug Targets Inflamm Allergy,"Amerio P, et al.

14519046,Dapsone-induced acute pancreatitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of acute pancreatitis associated with dapsone use.
CASE SUMMARY: An 87-year-old white man was prescribed dapsone for dermatitis herpetiformis. Four weeks later, he developed acute abdominal pain requiring hospitalization. The patient had elevated serum amylase and lipase levels. Laboratory test results for other possible etiologies were negative. His symptoms resolved when dapsone was discontinued. Dapsone was reintroduced for exacerbation of dermatitis herpetiformis 4 months later. The patient again had severe abdominal pain with high amylase and lipase levels. Again, symptoms resolved following dapsone discontinuation.
DISCUSSION: Only 1 other case of pancreatitis associated with dapsone was found in a MEDLINE search of the literature (1966-June 2003) using the key terms dapsone and pancreatitis. An objective causality assessment revealed dapsone to be a probable cause of acute pancreatitis, based on the Naranjo probability scale. Drugs should always be considered as causative factors for pancreatitis in patients without known risk factors. Dapsone is increasingly used as a second line of treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). The recognition of dapsone-induced pancreatitis is of particular importance in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: While dapsone is traditionally used for the treatment of leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis, its use for PCP prophylaxis, malaria, brown recluse spider bites, and acne is not uncommon. Pancreatitis is an uncommon adverse effect of dapsone, and greater awareness of this association will prompt a high index of suspicion in an appropriate clinical setting. Further reporting of cases and clinical research of drug-induced pancreatitis is indicated.","['Jha SH', 'Reddy JA', 'Dave JK']",2003,37,10,Ann Pharmacother,"Jha SH, et al.

Although intestinal ulceration, especially in jejunum or ileum is rare, spontaneous free perforation of the intestine developed in 6 patients with established or suspected celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis due to a malignant lymphoma. In 3 cases, perforation developed after celiac disease was diagnosed and compliance with a gluten-free diet was strictly maintained and repeatedly evaluated. In 1 of these cases, refractory celiac disease was defined. In another, free perforation was the presenting manifestation of the lymphoma and this led to a later diagnosis of subsequent biopsy-defined latent celiac disease. In 2 others, celiac disease was suspected but the rapidly deteriorating clinical course prohibited institution of a gluten-free diet. In all patients, the lymphoma involved the jejunum, but in 1 of these, perforation was defined in the colon indicating that any intestinal site may suffer free perforation from lymphoma in celiac disease.

The possibility that similar or identical bodies may be present in other disorders prompted further study exploring the specificity of caterpillar bodies in the differential diagnosis of subepidermal vesiculobullous disorders. Seventy-six cases exhibiting subepidermal clefting were reviewed by light microscopy. ""Classic"" caterpillar bodies were present in porphyria cutanea tarda (6 of 14) and 1 case representing either venous stasis-associated bulla or possibly bullosis diabeticorum. Caterpillar body-like clusters were present in porphyria cutanea tarda (5 of 14), erythropoietic protoporphyria (1 of 3), bullous pemphigoid (7 of 24), and junctional or dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (3 of 5). In some cases, classic caterpillar body and caterpillar body-like clusters coexisted in a blister roof. Caterpillar bodies or caterpillar body-like clusters were not identified in any cases of dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, bullous erythema multiforme, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, or wound-healing reactions. In contrast to caterpillar bodies, caterpillar body-like clusters were negative for PAS or Type IV collagen stains. In conclusion, caterpillar bodies appear to represent a specific feature of porphyria cutanea tarda (specificity, 98%) but were present in less than half of those cases in this study (sensitivity, 43%). Caterpillar body-like clusters are less specific and may be present in porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, pseudoporphyria, bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.","['Fung MA', 'Murphy MJ', 'Hoss DM', 'Berke A', 'Grant-Kels JM']",2003,25,4,Am J Dermatopathol,"Fung MA, et al.

12839117,IgE and non-IgE food allergy.,"BACKGROUND: Food allergy (FA) is characterized by an abnormal immunologic reactivity to food proteins. The gastro-intestinal tract serves not only a nutritive function but also is a major immunologic organ. Although previously thought to be triggered primarily by an IgE-mediated mechanism of injury, considerable evidence now suggests that non-IgE mechanisms may also be involved in the pathogenesis of FA.
OBJECTIVE: To review the immunologic disturbances that occur in FA and to correlate these with the clinical manifestations expressed in affected target organs based upon a classification of IgE and non-IgE mechanisms.
METHODS: Data collected from a computerized MEDLINE search were used for the analysis of the following topics: immediate GI hypersensitivity, oral allergy syndrome, acute urticaria and angioedema, acute bronchospasm, celiac disease, cow's milk enteropathy, dietary protein enterocolitis, breast milk colitis, proctolitis, proctitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, Heiner syndrome, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and behavioral disorders, as well as systems affected by mucosal associated lymphoid tissue-mediated injury of associated lymphoid tissues and the immunologic deviation to Th1 or Th2 mechanisms of FA.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review allow the construction of a central, unifying hypothesis for a new classification of FA as follows: the clinical manifestations of FA, expressed in affected target organs, may be the result of immunologic injury mediated by interaction of food antigens with contiguous elements of mucosal associated lymphoid tissue. These appear to be modulated by relative imbalances of the Th1/Th2 paradigm, which may be the ultimate determinant governing the expression of FA as IgE-mediated, non--IgE-mediated, or mixed forms of IgE/non-IgE mechanisms of FA.","['Sabra A', 'Bellanti JA', 'Rais JM', 'Castro HJ', 'de Inocencio JM', 'Sabra S']",2003,90,6 Suppl 3,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Sabra A, et al.

We encountered 35 cases of HCV infection associated with cutaneous eruptions. The present study evaluates paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin from biopsy specimens of skin lesions from 35 patients seropositive for HCV. In 20 cases, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using a probe for HCV RNA; the RNA was detected through the action of alkaline phosphatase on the chromogen nitroblue tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl phosphate. The clinical spectrum comprised dermatomyositis-like photodistributed eruptions, palpable purpura, folliculitis, violaceous and perniotic acral lesions, ulcers, nodules, and urticaria. Lesions were also classified histopathologically by the dominant reaction pattern: vasculopathies of neutrophilic, lymphocytic, and granulomatous vasculitis and pauci-inflammatory subtypes (15 patients); palisading granulomatous inflammation (3 patients); sterile neutrophilic folliculitis (5 patients); dermatitis herpetiformis (1 patient); lobular panniculitis composed of neutrophilic lobular panniculitis in 2 patients and benign cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa in 1 patient; neutrophilic dermatoses, including neutrophilic urticaria, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, and pyoderma gangrenosum (3 patients); interface dermatitis (3 patients); and low-grade lymphoproliferative disease of B-cell lineage representing marginal zone lymphoma in 1 patient and a clonal plasmacellular infiltrate in another patient. In most cases, whereas 1 of the aforementioned disorders defined the dominant reaction pattern, there was an accompanying secondary reaction pattern, defining a hybrid picture. Endothelial changes including endothelial cell enlargement and effaced heterochromatin with margination of the chromatin to the nuclear membrane were seen in several cases; in some cases similar cytopathic changes also involved the supporting pericytes, eccrine ductular cells, or keratinocytes. The RT-PCR analyses in 8 of 20 cases examined revealed HCV RNA expression in a focal, weak fashion in endothelia and perivascular inflammatory cells in those cases showing vasculopathic changes. Viral parasitism of endothelia may be important in cutaneous lesional propagation in the setting of HCV infection. Cross-reactivity between endogenous and viral antigens, leading to cellular and/or type II immune reactions; viral tropism to B lymphocytes, resulting in B cell expansion with resultant autoantibody production; and circulating immune complexes containing monoclonal cryoglobulins may also be of pathogenetic importance. Tropism of the virus to B lymphocytes provides a mechanism for the development of low-grade clonal B cell lymphoproliferative disease in this setting.","['Crowson AN', 'Nuovo G', 'Ferri C', 'Magro CM']",2003,34,6,Hum Pathol,"Crowson AN, et al.

We report a 16-yr-old adolescent primigravida, who presented with impetigo herpetiformis at 27 weeks gestation. She had a pustular erythroderma covering her entire body, except face, scalp, and palmoplantar regions, with severe pruritus and pain. After unsuccessful attempts of treatment with systemic corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics, treatment was switched to cyclosporine, but no therapeutic effect could be achieved.

Acute urticaria is a common manifestation of an allergic skin response to food, but food is rarely a cause of chronic urticaria. Approximately one third of infants/children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have food allergy. Although diagnosis of acute urticaria provoked by a food may be evident from a straightforward history and confirmed by diagnostic tests to detect food-specific IgE antibody, determination of the role of food allergy in patients with atopic dermatitis is more difficult and may require additional diagnostic maneuvers, including elimination diets and oral food challenges.

12725607,In patients with dermatitis herpetiformis distribution of transglutaminase in cutaneous tissue does not differ from controls.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis may be regarded as the cutaneous counterpart of coeliac disease. These conditions are related to the ingestion of gluten and both are characterised by circulating antibodies against tissue transglutaminase.
AIMS: To study the distribution of tissue transglutaminase in the skin of dermatitis herpetiformis patients and controls, and to investigate whether the dermal IgA deposits, diagnostic for dermatitis herpetiformis, are related to tissue transglutaminase expression in the skin.
METHODS: A series of 11 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis had a 4 mm punch biopsy taken from the uninvolved perilesional skin. A group of 16 controls, undergoing surgical removal of benign nevi, gave perilesional skin. Biopsies were covered with OCT and frozen at -80 degrees C. After washing, skin biopsy sections were incubated with an IgG anti-tissue transglutaminase mouse monoclonal antibody. After washing, sections were incubated with anti-mouse IgG.
RESULTS: The anti-tissue transglutaminase monoclonal antibody specifically recognised the basal epidermal cells. This staining was no different between patients and controls.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that tissue transglutaminase can be recognised in the basal epidermal layer both of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and controls. Since this distribution does not correspond to the distribution of dermal IgA deposits, it is concluded that dermatitis herpetiformis dermal IgA deposits are not due to antibodies directed against cutaneous tissue transglutaminase.","['Biagi F', 'Bassi E', 'Ardigó M', 'Vignini MA', 'Caravaggi M', 'Borroni G', 'Corazza GR']",2003,35,1,Dig Liver Dis,"Biagi F, et al.

The anti-endomysium and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are specific and sensitive diagnostic tools. The wide variety of clinical symptoms and presentations are discussed including the associated condition of dermatitis herpetiformis.

After medical school, he studied for two years in dermatology departments in London, Paris and Vienna. As a student in Vienna, he was under the tutelage of Ferdinand von Hebra, when the brilliant clinician and teacher was at the zenith of his fame. Duhring's series of 18 papers--published between 1884 and 1891--gave him an important and recognized position as one of the leading dermatological thinkers of the world. These publications described the skin disease which he named ""dermatitis herpetiformis"" (Duhring's disease). His assertion that dermatitis herpetiformis was a distinct dermatological disease process aroused at first considerable opposition. Moriz Kaposi, at that time the doyen of the Vienna school of dermatology, attacked his views with vigor and tenacity. Louis A. Duhring--this modest, unassuming, quiet-working, gentlemanly physician--made monumental contributions to American dermatology and played a significant role in establishing Philadelphia as one of the great centers of dermatologic activity.","['Bogenrieder T', 'Stolz W']",2003,54,2,Hautarzt,Bogenrieder T and Stolz W.

12524400,Missing endomysial and reticulin binding of coeliac antibodies in transglutaminase 2 knockout tissues.,"BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TG2) are thought to be responsible for the endomysial (EMA), reticulin (ARA), and jejunal antibody (JEA) tissue binding of serum samples from coeliac patients but the exclusive role of TG2 in these staining patterns has not yet been established.
AIMS: To evaluate whether antigens other than TG2 contribute to EMA/ARA/JEA reactions.
PATIENTS: Serum samples from 61 EMA/ARA/JEA positive untreated patients with coeliac disease, 40 dermatitis herpetiformis patients, and 34 EMA/ARA/JEA negative non-coeliac controls were tested.
METHODS: TG2 knockout (TG2-/-) and wild-type mouse oesophagus, jejunum, liver, and kidney sections, and TG2-/- sections coated with human recombinant TG2 were used as substrates in single and double immunofluorescent studies for patient IgA binding and tissue localisation of TG2, fibronectin, actin, and calreticulin.
RESULTS: None of the patient serum samples elicited EMA, ARA, or JEA binding in TG2-/- morphologically normal tissues. In contrast, 96 of 101 gluten sensitive patient samples (95%) reacted with wild-type mouse tissues and all 101 reacted in EMA/ARA/JEA patterns with TG2-/- mouse tissues coated with human TG2. Serum IgA binding to TG2-/- smooth muscle cells was observed in low titres in 31.1%, 27.5%, and 20.5%, and to TG2-/- epithelium in 26.3%, 5.0%, and 8.8% of coeliac, dermatitis herpetiformis, and control samples, respectively. These positivities partly colocalised with actin and calreticulin but not with TG2 or fibronectin.
CONCLUSIONS: EMA/ARA/JEA antibody binding patterns are exclusively TG2 dependent both in coeliac and dermatitis herpetiformis patients. Actin antibodies are responsible for some positivities which are not part of the EMA/ARA/JEA reactions.","['Korponay-Szabó IR', 'Laurila K', 'Szondy Z', 'Halttunen T', 'Szalai Z', 'Dahlbom I', 'Rantala I', 'Kovács JB', 'Fésüs L', 'Mäki M']",2003,52,2,Gut,"Korponay-Szabó IR, et al.

12485471,Genetic dissection between coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis in sib pairs.,"Gluten sensitive enteropathy has various manifestations, of which the two major forms are classical coeliac disease (cCD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). In cCD predominantly the small intestine is affected, whereas in DH also the skin is affected showing typical rash and IgA deposits. The symptoms in both forms are dependent on gluten intake. The factors diversifying these two clinical outcomes are unknown. In the present report we evaluated the role of the major genetic susceptibility locus, HLA DQ, in 25 families, in which both forms of the disease, cCD and DH, occurred in siblings. By using the family-based approach it can be assumed that within each family variation in environmental factors is substantially lower than in the standard case-control setting, and also the problems related to population stratification can be avoided. Results from the Finnish family material with 25 discordant and 85 concordant sib pairs, and from additional case-control material comprising 71 unrelated Hungarian DH and 68 cCD patients, together indicated that the HLA DQ locus did not differ between the two major outcomes of gluten sensitive enteropathy. The non-HLA DR;DQ factors are critical for the different clinical manifestations of gluten sensitivity.","['Karell K', 'Korponay-Szabo I', 'Szalai Z', 'Holopainen P', 'Mustalahti K', 'Collin P', 'Mäki M', 'Partanen J']",2002,66,Pt 5-6,Ann Hum Genet,"Karell K, et al.

12477369,Recognition and management of the cutaneous manifestations of celiac disease: a guide for dermatologists.,"In celiac disease, the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals, such as wheat, rye, and barley, results in small-bowel mucosal inflammation and villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia. The prevalence of the condition may be as high as 1% in the adult population. The disease can also embrace various extraintestinal manifestations, of which dermatitis herpetiformis is the best known. Earlier, dermatitis herpetiformis was considered a skin disease occurring often concomitantly with celiac disease. At present, a body of evidence shows that dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, and affects approximately 25% of patients with celiac disease. Both conditions can appear in the same family and are closely linked to HLA class II locus in chromosome 6; 90% of patients have HLA DQ2 and, almost all the remainder, HLA DQ8. All patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have at least some-degree of mucosal inflammation or lesion consistent with celiac disease. The etiology of celiac disease in not fully understood, but tissue transglutaminase seems to be the predominant autoantigen both in the intestine and the skin. Serum antibodies against tissue transglutaminase can be used in the serologic screening and follow-up of dietary compliance of patients with celiac disease. Gluten-free diet is essential in the treatment of both conditions, and oral dapsone is usually needed in newly detected dermatitis herpetiformis in order to alleviate symptoms. Oral mucosal lesions, alopecia areata, and vitiligo probably occur more frequently in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis than in the general population. By contrast, the reported association of celiac disease with psoriasis seems to be coincidental.","['Collin P', 'Reunala T']",2003,4,1,Am J Clin Dermatol,Collin P and Reunala T.

Thus, these cells might play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. We investigated the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta repertoire in involved and non-involved skin and compared it with the TCR delta repertoire of the inflamed duodenum and peripheral blood of the same patients. An identical TCR delta repertoire in the small bowel and in the cutaneous lesions would suggest a migration of antigen-specific gammadelta T cells from the intestine to the skin which cross-react with cutaneous antigens. T-cell receptor DV1-DV3 transcripts were amplified by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and analyzed by complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) size spectratyping and nucleotide sequencing. Our results indicate that the cutaneous TCR delta repertoires were oligoclonal and identical dominant gammadelta T-cell clones were present in the involved and non-involved skin. Furthermore, the TCR delta repertoire of the skin was distinct from that in the small bowel. The peripheral blood exhibited a restricted TCR delta repertoire, which differed from that in the intestine and skin. Thus, cutaneous gammadelta T cells are not specifically expanded within the involved skin and are unlikely to be derived from the inflamed duodenum.","['Holtmeier W', 'Pfänder M', 'Zollner TM', 'Kaufmann R', 'Caspary WF']",2002,11,6,Exp Dermatol,"Holtmeier W, et al.

Direct immunofluorescence revealed linear deposition of IgA, IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Indirect immunofluorescence detected IgG and IgA antibodies against the BMZ. Salt-split skin technique demonstrated that IgG antibodies bound exclusively to the dermal side, while IgA antibodies bound not only to the dermal side, but also to the epidermal side with relatively weak intensity. On immunoblot analysis, the patient's IgG antibodies exclusively reacted with a band of 200-kDa, while the antigenic target of IgA antibodies was not identified.

12452859,"Neutrophil CD11b, L-selectin and Fc IgA receptors in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.","BACKGROUND: The skin lesions found in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) are characterized by the presence of neutrophils at the dermal papillary tips in areas where the diagnostic cutaneous IgA deposits are found. Although the presence of the skin lesions of DH is known to be associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, the mechanisms that control the development of skin lesions are not known.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if circulating neutrophils from patients with DH have evidence of priming as shown by increased expression of CD11b, decreased expression of L-selectin and increased function of neutrophil Fc IgA receptor.
METHODS: Neutrophils from 12 normal subjects and 10 DH patients with active, ongoing disease and 14 DH patients with quiescent disease activity were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter for expression of cell surface CD11b, L-selectin expression, Fc IgA expression (CD89) and for the function of the Fc IgA receptor by determining the binding capacity of neutrophils for monoclonal human IgA.
RESULTS: Neutrophils from patients with active, ongoing DH had increased expression of CD11b when compared with patients with inactive DH or normal subjects [mean net geometric mean channel fluorescence (GMCF): active DH, 403.3; inactive DH, 237.8; normal subjects, 290.5; P < 0.05]. L-selectin expression in both groups of DH patients was significantly lower than that seen in normal subjects (mean net GMCF: active DH, 363.2; inactive DH, 375.2; normal subjects, 432.7; P < 0.05). No difference in CD89 expression was seen in any of the groups; however, the function of Fc IgA receptor was increased in patients with active DH when compared with patients with inactive DH and normal subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils from patients with active, ongoing DH show an increased expression of CD11b, decreased expression of L-selectin and increased ability to bind IgA, consistent with a pattern of priming of the neutrophils. This priming may occur in the gut as a result of the ongoing mucosal immune response that is present in patients with DH on a gluten-containing diet and may predispose neutrophils to localize in the skin of patients with DH.","['Smith AD', 'Streilein RD', 'Hall RP']",2002,147,6,Br J Dermatol,"Smith AD, et al.

METHODS: By using Swedish population-based inpatient and cancer registry data, we followed-up 12,000 subjects with CD or DH, and evaluated cancer incidence by using standardized incidence ratios (SIR).
RESULTS: Adults (but not children and adolescents) with CD had an elevated overall risk for cancer (SIR = 1.3) that declined with time and eventually reached unity. Elevated risks were found for malignant lymphomas, small-intestinal, oropharyngeal, esophageal, large intestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic carcinomas. The excess occurrence of malignant lymphomas was confined to adults, decreased with time of follow-up evaluation, and decreased over successive calendar periods. Decreased risks were found for breast cancer. Subjects with DH had a slightly increased overall cancer risk (SIR = 1.2) owing to excesses of malignant lymphoma and leukemia, but no increases of gastrointestinal carcinomas.
CONCLUSIONS: Albeit increased, the relative risks for lymphomas and gastrointestinal cancers in this study are lower (and declining) than in most previous reports.

12351994,The neurology of gluten sensitivity: separating the wheat from the chaff.,"Coeliac disease is the prototypical gluten-sensitive disease. Clinico-pathological features heal on a gluten-free diet and relapse when gluten is reintroduced. An immunopathology is suspected. A number of neurological syndromes may be associated with coeliac disease but it is unclear whether these are directly or indirectly caused by gluten ingestion. It has been proposed that idiopathic ataxias and central nervous system white matter disease are gluten-sensitive syndromes. This is an exciting hypothesis because it offers new therapeutic possibilities including simple exclusion diets. However, interpretation is difficult because occult sub-clinical coeliac disease occurs commonly and background prevalence needs to be accounted for in population-based studies. This review will attempt to summarize the pertinent literature on this fascinating topic.","['Wills AJ', 'Unsworth DJ']",2002,15,5,Curr Opin Neurol,Wills AJ and Unsworth DJ.

12220281,Dermatitis herpetiformis: should direct immunofluorescence be the only diagnostic criterion?,"We describe a 7-year-old boy with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) diagnosed on clinical and histologic evidence, negative direct immunofluorescence (DIF) findings for junctional IgA deposits in uninvolved skin, positive IgA endomysial and gliadin antibodies, and jejunal biopsy revealing a gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Treatment with dapsone led to the disappearance of cutaneous lesions and pruritus within 48 hours. Demonstration of IgA immune deposits in the dermal papillae has been the only acceptable criterion for the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis. However, considering several reports in the literature of DH with a negative DIF and our own case, we believe that in the absence of the characteristic DIF pattern, one needs the combination of clinical, histologic, and immunologic data to support the diagnosis of DH. We also discuss recent developments in the diagnosis of DH.","['Sousa L', 'Bajanca R', 'Cabral J', 'Fiadeiro T']",2002,19,4,Pediatr Dermatol,"Sousa L, et al.

12219268,[Oral antibiotics with antiinflammatory/ immunomodulatory effects in the treatment of various dermatoses].,"A range of antibiotics has been shown to modify host functions apart from the antimicrobial potency. They may directly influence phagocyte and lymphocyte function, as well as chemotaxis. Effects on the generation and release of various cytokines involved in the inflammatory process have been studied both in vivo and in vitro. However, the molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated in detail. It is suggested that antibiotics can exert immunopharmacological effects on the basis of structure-activity relationships independent of their antibacterial activity. We present a collection of clinical studies and case reports dealing with the potential benefits of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of selected dermatoses which have primarily been classified as non-infectious. Generally accepted treatments such as dapsone in dermatitis herpetiformis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis or chloroquine in lupus erythematosus have not been considered. Based on existing clinical trials with a higher number of cases the following antibiotics have been shown to be effective: erythromycin in bullous pemphigoid and pityriasis rosea as well as tetracyclines in pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid and pustulosis palmaris et plantaris. However, most reports have to be viewed critically due to the uncontrolled study design, particularly in dermatoses with a tendency to spontaneous resolution. Despite this lack of evidence-based data, it is important for the clinician to know about the potential use of antibiotics for various skin disorders as a primary treatment option or steroid-sparing therapeutic adjunct. In clinical practice the use of antibiotics depends on various factors including the severity of the disease, the patient's age, contraindications to conventional therapeutic regiments and economic considerations.","['Brinkmeier T', 'Frosch PJ']",2002,53,7,Hautarzt,Brinkmeier T and Frosch PJ.

They are thought to be rarer in the Far East than in western Europe.
OBJECTIVE: This 2-year retrospective study investigates the spectrum seen at our centre and the minimum estimated incidence of each.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 67 patients seen at the National Skin Centre (NSC), Singapore between January 1998 and December 1999 were diagnosed as having an SEIBD. Fifty-nine (88%) had BP, four (6%) had EBA, two (3%) LAD and two (3%) BSLE. There were no cases of CP, DH or PG diagnosed during this period. The minimum estimated incidence in our local population was 7.6, 0.5, 0.26 and 0.26 per million population per year, respectively. The mean age of onset was 77, 68, 65 and 31 years, respectively.
RESULTS: BP is the commonest SEIBD seen locally, with an incidence at least equal to that in western Europe. It is diagnosed at our centre three times more frequently than pemphigus. There is a predilection for ethnic Chinese but not Indian. EBA is twice as common as in western Europe and shows a predilection for ethnic Indians. LAD is rare here compared to China, despite the predominant Chinese population. BSLE is also rare. In contrast to western Europe, CP, DH and PG are very rare in Singapore.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study from this region to show that certain SEIBDs are not rarer in the Far East, as previously thought.","['Wong SN', 'Chua SH']",2002,147,3,Br J Dermatol,"Wong SN and Chua SH.

12199198,[Diagnosis and therapy of celiac disease in adolescence and adulthood].,"The incidence of celiac disease has increased considerably during the last two decades. Celiac Disease is now diagnosed in adults at least as frequently as in children. A prevalence of about 1:200 seems reasonable in central Europe. Besides the typical symptomatic presentation, silent, latent and potential celiac disease are found. Oligo- to asymptomatic courses (silent celiac disease) are increasingly found in all age groups. Endomysial antibodies and tissue-transglutaminase antibodies are sensitive and specific for about 95% of celiac patients. However, the final diagnosis is only done by a - mostly endoscopical - biopsy from the distal part of the duodenum, demonstrating hyperplastic villous atrophy of the mucosa with increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. The biopsies should be classified histologically according to the modified Marsh criteria. Increased prevalence in family members (10 to 15%) and in associated diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus) lead to the recommendation of active screening in populations at risk. Although the clinical symptoms are rather variable and different, the response to a lifelong strict gluten free diet is nearly 100%. So-called refractory celiac disease is very rare. There are numerous associated diseases as dermatitis herpetiformis, diabetes mellitus type I, thyroid and neurologic diseases. The most frequent complications are retardation of growth in childhood, early onset osteoporosis, and an increased risk of abortions. The most severe complication is intestinal lymphoma. Especially patients with late diagnosis and bad dietary adherence are at risk. A regular follow-up of patients, rather with antibody tests than with duodenal biopsies is recommended to test and secure dietary compliance.","['Vogelsang H', 'Propst A', 'Dragosics B', 'Granditsch G', 'Working Group for Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases of the Austrian Society of Gastroenterology and Hepatology']",2002,40,7,Z Gastroenterol,"Vogelsang H, et al.

12165736,Levels of F(1+2) prothrombin fragments and thrombin - antithrombin III (TAT) complexes in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a rare bullous disease of autoimmune etiology. It is an intestinocutaneous syndrome, in which vesicopapular cutaneous lesions are accompanied by gluten-dependent enteropathy. The diagnosis of DH is based on immunopathological investigation of unaffected skin fragment (granular IgA deposits present at the tops of dermal papillae and IgA - EmA present in the serum).
MATERIAL/METHODS: The studied group consisted of 33 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis - 23 males and 10 females aged 22-78 (mean age 44.7). In all the patients, the following parameters of blood coagulation systems were determined in the plasma Levels of prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F(1+2)), levels of thrombin - antithrombin III (TAT) complexes, antithrombin III activity (AT III).
RESULTS: In patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, the main level of F(1+2) fragments amounted to 9.08 nmol/l, as compared with 1.14 nmol/l in the control group (the difference statistically significant, p<0.0001). In DH patients, the levels of TAT complexes were over twice higher than among the controls and that difference also reached statistical significance (p<0.0001). Mean antithrombin III activity (AT III) in patients with DH reached 102.60% and was similar to that observed in the control group (104.68%).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, increased levels of F(1+2) prothrombin fragments and TAT complexes indicate enhanced in vivo thrombinogenesis. No statistically significant differences of F(1+2), TAT and AT III levels in DH patients related to their sex, age and duration of the disease were observed.","['Wankiewicz A', 'Iwan-Zietek I', 'Gwieździński Z', 'Kotschy M']",2002,8,8,Med Sci Monit,"Wankiewicz A, et al.

12142608,Characterization of a subgroup of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis with nonclassical histologic features.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune disease mediated by IgA antibodies. The diagnosis of DH is based on clinical presentation, biopsy for hematoxylin and eosin, and direct immunofluorescence. The chief hematoxylin and eosin finding is a subepithelial blister with neutrophils in dermal papillae. The direct immunofluorescence findings are deposition of IgA and sometimes C3 at the basement membrane with accentuation in dermal papillae. Immunofluorescence is thought to be a sensitive and specific assay in DH, and there are no other known diseases with this pattern of immunofluorescence. The aim of this project was to determine the prevalence of nonclassical histologic findings in DH. We studied 24 cases of DH received at our institution. All cases had clinical findings of DH as well as positive direct immunofluorescence with IgA. We found that 9 of 24 cases (37.5%) had nonspecific H&E findings of a lymphocytic infiltrate only with fibrosis in the dermal papillae and ectatic capillaries. The remaining 15 cases had classic findings of multilocular neutrophilic microabscesses in the dermal papillae. These findings were reproduced on step sectioning. These findings suggest that routine histology may be quite nonspecific in DH and direct immunofluorescence or other more specific immunologic assay is an essential adjunct to diagnosis.","['Warren SJ', 'Cockerell CJ']",2002,24,4,Am J Dermatopathol,Warren SJ and Cockerell CJ.

12125958,Iodine and gliadin challenge on oral mucosa in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Oral lesions and mucosal inflammatory changes may appear in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). We examined whether potassium iodine, known to initiate blisters in the DH skin, or wheat gliadin, responsible for T-cell-dependent intestinal damage, can induce visible or microscopic changes in oral mucosa. Six patients with active DH were challenged with crude gliadin and 50% potassium iodine applied in patch test chambers on buccal mucosa for 12 h. After reading, biopsies were taken from the challenged and non-challenged mucosa. No macroscopic or microscopic vesicles were seen. However, gliadin- but not iodine-challenged epithelium showed increased numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes in all 5 patients with representative specimens (p = 0.06). No marked changes were found in the numbers of CD8+ or TcR alpha/beta+ lymphocytes, and the numbers of TcR gamma/delta+ cells remained at a low level. The results show that oral mucosa is resistant to production of macroscopic or microscopic DH lesions. It is, however, capable of reacting to locally applied gliadin by a T-cell response consisting of CD4+ lymphocytes.","['Patinen P', 'Hietane J', 'Malmström M', 'Reunala T', 'Savilahti E']",2002,82,2,Acta Derm Venereol,"Patinen P, et al.

12056959,Product-related emphasis of skin disease information online.,"BACKGROUND: In 2000, 41 million people searched for medical information online. The quality of that information is unregulated, variable, and not well studied.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify and compare the numbers and types of Internet sites matched for 10 diverse skin conditions through different search systems.
DESIGN: Search strategies were performed at 6-month intervals via Netscape Navigator, using 3 search engines and 1 directory. Ten skin conditions were chosen to represent common (psoriasis and eczema), cosmetic (wrinkles and cellulite), difficult-to-treat (alopecia, mastocytosis, granuloma annulare, and xanthoma), and uncommon (dermatitis herpetiformis and epidermolysis bullosa) problems. Search strings were designed to generate lists of Web sites that provide educational or product-related information. Results were compared.
SETTING: The Saint Louis University information technology server, July 9, 1999, December 16, 1999, and February 5, 2000.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparisons of the total number, top 10 ranking, and type (educational vs product-related) of sites that matched through different search systems at 6-month intervals.
RESULTS: The total number of matched sites for different skin conditions varied up to 100-fold. This number increased by 30% to 316% between July and December 1999. The largest number of Web sites related to wrinkles, followed by Web sites related to common conditions. Product-related sites outnumbered educational sites, especially for common and cosmetic conditions. Although there were differences in the total number of sites found through different search engines, the ratios of product-related to educational sites were similar. Different search engines yielded different top 10 match lists for the same condition. The top 10 lists included higher proportions of educational sites than the total match lists for all conditions except cellulite. Within the top 10 lists, the rank order of well respected sites varied by search engine used and changed over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients are increasingly accessing the growing body of data available through the Internet. Most Web sites contain information related to products. Until standards are enacted to govern the distribution of online medical information, consumers are at risk for obtaining misinformation and buying ineffective products. To better guide patients, physicians must become familiar with this ever-changing information.","['Hu W', 'Siegfried EC', 'Siegel DM']",2002,138,6,Arch Dermatol,"Hu W, et al.

12037403,"Serum eosinophil cationic protein, myeloperoxidase, tryptase, eotaxin and Th2-L-like cytokines in Dermatitis herpetiformis.","BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a subepidermal bullous disease characterized by a neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrate, together with activated lymphocytes that show preferential polarization towards the Th2-like phenotype. To date, the role of neither soluble mediators, such as cytokines, nor serum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and tryptase (TRY) have been studied in the peripheral blood of DH. In this study we investigated 40 DH subjects for possible alterations in MPO, ECP, TRY, eotaxin, interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-5 concentrations to evaluate the role of neutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells in the induction of skin lesions. Sera from 20 healthy subjects were tested as controls.
METHODS: Eotaxin, IL-4 and IL-5 serum contents were determined by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A double antibody radioimmunoassay was used to measure serum levels of MPO, ECP and TRY.
RESULTS: Normal levels of eotaxin and IL-4 were found in all DH subjects; increased IL-5 levels were found only in 1 subject. The MPO levels were significantly higher in DH subjects than in healthy controls (p < 0.01). There was also a significant difference between the serum ECP levels of DH and healthy controls (p < 0.05). TRY was not revealed in the serum of DH subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The determination of Th2-like cytokines and TRY serum levels is not important in quantifying the involvement of activated lymphocytes and mast cells in DH; however, the finding of high MPO and ECP serum levels seems to confirm that these products are good markers of the presence of activated neutrophils and eosinophils.","['Caproni M', 'Cardinali C', ""D'Agata A"", 'Selvaggi W', 'Fabbri P']",2002,128,1,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,"Caproni M, et al.

A selection of autoimmune blistering diseases, including pemphigus vulgaris, paraneoplastic pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA dermatosis are reviewed. Pemphigus vulgaris usually starts in the oral mucosa followed by blistering of the skin, which is often painful. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is associated with neoplasms, most commonly of lymphoid tissue, but also Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, sarcomas, thymomas and Castleman's disease. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by large, tense bullae, but may begin as an urticarial eruption. Cicatricial (scarring) pemphigoid presents with severe, erosive lesions of the mucous membranes with skin involvement in one third of patients focused around the head and upper trunk. Dermatitis herpetiformis is intensely pruritic and chronic, characterized by papulovesicles and urticarial wheals on the extensor surfaces in a grouped or herpetiform, symmetric distribution. Linear IgA dermatosis is clinically similar to dermatitis herpetiformis, but it is not associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy as is dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Bickle K', 'Roark TR', 'Hsu S']",2002,65,9,Am Fam Physician,"Bickle K, et al.

To characterize immunological activation and mild inflammations leading to overt CD in potential coeliac patients, jejunal biopsies were obtained from family members of patients with CD or dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Nine family members and one latent CD, eight CD patients and eight normal controls furnished jejunal biopsy specimens. Immunohistochemical staining of sections for interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), CD3, gammadelta-T cell receptor (gammadelta-TCR), and alphabeta-TCR was carried out with monoclonal antibodies. Further, expression of IL-4 and IFN-gamma messenger RNA was detected by radioactive in situ hybridization in these same samples. In lamina propria, CD patients and potential CD patients had higher densities of IL-2 (P = 0.028, P = 0.043), IL-4 (P = 0.021, P = 0.034) and IFN-gamma positive cells (P = 0.000, P = 0.009) than did controls. Moreover, CD patients showed a higher density of TNF-alpha positive cells (P = 0.012, P = 0.001) than the other two groups, and expression of IFN-gamma mRNA (P = 0.035) was higher in them than in the other two study groups. Additionally, higher densities of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma positive cells occurred in potential CD patients with high gammadelta-TCR+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Our findings support the hypothesis that lamina propria T cells and macrophages, through their secretion of cytokines, play a central role in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease. The inflammatory cytokines found in potential CD specimens strongly suggest that these inflammatory markers can be identified long before visible villous changes have occurred.","['Westerholm-Ormio M', 'Garioch J', 'Ketola I', 'Savilahti E']",2002,128,1,Clin Exp Immunol,"Westerholm-Ormio M, et al.

The initial vesiculobullous stage of IP is characterized clinically by inflammatory papules, blisters, and pustules, and histopathologically by acanthosis, keratinocyte necrosis, epidermal spongiosis and massive epidermal eosinophil infiltration. The cause of this multisystem disease is attributed to the mutations of an X-linked regulatory gene, termed nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). The exact mechanism of epidermal eosinophil accumulation has not yet been determined. We explored the possible role of an eosinophil-selective, nuclear factor-kappaB-activated chemokine, eotaxin, in the accumulation of eosinophils in the initial stage of the disease. Monoclonal antibody (6H9) specific for human eotaxin strongly labelled the suprabasal epidermis of IP skin, paralleling the upper epidermal accumulation of eosinophils, but did not label the epidermis of normal skin or lesional skin from patients with other inflammatory skin diseases not characterized by prominent eosinophil accumulation, namely dermatitis herpetiformis and selected cases of atopic dermatitis lacking significant numbers of eosinophils. In addition, endothelial cells in lesional skin of IP also exhibited strong expression of eotaxin, which correlated with perivascular and intravascular eosinophil infiltration. We also examined the in vitro effects on epidermally derived eotaxin of several cytokines that were nuclear factor-kappaB-activated and/or known to induce eotaxin expression. In normal human keratinocytes, proinflammatory cytokines either independently (IL-1alpha) or synergistically (tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)/ interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and TNF-alpha/IL-4) up-regulated eotaxin expression. These studies suggest that release of cytokines during the initial inflammatory stage of IP induces epidermal expression of eotaxin, which may play a role in the epidermal accumulation of eosinophils.","['Jean-Baptiste S', ""O'Toole EA"", 'Chen M', 'Guitart J', 'Paller A', 'Chan LS']",2002,127,3,Clin Exp Immunol,"Jean-Baptiste S, et al.

11910857,[Autoantigens of subepidermal bullous autoimmune dermatoses].,"The dermal-epidermal junction contains a network of structural proteins that link epidermis and dermis. A central component of this complex is the cell membrane-associated hemidesmosomal plaque. Formation of autoantibodies against different components of this hemidesmosomal anchoring complex can lead to subepidermal blisters. Such autoantibodies have been frequently used to characterize the target antigens at the molecular level. Autoimmune subepidermal blistering diseases include bullous pemphigoid, pemphigoid gestationis, lichen planus pemphigoides, linear IgA disease, cicatricial pemphigoid, anti-p450-, anti-p200- and anti-p105-pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, bullous systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring. Differences in the clinical picture of these diseases can be attributed, at least in part, to the different specificity of the autoantibodies involved.

11907355,Celiac disease in Brazilian adults.,"UNLABELLED: Forty-eight adult patients with celiac disease between 15 and 68 years of age (mean, 41 years) were studied. Sixty-seven percent were female and 33% were male patients. Most of the patients were white (98%). The main clinical features were diarrhea (90%), weight loss (70%), and abdominal pain (56%). On physical examination, the main findings were pallor (40%), aphthous stomatitis (31%), and arthralgia (23%). Associated disorders included diabetes mellitus type I, osteoporosis, and atopy (6% each); dermatitis herpetiformis and depression (4% each); and hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, duodenal carcinoma, and Gilbert syndrome (2% each). The histologic results according to Marsh criteria (modified by Rostami) are as follows: type I, 10%; type II, 21%; type IIIa, 19%; type IIIb, 17%; and type IIIc, 33%. The sensitivity and specificity for the antiendomysium antibody-immunoglobulin A test were 92% and 100%, respectively, when considering the whole group of patients; however, the sensitivity (but not the specificity) decreased to 86% when taking into account only the group of patients with mild histologic alterations (Marsh type I, II, and IIIa).
CONCLUSION: In general, the authors' results are similar to those described in developing countries, indicating that celiac disease might have the same spectrum of presentation regardless of the region studied.","['de Freitas IN', 'Sipahi AM', 'Damião AO', 'de Brito T', 'Cançado EL', 'Leser PG', 'Laudanna AA']",2002,34,4,J Clin Gastroenterol,"de Freitas IN, et al.

11901200,Epidermal transglutaminase (TGase 3) is the autoantigen of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Gluten sensitivity typically presents as celiac disease, a common chronic small intestinal disorder. However, in certain individuals it is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, a blistering skin disease characterized by granular IgA deposits in the papillary dermis. While tissue transglutaminase has been implicated as the major autoantigen of gluten sensitive disease, there has been no explanation as to why this condition appears in two distinct forms. Here we show that while sera from patients with either form of gluten sensitive disease react both with tissue transglutaminase and the related enzyme epidermal (type 3) transglutaminase, antibodies in patients having dermatitis herpetiformis show a markedly higher avidity for epidermal transglutaminase. Further, these patients have an antibody population specific for this enzyme. We also show that the IgA precipitates in the papillary dermis of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, the defining signs of the disease, contain epidermal transglutaminase, but not tissue transglutaminase or keratinocyte transglutaminase. These findings demonstrate that epidermal transglutaminase, rather than tissue transglutaminase, is the dominant autoantigen in dermatitis herpetiformis and explain why skin symptoms appear in a proportion of patients having gluten sensitive disease.","['Sárdy M', 'Kárpáti S', 'Merkl B', 'Paulsson M', 'Smyth N']",2002,195,6,J Exp Med,"Sárdy M, et al.

11887034,Selected parameters of fibrinolysis system in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a very rare bullous dermatitis of autoimmune origin. It is a syndrome involving dermal and intestinal pathology, in which vesicopapular skin lesions are accompanied by gluten-dependent enteropathy. The diagnosis of DH is based on immunopathological investigation of unaffected skin bioptate (presence of granular IgA deposits in the upper portions of dermal papillae).
MATERIAL/METHODS: The study was carried out in a group of 33 patients, including 23 males and 10 females aged 22-78 (mean age 44.7 years). The following fibrinolysis system parameters were determined in the sera of all patients: tissue plasminogen activator concentration (t-PA: Ag), urokinase plasminogen activator concentration (u-PA: Ag), plasminogen activator inhibitor concentration (PAI-Ag), plasminogen level, alpha-2 antiplasmin activity (alpha-2-AP), plasmin-- alpha-2 antiplasmin complexes concentration (PAP).
RESULTS: Mean t-PA concentration in DH patients was 5.52 ng/ml, vs. 4.8 ng/ml in controls. The respective u-PA concentrations amounted to 0.33 ng/ml, and 0.39 ng/ml. PAI-1 concentration was markedly higher in DH patients (36.2 ng/ml) than in controls (22.40 ng/ml), whereas plasminogen level was significantly lower (86.0% vs. 115.9%). In patients, alpha-2-AP activity was 92% and was lower than in controls -103.4%. DH patients demonstrated also higher concentrations of PAP complexes (327.45 ng/ml) than the control group (203.03 ng/ml).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DH were found to have lower plasminogen and alpha-2 antiplasmin levels and increased concentrations of PAP complexes, which indicates increased plasminogenesis in vivo. Increased type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor level (PAI-1) may reflect a chronic inflammatory condition present in DH patients.","['Wankiewicz A', 'Iwan-Zietek I', 'Kotschy M', 'Gwieździński Z']",2002,8,3,Med Sci Monit,"Wankiewicz A, et al.

11861953,The hunt for coeliac disease in primary care.,"BACKGROUND: Serological screening suggests that most coeliac disease goes undetected.
AIM: To determine how often coeliac disease is found in patients referred for gastroscopy by general practitioners.
DESIGN: Testing of 9971 consecutive patients referred to a single health centre for their first open-access gastroscopy over a 10-year period, without previously-diagnosed coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis.
METHODS: Endoscopy and routine duodenal biopsy were in use throughout the study period. The occurrence of coeliac disease was evaluated in patients with dyspepsia, in those with regurgitation, and in those with symptoms suggestive of coeliac disease.
RESULTS: Altogether, 147 (1.47%) patients had coeliac disease: 18/2974 (0.61%) with regurgitation, 41/5347 (0.77%) with dyspepsia, and 88/1650 (5.33%) with suspected coeliac disease. Increasing age reduced the risk very slightly (OR 0.98; 95%CI 0.97-0.99). Risk was significantly increased when there was a suspicion of coeliac disease (OR 9.085; 95%CI 5.371-15.369), while no difference was found between patients with dyspepsia and those with reflux disease (OR 1.33; 95%CI 0.75-2.34). The risk in women was not increased (OR 0.97; 95%CI 0.69-1.38).
DISCUSSION: In this primary-care setting, <1% of patients with upper abdominal symptoms suffered from coeliac disease; population-based serological screening is expected to yield a corresponding prevalence. When physicians had suspected coeliac disease, the condition was nine times more common.","['Collin P', 'Rasmussen M', 'Kyrönpalo S', 'Laippala P', 'Kaukinen K']",2002,95,2,QJM,"Collin P, et al.

11843035,First-degree relatives are frequently affected in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are phenotypically distinct gluten-sensitive diseases. Coeliac disease is known to cluster in families, whereas there is little evidence for dermatitis herpetiformis and for the occurrence of both diseases in the same families.
METHODS: The study group comprised 380 patients with coeliac disease and 281 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, with a total of 3158 first-degree relatives, followed up for a mean of 14 years. The patients were questioned about affected first-degree relatives. The prevalence and incidence of biopsy-proven coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis in relatives were determined.
RESULTS: Seventy-three (19.2%) patients with coeliac disease and 51 (18.1%) with dermatitis herpetiformis had affected first-degree relatives. The prevalence among relatives was similar for both diseases; 4.7% and 3.9% of the relatives had coeliac disease and 0.8% and 1.5% had dermatitis herpetiformis, respectively. The disease prevalence was 7% among siblings, 4.5% among parents and 3.5% among children. The annual incidence was 3/1,000 relatives, which is 15 times higher than among the general population. Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis were mixed in several multiple-case families.
CONCLUSIONS: The present long-term follow-up study of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis shows that every fifth patient can have affected first-degree relatives, and that the prevalence among relatives is 5.5%. Dermatitis herpetiformis segregates also in the families of patients with coeliac disease, and vice versa, indicating the same genetic background.","['Hervonen K', 'Hakanen M', 'Kaukinen K', 'Collin P', 'Reunala T']",2002,37,1,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Hervonen K, et al.

11834848,Dermatitis herpetiformis in Japan: an update.,"BACKGROUND: Although dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a relatively common disease in Caucasian populations, it is rare in Asian populations including the Japanese. We encountered a Japanese case of DH which showed granular IgA and C3 deposits in the papillary dermis and which was associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy but no HLA-B8/DR3/DQ2.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics of Japanese DH cases, since most of them have been reported in Japanese language and dermatologists outside Japan are not familiar with the characteristics of Japanese DH.
METHODS: We have reviewed all 34 Japanese DH cases reported previously.
RESULTS: We found several features of Japanese DH compared with Caucasian DH, such as a high frequency of the fibrillar pattern, rarity of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and an absence of the HLA-B8/DR3/DQ2 haplotype.
CONCLUSION: There might be significant differences in pathophysiology between Caucasian and Japanese DH cases.","['Shibahara M', 'Nanko H', 'Shimizu M', 'Kanda N', 'Kubo M', 'Ikeda M', 'Matsumoto M', 'Nonaka S', 'Shimizu H']",2002,204,1,Dermatology,"Shibahara M, et al.

11796779,Dermatitis herpetiformis and neurological dysfunction.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease are gluten sensitive diseases, which have common immunopathological and genetic mechanisms. Neuropsychiatric complications have been reported in up to 26% of patients with coeliac disease. This is probably an overestimate, because of the chance associations with some common neurological conditions such as epilepsy. The pathogenesis is speculative but it has been postulated that gluten is neurotoxic possibly via immune mechanisms. The frequency of neurological dysfunction in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis has not been characterised. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis might be expected to be particularly susceptible to neuronal damage as some continue to consume gluten when their dermatological symptoms are controlled by dapsone. Thirty five patients were recruited with dermatitis herpetiformis from dermatology clinics at St Mary's Hospital, London and Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham and investigated for evidence of neurological abnormality. All patients underwent a full neurological examination and were asked about their neurological and general medical history by means of a structured questionnaire. Serum samples were taken and screened for the presence of anti-neuronal antibodies (anti-Hu and Yo) as well as anti-gliadin (IgA and G) anti-endomysial (IgA), and anti-tissue transglutaminase (IgA) antibodies. Neurophysiological tests were carried out where appropriate. Only two patients were identified with unexplained neurological abnormalities (one essential tremor, and one chorea). Two other patients had a history of migraine. The patient with chorea also had borderline/equivocally positive anti-Hu antibodies by immunofluorescence assay. All other samples were negative for anti-neuronal antibodies. Fifteen patients were positive for anti-gliadin antibodies (IgA and/or IgG), four for anti-endomysial antibodies (monkey oesophagus or umbilical cord), and six for anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. The presence of these antibodies did not correlate with the presence of neurological abnormalities. No cases of ""gluten ataxia"" were identified. In conclusion, there was no convincing evidence for immune mediated neurological damage in this pilot study of dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Wills AJ', 'Turner B', 'Lock RJ', 'Johnston SL', 'Unsworth DJ', 'Fry L']",2002,72,2,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Wills AJ, et al.

All patients showed an almost complete resolution of their symptoms within 2-4 weeks. All patients rated the treatment results with dapsone as good or very good.

11507352,Flow-cytometric detection of lactase expression in normal and coeliac intestinal epithelium.,"OBJECTIVE: Enterocyte lactase expression is a useful marker of gluten toxicity. In this study, the technique of flow cytometry was evaluated to quantify lactase expression in coeliac disease (CD).
METHODS: Duodenal enterocyte suspensions were obtained from 23 patients with CD, four patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and 33 control subjects. The percentage of enterocytes that reacted with anti-lactase monoclonal antibody was determined by flow cytometry. In some subjects, organ culture of duodenal biopsies in the presence of various stimuli (including gluten fractions) was performed before enterocyte analysis.
RESULTS: This study demonstrated that lactase expression can be readily investigated semi-quantitatively using flow cytometry. Moreover, the level of expression correlated with the extent of mucosal damage in gluten-sensitive individuals. However, in organ culture experiments, lactase expression did not change in the presence of gluten or after marked T-cell activation for 48 h.
CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of enterocyte lactase expression by flow cytometry is a useful adjunctive test in the diagnosis and monitoring of gluten-sensitive enteropathy. However, lactase expression is not a suitable marker of gluten-induced toxicity in organ culture.","['Feighery L', 'Lynch S', 'Kilmartin C', 'Abuzakouk M', 'Weir D', 'Jackson J', 'Feighery C']",2001,13,8,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Feighery L, et al.

In addition to subepidermal blistering, histology showed a typical mixed infiltrate of granulocytes and eosinophils and, occasionally, papillar microabsesses in one case. In the two other subjects, characteristic subepidermal lining with granulocytes was observed. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the diagnosis, while autoantibodies characteristic for dermatitis herpetiformis were absent. To our knowledge this is the second report of adult linear IgA dermatosis in association with erythema annulare centrifugum lesions. Our observations concord with several other reports of figurate erythema associated with autoimmune blistering disease and other immune disorders.

11458609,[Adult celiac disease].,"Celiac disease is much common than previously thought with a prevalence of 1/300, but most of cases are poorly symptomatic or silent. Fewer of half of patients report diarrhoea as a presenting symptom. In adults, the diagnosis should be considered, in case of isolated iron deficiency anaemia, neurological symptoms (ataxia, epilepsy), osteoporosis and arthralgia, infertility, dermatitis herpetiformis and abnormalities in liver tests. Characteristic histological features are total or subtotal villous atrophy associated with an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. The most sensitive and specific circulating antibodies for the diagnosis are endomysial and transglutaminase IgA antibodies. The treatment of celiac disease requires a strict gluten free diet, but the observance to this diet is often difficult. In patients refractory to a strict gluten free diet, serious complications such as intestinal lymphoma or refractory sprue should be considered.","['Cellier C', 'Grosdidier E']",2001,51,9,Rev Prat,Cellier C and Grosdidier E.

11419853,Linear IgA bullous dermatosis responsive to a gluten-free diet.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with a gluten-sensitive enteropathy in >85% of cases. Both the skin lesions and the enteropathy respond to gluten restriction. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis has a much lower prevalence of histological small bowel abnormalities, and lesions are not known to respond to gluten restriction. We report a patient with linear IgA bullous dermatosis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. This report addresses the issue of whether linear IgA bullous dermatosis can be associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. We evaluated the response to gluten restriction and normal diet by following the status of the patient's jejunal biopsies and skin lesions. The patient responded to gluten restriction, as shown by resolution of jejunal abnormalities and skin lesions and subsequently by recurrence of jejunal abnormalities and skin lesions with reinstitution of a gluten-containing diet. This report demonstrates that linear IgA bullous dermatosis can respond to gluten restriction if an underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy is present.","['Egan CA', 'Smith EP', 'Taylor TB', 'Meyer LJ', 'Samowitz WS', 'Zone JJ']",2001,96,6,Am J Gastroenterol,"Egan CA, et al.

11379333,Prevalence and clinical presentation of subclinical/silent celiac disease in adults: an analysis on a 12-year observation.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: In recent years, an increased incidence of subclinical/silent celiac disease has been reported. Thus, we herein describe the prevalence and the clinical presentation of subclinical/silent celiac disease in 252 consecutive diagnosed celiac patients.
METHODOLOGY: From 1988 to 1999 we diagnosed 252 celiac patients (74M and 178F, mean age: 27.9 yrs; range: 15-65 yrs, F/M ratio: 2.4). 144 patients were referred to us due to gastrointestinal symptoms, while 108 were referred to us from other specialists due to unexplained or unresponsive disease. All patients underwent both total immunoglobulin A and antigliadin antibodies antiendomysium antibody and evaluation, followed by gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal histological examination.
RESULTS: 144 (57.14%) and 108 (42.86%) patients showed classical and subclinical/silent celiac disease, respectively. The most frequent extraintestinal marker of subclinical celiac disease were iron-deficiency anemia (27.77%), alopecia and dermatitis herpetiformis (11.36%), osteoporosis (6.81%) and recurrent aphtous stomatitis (5.68%), while first-degree relatives (30%), Basedow's disease (25%) and insulin-dependent diabetes (20%) were the most frequent in silent celiac disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the extremely polymorphic nature of this condition that can affect several organs and apparatus without gastrointestinal symptoms. However, a more precise description of subclinical/silent celiac disease can only emerge from screening studies on general populations.","['Tursi A', 'Giorgetti G', 'Brandimarte G', 'Rubino E', 'Lombardi D', 'Gasbarrini G']",2001,48,38,Hepatogastroenterology,"Tursi A, et al.

11311458,"Dapsone-mediated agranulocytosis: risks, possible mechanisms and prevention.","Agranulocytosis is a rare, severe and unpredictable idiosyncratic reaction associated with drug therapy that can lead to life-threatening illness. Typically, the patient presents with a fever and evidence of infection 1-3 months after initiation of drug administration with a neutrophil count below 0.5x10(9) l. Of the drugs linked with this disease, aminopyrine, dipyrone, clozapine, anti-thyroid agents, sulphonamides and dapsone are the best documented. Generally, agranulocytosis is associated with older individuals (>60 years) and those of non-Caucasian descent. The incidence of agranulocytosis in subjects taking oral dapsone in combination with maloprim for malaria is 1 -- 10-20,000 while leprosy patients treated with dapsone exhibit virtually zero risk of agranulocytosis. However, dapsone is unusual in that during the rare but severe inflammatory disease, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), the risk of agranulocytosis is multiplied between 25 and 33 fold compared with normal patients. It is conceivable that dapsone might exhibit a similar risk in coeliac disease, a condition related to DH. As dapsone plasma levels in DH subjects can be high (2-10 microg/ml) the increased risk of agranulocytosis could be related to drug dosage, or increased immune responsiveness. The high risks in DH patients probably necessitate monitoring of neutrophil cell population in the first 3 months of therapy, while topical usage of the drug in acne treatment in otherwise healthy patients predominantly below the age of 25 is at the opposite end of the risk scale, probably as low as 1 in 10-20,000 patients.",['Coleman MD'],2001,162,1,Toxicology,"Coleman MD.

11302971,Candidate gene regions and genetic heterogeneity in gluten sensitivity.,"BACKGROUND: Gluten sensitivity is a common multifactorial disorder, manifested in the small intestine or on the skin as typical coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, respectively. The only established genetic risk factor is HLA DQ2.
AIMS: We tested genetic linkage of previously reported chromosomal loci 5q and 11q in Finnish families with gluten sensitivity. We also tested if genetic linkage to candidate loci on 5q, 11q, 2q33, and HLA DQ differed with respect to clinical manifestations or sex.
SUBJECTS: We studied 102 Finnish families with affected sibpairs. For heterogeneity analysis, families were divided into subgroups according to sex and the presence of dermatitis herpetiformis, the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity.
METHODS: Non-parametric linkage between microsatellite markers and disease was tested. Linkage heterogeneity between subgroups was tested using the M test. The transmission/disequilibrium test and association analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Evidence of linkage to 11q (MLS 1.37), but not to 5q, was found in the entire dataset of 102 families. Heterogeneity between subgroups was suggested: families with only the intestinal disease showed linkage mainly to 2q33 whereas families with dermatitis herpetiformis showed linkage to 11q and 5q, but not to 2q33. Linkage in all three non-HLA loci was strongest in families with predominantly male patients. HLA DQ2 conferred much stronger susceptibility to females than males.
CONCLUSIONS: Independent evidence for the suggested genetic linkage between 11q and gluten sensitivity was obtained. The possible linkage heterogeneity suggests genetic differences between intestinal and skin manifestations, and the gender dependent effect of HLA DQ2.","['Holopainen P', 'Mustalahti K', 'Uimari P', 'Collin P', 'Mäki M', 'Partanen J']",2001,48,5,Gut,"Holopainen P, et al.

11247893,Parallel expression of macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) in duodenal and skin lesions of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a specific dermatological manifestation of coeliac disease and 80% of DH patients have gluten sensitive enteropathy manifested by crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy. Matrix degradation mediated by collagenase 1 (MMP-1) and stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) has previously been implicated in the pathobiology of coeliac intestine and cutaneous DH blisters.
AIMS: To study expression of stromelysin 2, metalloelastase, collagenase 3, and matrilysin in the intestine and skin of DH patients.
METHODS: In situ hybridisation using 35S labelled cRNA probes was performed on duodenal biopsies of 15 DH patients, three samples each of control duodenal or jejunal mucosa, fetal ileal explants, lesional DH skin, and 19 serial biopsies of experimental DH blisters. Immunostaining was used to examine type IV collagen, macrophages (CD68), and 92 kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) in the specimens.
RESULTS: Metalloelastase (MMP-12) was abundantly expressed by subepithelial macrophages in both coeliac intestine and spontaneous and induced DH rash. It was also upregulated in the experimental model of coeliac disease (staphylococcal endotoxin B stimulated fetal explants). The only other MMP detected was MMP-9 which did not colocalise with MMP-12.
CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of metalloelastase is associated with T cell mediated immune responses both in the intestine and skin. In addition to modulating macrophage migration, it may contribute to degradation of proteoglycans or basement membrane components in the subepithelial mucosa.","['Salmela MT', 'Pender SL', 'Reunala T', 'MacDonald T', 'Saarialho-Kere U']",2001,48,4,Gut,"Salmela MT, et al.

11237562,Tissue transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies-diagnostic markers of gluten-sensitive enteropathy in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The association of Durhing's disease, commonly referred to as dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is supported by the presence of villous atrophy and endomysial antibodies (EMA). EMA are found to be a marker of GSE both in celiac disease (CD) and in DH. Since tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is believed to be the major autoantigen in GSE, the aim of our study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of anti-tTG antibody ELISA compared to the EMA indirect immunofluorescence test. We studied 44 cases of DH, confirmed by the presence of IgA immune deposits in the dermal papillae, and 58 cases of CD conforming to the International Criteria of Diagnosing CD. The control group comprised 161 sera from patients with vesiculobullous disorders other than DH and 106 sera from normal healthy blood donors. Anti-tTG antibodies were detected in 36 of 44 DH (79%) and in 32 of 58 CD (55%) patients. EMA were positive in 33 of 44 DH (74%) and in 36 of 58 CD (62%) patients. Both the EMA and the antibodies to tTG were present in the majority of patients with DH and CD when they were on a normal gluten-containing diet and were absent when on a gluten-free diet for an extended period of time. There were, however, small discrepancies in positivity and negativity in tTG antibody-positive and EMA-negative patients and vice versa. There seems to be a correlation between the EMA titers and the anti-tTG antibody levels. This study confirms the high specificity and sensitivity of anti-tTG antibody ELISA for GSE and its strong correlation with EMA both in CD and in DH. The results of anti-tTG antibody and EMA assays were comparable; however, in DH, tTG was somewhat more sensitive than the EMA test. For screening of DH, it is advisable to perform both EMA and anti-tTG antibody tests.","['Kumar V', 'Jarzabek-Chorzelska M', 'Sulej J', 'Rajadhyaksha M', 'Jablonska S']",2001,98,3,Clin Immunol,"Kumar V, et al.

Dapsone remains the most important drug for leprosy and is useful in the prophylaxis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with HIV disease. The medical treatment of choice for dermatitis herpetiformis is dapsone; and sulfapyridine also can be used for those patients who are intolerant of dapsone. Other neutrophilic disorders also may respond to these drugs. Toxic side effects of both dapsone and sulfapyridine are mediated through the hydroxylamine metabolite. These include hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and agranulocytosis.

Important data have accumulated in recent years regarding the association between celiac disease, fertility and pregnancy. Many primary care obstetricians and gynecologists and perinatologists are not aware of these important relationships. The aim of this review, utilizing a MEDLINE search from 1966 through March 2000 of the English language, is to describe the possible effects of celiac disease and its treatment upon the reproductive cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Review of the literature reveals that patients with untreated celiac disease sustain a significantly delayed menarche, earlier menopause, and an increased prevalence of secondary amenorrhea. Patients with untreated celiac disease incur higher miscarriage rates, increased fetal growth restriction, and lower birth weights. It appears that improvement of celiac disease, as reflected by restoration of small bowel mucosa associated with implementation of a gluten-free diet, may decrease miscarriage rates, improve fetal nutritional support and overall perinatal outcome.","['Eliakim R', 'Sherer DM']",2001,51,1,Gynecol Obstet Invest,Eliakim R and Sherer DM.

11121131,Concordance of dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease in monozygous twins.,"Celiac disease can be defined as the classical manifestation of gluten sensitivity, which primarily affects the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity has also a skin manifestation, i.e., dermatitis herpetiformis. Both diseases have a strong genetic association with HLA DQ on chromosome 6. In this study we tried to estimate how much different clinical expressions of gluten sensitivity are determined by genetic factors, and hence how feasible they are for genetic mapping; therefore, we studied all six monozygous twin pairs found among 1292 prospectively collected patients of dermatitis herpetiformis in Finland. Three of the six twin pairs were concordant for dermatitis herpetiformis and for simultaneous enteropathy, celiac disease. Two other twin pairs were partially discordant, one of each pair had dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease, whereas the other had solely the gut manifestation of gluten sensitivity, i.e., celiac disease. Only one pair was found to be discordant for gluten sensitivity. All the pairs had typical risk alleles for gluten sensitivity, i.e., either HLA DQ2 or DQ8. These results demonstrate that the genetic component in gluten sensitivity as broadly defined is very strong (5/6 concordant). Genetically identical individuals can have clearly distinguished phenotypes, either dermatitis herpetiformis or celiac disease, suggesting that environmental factors determine the exact phenotype of this multifactorial disease. These findings are of importance in genetic linkage analyses, which focus to only certain phenotypic properties of a complex trait.","['Hervonen K', 'Karell K', 'Holopainen P', 'Collin P', 'Partanen J', 'Reunala T']",2000,115,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Hervonen K, et al.

11117580,Increased production of IL-4 by gut T-cell lines from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis compared to patients with isolated gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and isolated gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) are gluten-sensitive diseases in which ingestion of dietary gluten results in the development of clinical disease. Patients with DH develop cutaneous IgA deposits and a severe skin disease, but rarely develop gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with isolated GSE develop clinically significant gastrointestinal symptoms, but not skin disease or cutaneous IgA deposits. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which a mucosal immune response to the same dietary antigen can result in two distinct clinical phenotypes. T-cell lines were derived from activated T-cells in the small bowel mucosa of five patients with DH and 14 patients with isolated GSE and analyzed for T-cell markers and cytokine production in vitro. T-cell lines from DH and isolated GSE patients produced IFN-gamma after stimulation (mean: DH = 2,619 pg/ml; isolated GSE = 1,993 pg/ml; NS). T-cell lines from patients with DH, however, produced significantly more IL-4 than the T-cell lines from patients with isolated GSE (IL-4: DH = 2,010 pg/ml; isolated GSE = 235 pg/ml; P < 0.05). Analysis of intracytoplasmic cytokine production by the T-cell lines showed that T-cell lines from patients with DH were CD4+ predominant, with a greater proportion of CD4+/IL4+ cells than CD4+/IFN-gamma+ cells. In contrast, isolated GSE T-cell lines were predominantly CD8+, with an equal proportion of IL-4- and IFN-gamma-positive cells. These studies demonstrate that T cell lines from patients with DH produce significantly more IL-4 than T-cell lines from patients with isolated GSE, while producing similar amounts of IFN-gamma. This difference in cytokine pattern may play an important role in the different clinical manifestations of these two forms of gluten sensitivity.","['Hall RP', 'Smith AD', 'Streilein RD']",2000,45,10,Dig Dis Sci,"Hall RP, et al.

11105427,Celiac disease--a worldwide problem.,"Celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are caused by the alcohol soluble fractions of wheat, barley, and rye. Reliable serological tests are available for both mass and risk group screening and recent epidemiological studies on celiac disease suggest that the prevalence varies between 1:100-300 in different continents. The clinical manifestations of the disease has changed in the West and the classical symptomatic cases represent only approximately 1/7th of all diagnosed cases. Symptoms such as, anemia, short stature, dental enamel defect or osteoporosis can be the only manifestations of the atypical disease. There is an increased prevalence of celiac disease in patients with autoimmune diseases. Recent data suggest that there is a correlation between the prevalence of autoimmune diseases and the number of years that an individual consumes gluten-containing foods. Genetic studies revealed a high prevalence of certain HLA antigens in celiac patients, however, there is likelihood that non-HIA genes are also important in the pathomechanism. An interesting new development is the recognition of tissue transglutaminase (tTG), an enzyme that probably forms an autoantigen with gluten. It is generally accepted that antibodies to tTG are identical to the previously described antiendomysium antibodies. Whether or not tTG is responsible for the initiation of an immunoreaction against prolamines or just exacerbates the immune response is a subject of further investigations.","['Horvath K', 'Mehta DI']",2000,67,10,Indian J Pediatr,Horvath K and Mehta DI.

11094626,Autoimmune and inherited subepidermal blistering diseases: advances in the clinic and the laboratory.,"Anchoring complexes are specialized focal attachment sites within the cutaneous basement membrane zone (BMZ) and play a crucial role in dermo-epidermal adhesion. Structural weakness that may be caused by the binding of autoantibodies to components of the anchoring complex or by aberrant expression of these components as a result of genetic defects can lead to subepidermal blisters. Autoimmune subepidermal blistering disorders include bullous pemphigoid, pemphigoid gestationis, lichen planus pemphigoides, linear IgA disease, cicatricial pemphigoid, anti-p200, anti-p105, and anti-p450 pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. The autoantigen in the skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis remains to be identified. More than 300 distinct mutations in 10 different genes corresponding to structural components of the BMZ have been described that result in skin fragility and dermo-epidermal separation associated with characteristic extracutaneous manifestations. This group of genodermatoses, collectively referred to as epidermolysis bullosa (EB), consists of distinct variants, such as EB simplex, EB with muscular dystrophy, EB with pyloric atresia, generalized atrophic benign EB, Herlitz junctional EB, and dystrophic EB. Recent advances in the molecular characterization of BMZ components have led to a better understanding of the interaction between these molecules as well as the autoimmune response against these proteins. In addition, by the elucidation of genetic defects in the different variants of EB, genotype-phenotype correlations now begin to arise and genetic counseling has been improved.","['Schmidt E', 'Zillikens D']",2000,16,,Adv Dermatol,Schmidt E and Zillikens D.

11069505,"Expression of eotaxin, interleukin 13 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in dermatitis herpetiformis.","BACKGROUND: The dermal and perivascular infiltrate in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), which is mainly composed of CD4+ lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils, is believed to play an important part in the pathogenesis of the disease. Previous studies suggest that cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-4 and IL-5 could be involved in the pathogenesis of DH. These cytokines appear to drive tissue infiltration and maturation of eosinophils. Part of the effect of T-helper (Th) 2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-5) on eosinophils could be mediated by eotaxin, which is a highly specific chemotactic protein induced by various cytokines [IL-4, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha and interferon-gamma].
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the expression of eotaxin and its inducers, IL-13 and TNF-alpha, in DH. METHODS We examined lesions collected from 10 DH patients with active disease. Sections from each specimen were incubated with anti-IL-13, anti-TNF-alpha and anti-eotaxin antibodies. Chloroacetyl esterase reaction was performed to show mast cell infiltration.
RESULTS: Eotaxin was mainly expressed at the tips of the dermal papillae, within the microabscesses. Positivity was also found in the lymphomonocytic infiltrate in the dermis. IL-13 was expressed in the dermal infiltrate and TNF-alpha was found in the inflammatory infiltrate and in dermal vascular cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the importance of the lymphomonocytic infiltrate and of Th2 cytokines in the pathogenesis of this disease, suggesting that tissue infiltration in DH is mediated by cell-specific chemokines such as eotaxin and not only by non-specific chemokines such as IL-8.","['Amerio P', 'Verdolini R', 'Giangiacomi M', 'Proietto G', 'Feliciani C', 'Offidani A', 'Bossi G']",2000,143,5,Br J Dermatol,"Amerio P, et al.

11007139,Evidence for existence of coeliac disease autoantigens apart from tissue transglutaminase.,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of coeliac disease (CD) and of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is strongly associated with production of autoantibodies, defined by indirect immunohistology. Recently, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) was identified as a prominent autoantigen. It would be important to investigate if further molecules apart from tTG are involved in autoimmunity.
METHODS: Tissue sections of human foetal intestine were used to compare the distribution of tTG with the autoantibody binding patterns of 14 sera samples from patients with CD or DH. Double label experiments were performed using monoclonal as well as polyclonal tTG antibodies (anti-tTG) and patient sera. The staining was investigated by using conventional light and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
RESULTS: Most autoantibody binding sites were matched by tTG. Further, the binding of autoantibodies could be inhibited by preincubation with monoclonal anti-tTG. However, in nine serum samples (64%) autoantibody staining suggested a few distinct binding sites apart from tTG. In three sera (21 %) autoantibody binding fibres were detected which definitely did not match monoclonal anti-tTG signals. Distinctly stained fibres were confirmed by applying polyclonal anti-tTG. This indicates the existence of autoantigenic epitopes not related to tTG.","['Uhlig HH', 'Lichtenfeld J', 'Osman AA', 'Richter T', 'Mothes T']",2000,12,9,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Uhlig HH, et al.

10989579,Dermatitis herpetiformis in a Japanese patient with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.,"We report a 73-year-old Japanese man with dermatitis herpetiformis which developed after diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The patient suffered fever, sweating, shivering, and multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes. The diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma was confirmed by the histologic features of a biopsied cervical lymph node. The patient underwent combination chemotherapy. However, one month after the initial therapy, pruritic erythematous skin lesions with peripheral vesicles appeared on his buttocks. A skin biopsy showed subepidermal blister formation associated with polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltrates. Direct immunofluorescence examination of the area adjacent to the lesion showed granular deposits of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction. While it is well-known that dermatitis herpetiformis can develop into lymphoma, there have been only a few reports of its appearance after a diagnosis of lymphoma. This case suggests that dermatitis herpetiformis may be induced by anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","['Amo Y', 'Tanei R', 'Tanabe K', 'Katsuoka K']",2000,27,8,J Dermatol,"Amo Y, et al.

10950050,Detection of autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase in patients with celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"OBJECTIVE: Endomysial autoantibodies (EmA) are specific for celiac disease. The target antigen has been identified as tissue tranglutaminase (tTG). Our aim was to study the accuracy of a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for easy detection of tTG autoantibodies.
METHODS: Thirty-one sera from patients with histologically proven celiac disease and 23 healthy controls were examined for EmA using monkey esophagus and human umbilical cord as substrate. IgA-tTG autoantibodies were determined by newly developed ELISA. Additionally, sera from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 20), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; n = 32), chronic liver disease (n = 36), and diabetes mellitus (n = 19) were tested.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the tTG autoantibody ELISA accounted for 90% detection in patients with untreated celiac disease. The specificity was 76% owing to positive values in the lower range in patients with IBD (15%), chronic liver disease (36%), and diabetes (22%), all of whom were negative for EmA. In dermatitis herpetiformis patients 90% were EmA-positive. Of these, only 47% showed elevated tTG autoantibodies. Preincubation of sera from dermatitis patients with tTG abolished immunofluorescent staining of endomysial structures.
CONCLUSION: Detection of mid- to high-titer tTG autoantibodies is highly specific for celiac disease. However, in the low-titer range, overlap exists with liver disease, IBD, and diabetes. Tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies may evolve as a new screening and follow-up method for celiac disease. Although tTG seems to be a major autoantigen in dermatitis herpetiformis, the low sensitivity of both tTG ELISA and immunofluorescence using human umbilical cord suggests differential involvement of tTG in this disease.","['Koop I', 'Ilchmann R', 'Izzi L', 'Adragna A', 'Koop H', 'Barthelmes H']",2000,95,8,Am J Gastroenterol,"Koop I, et al.

10949550,TCR Vbeta expression in the small bowel of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten sensitive enteropathy. Limited expression in dermatitis herpetiformis and treated asymptomatic gluten sensitive enteropathy.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering skin disease characterized by cutaneous deposits of IgA and an associated, most often asymptomatic, gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE). Gluten sensitive enteropathy is also seen in patients that do not have skin disease or cutaneous IgA deposits, but do have significant gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. Patients with DH and with GSE without skin disease have similar small bowel morphologic changes and HLA associations and both the skin disease and the GI symptoms can be controlled by a gluten free diet. It is not known what factors allow almost all patients with DH to continue to eat gluten and not develop symptomatic gastrointestinal disease. We have examined the expression of the Vbeta T-cell receptor (TCR) in the small bowel of patients with DH (n=11) and of patients with both symptomatic (n=10) and asymptomatic (n=7) GSE without skin disease to determine if differences in the pattern of TCR Vbeta expression are associated with differences in the clinical manifestations of these diseases. TCR Vbeta expression was analyzed using RT-PCR from small bowel biopsies. Patients with DH and those with GSE without skin disease that were on a gluten free diet and asymptomatic were found to express 6.6 and 5.6 out of 20 Vbeta families respectively, with no single family preference. Examination of peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients did not reveal any restriction of TCR Vbeta family expression. In contrast, patients with symptomatic GSE expressed 12.6 Vbeta families (P< 0.05), with no consistent preferential expression of any single Vbeta family between patients. Patients with DH, who are continuing to ingest wheat, show a more restricted pattern of TCR Vbeta utilization, similar to that of treated patients with GSE without skin disease, and significantly different from GSE without skin disease patients eating gluten. These findings suggest that the restricted nature of the TCR Vbeta expression may play a role in the different clinical manifestations of dermatitis herpetiformis and isolated gluten sensitive enteropathy.","['Hall RP', 'Owen S', 'Smith A', 'Keough M', 'Bagheri B', 'Church P', 'Streilein R']",2000,9,4,Exp Dermatol,"Hall RP, et al.

The histopathological examination performed on the elbow's lesional skin showed the presence of neutrophils and fibrin microabscesses at the tips of dermal papillae, with a few eosinophils, and small separations between the dermis and epidermis just over the infiltrate. The overlying epidermis was uninjured. The performed tests detected IgA anti-endomysium, anti-thyrogloblin, anti-smooth muscle and anti-microsomal fraction autoantibodies; DIF showed the presence of IgA granular deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction, prevalently at the tips of dermal papillae. This is the tenth case reported of an association between dermatitis herpetiformis and vitiligo.

10931138,B cell epitopes of gliadin.,"A phage displayed dodecapeptide library and synthetic octapeptides spanning the complete sequence of alpha- and gamma-type gliadin and overlapping in six amino acids (pepscan) were screened for binding to human gliadin antibodies (AGA). Phage display experiments led to four sequences recognized with significantly higher frequency by sera with raised IgA-AGA titres than by control sera. All these peptides contained the core sequence PEQ. Pepscan experiments revealed binding of AGA to five prominent regions: (i) QXQPFP (binding to IgG and IgA, X representing P, Q, and L); (ii) IPEQ (IgG) and WQIPEQ (IgA); (iii) FFQP (IgG) and QGXFQP (IgA, X representing F and S); (iv) PQQLPQ (IgG and IgA), all in alpha-type gliadin; and (v) QPQQPF (IgG and IgA) in gamma-type gliadin. In two of the sequences (QPQQPF and QQQPFP), substitution of Q by E resulting in QPEQPF and QEQPFP, respectively, increased significantly binding of AGA from sera of patients with biopsy-proven or suspected coeliac disease (CoD), all positive for endomysium antibodies (EmA). In contrast, binding of sera with high AGA titre from EmA-negative patients (CoD and dermatitis herpetiformis excluded) was not enhanced by this substitution. Thus, AGA directed against these modified epitopes can be regarded as specific for CoD. This is the first study demonstrating that deamidation of gliadin improves reactivity of AGA of CoD patients.","['Osman AA', 'Günnel T', 'Dietl A', 'Uhlig HH', 'Amin M', 'Fleckenstein B', 'Richter T', 'Mothes T']",2000,121,2,Clin Exp Immunol,"Osman AA, et al.

IgA antibodies to endomysium are considered as sensitive and specific markers for celiac disease. Recently, tissue transglutaminase was identified as the antigen of anti-endomysium antibodies. Moreover, serum levels of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase were found to correlate with titers of IgA antibodies to endomysium in patients with both celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. These findings confirm the close pathogenic relation between the two diseases. The determination of serum levels of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase may be a tool that can be routinely used for the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis in the future.","['Rose C', 'Zillikens D']",2000,51,6,Hautarzt,Rose C and Zillikens D.

After dapsone had to be discontinued because of side effects, a gluten-free diet and supportive therapy controlled the disease; the AEmA and tTG antibodies became negative. Our data on 10 consecutive DH cases examined by DIF and by serum studies for AEmA and antibodies to tTG, point to frequencies of 90% DIF positive and 70% AEmA and tTG positive cases. The use of both DIF and serum tests for AEmA and tTG reveals DH cases not detected by DIF alone that respond to gluten-free diet. Findings on autoantibodies to tTG, an enzyme that metabolizes gliadin, points to a role of tTG in the immunopathology of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and helps to explain the need for a gluten-free diet in the management of DH cases.","['Beutner EH', 'Baughman RD', 'Austin BM', 'Plunkett RW', 'Binder WL']",2000,43,2 Pt 2,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Beutner EH, et al.

Blood samples (200 microl) were collected via tail vein from each rat and pooled at intervals up to the 24-h period. A terminal blood sample was collected by cardiac puncture from each animal. Plasma concentrations of dapsone were determined by liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectroscopy. There was no treatment-related overt toxicity observed in any of the animals. Peak levels were reached 1 h after oral dosing (4890 ng/ml), and 6 to 8 h after dermal application, with Cmax values of 1.62, 5.56, and 12.8 ng/ml, for 12 mg/kg at 10 or 25% DGME, and for 60 mg/kg at 25% DGME, respectively. Bioavailability was calculated at 78% after oral dosing and <1% after dermal application. Apparent elimination half-lives (t(1/2))s were similar after i.v. and oral dosing. Both the calculated area under the plasma concentration versus time curve up to 24 h and Cmax values were 3- to 4-fold higher in the dermal application group administered 12 mg/kg dapsone in 25 versus 10% DGME gel, whereas the calculated area under the plasma concentration versus time curve up to 24 h and Cmax values for the 60 mg/kg group were only 3.3- and 2.3-fold greater than those obtained after application of 12 mg/kg in 25% DGME.

10896066,"Celiac disease and human leukocyte antigen genotype: accuracy of diagnosis in self-diagnosed individuals, dosage effect, and sibling risk.","BACKGROUND: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine characterized by intolerance to gluten. Traditionally, diagnosis is made by intestinal biopsy. Testing for immunoglobulin (Ig) A endomysial antibodies in the serum also is used for diagnosis. Biopsy and serology revert to normal with adherence to a gluten-free diet. Often, after an index case is diagnosed, siblings with symptoms adhere to a gluten-free diet without biopsy or serologic confirmation. More than 90% of patients with celiac disease have the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 genotype. Non-HLA genes also have been implicated.
METHODS: One hundred ninety-five individuals with confirmed or suspected celiac disease were identified in 73 families affected by the disease. IgA endomysial antibody testing was performed for all symptomatic family members who did not have biopsy-confirmed diagnoses. DNA samples were genotyped at D6S276 and the HLA class II loci DQA and DQB.
RESULTS: At the time sampling was begun in families, 88 of 177 (49.7%) individuals were self-diagnosed and adhering to a gluten-free diet. Ninety percent (91/101) of confirmed cases (biopsy or serology) had at least 1 copy of the DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 genotype, whereas only 67% (46/69) of cases self-diagnosed (adherence to gluten-free diet without confirmation) had at least 1 copy. Of confirmed cases, 61% carried two copies of DQB*0201. It is estimated that the HLA association and other unlinked genes contribute approximately equally to the sibling risk of celiac disease.
CONCLUSIONS: A dosage effect of DQB1*0201 may be associated with an increased risk of celiac disease. Self-diagnosis of celiac disease is as common as confirmed diagnosis in families in the United States. Diagnosis of celiac disease on the basis of clinical response to gluten restriction is inaccurate. With long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet, serologic test results are likely to be negative. Based on HLA genotype, approximately one third of self-diagnosed individuals are unlikely to have celiac disease. However, it is not possible to determine which individuals consuming a gluten-free diet have the disease. Therefore, before starting a gluten-free diet, serologic screening and biopsy confirmation are necessary.","['Lewis C', 'Book L', 'Black J', 'Sawitzke A', 'Cannon-Albright L', 'Zone J', 'Neuhausen S']",2000,31,1,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Lewis C, et al.

METHODS: Five pairs of monozygous female twins, of whom one or both were affected by gluten sensitivity (i.e., celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis), were followed-up for 11-23 yr.
RESULTS: Three pairs were concordant for celiac disease: the onset was comparable and synchronous in two pairs; in the third, one member presented an overt malabsorption syndrome, and the other developed iron deficiency anemia 10 yr later. Discordance for gluten sensitivity was found in the remaining two pairs, one of whose members was diagnosed as having, respectively, celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.
CONCLUSIONS: As no environmental factors were found to affect the phenotypic expression of the disease, genetic factors seem to play a major role. The presence of overt or latent celiac disease in three of the four siblings of the three concordant twins, and the association with cystic fibrosis in all three siblings of one of these families, further supports this hypothesis.","['Bardella MT', 'Fredella C', 'Prampolini L', 'Marino R', 'Conte D', 'Giunta AM']",2000,95,6,Am J Gastroenterol,"Bardella MT, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To further determine the significance of this finding for diagnostic (screening) and follow-up purposes, we performed tTG-based ELISAs, and compared the results to the endomysium antibody test (EMA).
PATIENTS: We examined 120 serum samples from patients with celiac disease (CD) including 72 on a gluten-free diet (GFD) and eleven on a gluten challenge, 47 with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) including 16 on a GFD and one on a gluten challenge, 96 with non-CD gastrointestinal diseases, and 117 with others; i.e. 380 serum samples altogether. Follow-up sera from 13 patients were included.
METHODS: Results of an ELISA with guinea pig liver tTG were compared with the EMA test using monkey esophagus. Inhibition of endomysial staining was performed with sera positive on the EMA test but negative with the guinea pig tTG ELISA.
RESULTS: The specificity and sensitivity of the tTG ELISA are high (98.6% and 92.5%). The serum IgA antibody titers against tTG decrease after introduction of a GFD. In one case, endomysial staining could not be inhibited.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the guinea pig tTG ELISA is suitable for use as a simple diagnostic screening and follow-up method for GSE. Further studies are necessary to identify possible additional minor antigens in GSE.","['Sárdy M', 'Kárpáti S', 'Péterfy F', 'Rásky K', 'Tomsits E', 'Zágoni T', 'Horváth A']",2000,38,5,Z Gastroenterol,"Sárdy M, et al.

Diagnoses include pemphigus, pemphigoid, lupus, dermatitis herpetiformis, lichen planus, and vasculitis. These specimens, initially evaluated during the period January 1997 to September 1998, were prepared with a standard immunofluorescence staining technique, and then a permanent aqueous mounting medium was added. All specimens were stored at room temperature in vertical slide holding trays. We focused on the presence and relative intensity of the immunofluorescence staining, as well as the final diagnosis. We then compared our readings to that of the original reports. Twenty of the 22 cases studied (91%) were read as having the same diagnosis as the initial immunopathology report. Seventeen of the 22 cases (77%) were found to have the identical or slightly less fluorescence intensity. The original reports in 3 of the cases did not comment on the original intensity of fluorescence. Thus, a comparison of fluorescence preservation could not be made. In 2 of the cases, the quality of tissue preservation was poor, and though fluorescent staining was noted, we were unable to render a diagnosis. Our results suggest that direct immunofluorescent studies, using a permanent aqueous mounting medium, can be stored over long periods of time at room temperature without significant degradation of staining.","['Grimwood RE', 'Proffer LH']",2000,27,5,J Cutan Pathol,Grimwood RE and Proffer LH.

10808126,Subepidermal blistering disease with autoantibodies against a novel dermal 200-kDa antigen.,"A number of autoimmune subepidermal blistering diseases are characterized by the distinct autoantigens of the cutaneous basement membrane zone. Recently, a few cases with autoantibodies against a novel 200-kDa dermal protein have been reported. We collected nine cases of subepidermal blistering disease with IgG antibodies against this 200-kDa antigen. In this report, we describe the clinical and immunological appearances in these cases. Five cases showed bullous pemphigoid-like features, one case resembled dermatitis herpetiformis, and another case showed mixed features of bullous pemphigoid and linear IgA bullous dermatosis. It was interesting to note that psoriasis coexisted in four cases. By indirect immunofluorescence on 1 M NaCl split skin, IgG antibodies from all sera reacted with the dermal side of the split. By immunoblot analysis, IgG antibodies recognized a 200-kDa protein of dermal extract. IgG affinity-purified antibodies on the 200-kDa immunoblot membrane stained the dermal side of 1 M NaCl split skin. Various examinations suggested that the 200-kDa antigen is not identical to any chains of laminins-1, -5 or -6. This autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease against the dermal 200-kDa protein may form a new distinct entity, which often associates with psoriasis.","['Kawahara Y', 'Zillikens D', 'Yancey KB', 'Marinkovich MP', 'Nie Z', 'Hashimoto T', 'Nishikawa T']",2000,23,2,J Dermatol Sci,"Kawahara Y, et al.

10750656,Incidence and presentation of coeliac disease in South Glamorgan.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and presenting features of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis in the population of South Glamorgan between 1981 and 1995.
DESIGN: Retrospective case-finding study using pathology, dietetic and clinical records, data from hospital activity analysis, general practice records and a Coeliac Society questionnaire. Incidence rates were calculated using the Registrar General's mid-year estimates.
SETTING: Regional hospitals, South Glamorgan, Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: All new cases of coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude incidence rates (per quinquennia) for both children and adults. Age, sex, family history, symptoms at the time of diagnosis and time to diagnosis from symptom onset.
RESULTS: In total, 137 cases of coeliac disease (27 children, 110 adults) and 19 cases of dermatitis herpetiformis were detected. In adults with coeliac disease, incidence rates have risen from 1.32 to 3.08 per 100,000 with a 3:1 female predominance. Almost 50% of adults were over fifty years old when diagnosed and 25% had no abdominal symptoms. In children, the disease incidence has remained stable but with a rising trend in mean age at diagnosis and higher likelihood of atypical symptoms in older children. There has been no change in the incidence of dermatitis herpetiformis. Only 8.3% of all patients had an affected first-degree relative.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other reports of declining incidence, coeliac disease in children has remained constant in South Glamorgan, but has markedly increased in adults, particularly women. Presentation may be at any age, often with atypical symptoms, which may delay diagnosis.","['Hawkes ND', 'Swift GL', 'Smith PM', 'Jenkins HR']",2000,12,3,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Hawkes ND, et al.

10741081,Skin disease in military personnel.,"Skin disease, disease of the musculoskeletal system, and respiratory infections are the most frequent reasons for military personnel to seek medical care. The Oslo Military Clinic serves all of the military personnel in Oslo and the surrounding region, including officers and civilian employees. From September 1996 to May 1997, 1,360 patients were diagnosed and treated by the author, and the data are included in the following study. Upper respiratory disease was the primary reason for seeking medical attention in 26% of the patients, 21% visited the clinic because of disease or pain in the musculoskeletal system, and 16% suffered from a skin disease. Apart from the low number of female patients, the patient population and the disease spectrum observed in the military clinic are very similar to those in a general medical practice. Among the 222 patients suffering from a cutaneous disease, eczema (42 patients), allergy (excluding dermatitis) (34 patients), acne vulgaris (23 patients), and sexually transmitted diseases (28 patients) were the most prevalent processes. Other less prevalent skin diseases were fungal infections, herpes simplex infection, nevi, common warts, and superficial bacterial skin infections. Skin diseases seen in one patient only included erysipelas, herpes zoster, dermatitis herpetiformis, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Good clinical skills in dermatology are of paramount importance in military medicine, and if possible, the military should appoint a dermatologist to its medical team to rapidly diagnose and treat the large number of patients with skin disorders.",['Selvaag E'],2000,165,3,Mil Med,Selvaag E.

10620002,Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with atrophic but not with goitrous variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a gluten-sensitive skin disease that is associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders. Several investigations demonstrated an association between DH and autoimmune thyroid disease. However, it has not been shown if DH is associated with atrophic or goitrous variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated a cohort of 41 DH patients (18 male, 23 female) and a control group (11 male, 19 female; sex and age matched healthy volunteers) to find out which variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with DH. All patients had thyroid hormones and antibodies measured. In addition to that, thyroid sonography as well as detailed history-taking of previous thyroid disease were performed.
RESULTS: In the control group no individual with elevated levels of thyroid antibodies nor abnormal thyroid hormones nor thyroid atrophy was found. Median thyroid volume in the control group was 11 mL (range 4.8-24.7 mL). However, in nine DH patients (22%) elevated levels of antithyroid microsomal (TM) antibodies were seen (P < 0.01). Three of them had abnormal thyroid hormones (7%). In the group of DH patients a significantly smaller thyroid volume was found (median 8 mL, range 1. 6-25.2 mL; P < 0001). Thyroid atrophy (volume < 4.4 mL) was found in 10 DH patients (24%) of whom 9 were females. All patients with elevated levels of TM antibodies or abnormal thyroid hormones and all patients with a history of previous hypothyroidism had a thyroid volume < 7 mL. Goitrous variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis was not seen in any of the DH patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that DH is associated with atrophic but not with goitrous variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.","['Zettinig G', 'Weissel M', 'Flores J', 'Dudczak R', 'Vogelsang H']",2000,30,1,Eur J Clin Invest,"Zettinig G, et al.

We describe two cases, a 50-year-old female with a pustular eruption resembling subcorneal pustular dermatosis and a 55-year-old male with a pruritic vesiculopustular eruption simulating dermatitis herpetiformis. They illustrate the clinical heterogeneity of IgA pemphigus which is likely to reflect differences in autoantigens, analogous to pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus. There is now evidence that IgA pemphigus encompasses at least two subgroups: a subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD)-type, (see case 1) characterized by subcorneal pustules and autoantibodies to desmocollin 1; and intra-epidermal neutrophilic dermatosis (IEN)-type cases (see case 2) which show intra-epidermal pustules and in whom the autoantigen may be desmoglein 3, the pemphigus vulgaris antigen.","['Harman KE', 'Holmes G', 'Bhogal BS', 'McFadden J', 'Black MM']",1999,24,6,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Harman KE, et al.

10585346,Recombinant human tissue transglutaminase ELISA for the diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"BACKGROUND: Tissue transglutaminase (TGc) has recently been identified as the major, if not the sole, autoantigen of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). We developed and validated an ELISA based on the human recombinant antigen and compared it to existing serological tests for GSE [guinea pig TGc ELISA and endomysium antibody (EMA) test].
METHODS: Human TGc was expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293-EBNA as a C-terminal fusion protein with the eight-amino acid Strep-tag II allowing one-step purification via streptavidin affinity chromatography. We carried out ELISA assays for IgA antibodies against TGc using calcium-activated human and guinea pig TGc. The sera were also tested on monkey esophagus sections by indirect immunofluorescence for IgA EMA. We examined 71 serum samples from patients with GSE (38 with celiac disease, 33 with dermatitis herpetiformis), including 16 on therapy, and 53 controls.
RESULTS: The human TGc could be expressed and purified as an active enzyme giving a single band on a Coomassie-stained gel. The mean intra- and interassay CVs for the human TGc ELISA were 3.2% and 9.2%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 0.999. The specificity and sensitivity were 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 95.7-100%) and 98.2% (95.9-100%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The human TGc ELISA was somewhat superior to the guinea pig TGc ELISA, and was as specific and sensitive as the EMA test. The human TGc-based ELISA is the method of choice for easy and noninvasive screening and diagnosis of GSE.","['Sárdy M', 'Odenthal U', 'Kárpáti S', 'Paulsson M', 'Smyth N']",1999,45,12,Clin Chem,"Sárdy M, et al.

10570380,Circulating autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase differentiate patients with dermatitis herpetiformis from those with linear IgA disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is highly associated with celiac disease. Recently, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) was identified as the autoantigen of IgA antibodies in celiac disease. The prevalence of antibodies to tTG in DH patients is not known.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether DH patients show circulating IgA autoantibodies to tTG, to compare their serum levels with those from patients with other subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases, and to correlate levels of antibodies to tTG with the extent of small bowel disease.
METHODS: Sera were obtained from consecutive patients with DH (n = 11), linear IgA disease (n = 15), bullous pemphigoid (n = 10), and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (n = 6) and were studied by indirect immunofluorescence on monkey esophagus and NaCl-split human skin. IgA reactivity to tTG was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The extent of mucosal involvement in jejunal biopsy specimens was assessed according to the grading of Marsh.
RESULTS: All untreated DH patients showed circulating IgA autoantibodies to tTG. One DH patient already undergoing therapy, the 15 patients with linear IgA disease, and all other controls revealed no autoantibodies to tTG. In addition, serum levels of IgA anti-tTG antibodies reflected the degree of histopathologic changes in jejunal mucosa from biopsy specimens in DH patients.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that circulating IgA autoantibodies to tTG are detectable in DH but not in linear IgA disease or other subepidermal autoimmune bullous diseases. The levels of IgA anti-tTG antibodies reflect the extent of histopathologic changes of the jejunal mucosa in DH.","['Rose C', 'Dieterich W', 'Bröcker EB', 'Schuppan D', 'Zillikens D']",1999,41,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Rose C, et al.

10548369,Bone mass and metabolism in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is a gluten-sensitive skin disease with intestinal lesions and malabsorption symptoms less severe than those found in celiac disease. While several studies have shown the occurrence of osteopenia in celiac disease, bone mass and metabolism have never before been evaluated in dermatitis herpetiformis. Therefore, in 16 untreated patients, 16 sex- and age-matched untreated celiac patients, and 16 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers, lumbar and femoral bone mineral density were measured and bone and mineral metabolism and nutritional status were evaluated. All these parameters were significantly altered in the two groups of patients and although the degree of these alterations was milder in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis than in celiac patients, the presence of subtotal villous atrophy in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was associated with the presence of more severe alterations. Bone mineral density was significantly correlated with nutritional status, and patients showing bone loss were characterized by a body mass index lower than 20. Alterations of bone mass and mineral metabolism complicate dermatitis herpetiformis when severe intestinal lesions coexist. A low nutritional status may be predictive of the presence of bone loss.","['Di Stefano M', 'Jorizzo RA', 'Veneto G', 'Cecchetti L', 'Gasbarrini G', 'Corazza GR']",1999,44,10,Dig Dis Sci,"Di Stefano M, et al.

10548367,Expression of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma in the small bowel of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and isolated gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"Although possessing a morphologically similar small bowel abnormality to patients with isolated gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE), patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have few gastrointestinal symptoms and exhibit blistering skin lesions and cutaneous IgA deposits. To determine whether clinical discrepancies between these gluten-sensitive conditions might be the result of different patterns of small bowel cytokine expression, duodenal biopsies were obtained from eight DH patients and nine isolated GSE patients. Biopsies were evaluated for interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (message) and immunohistochemistry (protein). In DH patients, most of whom had no gut symptoms, IFN-gamma mRNA expression was significantly less than in isolated GSE patients with symptomatic gut disease. Conversely, IL-4 mRNA expression in DH patients was greater than that found among isolated GSE patients. These findings suggest that the different clinical phenotypes of gluten sensitivity may be caused by variation in cytokine expression in the small bowel response to gluten.","['Smith AD', 'Bagheri B', 'Streilein RD', 'Hall RP']",1999,44,10,Dig Dis Sci,"Smith AD, et al.

10545715,Clinical features of celiac disease today.,"The clinical spectrum of celiac disease has widened over the past decades. The condition is no longer a severe malabsorption syndrome. Instead, a typical celiac disease patient today has merely mild abdominal symptoms. Malabsorption can be subclinical or absent, and there is usually only moderate, if any, loss of weight. Simultaneously, the current prevalence has increased from 1:1,000 to 1:300 inhabitants, or even higher. Clinically silent celiac disease cases are being detected in increasing numbers since the introduction and widespread use of serologic screening tests. Symptoms of celiac disease can appear outside the intestine, a typical example being dermatitis herpetiformis. Gluten intolerance is no longer limited to overt villous atrophy. Inflammation without villous damage may be observed in genetically susceptible individuals. The term latent celiac disease is applied in situations where the patient has normal villous architecture while on a gluten-containing diet, but later develops small bowel villous atrophy compatible with celiac disease.","['Collin P', 'Kaukinen K', 'Mäki M']",1999,17,2,Dig Dis,"Collin P, et al.

METHOD: Twelve cases of Thai patients diagnosed as LAD of childhood were analyzed concerning clinical, histopathological, immunopathological findings including treatment responses and courses compared with those of Caucasians.
RESULT: The mean age of onset was 5.1 years. The areas of common involvement were the perioral region, lower abdomen, perineum, buttock, inner thighs and extremities. Histopathology in half of the cases showed features of dermatitis herpetiformis or bullous pemphigoid. All patients had positive linear IgA band at the basement membrane zone (BMZ) by direct immunofluorescence. Only one patient had positive circulating anti BMZ antibody at the titer of 1:10. Most patients responded well to dapsone. The mean duration before remission was 1.9 years.

10494709,"Mast cells in developing subepidermal bullous diseases: emphasis on tryptase, chymase and protease inhibitors.","The possible involvement of mast cell tryptase and chymase in subepidermal bullous diseases was studied enzyme-histochemically in specimens from erythematous and vesicular skin and from non-involved skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, infective bullous eruption and linear IgA dermatosis. Patients with pemphigus were biopsied for comparison. The immunoreactivity of chymase inhibitors, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-PI) and alpha1-antichymotrypsin (alpha1-AC), in mast cells was demonstrated using the sequential double staining method. Tryptase-positive mast cells were unchanged or only slightly increased in number in erythematous lesions and slightly decreased in blistering skin compared with healthy-looking skin. Only occasionally were mast cells seen in apparent contact with the basement membrane zone. Chymase-positive mast cells and the chymase/tryptase ratio steadily decreased during the development of the lesions in each subepidermal bullous disease. The percentage of alpha1-PI+ and/or alpha1-AC+ mast cells increased simultaneously, which could explain the disappearance of chymase activity. Similar results were obtained regardless of the bullous disease. The results were also similar in pemphigus, which is an intraepidermal bullous disease. In conclusion, these results show significant alterations in mast cell chymase and protease inhibitors in a range of different bullous diseases, suggesting mast cell involvement. The apparent inactivation of chymase could be due to the action of chymase inhibitors detected in numerous mast cells. However, these alterations probably reflect general inflammation rather than a specific reaction in a certain bullous disease.","['Kaminska R', 'Naukkarinen A', 'Glinski W', 'Horsmanheimo M', 'Harvima IT']",1999,79,5,Acta Derm Venereol,"Kaminska R, et al.

The article consists in a review of published reports, and an account of our experience of including oats in the gluten-free diets of adults. Oats were found to be safe and well tolerated by adults with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, though the risk of wheat contamination of commercial oat products remains a cause of concern. Similar findings were reported from a study of adolescents, but no such studies have been made of small children.

10417632,Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase as serologic markers in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is a gluten-sensitive disease with a symmetrically distributed blistering over extensor surfaces. The association with celiac disease is further supported by the high rate of immunoglobulin A autoantibodies to endomysium in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, which are highly specific and sensitive indicators of celiac disease. Therefore, we determined immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase, the recently discovered endomysial autoantigen in celiac disease, in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and controls. Sera of 61 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, as characterized by granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the subepidermal basement membrane and known endomysial antibody titers (determined by indirect immunofluorescence) as well as 84 control sera of patients with dermal or intestinal diseases unrelated to dermatitis herpetiformis, were analyzed for circulating immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase titers in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were significantly elevated above the controls. Furthermore, the immunoglobulin A anti-tTG titers showed a positive correlation with semiquantitative endomysial antibody data. Compared with endomysial antibodies, determination of immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase reached a specificity and sensitivity of 97.6% and 89.1%. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have elevated immunoglobulin A autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase, confirming its pathogenic relation with celiac disease and further supporting the usefulness of this novel assay for screening and therapy control.","['Dieterich W', 'Laag E', 'Bruckner-Tuderman L', 'Reunala T', 'Kárpáti S', 'Zágoni T', 'Riecken EO', 'Schuppan D']",1999,113,1,J Invest Dermatol,"Dieterich W, et al.

We have studied the expression of the epithelial adhesion complex as well as the basement membrane and anchoring fibril antigens in uninvolved dermatitis herpetiformis skin to find out if alterations can be detected in these structures predisposing to the blister formation typical of the disease. Ten uninvolved dermatitis herpetiformis skin specimens, which all showed clear granular deposits of IgA under the basement membrane in direct immunofluorescence and five normal skin specimens, were studied by indirect immunofluorescence technique. Six uninvolved dermatitis herpetiformis skin specimens showed distinctly decreased immunoreaction for BP230 and four uninvolved dermatitis herpetiformis skin specimens showed distinctly decreased immunoreaction for plectin/HD1. All five skin controls showed strong immunoreactions for BP230 and plectin/HD1. Other hemidesmosomal proteins including BP180 and integrin alpha6beta4, as well as basement membrane proteins laminin-5, laminin-1, nidogen and type IV collagen, and the anchoring fibril protein type VII collagen showed a normal strong expression.

10382335,[Dietary treatment of celiac disease].,"Life-long gluten-free diet is the established therapy of coeliac disease. Patients suffering from dermatitis herpetiformis benefit from the same treatment. In Norway the gluten-free diet has excluded oats as well as wheat, rye and barley. The basis for this recommendation was a 1972 report indicating that ten out of 23 children consuming oats as part of their gluten-free diet for at least 18 months developed signs of damage to the intestinal mucosa. During the last decades, the clinical picture of coeliac disease has changed as a result of better diagnostic tools. Controlled clinical trials during the last few years indicate that some patients may tolerate small amounts of oats in their gluten-free diet. As a consequence, patients may be confused with regard to what dietary regime is recommended in coeliac disease. Compliance with gluten-free diet is important to secure growth and development, the all-round condition, fertility, bone density and a reduced risk of nutrient deficiency and malignancy. Consensus on dietary treatment is essential. A number of controlled trials are under way and the outcome of these studies will in a few years determine whether oats might be included in the standard gluten-free diet. So far oats are not recommended. The physician who makes the diagnosis is responsible for all patients getting adequate dietary counselling and management. Dietary advice given by health personnel must be consistent.","['Løvik A', 'Fluge G', 'Dybdahl JH', 'Holsdal ER', 'Ek J', 'Røhme R', 'Dahl R']",1999,119,13,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Løvik A, et al.

So far, however, the induction of this granulocyte infiltration has not been elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: Regarding their biological effects, the chemokines interleukin 8 (IL-8) and RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T lymphocyte expressed and secreted) could play a role in this granulocyte accumulation.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical examination of lesional skin from patients with bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA disease was performed using a set of different antibodies against IL-8 and RANTES. Additionally, blister fluids were screened for soluble RANTES peptide using an ELISA.
RESULTS: No difference in chemokine expression was found in lesions of autoimmune bullous diseases compared to normal skin.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to chronic inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and eczema, where keratinocyte IL-8 immunoreactivity was found to differ from normal skin, keratinocyte immunoreactivity is not altered in autoimmune bullous diseases.","['Bornscheuer E', 'Zillikens D', 'Schröder JM', 'Sticherling M']",1999,198,2,Dermatology,"Bornscheuer E, et al.

10319267,"The genetic basis for the association of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype (A1, B8, DR3) with multiple immunopathological diseases.","An individual's major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ancestral haplotype (AH) is the clearest single determinant of susceptibility to MHC associated immunopathological disease, as it defines the alleles carried at all loci in the MHC. However, the direct effects of any of the 150-200 genes that constitute the MHC are difficult to determine since recombination only occurs at defined hotspots. This review concerns the 8.1 AH (HLA-A1, C7, B8, C4AQ0, C4B1, DR3, DQ2), which is carried by most Caucasians with HLA-B8. It is associated with accelerated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, and susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatitis herpetiformis, common variable immunodeficiency and IgA deficiency, myasthenia gravis and several other conditions. We have mapped susceptibility genes for HIV, IDDM and myasthenia gravis to the central MHC between HLA-B and the tumour necrosis factor or complement genes. Here we consider which of the remaining 8.1-associated diseases are more closely associated with HLA-DR3 and/or DQ2. Several candidate genes in the central MHC have the potential to modulate immune or inflammatory responses in an antigen-independent manner, as is seen in studies of cultured cells from healthy carriers of the 8.1 AH. Hence these genes may act as a common co-factor in the diverse immunopathological conditions associated with the 8.1 AH.","['Price P', 'Witt C', 'Allcock R', 'Sayer D', 'Garlepp M', 'Kok CC', 'French M', 'Mallal S', 'Christiansen F']",1999,167,,Immunol Rev,"Price P, et al.

A case-control study compared the occurrence of comorbid diagnoses in case and control subjects with and without celiac sprue, respectively. All patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of celiac sprue (ICD-579.0) who were discharged from hospitals of the Department of Veterans Affairs between 1986 and 1995 were selected as case subjects. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the occurrence of celiac disease served as outcome variable, while age, gender, ethnicity, and the comorbid occurrences of other diagnoses served as predictor variables. A total of 458 individual patients with celiac sprue were identified. The data confirmed the known associations of celiac sprue with dermatitis herpetiformis, lactase deficiency, enlargement of lymph nodes, and lymphoma. Celiac sprue was also found to be statistically significantly associated with pancreatic insufficiency, Crohn's disease, functional bowel symptoms, chronic nonalcoholic hepatitis, and pulmonary eosinophilia. The nutritional manifestations associated with celiac disease included nutritional marasmus, cachexia, weight loss, hypocalcemia, osteoporosis, vitamin B-complex deficiency, and various types of iron- and vitamin-deficiency anemias. The large variety of complex associations clearly indicates that celiac sprue is a systemic disease that involves multiple organs and exceeds an isolated nutritional intolerance to gluten.","['Delcò F', 'El-Serag HB', 'Sonnenberg A']",1999,44,5,Dig Dis Sci,"Delcò F, et al.

10228384,[Oxidative injury and its defense system in vivo].,"We and other researchers verified that excessively produced free radicals by neutrophils induce various diseases such as Behçet's disease, MCLS, SLE (neutrophil-stimulated lymphocytes), RA (synovial fluid neutrophils), Crohn's disease, colitis ulcerosa, and dermatitis herpetiformis (Dühring). Recently, it was reported that environmental toxic agents including herbicides such as paraquat, insecticides, nitrogen oxide, and ultraviolet radiation produce free radicals. Nitrogen oxide, a main product of the combustion of petroleum, is a prominent component of exhaust from automobiles. Generation of 1O2 by ultraviolet radiation has also increased by breaks in the earth's ozone layer induced by halogenated hydrocarbon gas. Various diseases have been induced by these agents such as malignancies, severe adult atopic dermatitis, complication of cataract and retinolysis with atopic dermatitis, skin cancer, male infertility, severe collagen diseases, and lung fibrosis. It was also found that PCB, methyl-Hg and Mn, Cd induce neuropathic diseases through the increase in free radical production. On the other hand, a self-defense system exists against oxidative injuries; high-molecular-weight antioxidants such as SOD, catalase, and GSH-Px, and low-molecular-weight antioxidants such as vitamin C, E, A, polyphenols, flavonoids, and catechin. As protection from oxidative injury, various antioxidant products have been developed, however, the development of SOD injection was given up by all the pharmaceutical companies in the world on account of ineffectiveness due to rapid excretion from the kidney, low affinity to the receptor and weak penetration into the cell. A.M. Michelson, a French biochemist succeeded in developing an effective bovine liposomal-encapsulated SOD solving these problems, however, he also gave it up since French government prohibited bovine products due to the prion virus. Regarding low-molecular-weight antioxidants, synthetic products generally show low affinity to human cell receptors, however, natural products also has demerits that abundant low-molecular-weight compounds with antioxidant activity that exist in the native materials as repeating subunits of high-molecular-weight polymers resulting in inactive forms. We have developed effective natural antioxidant by a unique treating procedure that includes heating with far infrared radiation of 4-14 microns wavelength, brewing with the fungus Aspergillus oryzae, and emulsification with similarly heated sesame oil. This formulation is based on our hypothesis that treatment of natural plant products with heating and brewing results in the liberation of abundant low-molecular-weight compounds with antioxidant activity that exist in an inactive form as repeating polymers as described above.",['Niwa Y'],1999,47,3,Rinsho Byori,Niwa Y.

Both direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies were negative. She remained in remission for 6 years. At the second onset, she developed bullous skin lesions; histological examination disclosed suprabasal acantholysis and infiltration of eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence revealed IgG and C3 deposits at the cell surface, predominantly in the lower epidermis. Indirect immunofluorescence using normal human skin as a substrate demonstrated anti-cell surface IgG antibodies at a titer of 1:160. Immunoblot analysis showed that the patient's serum reacted only with a 130 kD protein.

10201535,Enhanced expression of human metalloelastase (MMP-12) in cutaneous granulomas and macrophage migration.,"Accumulation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages may lead to degeneration of connective tissue matrix in various skin diseases. Macrophage metalloelastase, is a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-12) capable of degrading elastin as well as various basement membrane components. To investigate the role of human macrophage metalloelastase in skin, we assessed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry 66 specimens representing skin diseases characterized either by changes in elastic fibers or by pronounced infiltrations of extravasating and migrating macrophages. CD68 immunostaining was performed to identify the human macrophage metalloelastase-positive cells and Weigert's Resorcin-Fuchsin staining to reveal the status of elastic fibers. We found abundant expression of human macrophage metalloelastase mRNA in macrophages in areas devoid of normal elastic fibers in granulomatous skin diseases sarcoidosis, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and granuloma annulare. Positive cells for human macrophage metalloelastase protein could be detected in the same regions as well as positive immunostaining for urokinase plasminogen activator. Of the other matrix metalloproteinases capable of degrading elastin, 92 kDa gelatinase colocalized with human macrophage metalloelastase, while 72 kDa gelatinase was produced by surrounding fibroblast-like cells. Furthermore, human macrophage metalloelastase was expressed by macrophages in areas with disrupted basement membrane, as assessed by type IV collagen staining, in pityriasis lichenoides and dermatitis herpetiformis. Specimens of anetoderma, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and pseudoxanthoma elasticum showed no signal for human macrophage metalloelastase. Matrilysin was not detected in any of the samples investigated. Our study suggests that human macrophage metalloelastase may contribute to elastin degradation occurring in granulomatous skin diseases and may aid macrophage migration through the epidermal and vascular basement membranes in inflammatory disorders.","['Vaalamo M', 'Kariniemi AL', 'Shapiro SD', 'Saarialho-Kere U']",1999,112,4,J Invest Dermatol,"Vaalamo M, et al.

10192194,Wheat starch-containing gluten-free flour products in the treatment of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. A long-term follow-up study.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated whether wheat starch-based gluten-free products are safe in the treatment of gluten intolerance.
METHODS: The study involved 41 children and adults with coeliac disease and 11 adults with dermatitis herpetiformis adhering to a gluten-free diet for 8 years on average. Thirty-five newly diagnosed coeliac patients at diagnosis and 6 to 24 months after the start of a gluten-free diet and 27 non-coeliac patients with dyspepsia were investigated for comparison. Daily dietary gluten and wheat starch intake were calculated. Small-bowel mucosal villous architecture, CD3+, alphabeta+, and gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes, mucosal HLA-DR expression, and serum endomysial, reticulin, and gliadin antibodies were investigated.
RESULTS: Forty of 52 long-term-treated patients adhered to a strict wheat starch-based diet and 6 to a strict naturally gluten-free diet; 6 patients had dietary lapses. In the 46 patients on a strict diet the villous architecture, enterocyte height, and density of alphabeta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes were similar to those in non-coeliac subjects and better than in short-term-treated coeliac patients. The density of gammadelta(+)cells was higher, but they seemed to decrease over time with the gluten-free diet. Wheat starch-based gluten-free flour products did not cause aberrant upregulation of mucosal HLA-DR. The mucosal integrity was not dependent on the daily intake of wheat starch in all patients on a strict diet, whereas two of the six patients with dietary lapses had villous atrophy and positive serology.
CONCLUSION: Wheat starch-based gluten-free flour products were not harmful in the treatment of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Kaukinen K', 'Collin P', 'Holm K', 'Rantala I', 'Vuolteenaho N', 'Reunala T', 'Mäki M']",1999,34,2,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Kaukinen K, et al.

10098286,IgA multiple myeloma presenting as an acquired bullous disorder.,"A 63-year-old man presented with an intensely pruritic vesiculo-bullous eruption on the limbs and was subsequently found to have an IgA kappa multiple myeloma. The eruption clinically and histologically was suggestive of linear IgA disease (LAD), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), or bullous lupus erythematosus (LE), with the skin biopsy revealing subepidermal bullae and dermal papillary micro-abscesses. However, direct immunofluorescence showed a unique pattern of diffuse dermal IgA staining. Although chemotherapy produced a dramatic resolution of the lesions, which paralleled the fall in serum IgA paraprotein level, the myeloma later became progressive and the resulting paraprotein increase was accompanied by recurrence of the eruption. We propose that this patient's rash was the presenting manifestation of his multiple myeloma, and was a consequence of transudation of IgA paraprotein into the dermis.","['Wong DA', 'Hunt MJ', 'Stapleton K']",1999,40,1,Australas J Dermatol,"Wong DA, et al.

10086653,The clinical pattern of subclinical/silent celiac disease: an analysis on 1026 consecutive cases.,"OBJECTIVE: The demographic, clinical, and epidemiological features of subclinical/silent celiac disease in Italy were analyzed in a multicenter study carried out with the participation of 42 centers, in the years between 1990 and 1994.
METHODS: One thousand twenty-six subclinical/silent patients (644 children and 382 adults, 702 women and 324 men) were considered eligible for the study.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the subclinical/silent form increased significantly during the study both in adults (p < 0.001) and in children (p < 0.005), but its prevalence was always lower (p < 0.001) in children than in adults. This increase appears more likely due to a greater diagnostic awareness and to a better use of screening than to a higher number of subclinical/silent cases. Whereas in 1990 a significantly higher proportion (p < 0.001) of subclinical/silent celiac patients was diagnosed in Northern Italy rather than in Southern-Insular Italy, both in adults (46.7% vs 17.2%) and in children (22.0% vs 9.0%), in 1994 such a difference was no longer conspicuous. Both in children and in adults, iron-deficiency anemia appeared to be the most frequent extraintestinal symptom, followed by short stature in children and cutaneous lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis in adults. In 25.9% of the cases another disease was present, with a significantly higher frequency (p < 0.05) in adults (30.1%) than in children (20.7%). Diabetes and atopy appeared to be the most frequently associated conditions both in children and in adults.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided an analysis of the largest series of subclinical/silent celiac disease reported to date. In Italy, this form is most frequently recognized in adults, and prospective studies will clarify whether the lower frequency observed in children is a real or apparent phenomenon.","['Bottaro G', 'Cataldo F', 'Rotolo N', 'Spina M', 'Corazza GR']",1999,94,3,Am J Gastroenterol,"Bottaro G, et al.

10075317,The widening spectrum of celiac disease.,"Celiac disease is a permanent intolerance to ingested gluten that results in immunologically mediated inflammatory damage to the small-intestinal mucosa. Celiac disease is associated with both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes and with other immune disorders, notably juvenile diabetes and thyroid disease. The classic sprue syndrome of steatorrhea and malnutrition coupled with multiple deficiency states may be less common than more subtle and often monosymptomatic presentations of the disease. Diverse problems such as dental anomalies, short stature, osteopenic bone disease, lactose intolerance, infertility, and nonspecific abdominal pain among many others may be the only manifestations of celiac disease. The rate at which celiac disease is diagnosed depends on the level of suspicion for the disease. Although diagnosis relies on intestinal biopsy findings, serologic tests are useful as screening tools and as an adjunct to diagnosis. The treatment of celiac disease is lifelong avoidance of dietary gluten. Gluten-free diets are now readily achievable with appropriate professional instruction and community support. Both benign and malignant complications of celiac disease occur but these can often be avoided by early diagnosis and compliance with a gluten-free diet.",['Murray JA'],1999,69,3,Am J Clin Nutr,Murray JA.

Histopathological evaluation of a biopsy revealed typical changes of pustular psoriasis with parakeratosis and abscesses of neutrophils (Kogoj's spongiform pustules). The diagnosis of pustular psoriasis was established by the typical clinical and histopathological findings. Laboratory parameters showed a highly elevated blood sedimentation rate, hypoferric anemia and decreased albumin levels. Serum concentrations of parathormone and its metabolites were normal. After systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids and antibiotics, the lesions improved but did not clear. After delivery of a healthy boy, therapy was switched to retinoid photochemotherapy with isotretinoin and PUVA that resulted in rapid and complete clearing of the eruption. The coincidence of plaque-type psoriasis and a pustular eruption as described previously in impetigo herpetiformis supports the view that this dermatosis of pregnancy is a variant of generalized pustular psoriasis.","['Breier-Maly J', 'Ortel B', 'Breier F', 'Schmidt JB', 'Hönigsmann H']",1999,198,1,Dermatology,"Breier-Maly J, et al.

9872611,The diagnosis of gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease--the two are not mutually inclusive.,"The traditional definition of coeliac disease is inadequate because it includes only patients with abnormal small intestinal morphology. Gluten sensitivity is a systemic disorder whose common factor is an immune response to gluten in the context of the susceptible 'coeliac' HLA haplotype and possibly environmental triggers. Gluten sensitivity embraces traditional coeliac disease as well as subjects with normal small bowel morphology including latent coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, and symptomatic gluten intolerance. The diagnosis of gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease are not mutually inclusive. Small intestinal biopsy and clinical criteria are essential in diagnosing classical coeliac disease. IgA endomysial antibody is valuable in identifying gluten sensitivity and has particular value as a screening test. Serology should include total IgA levels to exclude selective IgA deficiency, a potential cause of false negative IgA endomysial antibody. A combination of histology, serology and clinical criteria will identify most cases of coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.","['Loft DE', 'Nwokolo CU', 'Ciclitira PJ']",1998,10,11,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,"Loft DE, et al.

9824575,Tolerance to oats in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"OBJECTIVES: Recent studies on coeliac disease have shown that oats can be included in a gluten-free diet without adverse effects on the small bowel. The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Eleven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in remission on a gluten-free diet were challenged daily with 50 g oats for six months. Clinical symptoms were recorded, serum samples taken, and skin and small bowel biopsies performed before and after the oat challenge. A control group comprised of 11 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a conventional gluten-free diet was also studied.
RESULTS: Eight patients challenged with oats remained asymptomatic, two developed a transient rash, and one withdrew because of the appearance of a more persistent but mild rash. Three of the 11 controls also developed a transient rash. IgA endomysial antibodies remained negative in all patients. The small bowel villous architecture, the densities of intraepithelial CD3 and alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cell receptor positive lymphocytes and crypt epithelial cell DR expression remained unaltered during the oat challenge.
CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the absence of oat toxicity on the gluten sensitive small bowel mucosa and suggest that the rash in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis is not activated by eating oats.","['Reunala T', 'Collin P', 'Holm K', 'Pikkarainen P', 'Miettinen A', 'Vuolteenaho N', 'Mäki M']",1998,43,4,Gut,"Reunala T, et al.

9814827,Dermatitis herpetiformis: coeliac disease of the skin.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a lifelong, gluten-sensitive, blistering skin disease with pathognomonic immunoglobulin (Ig)A deposits in the papillary dermis. Less than 10% of patients with DH have gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of coeliac disease, yet they all have gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The rash, too, responds to gluten withdrawal. Therefore, DH provides a unique example of the frequent existence of gastroenterologically 'silent' but dermatologically active coeliac disease. DH and coeliac disease are strictly associated with class II HLA alleles A1*0501 and B1*02 encoding the HLA-DQ2 heterodimer. Coeliac disease segregates in the families of patients with DH, also supporting a shared genetic background. Monozygotic twins, one with DH and the other with coeliac disease, show that environmental, not genetic, factors seem to be responsible for the development of the rash in DH. A clinically silent but immunologically active coeliac disease in the gut could well produce IgA autoantibodies which react also with the connective tissue in the skin. The antigen for deposited IgA and its role, if any, in the blister formation in DH remains, however, to be elucidated.",['Reunala T'],1998,30,5,Ann Med,Reunala T.

9738302,Families with multiple cases of gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"UNLABELLED: Early detection of oligosymptomatic gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) may contribute to the prevention of late complications, such as malignancy. Family members of known GSE patients are at higher risk of being affected. To evaluate the frequency and clinical significance of multiple occurrence, we routinely offered an antiendomysium antibody (EmA)-based non-invasive screening to affected families. Among 997 family members of 396 GSE patients, we identified 89 subjects with EmA positivity and/or severe jejunal villous atrophy. In 83 cases GSE has been verified, four patients refused the biopsy and two subjects are under further observation for latent celiac disease. Prevalence of GSE was 8.5% (80/943) among the first-degree relatives, with significantly higher values in the siblings (13.8%) and offsprings (12.0%) than in the parents (4.2%) of the probands (p < 0.001). In 55 families (13.9% of the families studied) two, in ten families (2.5%) three, in one family four and in one other family six members were affected. Combinations of the clinical presentations of index and screening-detected cases were highly variable, with a high percentage of silent and atypical forms in the relatives. GSE cases presenting both with and without dermatitis herpetiformis occurred in 15 families. Six GSE cases with atypical or mild dermatitis herpetiformis were detected in consequence of the screening.
CONCLUSIONS: EmA-assisted family screening resulted in the detection of a clinically significant number of additional GSE patients.","['Korponay-Szabó I', 'Kovács J', 'Lörincz M', 'Török E', 'Gorácz G']",1998,36,7,Z Gastroenterol,"Korponay-Szabó I, et al.

The flat-destructive stage corresponds to severe lesions involving activated T-cells. However, other inflammatory cells such as eosinophils are also abundant. The mechanisms for the intestinal recruitment of eosinophils in patients with CD and DH remain unknown. Eosinophil recruitment and activation are induced in vitro by three main cytokines: interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In this study, IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF were detected by immunohistochemistry in all patients with CD and DH but not in the control group. By ultrastructural immunogold staining, these three cytokines had the same subcellular localization in the granule matrix of eosinophils. This result suggests that eosinophils may be involved in the immune response at the flat-destructive stage of both CD and DH.","['Desreumaux P', 'Delaporte E', 'Colombel JF', 'Capron M', 'Cortot A', 'Janin A']",1998,88,1,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,"Desreumaux P, et al.

9602868,Th2-like cytokine activity in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic subepidermal blistering disease, in which a perivascular cellular infiltrate, composed mainly of CD4+ T lymphocytes together with a varying number of neutrophils and eosinophils, is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of blister formation. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of cytokines such as the interleukins IL-4 and IL-5 and to quantify the distribution of T cells as well as their state of activation using alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedures in seven patients with typical clinical and histological features of DH. A strong extracellular staining with anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody was detected in the upper dermis with a prevalent perivascular pattern in perilesional areas, whereas in the dermal-epidermal separation sites there was an intense, scattered distribution. IL-5 was intensely expressed, mainly at the intracellular level, by eosinophils and lymphocytes. Concerning RT-PCR, five DH patients showed a strong positive signal for both IL-4 and IL-5 cytokines while two patients showed a faint signal for both IL-4 and IL-5; these last two cases were histologically poor in inflammatory cells. In view of these results, it can be hypothesized that the recruitment of eosinophils and neutrophils in DH may be induced not only by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-8 as previously demonstrated, but also by Th2 cytokines as well.","['Caproni M', 'Feliciani C', 'Fuligni A', 'Salvatore E', 'Atani L', 'Bianchi B', 'Pour SM', 'Proietto G', 'Toto P', 'Coscione G', 'Amerio P', 'Fabbri P']",1998,138,2,Br J Dermatol,"Caproni M, et al.

9400824,Anti-inflammatory action of dapsone: inhibition of neutrophil adherence is associated with inhibition of chemoattractant-induced signal transduction.,"Dapsone has clinical utility as an anti-inflammatory agent but the mechanism of this action remains unknown. We have previously reported that dapsone inhibits beta2 integrin (CD11b/CD18)-mediated adherence of human neutrophils in vitro and now describe studies designed to discover how dapsone-mediated inhibition of this neutrophil function occurs. Results indicate that dapsone interferes with the activation or function of the G-protein (Gi type) that initiates the signal transduction cascade common to chemotactic stimuli. They also show that dapsone-mediated suppression of this pathway inhibits the generation of second messengers essential to the activation of beta2 integrin molecules, as well as respiratory and secretory functions of neutrophils exposed to chemoattractants. We propose that the inhibition of chemoattractant-induced signal transduction by dapsone suppresses neutrophil recruitment and local production of toxic respiratory and secretory products in the affected skin of dermatitis herpetiformis and other neutrophilic dermatoses.","['Debol SM', 'Herron MJ', 'Nelson RD']",1997,62,6,J Leukoc Biol,"Debol SM, et al.

9407155,Absence of toxicity of oats in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND: People with gluten sensitivity should avoid foods containing wheat, rye, and barley, but there has been debate about whether they should avoid oats. Although patients with celiac disease have recently been shown to tolerate oats, less is known about the effects of oats on patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.
METHODS: We studied seven men and three women (mean age, 58 years) with biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis. They had followed a strict gluten-free diet for a mean of 15.8 years, which controlled their rash and enteropathy. The patients added oats that were not contaminated with gluten to their diets for 12 weeks (mean [+/-SD] daily intake, 62.5+/-10.8 g).
RESULTS: None of the patients had any adverse effects. Serologic tests for antigliadin, antireticulin, and antiendomysial antibodies were negative before oats were introduced into the diet and after they were discontinued. Villous architecture remained normal: the mean (+/-SE) ratio of the height of villi to the depth of crypts was 3.59+/-0.11 before the diet and 3.71+/-0.09 afterward (normal, 3 to 5), and the mean enterocyte heights were 31.36+/-0.58 microm and 31.75+/-44 microm, respectively (normal range, 29 to 34). Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts all remained within normal limits (mean, 13.8+/-1.03 per 100 enterocytes before the diet and 14.2+/-1.2 per 100 enterocytes afterward; normal range, 10 to 30). Dermal IgA showed no significant changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis can include moderate amounts of oats in their gluten-free diets without deleterious effects to the skin or intestine.","['Hardman CM', 'Garioch JJ', 'Leonard JN', 'Thomas HJ', 'Walker MM', 'Lortan JE', 'Lister A', 'Fry L']",1997,337,26,N Engl J Med,"Hardman CM, et al.

9399394,High incidence and prevalence of adult coeliac disease. Augmented diagnostic approach.,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of coeliac disease is easily overlooked as patients can present with mild or atypical symptoms, or the condition can even be clinically silent. Our aim was to detect coeliac disease patients with such atypical or no symptoms as well as those with typical features.
METHODS: The incidence of adult coeliac disease in Tampere was calculated from 1975 to 1994 and the prevalence as of 31 December 1994. Open-access endoscopy was available for general practitioners, and small-bowel biopsy was done routinely. Serologic screening was applied to patients with an increased risk of coeliac disease.
RESULTS: The incidence of coeliac disease increased tenfold, and the prevalence was 270 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1994. Twenty per cent were found by serologic screening and 10% as a result of routine biopsy; 24% had dermatitis herpetiformis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our diagnostic approach gave a coeliac prevalence similar to that found in population screening studies. One-third had silent coeliac disease.","['Collin P', 'Reunala T', 'Rasmussen M', 'Kyrönpalo S', 'Pehkonen E', 'Laippala P', 'Mäki M']",1997,32,11,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Collin P, et al.

Deposition of granular IgA at the dermoepidermal junction on direct immunofluorescence was present in each case. The average age of onset was 41.8 yr, patients having symptoms for an average of 1.6 yr before diagnosis. Six patients had a prior history of coeliac disease. Two patients had a family history of dermatitis herpetiformis, a father and son who were both propositi in this study. Small bowel biopsy was performed on 35 patients, 71.4 per cent of them showing evidence of villous atrophy. All patients were controlled on a gluten free diet or by dapsone or a combination of these.

However, direct immunofluorescence analysis showed IgG deposits at the basement membrane zone, indicating a relationship with bullous pemphigoid or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Indirect immunofluorescence studies on salt-split skin showed binding of IgG mainly on the dermal side of the blister. Immunoblot analysis revealed a novel 200 kDa dermal antigen that could be associated with a major pathogen in this blistering disease. The histopathological similarity to dermatitis herpetiformis and the immunofluorescence findings indicating bullous pemphigoid or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita seem typical of a distinct subepidermal blistering disease characterized by this 200 kDa antigen.

21781797,Food induced skin diseases.,"Skin diseases due to an adverse reaction to food are urticaria, atopic dermatitis, oral allergy syndrome, dermatitis herpetiformis and protein induced contact dermatitis. The first three disorders will be discussed in more detail. Urticaria per se is a common skin reaction associated with various external and internal factors. Food as a causative factor is more frequently associated with acute than with chronic urticaria. The relation between food and atopic dermatitis is evident in young children with atopic dermatitis. The course of atopic dermatitis in adults is hardly influenced by food. The mechanism involved in urticaria may be immune-mediated, being IgE-mediated, or non-immune mediated, being pharmacologic or unknown. The mechanism involved in food-induced atopic dermatitis is based on the involvement of IgE antibodies and T lymphocytes. So far, it not known if and how (free or complexed with antibodies) food allergens enter the skin.

9183321,Wheat starch intolerance in patients with celiac disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate in patients with celiac disease the tolerance of prolonged consumption of small amounts of gliadin contained in products containing wheat starch.
DESIGN: Open 1-year trial of the addition of wheat starch to a gluten-free diet in a cohort of adult patients with biopsy-proven celiac disease who had never consumed wheat starch. The control group consisted of patients with celiac disease who tolerated wheat starch.
SUBJECTS: Seventeen patients with celiac disease and 14 control patients, all diagnosed according to criteria of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, were recruited from the Canadian Celiac Association and the Quebec Celiac Foundation.
SETTING: The study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of the Gastroenterology and Nutrition Service of Ste Justine Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were asked to consume four to six portions daily of a wheat starch-containing product, mainly bread, for up to 1 year.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The gliadin content of the wheat starch product used in this trial was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patient outcome measures included symptoms, nutritional parameters (anthropometric data, complete blood count, serum folate and iron levels), and immunologic parameters (antigliadin antibody and antiendomysium antibody titers).
RESULTS: A quantifiable amount of immunoreactive gliadin (0.75 mg/100 g) was found in the wheat starch. The majority of the patients with celiac disease (11 of 17) who had never consumed wheat starch previously developed symptoms, which resolved within weeks of discontinuing the product. Relapse of skin lesions was seen in two of three patients with coexisting dermatitis herpetiformis. No weight loss or biochemical changes were observed. Despite the presence of symptoms, antigliadin antibody and antiendomysium antibody determinations were not useful to detect the clinical intolerance.
APPLICATIONS: The innocuousness of the long-term ingestion of ""gluten-free"" products containing wheat starch is still unproven, and prolonged use of such products by patients with celiac disease cannot be recommended.","['Chartrand LJ', 'Russo PA', 'Duhaime AG', 'Seidman EG']",1997,97,6,J Am Diet Assoc,"Chartrand LJ, et al.

In this study, we examined whether increased numbers of gamma/delta TcR positive lymphocytes occur in the oral mucosa of patients with DH. Oral and jejunal mucosal biopsies were taken from 13 newly diagnosed and 13 gluten free diet (GFD)-treated patients with DH. Monoclonal antibodies and avidin-biotin peroxidase method was used for staining, and TcR positive cells were counted from the buccal and jejunal epithelium. Very few gamma/delta TcR positive lymphocytes were seen in the buccal epithelium of untreated or GFD-treated DH patients (median 0.4 and 0.3 cells/mm2), whereas alpha/beta TcR positive lymphocytes were frequent in both groups of DH patients (154 and 250 cells/mm2) and healthy controls (135 cells/mm2). The numbers of gamma/delta TcR positive intraepithelial lymphocytes were significantly increased in the jejunum of both untreated (43 cells/mm) and GFD-treated (27 cells/mm) DH patients compared to control patients (2.2 cells/mm). The present study did not, therefore, disclose any evidence for active recruitment of gamma/delta TcR positive lymphocytes in the oral epithelium, but showed substantial amounts of intraepithelial alpha/beta TcR positive lymphocytes both in DH patients and healthy controls.","['Patinen P', 'Savilahti E', 'Hietanen J', 'Malmström M', 'Mäki M', 'Reunala T']",1997,105,2,Eur J Oral Sci,"Patinen P, et al.

The results were compared with those from 383 patients with coeliac disease (CD). Twenty-nine (9.5%) patients with DH and 73 (19.1%) with CD had concomitant endocrine or connective tissue disorders. The following associations were found: auto-immune thyroid disease (4.3% of DH patients and 6.0% of CD patients), insulin dependent diabetes (1.0% DH and 5.5% CD), lupus erythematosus (1.3% DH and 0.3% CD), Sjögren's syndrome (1.0% DH and 2.9% CD), sarcoidosis (1.3% DH and 1.8% CD), and vitiligo or alopecia areata (1.6% DH and 0% CD). We have shown that patients with DH are similar to those with CD in that many have associated endocrine or connective tissue disorders. Most of these diseases began before DH had been diagnosed suggesting that those on a gluten-free diet are not at special risk of contracting them.","['Reunala T', 'Collin P']",1997,136,3,Br J Dermatol,Reunala T and Collin P.

9120771,Studies on the inhibitory effects of analogues of dapsone on neutrophil function in-vitro.,"We have compared twelve sulphone analogues of dapsone in terms of inhibition both of zymosan-mediated human neutrophil respiratory burst and inhibition of interleukin-1-stimulated neutrophil adhesion to transformed human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Overall, there was a good correlation between the respective rank orders of compound potency in the two test systems. The most effective compounds in terms of respiratory burst and adherence inhibition were the 2-nitro-4-amino-, 2-hydroxy-4-aminopropyl-, and 2-methoxy-4-aminoethyl- derivatives. In general, potency was inversely associated with lipophilicity; compounds with bulky side-chains, e.g. the 2-methyl-4-aminopentyl, 2-methyl-4-aminohexyl and the 2-hydroxymethyl-4-aminoethyl derivatives, were less potent. A 2-hydroxy-4-amino- derivative was the exception, however, with low lipophilicity and relatively low potency. All of the compounds tested showed comparable or greater inhibition in both the neutrophil-mediated assays compared with dapsone. Some of the compounds might, because of their good tissue penetration and lower toxicity than dapsone, have the potential to undergo further development.","['Coleman MD', 'Smith JK', 'Perris AD', 'Buck NS', 'Seydel JK']",1997,49,1,J Pharm Pharmacol,"Coleman MD, et al.

To induce blisters, 50% potassium iodide patch tests were performed, and serial biopsy specimens were taken at 4, 12, and 24 h. Additional samples were taken from occasional spontaneous blisters. Components of the basement membrane, laminin-5, laminin-1, and type VII collagen, were examined immunohistochemically in relation to matrix metalloproteinase expression. At 12 h, when no blisters were seen, uPA mRNA was present in basal keratinocytes in five of eight samples, whereas interstitial collagenase and stromelysin-1 mRNA were not detected. At this time, immunohistochemistry failed to show changes in the basement membrane. At 24 h, uPA, collagenase, and stromelysin-1 mRNAs were present in basal keratinocytes, suggesting an activation of latent forms of the two latter enzymes by the uPA-plasmin pathway. Signal for stromelysin-2 was not detected. Furthermore, disruptions of laminin-1 and type VII collagen were evident. The data suggest that stromelysin-1 and interstitial collagenase may contribute to the degradation of basement membrane in dermatitis herpetiformis. Intracellular staining for laminin-5 co-localized with collagenase mRNA in basal keratinocytes. Because laminin-5 is essential for adhesion of keratinocytes to basement membrane and for establishment of focal adhesions on migrating cells, its production may reflect a regenerative response after the destruction of basement membrane components.","['Airola K', 'Reunala T', 'Salo S', 'Saarialho-Kere UK']",1997,108,1,J Invest Dermatol,"Airola K, et al.

8814255,"TNF2, a polymorphism of the tumour necrosis-alpha gene promoter, is a component of the celiac disease major histocompatibility complex haplotype.","Celiac disease (CD) is an immune disease triggered by the cereal antigen gliadin, resulting in villous atrophy in the small intestine. Susceptibility to the development of CD is strongly influenced by genes in the major histocompatibility complex, in particular alleles of the DQ genes in the class II region. However recent evidence has suggested that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region may be linked to celiac disease independently of the class II region. Among the genes located in this area is TNF-alpha, which encodes the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha which has a broad range of pro-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and catabolic activities. Therefore, aberrant expression of TNF-alpha could be important in the pathogenesis of MHC-associated immune disorders. A TNF-alpha variant with a polymorphism in its promoter region has been described and designated TNF2. TNF2 has been associated with a variety of MHC-linked diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatitis herpetiformis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), as well as parasitic infections. TNF2 has previously been shown to be associated with the MHC haplotype HLA A1-B8-DR3-DQ2, which confers susceptibility to CD. We have analyzed the distribution of TNF2 alleles in a group of celiac patients (n = 52) compared to controls (n = 52) in an effort to evaluate its role, if any, in susceptibility to the condition. TNF2 has a frequency of 0.5000 (SE +/- 0.0490) in CD, compared to 0.1635 (+/- 0.0362) in a control sample (p < 10(-6)). Of 52 patients, 44 carried one or more TNF2 alleles. Analysis indicates that the distribution of TNF2 is best explained by assuming 100% allelic association between it and HLA-DQB1*0201 (frequency = 0.7791 +/- 0.0447). However, the number of TNF2 heterozygotes significantly exceeds expectations and measurements of linkage disequilibrium confirm that allelic associations spanning the DQ and TNF regions are strongly maintained in CD. Taken together, these results indicate that TNF2 may have a role in the pathogenesis of CD; however, since it is not an independent association, the possibility that TNF2 constitutes a passive component of the CD haplotype cannot be excluded.","['McManus R', 'Wilson AG', 'Mansfield J', 'Weir DG', 'Duff GW', 'Kelleher D']",1996,26,9,Eur J Immunol,"McManus R, et al.

8858285,HLA class II region genes and susceptibility to dermatitis herpetiformis: DPB1 and TAP2 associations are secondary to those of the DQ subregion.,"Classical dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is associated with similar HLA class I, II and III polymorphisms to coeliac disease (CD). The two diseases share distinctive pathological changes to the small intestinal mucosa which reverse on withdrawal of dietary gluten. In order to determine the locus primarily associated with DH, and to examine whether there is a common genetic link predisposing to the enteropathy seen in both DH and coeliac disease, HLA-DR, DQ and DP subregion associations were investigated by HLA genotyping in 23 DH patients and 64 healthy controls. We also studied polymorphisms of the TAP2 locus, which is located between the DP and DQ subregions. Genotyping was carried out by PCR of genomic DNA with allelic assignment by sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) hybridization or amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). The strongest associations in the patient group were with HLA DRB1*0301 (91% vs 22% of controls), HLA DQB1*02 (100% vs 32% of controls) and DPB1*0101 (39% and 14%). These associations are similar to those described for CD. 100% of DH patients were positive for the DQA1*0501/DQB1*02 dimer in cis or trans and, by analogy with CD, this is probably responsible for presenting gliadin peptide implicated in the disease process. Homozygosity for DQ2 was significantly increased in the CD patient group compared to the DH patient group (65% versus 39%), and so differences in dosage of HLA class II genotypes between DH and CD may be responsible for the milder gastrointestinal symptoms characteristic of DH.","['Hall MA', 'Lanchbury JS', 'Ciclitira PJ']",1996,23,4,Eur J Immunogenet,"Hall MA, et al.

8712841,Deposition of granular IgA relative to clinical lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the deposition of IgA and C3 in the skin of patients with active dermatitis herpetiformis relative to the sites of disease.
DESIGN: In the phase 1 study, skin biopsy specimens were obtained from erythematous perilesional skin, nonerythematous perilesional skin, and never-involved skin. In the phase 2 study, specimens from the nonerythematous perilesional and uninvolved skin from the same anatomic region were sampled.
SETTING: The Dermatology Clinic at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City.
PATIENTS: Patients with known dermatitis herpetiformis: 19 patients in the phase 1 study and 15 patients in the phase 2 study. Suppressive medications were stopped for 48 to 72 hours after biopsy specimens were obtained. All patients had active disease at the time that biopsy specimens were taken.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The intensity of IgA and C3 immunofluorescent staining in 6 sections from each skin biopsy specimen was graded by using a semiquantitative scale (0 to 3+) in a blinded fashion by a single observer.
RESULTS: Deposition of IgA was more intense in noninflamed perilesional skin in 11 of 19 patients compared with that in erythematous skin (P < .05). Erythematous skin was negative for IgA in 16% (3/19) of the specimens. Noninflamed perilesional skin showed more intense IgA deposition in 18 of 19 specimens compared with that in never-involved skin (P < .01); C3 was more intense in erythematous skin (P < .01). In the phase 2 study, skin from the same anatomic region revealed greater deposition of IgA near lesions in 12 of 15 patients (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, IgA is not uniformly distributed throughout the skin, and IgA is present in greater amounts near active lesions. The preferred biopsy site for the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis is normal-appearing skin that is adjacent to an active lesion.","['Zone JJ', 'Meyer LJ', 'Petersen MJ']",1996,132,8,Arch Dermatol,"Zone JJ, et al.

Direct immunofluorescence from non-inflammatory loose skin revealed granular immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits at the basement membrane zone and fibrillar IgA deposits in the dermal papillae. IgA deposits were also observed on the elastic fibres of the reticular dermis. Electron microscopy of skin from the submammary fold revealed fragmented elastic fibres, partial absence of peripheral microfibrils and abundant neutrophils, some of which were degranulated and adjacent to elastic fibres. Immunoelectron microscopy of an erythematous papule revealed IgA deposits around dermal elastic fibres. Antigliadin, antireticulin and antiendomysium antibodies were present.

8881298,[Dermatitis herpetiformis occuring in patients with celiac disease in childhood].,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic papulovesicular immune-mediated disorder associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. We report eight cases in which DH appeared many years after celiac disease (CD) in child.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of CD was based on histological features of total or subtotal villous atrophy, full remission after withdrawal of gluten from the diet, and eventually circulating antibodies (IgA gliadin, antireticulin and antiendomysium) at the time of diagnosis and their disappearance under gluten-free diet. The diagnosis of DH was made from clinical findings, histological examination of the involved skin and direct immunofluorescence microscopy of normal or perilesional skin. HLA class II typing was performed in five patients. DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DBP1 alleles were studied.
RESULTS: DH appeared between 3 and 22 years after the initial diagnosis of CD. Five patients did not show at that time any digestive symptoms. In three cases, a break in the gluten-free diet or a recent revival of the normal diet preceded the rash. In only one case, DH appeared while the patient was under gluten-free diet. In three patients, the rash appeared many years after the gluten-free diet had been stopped. Phenotype DR3 and/or DR7 of the celiac disease could be found in four of the five patients studied; three of them were found to bear DQW2. The DR2 allele was not found in any of the five tested patients.
DISCUSSION: These eight cases illustrate the absence of precise nosological barrier between gluten-sensitive enteropathy of the DH and that observed in CD. The presence of the DR7 allele, and especially the absence of the DR2 allele, could explain the particularly severe and symptomatic course of the enteropathy in these patients. The delay in the appearance of DH, after a very variable period of normal diet, could correspond to the necessary time for progressive accumulation of IgA (or immune complex IgA-gluten) in the skin after a digestive sensitization to gluten. The preventive role of gluten-free diet is thus probable.
CONCLUSION: CD and DH likely correspond to two different stages of the same disease, thus requiring a prolonged follow-up of both digestive and skin tissues. Long-term eviction of gluten to prevent eventual DH must be balanced with the demand and the cost of such a diet.","['Démoulins-Giacco N', 'Gagey V', 'Teillac-Hamel D', 'Fraitag S', 'Caillat-Zucman S', 'Schmitz J', 'de Prost Y']",1996,3,6,Arch Pediatr,"Démoulins-Giacco N, et al.

8793663,Neutrophilic spongiosis in pemphigus herpetiformis.,"Pemphigus herpetiformis is a rare pemphigus variant with light microscopic features that have historically been described as either ""acantholytic dermatitis herpetiformis"" or as ""eosinophilic spongiosis in pemphigus"". The clinical features of this form of pemphigus are reminiscent of dermatitis herpetiformis; however, the direct immunofluorescence finding of epidermal inter-cellular IgG deposition is that of the pemphigus group. We report two patients with clinical presentations suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis in whom the histopathologic features were those of a neutrophilic intraepidermal blistering disorder. Biopsies showed marked epidermal spongiosis with midepidermal acantholytic vesicles containing predominantly neutrophils and a few eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence was positive for epidermal intercellular IgG; IgA deposition was not present. Neutrophilic spongiosis, in the absence of a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate, should be recognized as an early finding in some cases of pemphigus, and immunofluorescence studies are justified when this histologic feature is encountered in a skin biopsy.","['Huhn KM', 'Tron VA', 'Nguyen N', 'Trotter MJ']",1996,23,3,J Cutan Pathol,"Huhn KM, et al.

8792511,Dapsone in rheumatoid arthritis.,"Dapsone, a synthetic sulfone with chemical similarities to sulfapyridine, has been used for a number of years to treat leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis. Recently, a number of prospective, randomized, double-blind trials have shown their success in the management of rheumatoid arthritis, with dapsone being superior to placebo and comparable to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Its mode of anti-inflammatory actions in rheumatoid arthritis is not clearly understood, but modulation of neutrophil activity or inhibition of neutrophil inflammatory product formation or release appear to play a role. The major limiting side effect is hemolytic anemia, which may be mitigated through careful patient selection, conservative drug dosing, close monitoring, and possibly, concurrent administration of antioxidants or cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Methemoglobinemia is another common finding among patients receiving dapsone therapy, but rarely does it result in prominent symptoms other than transient pallor. Less common adverse events to dapsone include the idiosyncratic reactions of leukopenia and agranulocytosis, cutaneous eruptions, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, toxic hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, nephrotic syndrome, renal papillary necrosis, severe hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome, and minor neurological and gastrointestinal complaints. In this report, two patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis, who were safely and effectively treated with dapsone after failure with other second-line agents, are described and the literature is reviewed. We suggest that dapsone is an effective second-line agent in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.","['Chang DJ', 'Lamothe M', 'Stevens RM', 'Sigal LH']",1996,25,6,Semin Arthritis Rheum,"Chang DJ, et al.

They are found more amply in the papillary derma where they are manifested most markedly as the mentioned type of dermatosis. The objective of the present work was to assess the participation of components of the extracellular matrix in the pathogenesis of diseases and the possibility of their detection to make a more accurate diagnosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a group of 11 patients (mean age 39 +/- 17 years) with dermatitis herpetiformis the diagnosis was established on the basis of the clinical and histological finding. Fibronectin and collagens type I, III, IV, V were assessed in the skin using rabbit antisera (INPHARM Co. Moscow). An elevated level of collagen type III and V was found in the affected papillae and on the floor of the blisters in the papillary derma, collagen type IV on the vault of the blister and fibronectin deposits in the affected papillae which had a netlike structure.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the above findings assessment of fibronectin, collagens type III, IV and V in the affected skin can be considered an important supplementary examination in the histological diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Halagovec A', 'Héjj F', 'Baranová Z']",1996,135,9,Cas Lek Cesk,"Halagovec A, et al.

The prevalence of histologically confirmed CD in Edinburgh and the Lothians in 1979 was 61 per 100,000. The National Health Service Central Records of all 653 subjects registered at that time have been flagged, allowing us to analyse mortality in CD. At a mean of 13.5 years, mortality overall was 1.9-fold that of the general population (115 deaths observed. 61.8 expected; p < 0.0001). For both sexes the early mortality was much greater than expected, but the excess steadily diminished with time from diagnosis. Much of the increased mortality from malignant disease was accounted for by deaths from lymphoproliferative disease and esophageal cancer. Interim re-analysis after a further 9 years shows that the pattern of later deaths is consistent with these trends. Clinical and pathological features of lymphomas in CD are described. In serum samples of 41 patients with normal villus architecture while taking a normal diet, but with minor pathological and/or immunological abnormalities, i.e. potential CD, IgA antiendomysium antibodies were positive in 7 with dermatitis herpetiformis but in only 3 others.","['Ferguson A', 'Kingstone K']",1996,412,,Acta Paediatr Suppl,Ferguson A and Kingstone K.

Concomitantly 8 age- and sex-matched healthy blood donor as well as six patients with dermatitis herpetiformis served as negative and positive controls, respectively. The concentration of soluble interleukin 2 receptor in serum samples from these patients was similar to that in samples from normal subjects. In contrast to this, patients with dermatitis herpetiformis showed higher values of interleukin 2 receptor.

8707082,Malignancy and survival in dermatitis herpetiformis: a comparison with coeliac disease.,"BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis is a lifelong, gluten sensitive skin disease. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, similar to patients with coeliac disease not adhering to a gluten free diet, seem to have increased risk for lymphoma.
AIMS: This study looked at the occurrence of malignancy and survival of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and compared the results with those seen in patients with coeliac disease or in the general population.
PATIENTS: A total of 305 adult patients with dermatitis herpetiformis diagnosed at the University Hospital of Tampere in 1970-1992 were studied. Most patients started a gluten free diet and at the end of the study 93% of the patients were adhering to the diet. A control group comprised 383 adult patients with coeliac disease, 81% of them adhered to a gluten free diet, 6% had a normal diet, and in 13% the diet history remained unknown.
METHODS: The occurrence of malignant diseases and survival of the patients were assessed up to the end of 1993. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals were used for the malignant diseases. The survival of the patients was compared with that of the general population.
RESULTS: Thirteen (4.3%) patients with dermatitis herpetiformis developed 14 malignant disorders during the follow up (SIR 1.25; 95% confidence intervals 0.68 to 2.09). A non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred in four patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, significantly more than expected (SIR 10.3; 2.8-26.3). Thirteen (4.3%) patients with dermatitis herpetiformis died during the follow up but there was no increased general mortality. In coeliac disease, 13 (3.4%) patients developed malignancy (SIR 1.16; 0.62 to 1.97), 31 (8.1%) patients died but the survival rate did not differ from that in the general population.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was significantly increased in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. The results also confirm that the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis treated mainly with a gluten free diet have no increased general mortality.","['Collin P', 'Pukkala E', 'Reunala T']",1996,38,4,Gut,"Collin P, et al.

8731659,Incidence of familial dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and coeliac disease (CD) are gluten-sensitive diseases which have a common immunogenetic background, with the histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) alleles DQ A1*0501 and B1*0201 in the short arm of chromosome 6. CD is well known to cluster in families whereas DH has not been generally regarded as a familial disease. To study the familial incidence of DH, a prospective study was started in 1969 at the Department of Dermatology of Helsinki University Hospital and in 1976 at the Department of Dermatology of Tampere University Hospital. A total of 1018 patients with DH were diagnosed and questioned for positive family histories. Of the 999 unrelated DH patients, 105 (10.5%) had one or several affected first-degree relatives. The disease in the relatives was either DH (4.4%) or CD (6.1%). Analysis of the 105 families showed that 13.6% of parents, 18.7% of siblings and 14.0% of children were affected, a segregation pattern which fits well to a dominant mode of Mendelian inheritance. Gender may also be important because the first-degree relatives affected with DH were more often females and those affected with CD twice as often females as males. In contrast, there were more males among the 105 propositi with DH and also among the 894 DH patients with no affected relatives. The present study clearly shows that DH is a familial disease in which the first-degree relatives can be affected both with DH and CD, presumably because of a common genetic background. The environmental factors which could cause the rather high penetrance of DH and CD in the first-degree relatives of DH patients remain unknown.",['Reunala T'],1996,134,3,Br J Dermatol,Reunala T.

8675091,"Importance of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis: prevalence, titre, and IgG subclass.","Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have been reported in up to 87% of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis with or without ulcerative colitis (PSC +/- UC) and in 68% of those with UC only. Compared with other liver and diarrhoeal diseases, ANCA have high specificity for PSC (+/- UC) and UC only. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and significance of ANCA in these two diseases and whether the ANCA titre or IgG subclass, or both, could distinguish between PSC + UC and UC only. Subjects included 63 patients with PSC, 85 with UC, 17 with coeliac disease, and 10 with dermatitis herpeteformis and 36 normal subjects. ANCA was detected using the immunoalkaline phosphatase method. The IgG subclass of ANCA was determined in 27 PSC + UC and 30 UC only patients using a panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the IgG subclasses. At a serum dilution of 1:5, ANCA had a diagnostic sensitivity of 65% for all PSC and 45% for UC only. For PSC + UC the sensitivity was 70% at 1:5 (p = 0.004 v UC only). At 1:50, the sensitivity values were 54% and 25% respectively for PSC + UC and UC only (p = 0.0006). In PSC, ANCA positivity was significantly associated with extensive involvement of the biliary tree but not with other clinical parameters. In UC only, the median disease duration was significantly greater in ANCA positive patients. The PSC + UC ANCA showed increased IgG3 compared with UC only ANCA (p < 0.05), together with increased IgG2 and IgG4 (p = NS). ANCA is a diagnostic marker in PSC and UC. While the higher titres and different IgG subclass distribution of ANCA in PSC + UC patients compared with those with UC only may reflect differences in underlying immune regulation, determination of the ANCA titre and IgG subclass is unlikely to have a role in distinguishing between PSC + UC and UC only ANCA. Future identification of the antigen(s) for ANCA should allow the development of a more sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of these two conditions and also determine if ANCA is associated with UC or PSC.","['Bansi DS', 'Fleming KA', 'Chapman RW']",1996,38,3,Gut,"Bansi DS, et al.

9615104,[Bullous IgA linear dermatosis of children in Mali].,"INTRODUCTION: Bullous IgA linear dermatosis is relatively frequent in children in Africa. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of this disease among autoimmune bullous diseases in children in Mali.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with chronic bullous disease seen at the Marchoux Institute in Bamako and for whom direct immunofluorescence of the perilesional skin demonstrated immunoglobulin and/or complement deposits were included in the study population.
RESULTS: Twelve children were included. Direct immunofluorescence showed linear IgA deposit along the dermo-epidermal junction in 10, once with a pemphigoid aspect and once with a pemphigus aspect. The skin lesions in the children with linear IgA deposits were stereotypic: disseminated bullae, rosettes (9 out of 10), involving the external genital organs (10/10), the limbs, the face and the trunk. Histology showed subepidermal bullae (10/10), with neutrophil papillar abscesses (9/10). Indirect immunofluorescence of the cleaved skin NaCl in 5 patients showed that the cleavage always lied at the roof of the cleavage. All the children responded to dapsone (1 to 2.5 mg/kg/d) which gave complete (7/10), or incomplete remission. Local corticosteroids were used in 2 patients and general corticosteroids in 1.
DISCUSSION: This confirms the frequency of bullous IgA linear dermatosis in Africa, in contrast with uncommon dermatitis herpetiformis. Diagnosis is facilitated with immunofluorescence. The low cost of this test makes it a useful diagnostic tool in these countries.","['Mahé A', 'Flageul B', 'Bobin P']",1996,123,9,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Mahé A, et al.

II. Subepidermal bullous dermatoses, due to mutation of the basement membrane zone proteins. These are epidermolysis bullosa junctionalis and epidermolysis bullosa dystrophicans. III. Subepidermal bullous dermatoses due to metabolic disorders: Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). IV.

8927941,Symptoms and haematologic features in consecutive adult coeliac patients.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine in a homogeneous adult population from Denmark, which is known to have very low incidence rates of coeliac disease, 1) the percentage of patients presenting with mild or atypical symptoms; 2) a possible change in clinical pattern over time; and 3) the delay in diagnosis and the age and sex distribution.
METHODS: The symptoms, delay in diagnosis, age, sex, and haematologic features of 50 consecutive adult coeliac patients, diagnosed by the same person in a uniform manner, are presented.
RESULTS: The median age was 40.5 (range, 17-82) years. The male to female sex ratio was 1:2.8. The median delay in diagnosis was 3 years. Fifty-eight per cent reported symptoms that could be attributed to coeliac disease during childhood. Presenting symptoms were tiredness, 78%; borborygmus, 72%; abdominal pain, 64%; diarrhoea, 56%; weight loss, 44%; vomiting, 16%; constipation, 12%; bone pain, 12%; and dermatitis herpetiformis, 10%. Weight gain after treatment was experienced by 84%. As a group the coeliac patients had many abnormal blood analysis results, but many patients had several test results inside the normal range. Only 22% had anemia. Liver involvement was not an uncommon feature (19% had increased transaminase levels). Low values were registered in s-iron (32%), p-folate (49%), c-folate (35%), p-vitamin B12 (11%), p-coagulation factors (II, VII, X) (32%), s-protein (21%), s-albumin (26%), s-calcium (43%), p-magnesium (13%), and s-zinc (31%). High/low IgG levels were 3%/8%; high, IgA 21%; high/low IgM, 65%/14%; and high IgE, 71%. The gliadin antibody test was the best screening test (81% positive). No changes in clinical pattern were demonstrated during the period.
CONCLUSION: The percentage of patients presenting with anaemia (22%) and other haematologic signs of malabsorption was one of the lowest reported ever. This emphasizes the highly variable and subtle clinical expression of adult coeliac disease.","['Bodé S', 'Gudmand-Høyer E']",1996,31,1,Scand J Gastroenterol,Bodé S and Gudmand-Høyer E.

She ultimately had to be treated with parenteral heparin which brought about involution of the skin lesions with symptomatic relief within 1 week. The mechanism of action of heparin is uncertain but may be related to the inhibition of the formation of proteases generated from polymorphs by the clotting process.

However, immunofluorescence studies demonstrated concurrent anti-cell-surface and anti-basement-membrane-zone antibodies in the patient's serum. Immunochemical studies showed that the patient's serum reacted with both the pemphigus foliaceus antigen and the two bullous pemphigoid antigens. Subsequently, the patient developed AIHA. Both anemia and skin lesions were successfully treated with oral prednisolone. We believe that this is the first case with HP in association with AIHA.

8761086,[Agranulocytosis induced by dapsone prescribed for dermatitis herpetiformis].,"INTRODUCTION: Dapsone is a drug widely prescribed in dermatology. It can lead to undesirable side effects including hematologic disorders.
CASE REPORT: A patient with dermatitis herpetiformis was treated with dapsone. Agranulocytosis developed 6 weeks later and was revealed by fever and pneumonia which resolved under antibiotics. The agranulocytosis regressed without specific treatment after drug withdrawal. Blood counts returned to normal 2 weeks later.
DISCUSSION: Dapsone-induced agranulocytosis is in common (1/10,000 to 1/20,000). The drug is widely prescribed, particularly for leprosy. Nevertheless, when dapsone is prescribed for dermatitis herpetiformis, the risk of agranulocytosis increases 25-fold reaching 1/400. The indication for dapsone must always made carefully, with surveillance of the blood counts every 15 days during the first 3 months of treatment for dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Machet L', 'Callens A', 'Mercier E', 'Gargot S', 'Lorette G', 'Vaillant L']",1996,123,5,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Machet L, et al.

Sera from 144 adult patients (without concurrent dermatitis herpetiformis or IgA deficiency) who underwent small bowel biopsy were analyzed for both IgA anti-endomysium and IgA anti-gliadin antibodies. Nineteen patients (13%) had celiac disease. The presence of IgA antiendomysium antibodies had a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 100%. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 96%, respectively, and the diagnostic accuracy was 97%. In contrast, IgA anti-gliadin antibodies had positive and negative predictive values of 28% and 96%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 71%. Based on these data, we suggest that small bowel biopsy is not necessary to diagnose celiac disease in symptomatic adults with IgA antiendomysium antibodies. Due to a negative predictive value of 96%, some symptomatic adults lacking anti-endomysium antibodies will not be correctly diagnosed without small bowel biopsy.","['Valdimarsson T', 'Franzen L', 'Grodzinsky E', 'Skogh T', 'Ström M']",1996,41,1,Dig Dis Sci,"Valdimarsson T, et al.

Most patients show antiepidermal autoantibodies that stain the epidermal intercellular spaces by immunofluorescence, similar to pemphigus autoantibodies, and lack the immunopathologic features of dermatitis herpetiformis.
OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at characterizing the specificity of the antiepidermal autoantibodies in seven patients with pemphigus herpetiformis.
METHODS: The antiepidermal autoantibodies were characterized by immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation studies in seven patients who fulfilled the clinical, histologic, and immunofluorescence diagnostic criteria for pemphigus herpetiformis.
RESULTS: Five patients with features of pemphigus herpetiformis either had classic pemphigus foliaceus, or their disease evolved into classic pemphigus foliaceus. One of these patients had fogo selvagem. Two of the seven patients showed features of or had disease that evolved into pemphigus vulgaris.

In the present study salivary and serum IgA-AGA were measured by an ELISA test in 10 untreated patients with DH. The results were compared to IgA-AGA levels in nine patients with DH on a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) and in 20 healthy control subjects on an ordinary diet. The mean serum but not salivary IgA-AGA concentrations were significantly higher in the untreated than in the patients with DH on a long-term GFD. When the 10 untreated patients with DH adhered to a GFD for 3 months, the rash disappeared and the mean serum IgA-AGA decreased to normal levels, but no change was found in the mean salivary IgA-AGA concentration. These results show that serum but not salivary IgA-AGA measurements are suitable for monitoring GFD treatment in patients with DH. The discrepancy between the serum and salivary IgA-AGA concentrations suggests that systemic and salivary IgA-AGA responses are controlled separately.","['Patinen P', 'Björksten F', 'Malmström M', 'Savilahti E', 'Reunala T']",1995,103,5,Eur J Oral Sci,"Patinen P, et al.

A prominent signal for collagenase mRNA was consistently detected in the basal keratinocytes of rete ridges surrounding the neutrophilic abscesses in 10 of 11 lesions, and the expression was independent of the age of the lesion and the migratory state of the basal keratinocytes. Expression of stromelysin-1 was detected in seven of 11 lesions and co-localized with collagenase. No expression of the 92-kDa gelatinase mRNA or matrilysin protein was found in the vicinity of neutrophilic accumulations or the damaged basement membrane. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator mRNA was found in basal keratinocytes in seven of nine samples. Collagenase, stromelysin-1, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator were not expressed in normal-appearing skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Our results suggest that in lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis, collagenase and stromelysin-1 may be induced in basal keratinocytes by neutrophil cytokines or by altered cell-matrix interactions through contact of keratinocytes with the matrix due to damaged basement membrane. Stromelysin-1, in particular, may contribute to formation of blisters by degrading basement membrane components.","['Airola K', 'Vaalamo M', 'Reunala T', 'Saarialho-Kere UK']",1995,105,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Airola K, et al.

7492350,Lack of proliferative response by gluten-specific T cells in the blood and gut of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The majority of patients with Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) have a gluten-sensitive enteropathy which may be triggered by a T cell-mediated immune response to gluten. Using a proliferative assay, the responses to gluten fraction III, recall antigens and mitogens of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and gut T cell lines (TCL) isolated from patients with Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) and normal controls were studied. In most cases, neither PBMC nor gut T cell lines (which were predominantly CD3+, CD4+, TCR alpha beta +) from either controls or patients proliferated in response to gluten fraction III alone. However, the addition of 10 U/ml IL-2 to PBMC cultures containing gluten fraction III resulted in a marked increase in proliferation in 9/19 DH patients and 7/11 controls compared to IL-2 alone. Furthermore, gluten-induced upregulation of IL-2 receptor (CD25) expression was demonstrated on PBMC from 4/4 patients with DH and 2/3 controls after 7 days' culture with antigen. A similar effect by exogenous IL-2, or the same concentration of IL-4, was observed in 8/11 (P = 0.02) and 5/6 respectively DH, and 3/4 normal gut T cell lines. No difference was observed in the response of DH and control PBMC to Tetanus toxin, Candida albicans and PPD; both normal and DH gut T cell lines were unresponsive to these antigens. However, the addition of IL-2 increased the response to Candida albicans by DH gut T cell lines. Moreover, the response of DH gut T cell lines to PHA (P < 0.001), Concanavalin A and anti-CD3 were markedly reduced compared to PBMC from the same patients. These findings suggest that gluten-specific T cells present in the blood and gut of normal and DH individuals are activated by but do not proliferate in response to specific antigen.","['Baker BS', 'Garioch JJ', 'Bokth S', 'Thomas H', 'Walker MM', 'Leonard JN', 'Fry L']",1995,8,4,J Autoimmun,"Baker BS, et al.

The disease is characterized by the presence of IgA deposits in the upper dermis of uninvolved skin and the diagnosis should not be made in the absence of these deposits. Two-thirds of patients have a small intestinal enteropathy with villous atrophy as seen in coeliac disease (CD). However, the remaining third also show evidence of a gluten sensitivity in the intestine, as judged by increased lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium. Villous atrophy also ensues after gluten challenge in those patients with previous normal villous architecture. The initial treatment of the rash is with one of the following three drugs, dapsone, sulphapyridine or sulphamethoxypyridazine. However, the rash also clears with gluten withdrawal. It must be stressed, however, that the average time to achieve significant reduction in drug requirements is 6 months and it can be over 2 years before drugs are no longer required. On re-introduction of gluten the eruption recurs. Patients with DH have a high incidence of auto-immune disorders, thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes, and should be screened for those diseases on a yearly basis. As with coeliac disease there is also an increased incidence of lymphoma and a gluten-free diet appears to protect patients from this complication. The mechanism by which gluten causes the skin lesions has still to be elucidated, but current investigations implicate lymphocytes and cytokines in the pathogenesis. The original hypothesis of an antigen-antibody reaction in the skin with complement activation causing the skin lesions, may not be correct.",['Fry L'],1995,9,2,Baillieres Clin Gastroenterol,Fry L.

7772473,Failure of intradermal skin testing with gluten to produce delayed hypersensitivity reactions in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized by a rash and a gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) indistinguishable from that of coeliac disease. T-cell-mediated mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of GSE. It seems feasible that intradermal injection of gluten, in patients known to have GSE, could lead to an influx of T cells sensitized to gluten, with subsequent development of a delayed hypersensitivity-type reaction. Six patients with DH and three normal subjects had intradermal injections of 'Frazer's fraction III' (FFIII; the partial peptic tryptic digest of gluten which is known to be antigenic) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control. Skin biopsies were taken at PBS and FFIII injection sites at 48 h. In addition, two of the patients with DH had biopsies taken of FFIII injection sites at 6 h. Monoclonal antibodies and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique were used to stain for T cells in the skin biopsies. A monoclonal antibody to a neoepitope exposed in the terminal complement complex and an immunofluorescent method were used to detect the presence of terminal complement component in biopsies taken from two of the control subjects and two of the patients. Both patients and control subjects developed a weal and flare within a few minutes of injecting the FFIII, and this persisted for up to 6 h. No skin reaction was present in either the patients or the control subjects at 48 h. No skin reaction was visible at any time following injection of PBS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Garioch JJ', 'Unsworth DJ', 'Baker BS', 'Leonard JN', 'Fry L']",1995,132,5,Br J Dermatol,"Garioch JJ, et al.

7741544,Diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis by an avidin-biotin-peroxidase method.,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Immunofluorescence detection of stippled IgA in dermal papillae has been considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). We have developed an immunohistochemical technique using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex that is equally effective as direct immunofluorescence in detecting IgA. We retrospectively studied 43 paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens obtained from patients with DH and a variety of other diseases for the presence of IgA along the basement membrane zone.
RESULTS: Eleven immunofluorescence-proved cases of DH were found positive for IgA with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. One biopsy specimen originally classified as DH was identified and reclassified as linear IgA bullous disease based on the immunoperoxidase findings. All the samples that were positive on direct immunofluorescence were positive with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. Control samples of bullous pemphigoid, discoid lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris, and dermatitis were all negative for IgA deposition.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of DH on formalin-fixed tissue is possible with the use of an avidin-biotin-peroxidase method, which is convenient and cost-effective.","['Zaenglein AL', 'Hafer L', 'Helm KF']",1995,131,5,Arch Dermatol,"Zaenglein AL, et al.

7738367,Comparative genetic association of human leukocyte antigen class II and tumor necrosis factor-alpha with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic subepidermal vesicular autoimmune skin disease characterized by a strong association with the human leukocyte antigen A1-B8-DR3-DQ2 haplotype. Although the strongest major histocompatibility complex association has been shown to be with the DQw2 (DQB1*0201/DQA1*0501) heterodimer, recent evidence has suggested that there may be up to three susceptibility loci within the major histocompatibility complex. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine with a broad range of proinflammatory, immunomodulating, and catabolic activities. We have recently described the first known polymorphism in the human TNF-alpha gene, which is biallelic and lies in the promoter region. The rare allele, TNF2, is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the human leukocyte antigen A1-B8-DR3-DQ2 haplotype. We therefore examined TNF-alpha genotypes in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and controls and compared the association with that of the class II alleles. Although TNF2 is strongly associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, this was weaker than the association with the class II loci, with DQw2 (DQB1*0201/DQA1*0501) showing the strongest disease association. Of the four patients negative for this marker, only one carried the TNF2 allele. These results indicate that TNF2 is not a major disease susceptibility marker, although our results do not exclude a minor role.","['Wilson AG', 'Clay FE', 'Crane AM', 'Cork MJ', 'Duff GW']",1995,104,5,J Invest Dermatol,"Wilson AG, et al.

7738351,"Increased expression of vascular permeability factor (vascular endothelial growth factor) in bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and erythema multiforme.","Vascular permeability factor (VPF), also known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plays an important role in the increased vascular permeability and angiogenesis associated with many malignant tumors. In addition, VPF/VEGF is strongly expressed by epidermal keratinocytes in wound healing and psoriasis, disorders that are also characterized by increased microvascular permeability and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the expression of VPF/VEGF in three bullous diseases with subepidermal blister formation that are characterized by hyperpermeable dermal microvessels and pronounced papillary dermal edema. The expression of VPF/VEGF mRNA was strongly up-regulated in the lesional epidermis of bullous pemphigoid (n = 3), erythema multiforme (n = 3), and dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 4) as detected by in situ hybridization. Epidermal labeling was particularly intense over blisters, but strong expression was also noted in areas of the epidermis adjacent to dermal inflammatory infiltrates at a distance from blisters. Moreover, the VPF/VEGF receptors, flt-1 and KDR, were up-regulated in endothelial cells in superficial dermal microvessels. High levels of VPF/VEGF (138-238 pM) were detected in blister fluids obtained from five patients with bullous pemphigoid. Addition of blister fluid to human dermal microvascular endothelial cells exerted a dose-dependent mitogenic effect that was suppressed after depletion of VPF/VEGF by immunoadsorption. These findings strongly suggest that VPF/VEGF plays an important role in the induction of increased microvascular permeability in bullous diseases, leading to papillary edema and fibrin deposition and contributing to the bulla formation characteristic of these disorders.","['Brown LF', 'Harrist TJ', 'Yeo KT', 'Ståhle-Bäckdahl M', 'Jackman RW', 'Berse B', 'Tognazzi K', 'Dvorak HF', 'Detmar M']",1995,104,5,J Invest Dermatol,"Brown LF, et al.

7625796,Pharmacokinetics of dapsone in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.,"Dapsone, administered at various doses and schedules, has been proven to be a safe and effective alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Dapsone is also recommended by the Centers for Disease Control for PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected children. However, the suggested dosage regimen is based upon clinical experience with children with leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis rather than pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data obtained from the target patient population. In order to determine a rational dosage regimen that could be tested in clinical studies aimed at the evaluation of dapsone for the prevention of PCP in HIV-infected children, we studied the pharmacokinetics of dapsone following a 2-mg/kg of body weight oral dose in twelve HIV-positive children aged 9 months to 9 years. Plasma was collected at the following times after dapsone administration: 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The levels of dapsone in plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Data were analyzed by noncompartmental methods. Expressed as means +/- standard deviations (ranges), the pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: peak concentration in plasma, 1.12 +/- 0.48 (0.44 to 1.81) mg/liter; time to peak concentration in plasma, 3.8 +/- 1.3 (2 to 6) h; half-life at elimination phase, 24.2 +/- 7.1 (14.4 to 35.0) h; clearance from plasma divided by bioavailability (CL/F), 1.15 +/- 0.67 (0.37 to 2.63) ml/min/kg; and volume of distribution divided by bioavailability (V/F), 2.25 +/- 1.20 (1.00 to 4.57) liters/kg. Oral CL correlated negatively with age (r = 0.614 and P = 0.034), as did V (r = 0.631 and P = 0.028). As a consequence of the high interindividual variability in growth retardation, pharmacokinetic parameters correlated with measures of body development better than they did with age (e.g., for CL/F to height, r = 0.765 and P = 0.004, and for V/F to height, r = 0.748 and P = 0.005). Since oral CL from plasma and V were positively and highly correlated (r = 0.898 and P = 0.0001), a lower absolute F may be the cause, in part, of higher values for CL/F and V/F in smaller children. The results of this study warrant the testing of a 2-mg/kg dose of dapsone administered twice or thrice weekly to HIV-infected children. The monitoring of drug levels in plasma and dosage adjustment may be necessary for smaller children.","['Gatti G', 'Loy A', 'Casazza R', 'Miletich F', 'Cruciani M', 'Bassetti D']",1995,39,5,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Gatti G, et al.

7872276,Screening for celiac disease: a prospective study on the value of noninvasive tests.,"OBJECTIVE: Celiac disease is frequently diagnosed in patients with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. Therefore, highly sensitive, specific, and simple noninvasive screening tests are needed.
METHODS: This study compared the usefulness of IgG- and IgA-antigliadin antibodies, IgA-endomysial antibodies, and intestinal permeability in diagnosing celiac disease in 102 adult patients with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. In addition, all patients underwent small bowel biopsy as a gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were ultimately diagnosed as having celiac disease because of flat mucosa. Flatulence and signs and symptoms dating back to childhood were more frequent and abdominal pain less frequent (p < 0.05) in celiac disease but were not helpful for screening. IgA-endomysial antibodies showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100%; an altered intestinal permeability had also a 100% sensitivity, but only 55% specificity. IgG- and IgA-antigliadin antibodies' sensitivity (73% and 82%, respectively) and specificity (74% and 83%, respectively) were much lower. Combining the two antigliadin antibodies did not significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the advantage of IgA-endomysial antibodies for screening of celiac disease except in the case of patients with IgA-deficiency or dermatitis herpetiformis. In these patients, the permeability test could improve noninvasive differential diagnosis.","['Vogelsang H', 'Genser D', 'Wyatt J', 'Lochs H', 'Ferenci P', 'Granditsch G', 'Penner E']",1995,90,3,Am J Gastroenterol,"Vogelsang H, et al.

We report about 2 brothers presenting with DH, clinically asymptomatic, without antigliadin serum antibodies (AGA), but positive to the research of antiendomysial (EMA) ones. The biopsy performed by digestive endoscopy showed a complete atrophy of duodenal villi and the diagnosis of CD was confirmed according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) criteria. The diet without gluten caused the DH to recovery and the duodenal villi microscopic aspect to normalize as well. Both the brothers had the same HLA pattern: A1, B8, DR3-DR2, DQw2. Our clinical study suggests that it is very important, especially for the general practitioner, to recognize a DH and in every child presenting with a dermatitis like that it will be mandatory to perform a laboratory research of both AGA and EMA.","['Dodi I', 'Iughetti L', ""de' Angelis GL"", 'Nasi S', 'Cavalli C', 'Cassaro F', 'Malvicini R', 'Ottaviani A']",1995,17,2,Pediatr Med Chir,"Dodi I, et al.

In this study IgM, IgG and IgA rheumatoid factor was measured in 89 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and 22 patients with coeliac disease and compared with 89 normal controls. There was an increased prevalence of elevated IgA rheumatoid factor in the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (13.5%; p = 0.036) and coeliac disease (18.2%; p = 0.078), while no such increase was found for the IgM or IgG rheumatoid factor isotypes.

7888363,Cimetidine improves the therapeutic/toxic ratio of dapsone in patients on chronic dapsone therapy.,"We have previously shown that cimetidine, given concurrently for 2 weeks to patients on chronic dapsone therapy, reduced methaemoglobinaemia by inhibiting the formation of the toxic hydroxylamine metabolite of dapsone. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of this combination on the benefit/toxic ratio of dapsone over a longer period. Eight patients (six dermatitis herpetiformis, one linear IgA disease, one folliculitis decalvans) on long-term dapsone 50-100 mg daily, took cimetidine 1.6 g daily concurrently for 3 months. At 3-weekly intervals, a clinical assessment was made, plasma dapsone and methaemoglobin were measured, and parameters of oxidative haemolysis were monitored. The dapsone level rose from 2298 +/- 849 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) at baseline to 3006 +/- 1131 ng/ml at week 3 of cimetidine (P < 0.01). This rise in plasma dapsone was sustained during cimetidine administration, falling to 2446 +/- 954 ng/ml when cimetidine was stopped (P < 0.02). The methaemoglobin fell from 5.5 +/- 2.2% (mean +/- SD) at baseline to 3.9 +/- 1.1% at week 3 (P < 0.01), and remained low until week 12, when there was a return to baseline values (P < 0.01). The haemoglobin did not change from the baseline of 12.7 +/- 0.3 g/dl (mean +/- SD), and other parameters of haemolysis were unaltered. There was a fall in the visual analogue score for headache (P < 0.05), but this was not associated with any deterioration in control of the skin disorders. Hence, long-term concurrent cimetidine results in increased plasma dapsone levels without increased haemolysis, and is accompanied by reduced methaemoglobinaemia for more than 2 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Rhodes LE', 'Tingle MD', 'Park BK', 'Chu P', 'Verbov JL', 'Friedmann PS']",1995,132,2,Br J Dermatol,"Rhodes LE, et al.

Both monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and patient serum reacted with wheat, rye, barley and oats, the patient serum showing individual variation both in IgA and IgG stainings. A broad reactivity with polypeptides from 30 to 68 kD was, however, typical for patient serum and comparable to the reactivity of two broadly reacting antigliadin MAbs. This kind of broad reactivity of the MAb may suggest that it binds to glutamine-repeating sequences of highly homologous gliadin polypeptides. Glutamine- and proline-containing motifs Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln and Gln-Gln-Gln-Pro are also included in the peptides toxic to the celiac small intestinal mucosa. Our study indicates that the humoral response of the patients may detect similar structures, in oat prolamines as well.

7734038,Absence of gluten-specific T lymphocytes in the skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) is an immunobullous skin disease with an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Withdrawal of gluten from the diet leads to the resolution of both the skin lesions and the enteropathy. A T cell-mediated immune response to gluten has been implicated in the damage to the gut; the possible gluten specificity of the T cell infiltrate in DH skin lesions has not, however, been investigated. T cell lines (TCL) were therefore established from the skin lesions of eight patients with DH by culturing skin fragments for 11-17 days with a medium supplemented with 20 U/ml of IL-2. In three cases, gliadin (fraction of gluten toxic to the DH gut) and irradiated, autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells were also added. The TCL were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, TCR alpha beta and gamma delta expression by indirect immunofluorescence, and their proliferative responses to mitogens and gluten fraction III (a peptic-tryptic digest of gluten) investigated. Of the eight CD3+ TCL, four were predominantly CD4+ (82.1-98.8%), three predominantly CD8+ (92.6-98.6%) and one TCL contained both 87.6% CD4+ and 95.2% CD8+ T cells, a substantial proportion of which were presumably double-labelled CD4+, CD8+ T cells. All eight TCL, which were almost exclusively TCR alpha beta +, proliferated in response to PHA whilst six out of the eight were stimulated by Concanavalin A. None of the TCL proliferated to gluten fraction III alone; however, two TCL showed increased proliferation to the antigen in the presence of exogenous IL-2 or IL-4 (10 U/ml) compared to cytokine alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Baker BS', 'Garioch JJ', 'Bokth S', 'Leonard J', 'Fry L']",1995,8,1,J Autoimmun,"Baker BS, et al.

These are features of early and evolving lesions. We present two cases of clinically typical dermatitis herpetiformis with previously unreported histologic features that may provide a significant diagnostic clue. In each of these cases there were focal collections of nuclear dust in the cornified layer of the epidermis, a finding that may represent a resolving phase of dermatitis herpetiformis, beyond the usual papillary dermal neutrophilic microabscesses seen in early lesions. Biopsy material was available for immunofluorescent studies in one of the cases presented. In addition to the granular pattern of IgA positivity at the dermal-epidermal junction, which is diagnostic of dermatitis herpetiformis, this biopsy also showed similar IgA positivity in the intracorneal nuclear dust aggregates.

8660393,Myeloperoxidase as a generator of drug free radicals.,"Reactive metabolites are believed to be responsible for many types of toxicity, including idiosyncratic drug reactions. Bone marrow is a frequent target of idiosyncratic reactions, and, since these reactions have characteristics that suggest involvement of the immune system, the formation of reactive metabolites by leucocytes could also play a role in the aetiology of idiosyncratic drug reactions. The major oxidation system in neutrophils and monocytes is a combination of NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase. This system oxidizes primary arylamines, such as sulphonamides, to reactive metabolites and these drugs are also associated with a high incidence of agranulocytosis, generalized idiosyncratic reactions and/ or drug-induced lupus. Clozapine is oxidized by this system to a relatively stable nitrenium ion; clozapine is also associated with a high incidence of agranulocytosis. Arylamines that have an oxygen or nitrogen in the para position, such as amodiaquine, vesnarinone and 5-aminosalicylic acid, are oxidized to quinone-like reactive intermediates. Aminopyrine is oxidized to a very reactive dication. Such reactive metabolites could also inhibit neutrophil function and mediate some of the therapeutic effects of these drugs: for example, the use of dapsone for dermatitis herpetiformis and the use of 5-aminosalicylic acid for inflammatory bowel disease.",['Uetrecht JP'],1995,61,,Biochem Soc Symp,Uetrecht JP.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a Japanese DH patient, who showed a fibrillar pattern of deposition of IgA, IgG, IgM and C3. The HLA typing revealed no B8/DR3. The survey of the Japanese literature and the comparison to studies on American or European DH revealed several interesting differences: high frequency of the fibrillar pattern, relatively high incidence of deposits of immunoglobulins other than IgA, rarity of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and HLA-B8/DR3 in Japanese DH.

Monoclonal antibodies and the avidin-biotin peroxidase staining technique were used to stain for T cells and Langerhans cells in skin sections. A significant increase in the number of CD3-positive T cells was observed in the upper dermis of involved compared with uninvolved skin (P < 0.0005). Most of the T cells in involved skin were CD45RO-positive memory cells; CD4-positive T cells exceeded the number of CD8-positive T cells by a ratio of 4:1. In addition, CD1a-positive dendritic cells were observed within the clumps of T cells in involved dermis in nine of the 10 patients, but were absent from the dermis of uninvolved skin. Double immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that approximately 20-40% of the CD3-positive T cells were activated, and expressed the HLA-DR antigen. These findings suggest that activated T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis skin lesions.","['Garioch JJ', 'Baker BS', 'Leonard JN', 'Fry L']",1994,131,6,Br J Dermatol,"Garioch JJ, et al.

7947207,25 years' experience of a gluten-free diet in the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Gluten-free diets have been used in the treatment of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in our department since 1967. Of the 212 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis attending between 1967 and 1992, 133 managed to take the diet, and 78 of these achieved complete control of their rash by diet alone. Of the remaining 55 patients taking a gluten-free diet, all but three were taking partial diets; over half of these patients managed to substantially reduce the dose of medication required. Of the 77 patients taking a normal diet, eight entered spontaneous remission, giving a remission rate of 10%; a further two patients who had been taking gluten-free diets were found to have remitted when they resumed normal diets. Loss of IgA from the skin was observed in 10 of 41 (24%) patients taking strict gluten-free diets. These patients had been taking their diets for an average of 13 years (range 5-24 years), and their rash had been controlled by diet alone for an average of 10 years (range 3-16 years). The advantages of a gluten-free diet in the management of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis are: (i) the need for medication is reduced or abolished; (ii) there is resolution of the enteropathy, and (iii) patients experience a feeling of well-being after commencing the diet. Thus, we propose that a gluten-free diet is the most appropriate treatment for patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Garioch JJ', 'Lewis HM', 'Sargent SA', 'Leonard JN', 'Fry L']",1994,131,4,Br J Dermatol,"Garioch JJ, et al. 25 years' experience of a gluten-free diet in the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis. 25 years' experience of a gluten-free diet in the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis. 1994; 131:541-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.1994.tb08557.x",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7947207/
7868753,T lymphocytes bearing the gamma/delta T-cell receptor in cutaneous lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"T lymphocytes bearing the gamma/delta T-cell receptor are a rare component of normal human GI epithelium and skin. Recently, however, an unusually high percentage of T lymphocytes with gamma/delta receptors has been described in gastrointestinal biopsies from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, implicating the gamma/delta T cell subset in the pathogenesis of this disease. We investigated a possible role for this subset of lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis. Using a standard immunoperoxidase technique, we labelled perilesional skin biopsies from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and other inflammatory dermatoses with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, alpha/beta T cell receptor, gamma/delta T cell receptor, and IL-2 receptor. We found no differences in the percentage of gamma/delta positive T lymphocytes in skin lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis as compared to other selected inflammatory conditions. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis is not mediated through gamma/delta T cells, and that the cutaneous lesions may develop through mechanisms different from those operative in the gastrointestinal tract.","['Kell DL', 'Glusac EJ', 'Smoller BR']",1994,21,5,J Cutan Pathol,"Kell DL, et al.

Laboratory examinations revealed that either more or fewer of the standard number of helper/inducer T lymphocytes (UCHL1+) were observed in the upper dermis in 84.8% of the cases examined, particularly in the various forms of pemphigus; histiocytes (MAC387+) were also found to occur in the upper dermis in 45.5% of the cases and blisters in 27.3% of the cases, particularly in pemphigus erythematosus and dermatitis herpetifomis. In 54.5% of all the cases, both UCHL1+ and MAC387+ cell infiltrates predominated in the upper dermis. These findings suggest that a cell-mediated immune response may also be important in the pathogenesis of bullous skin diseases. It may be possible that antigen from keratinocytes can produce ETAF, and that IL1 activating T lymphocytes and histiocytes also produce IL1 activating T cells, particularly helper/inducer T cells. Such activities would further promote the increase of B cell function and immunoglobulin synthesis.","['Zou MX', 'Chen QJ']",1994,21,10,J Dermatol,Zou MX and Chen QJ.

The disease is traditionally characterized by villous atrophy responsive to gliadin. Recent data suggest that there is an extended spectrum of gluten sensitivity that includes first-degree relatives and patients with latent celiac disease. Genetic studies have identified HLA DQ A1 *0501 B1 *0201 as the predominant HLA gene most tightly linked to this condition. Gliadin-specific T cell clones restricted by DQ have now been identified in the small intestine lamina propria. Such T cells may be important in mediating many of the features of the disease. This review discusses the interrelationship of genetics, cereal chemistry, environmental factors, and immunology involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and explores its relationship with other nutrient-induced enteropathies.","['Goggins M', 'Kelleher D']",1994,89,8 Suppl,Am J Gastroenterol,Goggins M and Kelleher D.

8046318,Subclinical coeliac disease: an anthropometric assessment.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with untreated coeliac disease (CD) according to their pattern of presentation, and the effect of gluten-free diet (GFD) upon nutritional status.
DESIGN: Cohort prospective study.
SETTING: All subjects were seen at the outpatient 'malabsorption' clinic of the Department of Medical Pathology I, University of Bologna (referral centre), Bologna.
SUBJECTS: Eighty consecutive patients with CD (48 with classical and 32 with subclinical presentation), 15 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and 40 healthy volunteers (members of the hospital staff).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The nutritional status was evaluated by anthropometric measurements (percentage of ideal body weight for height and sex, percentage of standard triceps skinfold thickness and percentage of ideal arm-muscle circumference).
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malnutrition in our series of CD patients was 53%. Prevalence of malnutrition (actual body weight less than 90% of the ideal) was significantly higher in classical coeliacs (67%) than in subclinical ones (31%, P < 0.002), in patients with DH (13%, P < 0.0003) and in healthy volunteers (13%, P < 0.0001). At diagnosis, percentage values of ideal body weight, triceps skinfold thickness and arm-muscle circumference were significantly lower (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0002 and P < 0.0003, respectively) in classical coeliacs (84.5 +/- 10.6, 71.2 +/- 28.1 and 87.1 +/- 10.8, respectively) than in subclinical coeliacs (95.5 +/- 9.1, 105.6 +/- 41.0 and 94.8 +/- 10.6, respectively). After GFD, 33% of classical and only 3% of subclinical coeliacs were still malnourished.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of malnutrition in CD is lower than was previously thought. CD patients with classical presentation may require a longer period of GFD to achieve a significant improvement of their nutritional status, with respect to those with subclinical presentation, probably because of a greater extent of intestinal damage. Finally, a careful evaluation of dietary habits is usually sufficient to identify incomplete adherence to GFD as the reason for nonimprovement of the nutritional status in patients with CD.","['Corazza GR', 'Di Sario A', 'Sacco G', 'Zoli G', 'Treggiari EA', 'Brusco G', 'Gasbarrini G']",1994,236,2,J Intern Med,"Corazza GR, et al.

8040334,Reconstitution of cultured intestinal epithelial monolayers with a mucosal-derived T lymphocyte cell line. Modulation of epithelial phenotype dependent on lymphocyte-basolateral membrane apposition.,"In vivo, epithelial cells which line the intestine are intimately associated with lymphocytes, termed intraepithelial lymphocytes. Previous studies have demonstrated that intraepithelial lymphocytes are present in the uninflamed mucosa, and become especially prominent in various human enteropathies including coeliac disease, tropical sprue, dermatitis herpetiformis, and giardiasis. Using the intestinal crypt cell line T84, and a previously well-defined human mucosa-derived lymphocyte (MDL) line with phenotypic features similar to (but not specific for) intraepithelial lymphocytes, we describe a co-culture model to study the functional sequellae of MDL-T84 cell interactions in vitro. A co-culture method was defined which permitted reconstitution of the paracellular spaces of physiologically confluent epithelial monolayers with MDL. Such co-cultures thus mimicked the correct geometry of intraepithelial lymphocytes-epithelial cell interactions. The presence of physiologically positioned MDL brought about specific and dramatic effects on intestinal epithelial monolayer function. In a dose-dependent fashion, the presence of MDL significantly attenuated barrier function (expressed as a decrease in monolayer resistance), decreased epithelial electrogenic Cl- secretion, and modulated epithelial-neutrophil interactions. Such effects were not reproduced in monolayers similarly reconstituted with inert polystyrene beads equivalent in size to MDL. These MDL-elicited effects on epithelial function specifically required direct MDL apposition to the epithelial basolateral membrane. Furthermore, this specific form of MDL-epithelial basolateral contact released soluble factors which were able to confer the MDL-reconstituted phenotype on virgin epithelial monolayers in the absence of MDL. We have previously shown that many aspects of the MDL converted epithelial phenotype described here can be induced by IFN-gamma. While IFN-gamma, a cytokine produced by many lymphocytes including intraepithelial lymphocytes, was detectable in conditioned supernatants from co-cultures, it existed at concentrations insufficient to fully explain the physiologic effects observed here.","['Kaoutzani P', 'Colgan SP', 'Cepek KL', 'Burkard PG', 'Carlson S', 'Delp-Archer C', 'Brenner MB', 'Madara JL']",1994,94,2,J Clin Invest,"Kaoutzani P, et al.

The circulating antibodies (39 patients) and the cutaneous deposits (39 patients) were IgA1 in all 40 patients with linear IgA disease. The cutaneous deposits in dermatitis herpetiformis were also all IgA1, and no circulating antibodies were detected. The controls were all negative. This large series of children and adults with linear IgA disease demonstrates that the circulating and cutaneous basement membrane zone deposits are all IgA1, and suggests that linear IgA disease is an IgA1-mediated disease.","['Wojnarowska F', 'Bhogal BS', 'Black MM']",1994,131,2,Br J Dermatol,"Wojnarowska F, et al.

For each of these 13 patients, 1 or 2 controls with coeliac disease, matched for age, gender, menopausal state, and dermatitis herpetiformis, whose intestinal mucosa had normalized at least 4 years earlier, were identified (n = 17). Bone mineral density was measured in the forearm using single-photon absorptiometry and in the femoral neck and trochanter using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Bone mineral density was reduced at all sites in patients with persistent villous atrophy compared with patients responsive to diet and healthy controls.

8025351,Changing clinical features of coeliac disease.,"The classical clinical picture of coeliac disease includes prolonged diarrhoea with failure to thrive. During the past two decades this type of active presentation of coeliac disease has decreased in many European countries, giving the impression that coeliac disease is a disappearing disease. However, this is not true. The disease can be found in older children with a more or less silent presentation. Silent coeliac disease can be detected by active screening with serological tests. Coeliac disease can be suspected in children suffering from mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, and in those with signs of nutritional deficiencies, as well as in children of first-degree relatives of already diagnosed coeliacs, patients with IgA-deficiency, patients suffering from dental enamel hypoplasia or dermatitis herpetiformis, and patients with some other disease known to be associated with coeliac disease, such as diabetes mellitus. According to the fundamental criteria of coeliac disease, the intestinal mucosa is flat when the individual is eating gluten-containing foods. However, this is not strictly true. Intolerance to gluten is obviously variable and the intestinal mucosa may be normal. This type of latent coeliac disease can be detected by analysing genetic markers, measuring antibodies in intestinal fluid or counting the density of intra-epithelial gamma/delta T cells which are increased greatly even in the latent phase of coeliac disease. Thus the general concept of the natural history of coeliac disease is changing.","['Visakorpi JK', 'Mäki M']",1994,83,395,Acta Paediatr Suppl,Visakorpi JK and Mäki M.

8129413,A novel immune-mediated subepidermal bullous dermatosis characterized by IgG autoantibodies to a lower lamina lucida component.,"BACKGROUND: Immune-mediated subepidermal bullous dermatoses characterized by in vivo-bound linear IgG deposition at the cutaneous basement membrane zone include bullous pemphigoid, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, anti-bullous pemphigoid antigen mucosal pemphigoid, anti-epiligrim mucosal pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and the bullous eruption of systemic lupus erythematosus. In this article, we describe a novel IgG-mediated bullous dermatosis.
OBSERVATIONS: Clinically, a unique nonscarring dermatosis was characterized by the sudden onset of extensive bullae and erosions on mucous membrane and skin, resembling toxic epidermal necrolysis or pemphigus vulgaris. Histologically, the patient's skin lesion demonstrated neutrophilic papillary dermal infiltration and subepidermal blister formation, resembling dermatitis herpetiformis. Immunopathologically, there was linear IgG and C3 deposition at the skin basement membrane zone. The patient responded well to prednisone and azathioprine immunosuppression and has achieved a lasting remission without further therapy. Further immunologic investigations revealed that this unique dermatosis is distinct from all other known IgG-mediated subepidermal bullous dermatoses.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel deep lamina lucida pemphigoid can be distinctly termed anti-p105 pemphigoid on the basis of antigenic specificity of the autoantibodies. Although this novel dermatosis resembles toxic epidermal necrolysis clinically, prudent use of diagnostic immunofluorescence studies can clearly delineate its immunologic nature. Prompt recognition of this unique dermatosis and timely initiation of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy could be life-saving for those patients suffering from this dermatosis.","['Chan LS', 'Cooper KD']",1994,130,3,Arch Dermatol,Chan LS and Cooper KD.

8304761,The genetics of psoriasis.,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Psoriasis is a member of a class of common, HLA-associated conditions in which disease susceptibility appears to be heritable. However, the mode of inheritance of these diseases has been difficult to define in simple mendelian terms. Psoriasis displays one of the strongest HLA associations of this class of diseases. However, only a small fraction of those who carry the implicated HLA susceptibility alleles develop disease, and it has proven difficult to demonstrate that the HLA associations observed are due to formal genetic linkage between the disease and the HLA locus. Although the role of environmental factors in psoriasis and these other diseases cannot be denied, the participation of additional genes, not necessarily linked to HLA, has long been suspected.
OBSERVATIONS: Epidemiologic and immunogenetic data are reviewed and analyzed, which demonstrate that a predisposition to psoriasis is heritable, and which implicate genes of the HLA locus as necessary but not sufficient determinants of psoriasis. Recent developments in human genome research are described, which make possible a systematic search for additional genetic determinants of psoriasis, including those unlinked to HLA.
CONCLUSIONS: As one of the most common, most heritable, and most highly HLA-associated examples of this class of HLA-associated diseases, psoriasis represents an ideal target for the application of this emerging genomic technology.","['Elder JT', 'Nair RP', 'Guo SW', 'Henseler T', 'Christophers E', 'Voorhees JJ']",1994,130,2,Arch Dermatol,"Elder JT, et al.

In this series, of 35 patients who did not have dermatitis herpetiformis, 15 had attended family doctors and hospital outpatient departments for an average of 28 years with unexplained symptoms or abnormalities in blood tests but the diagnosis of coeliac disease had been missed. This is unsatisfactory because these patients can both manage and respond to a gluten free diet. Thirty eight patients complied strictly with the diet with resolution of symptoms. Significant improvement in weight, haemoglobin, albumin, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase values after a year on the diet also occurred. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of coeliac disease in the elderly particularly in patients with non-specific complaints in the presence of unexplained anaemia.","['Hankey GL', 'Holmes GK']",1994,35,1,Gut,Hankey GL and Holmes GK.

DESIGN: Comparison of observed and expected incidence of cancer in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.
SUBJECTS: 976 patients aged 4 to 97 years with no clinical signs of coeliac disease who were admitted to hospital between 1963 and 1983.
SETTING: Data from Swedish Cancer Registry.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and type of cancer.
RESULTS: 106 cancers were diagnosed in 94 patients. The relative risk was 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.7) in male patients and 1.2 (0.8 to 1.7) in female patients. When the individual cancer sites were analysed a significant risk was found only for malignant, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in male patients, with a relative risk of 5.4 (2.2 to 11.1).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of lymphoma is greater in male patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, and this calls for increased surveillance in these patients.","['Sigurgeirsson B', 'Agnarsson BA', 'Lindelöf B']",1994,308,6920,BMJ,"Sigurgeirsson B, et al.

With these 2 cases, 32 cases of DH complicated by lymphoma have now been documented. Reviewing the literature we show that the majority of lymphomas (78.1%) arises from the gastro-intestinal tract and that almost all cases of DH with lymphoma are associated with coeliac disease.

The purpose of this study was to determine if IgA antibodies directed against tissue antigens, which are present in the serum of patients with DH, are also present in the gut secretions of these patients. Serum and gut secretions from 8 patients with DH and 5 control subjects were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for the presence of IgA antireticulin and antiendomysium antibodies. IgA antibodies against reticulin (3 of 8 patients) and endomysium (4 of 8 patients) were found in the serum of patients with DH. IgA antibodies were also present in the gut secretions of all of these patients, but not in subjects (patients with DH and controls) that did not have serum IgA antireticulin or antiendomysium antibodies. The presence of IgA antireticulin and antiendomysium in both the serum and gut secretions of DH patients suggests that these antibodies arise as a result of the mucosal immune response and that IgA of mucosal origin can persist in the serum of patients with DH.","['McCord ML', 'Hall RP']",1994,189 Suppl 1,,Dermatology,McCord ML and Hall RP.

7958021,The immunological features and pathophysiology of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.,"Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is an uncommon but severe and potentially blinding systemic disease. It shares many pathophysiological features with the other bullous skin diseases such as dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris. All of these diseases have circulating antibodies that bind to the basement membrane of mucous membranes. The individual diseases differ by each having a specific component of the basement membrane complex as its antigen. In acute ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, the conjunctiva is infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages, Langerhans cells and CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells while in the chronic disease the conjunctiva is infiltrated mainly by CD8+ T-cells. There is evidence of activation of these T-cells as CD4+ cells as shown by expression of the interleukin-2 receptor and increased expression of major histocompatibility class II antigens within the tissue. The aetiology of the fibrosis is unknown but increased amounts of several fibrogenic growth factors are demonstrable by immunohistochemistry.","['Elder MJ', 'Lightman S']",1994,8 ( Pt 2),,Eye (Lond),Elder MJ and Lightman S.

7914110,Polymorphism of the tumor necrosis factor genes in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"In 18 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) of whom 16 were HLA-DR3 positive and 14 had the HLA-B8, -DR3 haplotype, the frequencies of known mutations of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and TNF-beta genes were investigated using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and the single-strand conformational polymorphism technique. In DH, the phenotype frequency (28%) and allele frequency (0.58) of the rare TNF-beta allele TNFB*1 were significantly increased (normal control 12.4% and 0.37). For the TNF-alpha promoter/enhancer polymorphism, the rare allele TNF2 was more frequent in DH patients (11%, 0.47) compared to controls (2%, 0.16). Since functional studies have associated the rare TNFB*1 and TNF2 alleles with a higher secretion of TNF upon activation in vitro, the predominance of these two 'high-response' TNF alleles in DH patients may represent a genetic basis for the chronic inflammatory response in the skin and mucosal tissues of patients with DH.","['Messer G', 'Kick G', 'Ranki A', 'Koskimies S', 'Reunala T', 'Meurer M']",1994,189 Suppl 1,,Dermatology,"Messer G, et al.

7632006,[Iga linear bullous dermatosis in children. A series of 12 Tunisian patients].,"BACKGROUND: Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) of childhood is one of the chronic, non-hereditary blistering diseases of childhood in which clinical, histologic and therapeutic findings are similar to those associated with bullous pemphigoid (BP) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). LABD, however, can be distinguished from BP of DH by direct immunofluorescence (IF) demonstration of linear IgA deposits along the basement membrane zone (BMZ).
RESULTS: During the period 1984-1993, 12 children with LABD were studied. Their ages ranged from 2 years to 15 years with a mean of 8.5 years. There were 7 males and 5 females. All children had a generalized eruption consisting of large tense blisters arising on normal skin. The blisters were more profuse on the lower trunk, pelvic region and limbs. Face and scalp were also affected. Occasionally, annular blister formation producing a ""rosette"" or ""cluster of jewels"" was found. Pruritus was frequent. Histological features of BP and DH were seen. Direct IF showed linear deposits of IgA at the BMZ in all cases. IgM, IgG, and complement were also seen in 8 cases. Four patients showed IgA BMZ antibodies by indirect IF. There were no symptoms of malabsorption and 3 patients had a mild bowel lesions. HLA studies showed the B8DR3 antigen in 7 of the 10 patients studied. Nine patients were treated with dapsone associated in 3 patients with prednisone. Three patients were controlled on oxacillin.
CONCLUSION: LABD of childhood is a definite clinical entity. It is the most frequent chronic, non hereditary bullous disease of childhood in Tunisia. It is characterized by a self limiting blistering eruption which resembles BP or DH histologically and has a characteristic linear deposits of IgA at the BMZ of the skin. The treatment consisted on dapsone therapy, but 3 patients in our study were well controlled on oxacillin.","['Denguezli M', 'Ben Nejma B', 'Nouira R', 'Korbi S', 'Bardi R', 'Ayed K', 'Essoussi AS', 'Jomaa B']",1994,121,12,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Denguezli M, et al.

8256113,Dermatitis herpetiformis--an autoimmune disease due to cross-reaction between dietary glutenin and dermal elastin?,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), is associated with skin eruptions and granular depositions of IgA in the papillary dermis, but this is not a feature of coeliac disease (CD). The specificity of the IgA in the skin is unknown. High molecular weight glutenin (HMW-g), a component of gluten, has been shown to have structural similarities to human elastin. This paper reports immunoadsorption studies which suggest that human serum may contain antibodies which cross-react with HMW-g and elastin. DH patients had significantly lower levels of IgA antibodies to HMW-g and to elastin than both CD patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, introduction of a gluten-free diet (GFD) was associated with a further reduction in the amount of IgA antibodies to elastin in the DH patients. This diet-associated decrease of elastin antibodies was restricted to the IgA isotype. A significant correlation was observed between IgA antibodies to HMW-g and elastin in healthy controls and CD patients, while no such correlation was found in patients with DH. These findings could indicate that HMW-g induces production of antibodies to elastin, which are deposited in the skin, and that when the antigenic stimulus is removed, these antibodies are further reduced due to continuous dermal deposition. It is postulated that DH may be an autoimmune disease due to cross-reactivity between dietary glutenin and dermal elastin.","['Bödvarsson S', 'Jónsdóttir I', 'Freysdóttir J', 'Leonard JN', 'Fry L', 'Valdimarsson H']",1993,38,6,Scand J Immunol,"Bödvarsson S, et al.

8252813,Extracts of wheat gluten activate complement via the alternative pathway.,"We studied the ability of wheat gluten and its subfractions to activate complement directly. A sensitive sandwich ELISA employing a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to a C9 neoepitope exposed in the terminal complement complex (TCC), a functional haemolytic assay for C5b6 generation, and Laurell's electrophoretic method of estimating C3 conversion to C3bi were used. On a weight-for-weight basis, enzyme solubilized Frazer's fraction three of gluten (FIII) produced approximately 75% of the complement activation seen with the potent activator zymosan. By contrast, activation with whole insoluble undigested gluten was very weak and similar to that seen with ovalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin. The results were the same using normal human serum or sera from patients with coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, or hypogammaglobulinaemia as the complement source. Activation by both zymosan and FIII was blocked in 0.01 M EDTA, but not in 0.01 M EGTA with 0.0025 M magnesium chloride. Zymosan and FIII activated complement in a serum from a patient with an intact alternative pathway but classical pathway haemolytic activity (CH50) of zero. Preferential heat inactivation of the alternative pathway inhibited both zymosan- and FIII-induced activation. Our results confirm that FIII is a strong activator of the alternative pathway.

8245782,Major histocompatibility complex susceptibility genes for dermatitis herpetiformis compared with those for gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) shares some clinical features and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) markers with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). We compared MHC haplotypes in 27 patients with DH, 35 patients with GSE, and normal controls. As in GSE, the frequencies of two extended haplotypes, [HLA-B8, SC01, DR3] and [HLA-B44, FC31, DR7], were increased in patients with DH. Distributions of fragments of extended haplotypes, consisting of some but not all of the elements of complete extended haplotypes, were analyzed to attempt to localize a susceptibility gene. Besides complete extended susceptibility haplotypes, (DR3, DQ2) and (DR7, DQ2) fragments were most common in GSE. In contrast, DH showed only a few such fragments but many instances of the fragment (SC01). The differences in distribution of these fragments in the two diseases were highly significant (P < 0.002). HLA-DQ2 and DR3 had the highest odds ratios for GSE, but the highest odds ratio for DH was for the complotype SC01. These findings suggest that the MHC susceptibility gene for DH is between class II and complotype regions, closest to the complotype, whereas that for GSE is in the class II region.","['Ahmed AR', 'Yunis JJ', 'Marcus-Bagley D', 'Yunis EJ', 'Salazar M', 'Katz AJ', 'Awdeh Z', 'Alper CA']",1993,178,6,J Exp Med,"Ahmed AR, et al.

A set of amplification primers were designed to amplify a 281-bp region between amino acids 95 and 135 encoding the second domain of the DQ beta chain gene. A polymorphism at amino acid 135 was shown to distinguish DR3 and DR7 haplotypes. Two SSO probes were designed to identify amino acid sequences (133-135) RND (DR3-DQ2) and RNG (DR7-DQ2). To establish whether polymorphism existed elsewhere in the second-domain sequence, which could explain the migratory characteristics of the CD-associated DR3-DQ2 beta-chain reported by Roep et al. DQB1 second-domain PCR products were sequenced from the genomic DNA of three CD patients. The results showed that the polymorphism at amino acid 135 distinguishing DR3 and DR7 haplotypes was present in CD, DH patients, or normal controls of the appropriate DR and DQ genotypes by oligonucleotide hybridization. Cloning and sequencing of DQB1 second domains of three CD patients (two DR3,3 and one DR3,7) gave normal sequences expected from their genotypes. No specific polymorphism of DQB1 second domains on CD-associated DR3 haplotypes distinguishes them from normal DR3 haplotypes. We conclude that individuals positive for the DR3,7 genotype have the potential to express a unique trans-encoded heterodimer with enhanced ability to predispose people to CD.","['Hall MA', 'Lanchbury JS', 'Lee JS', 'Welsh KI', 'Ciclitira PJ']",1993,38,4,Hum Immunol,"Hall MA, et al.

It is suggested that immunological cross reactivity between these two peptides may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. As a milder but histologically identical GSE is found in the majority of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), a condition also thought to be caused by dietary gluten, we postulated that AD12 may also be involved in the pathogenesis of DH. To test this we assayed sera from 40 patients with DH and 18 healthy controls for AD12-neutralizing antibodies as evidence of past viral exposure. Detectable AD12 antibodies (titre of 13 or higher) were found in only 15% (6/40) of DH patients, compared with 27.8% (5/18) controls (not significant).

8251346,"Dapsone: modes of action, toxicity and possible strategies for increasing patient tolerance.","Dapsone is useful in the treatment of a number of inflammatory conditions which are characterized by neutrophil infiltration. It is the drug of choice for suppression of the symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, as it inhibits the process by which neutrophils leave the circulation and migrate to lesional sites. It also prevents the tissue destruction normally caused by the neutrophils' respiratory burst. Although dapsone can cause a number of serious idiosyncratic reactions, such as agranulocytosis, tolerance of the drug at higher doses is more usually determined by its haematological side-effects of methaemoglobinaemia and haemolysis. These effects are due entirely to the hepatic N-hydroxylation of dapsone to a hydroxylamine metabolite, some of which escapes from the liver and rapidly enters red cells. Attempts have been made to counteract the haemotoxic effects of the metabolite by the use of antioxidants such as vitamins E and C. Recently, the co-administration of a metabolic inhibitor such as cimetidine has been shown to reduce significantly dapsone-dependent methaemoglobinaemia, without any change in drug efficacy. It remains to be seen if this approach will be adopted clinically, to improve patient tolerance of high dapsone dosage.",['Coleman MD'],1993,129,5,Br J Dermatol,"Coleman MD.

8221479,Why don't we use vitamin E in dermatology?,"OBJECTIVE: To review the possible uses of topical and systemic tocopherols as therapy for skin conditions in light of the widespread use of vitamin E by patients.
DATA SOURCES: Index Medicus was searched for articles published from 1922 (when vitamin E was discovered) to 1966 (the beginning of MEDLINE). MEDLINE was searched for articles in English and French on vitamin E or tocopherol in relation to dermatology. Additional original articles were identified from the reference lists of the review articles.
STUDY SELECTION: Only well-designed controlled studies were accepted; anecdotes and open studies are cited for completeness and as direction for future research.
DATA SYNTHESIS: There was some weak or conflicting evidence that vitamin E is of value in yellow nail syndrome, vibration disease, epidermolysis bullosa, cancer prevention, claudication, cutaneous ulcers, and collagen synthesis and wound healing. It was of no use in atopic dermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, porphyrias and skin damage induced by ultraviolet light.
CONCLUSIONS: After 44 years of research there is still scant proof of vitamin E's effectiveness in treating certain dermatologic conditions.

7504504,The role of cytokines in the generation of skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) into the upper dermis which characterizes the skin lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) has never been satisfactorily explained. This study has shown that lesional skin of patients with DH has increased expression of endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules (ELAM) in the deep dermis, combined with a markedly increased staining for interleukin 8 (IL-8) in the basal epidermal layer. Dendritic cells which stained for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were also observed at the dermo-epidermal junction, and this phenomenon was more pronounced in lesional than in uninvolved DH skin. ELAM, IL-8 and GM-CSF are known to promote infiltration and activation of PMN, and it is suggested that these cytokines may play a key role in the generation of DH lesions.","['Graeber M', 'Baker BS', 'Garioch JJ', 'Valdimarsson H', 'Leonard JN', 'Fry L']",1993,129,5,Br J Dermatol,"Graeber M, et al.

8409534,Identification of a basement membrane zone antigen reactive with circulating IgA antibody in ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.,"Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is a rare vesiculobullous disease characterized by linear deposition of IgG and/or IgA along the basement membrane zone of conjunctival biopsies. This study identifies a tissue antigen detected by ocular cicatricial pemphigoid patient sera. Patient selection was based on the presence of only ocular involvement and a positive direct immunofluorescence of conjunctiva. We evaluated patient and control sera using indirect immunofluorescence of basement membrane zone separated skin, Western blot, and purified antibodies from nitrocellulose and epidermal sheets. Direct immunofluorescence performed on the patients' conjunctival biopsy showed linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane zone in all seven patients, and five of seven also demonstrated deposition of IgG along the basement membrane zone. Indirect immunofluorescence performed on the patients' sera demonstrated linear deposition of IgA along the epidermal side of the basement membrane zone of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-separated skin in all seven patients. IgA titers ranged from 1:20 to 1:80. No IgG was detected. Immunoblots detected IgA binding to a 45-kD antigen in all patients as well as sporadic IgA binding to a number of other proteins. Immunoblots stained with sera from patients did not show reactivity to the 230- or 180-kD bullous pemphigoid antigens or the 97-kD linear IgA bullous dermatosis antigen. Eluting IgA from the 45-kD region and other regions revealed that only antibodies eluted from the 45-kilodalton region bound linearly to the basement membrane on separated skin. Purification of IgA using epidermal sheets confirmed that the antibody responsible for staining on indirect immunofluorescence bound to the 45-kD region on Western blot. Sera from normals and patients with bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis failed to demonstrate basement membrane zone IgA on elution of the 45-kD region. We conclude that these ocular cicatricial pemphigoid sera contain a unique IgA antibody that binds to a 45-kD basement membrane zone antigen.","['Smith EP', 'Taylor TB', 'Meyer LJ', 'Zone JJ']",1993,101,4,J Invest Dermatol,"Smith EP, et al.

8370962,Identification and partial characterization of a novel 105-kDalton lower lamina lucida autoantigen associated with a novel immune-mediated subepidermal blistering disease.,"Certain skin basement membrane components, such as bullous pemphigoid antigens and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen, were discovered as a result of an autoimmune reaction. In this report, we describe a unique lamina lucida determinant associated with a novel immune-mediated subepidermal bullous dermatosis. This unique bullous dermatosis resembled severe toxic epidermal necrolysis clinically. The histologic findings resemble dermatitis herpetiformis. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy detected linear immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C3 deposition at the cutaneous basement membrane zone of lesional and perilesional skin. Direct and indirect immunoelectron microscopy localized the IgG deposits to the lowest portion of the lamina lucida. The patient's autoantibodies, belonging to the IgG1 subclass, labeled basement membrane zone of normal intact human skin, oral mucosa, and conjunctiva, and localized to the dermal side of salt-split normal adult and neonatal human skin, but failed to react with human fetal skin up to 142 gestational days. The patient's autoantibodies failed to react with bullous pemphigoid antigens or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen (type VII collagen) by immunoblotting. Instead, the patient's autoantibodies unequivocally labeled a 105-kilodalton (kD) protein in cellular extracts and conditioned media of human cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. The titer of the patient's antibody against the cutaneous basement membrane zone and the intensity of the antibody reactivity against the 105-kD protein paralleled the patient's disease activity. Thus, this 105-kD lower lamina lucida protein represents a novel autoantigen and this patient's disease represents a novel autoantigen and this patient's disease represents a deep lamina lucida pemphigoid, distinguishable from all other known autoimmune bullous dermatoses.","['Chan LS', 'Fine JD', 'Briggaman RA', 'Woodley DT', 'Hammerberg C', 'Drugge RJ', 'Cooper KD']",1993,101,3,J Invest Dermatol,"Chan LS, et al.

These include pemphigus, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, erythema multiforme, and lichen planus. Although each of these has certain specific characteristics, all may produce bullae, erosions, and ulcers on the oral mucosa, resulting in confusingly similar clinical presentations. With careful clinical, histological, and immunofluorescence examination, it is possible to establish a definitive diagnosis in a high proportion of cases.

7654572,Mortality and cancer incidence in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis: a cohort study.,"One hundred and fifty-two patients in whom a diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis was made at St John's Hospital for Diseases of the Skin, London, during 1950-85, were followed from the date of diagnosis to the end of 1989 for mortality, and from 1971, or the date of diagnosis if later, to 1986 for cancer incidence. Thirty-eight deaths occurred under the age of 85, slightly fewer than expected on the basis of national general population rates [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 61-119]. All-cause mortality was somewhat lower in patients who had followed a gluten-free diet (SMR = 51; 17-120) than in those who had not (SMR = 97; 66-136), but the difference in SMRs was not significant (P = 0.3). Cancer mortality was non-significantly below expectations from national rates (SMR = 72; 31-142), but cancer incidence was significantly increased [standardized registration ratio (SRR) = 394; 180-749]. No particular cancer site accounted for the cancer incidence excess. One death occurred from cancer of the small intestine (SMR = 4953, P = 0.04), and one lymphoma was incident (SRR = 1555, P = 0.12). Increased risks of these malignancies have previously been found to be associated with coeliac disease (which is present in many patients with dermatitis herpetiformis), and with dermatitis herpetiformis, respectively. Mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was significantly below national rates (SMR = 37; 95% CI 12-86), and was similar in patients who had followed a gluten-free diet and those who had not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Swerdlow AJ', 'Whittaker S', 'Carpenter LM', 'English JS']",1993,129,2,Br J Dermatol,"Swerdlow AJ, et al.

The expression of the gamma/delta T-cell receptor in the jejunum of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, coeliac disease, treated and untreated, and controls were studied. Expression of the gamma/delta T-cell receptor was significantly increased in patients with dermatitis hepetiformis (P < 0.0005) and in both untreated (P < 0.0005) and treated coeliac patients (P < 0.05) compared with controls. There were significant correlations between the indices of enteropathy, enterocyte height (P < 0.005) and villous height/crypt depth ratio (P < 0.0001), and expression of the gamma/delta T-cell receptor in the jejunum of all the patients. This argues against the hypothesis that gamma/delta T-cells have a fundamental role in the aetiology of gluten-sensitive enteropathy.

8365036,Dermatitis herpetiformis and linear IgA bullous dermatosis.,"DH is an uncommon vesicular disease of the skin which has attracted great interest because of myriad clinical and laboratory findings believed to be related to its immunopathogenesis. Investigations have centered on its relationship to gluten intake, multisystem disease associations, pathognomonic patterns of IgA deposition, and impressive therapeutic response to gluten restriction and dapsone. However, a coherent theory of pathogenesis has not yet been established. The circulating antibody responsible for the IgA deposition has not yet been identified, and indirect IF is negative. LABD has now been separated from DH on the basis of its unique immunopathologic finding of linear IgA along the cutaneous basement membrane and the presence of circulating IgA anti-basement membrane antibody, which binds to a 97-kD protein found in normal human skin. It has been suggested that CBDC and LABD are expressions of the same disease process in different age groups rather than two distinct disease processes. Supporting evidence for this theory is based on immunopathologic findings. Linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane of perilesional skin is identical to LABD and, in addition, a circulating IgA anti-basement membrane antibody is present in the serum of some patients which binds to the 97-kD antigen described in LABD.","['Smith EP', 'Zone JJ']",1993,11,3,Dermatol Clin,Smith EP and Zone JJ.

8328709,Spectrum of expression of intestinal cellular immunity: proposal for a change in diagnostic criteria of celiac disease.,"The clinical heterogeneity of celiac disease is well recognized, with great variability in malabsorption and in gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with active celiac disease, and the fairly common occurrence of silent celiac disease (ie, an apparently healthy individual with a flat small bowel mucosa). Research in experimental animals has shown that expression of cell-mediated immunity in the gut mucosa occurs in a spectrum of pathologies ranging from minimal enteropathy with a high count of intra-epithelial lymphocytes to the celiac-like lesion with short villi and long crypts. A similar range of pathology is seen in celiac patients in some circumstances, with low grade enteropathy occurring in the early stages of gluten challenge, in patients taking a low gluten diet, and also in some patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. In so-called latent celiac disease, sophisticated immunologic studies may reveal a high intra-epithelial lymphocyte count, an increased gamma delta intra-epithelial lymphocyte count, and a celiac-like intestinal antibody abnormality with overexpression of mucosal IgM responses. If further work confirms that one or more of these features may be the only manifestation of gluten-sensitive disease in some newly presenting patients, the current definition of celiac disease (a flat mucosa, gluten-sensitive) will need to be revised.","['Ferguson A', 'Arranz E', ""O'Mahony S""]",1993,71,1,Ann Allergy,"Ferguson A, et al.

Its frequency in patients referred for jejunal biopsy has been examined.
METHODS: Serum IgG and IgA antigliadin antibody, jejunal fluid IgA and IgM antibodies to gliadin, ovalbumin and beta lactoglobulin, and jejunal fluid IgA and IgM concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Seventeen of 19 celiac patients on normal diet and 16 of 23 on gluten-free diet had the celiaclike antibody pattern, as did 41 of 217 other patients. Jejunal biopsy histology had been classified as normal in 38 of these, with minor abnormalities in 3; however, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) counts were high in 13 cases. Trial of a gluten-free diet produced clinical improvement in 6 of 7 antibody-positive patients. After extra dietary gluten, one developed subtotal villous atrophy.

8466215,Confocal laser scanning microscopic and immunoelectron microscopic studies of the anatomical distribution of fibrillar IgA deposits in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: The fibrillar immunofluorescent pattern of IgA deposition in dermatitis herpetiformis is considered by most authorities to be a variant of the granular IgA pattern. It has been hypothesized that the fibrillar vs the granular pattern is related to longitudinal vs transverse sectioning of affected dermal microfibril bundles. However, direct evidence for this possibility has yet to be presented. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy were performed to determine the anatomical distribution of fibrillar IgA deposits, using skin specimens from a patient with typical fibrillar IgA deposition.
OBSERVATIONS: Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed numerous fibrils stained with anti-IgA extending from the dermoepidermal junction to a depth of 50 to 110 microns in the dermis. They crossed each other at various angles to form a three-dimensional network. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated a diffuse dispersion of immune deposits on the surface of microfibrils of dermal microfibril bundles, with sporadic distribution of small aggregates, 0.1 to 0.3 micron in diameter.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first article to present evidence for the actual distribution of fibrillar IgA. Insofar as the present case is concerned, the distribution of fibrillar IgA is greatly at variance with that indicated in previous reports on granular IgA. However, studies on more cases should be conducted to determine whether this is a distinctive feature of the fibrillar type of IgA deposition.","['Kawana S', 'Segawa A']",1993,129,4,Arch Dermatol,Kawana S and Segawa A.

Diagnostic phase serum samples from 44 children with CD, 16 children with DH and 60 matched controls were studied for serum antibodies to synthetic peptides derived from an early E1b protein of Ad12 and A gliadin.

Our results indicate that IgA-ARA is a reproducible marker, with high positive (99-100%) and negative (100%) prediction values, when it is applied to children who have been on gluten containing diets for a long time (more than six months). The IgA-ARA measurement is not applicable in cases of selective IgA deficiency. Although IgG-ARA has a high predictive positive value, its low predictive negative value makes it a poor diagnostic tool.

1456754,The incidence and prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis in Utah.,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: The incidence and prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis has never been formally evaluated in any area of the United States. Several northern European studies have shown prevalence rates ranging from 1.2 per 100,000 to 39.2 per 100,000. The present study was performed to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis in Utah. Information from 240 patients diagnosed with dermatitis herpetiformis was compiled from hospital records throughout Utah, as well as the sole private dermatopathologist in the state, and from the university referral center of the state. Criteria for inclusion in the study were a clinical diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis plus granular deposition of IgA in dermal papillae by direct immunofluorescence of uninvolved skin, or histopathologic findings consistent with the disease. Clinical diagnosis and response to dapsone alone was considered insufficient for inclusion in the study. On the basis of these criteria, as well as exclusion of non-Utah residents, 188 of the original 240 patients qualified for the study.
RESULTS: The prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis in Utah in 1987 was 11.2 per 100,000. The mean incidence for the years 1978 through 1987 was 0.98 per 100,000 per year. The mean age at onset of symptoms for male patients was 40.1 years, and that for female patients was 36.2 years. The male-female ratio was 1.44:1.
CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first evaluation of the incidence and prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis in the United States. These results are similar to those of the previous studies, probably because of Utah's largely northern European ancestry. This population base, plus a much smaller than average black and Oriental population, is likely to have produced a higher incidence and prevalence in Utah than would be seen in other areas of the United States.","['Smith JB', 'Tulloch JE', 'Meyer LJ', 'Zone JJ']",1992,128,12,Arch Dermatol,"Smith JB, et al.

1444501,Serologic markers of gluten-sensitive enteropathy in bullous diseases.,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized immunologically by the presence of IgA immune deposits in the skin and by the presence of various serum antibodies. Of these, antibodies to gliadin, reticulin, and endomysium have been found to be significant. There are, however, conflicting reports as to the exact specificity and sensitivity of these serologic markers in diagnosing DH. We examined the disease specificity of these three antibody markers in 14 patients with DH, in 98 patients with pemphigus and pemphigoid, and in 26 normal subjects. Reticulin and endomysium antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence and gliadin antibodies by means of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.
RESULTS: Among the various bullous diseases, endomysial and reticulin antibodies were found to be disease specific for DH. Endomysial antibodies occurred in twice the number of DH patients (72%) compared with the occurrence of reticulin antibodies (36%). Antigliadin antibodies were detected in two thirds of DH patients and were not disease specific since increased frequencies of these antibodies were also detected in patients with pemphigus and pemphigoid.
CONCLUSION: These studies support the earlier findings of the high degree of specificity of endomysial antibodies for DH and, thus, help to differentiate DH from other bullous disorders.","['Kumar V', 'Zane H', 'Kaul N']",1992,128,11,Arch Dermatol,"Kumar V, et al.

Of these patients, 71% presented severe intestinal lesions, indistinguishable from those found in coeliac disease (CD). However, there were little other clinical manifestations of this finding since only three children in this group had weight and height < or = P3. Of the remaining children, 18% had moderate intestinal atrophy and 10% had normal mucosa or mucosa with negligible changes. When changed to a gluten free diet, the intestinal lesions subsided, dermic lesions disappeared in 17 patients, improved in 8 others and remained the same in the other three patients that were still on variable diets. A study of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class II showed a total association with Dqw2 and 85% association to DR3, which was identical to the coeliac disease control group. These findings lead one to conclude that HD and CD are different clinical expressions of the same sensitivity to gluten which is associated to an immunological disorder with a common genetic base linked to certain HLA molecules.","['Cuartero BG', 'Santamaría MJ', 'Acuña Quirós MD', 'Martínez Gómez J', 'Romero Portilla M', 'Pedrón Giner C', 'Pérez B', 'Vicario JL', 'García Novo MD']",1992,37,4,An Esp Pediatr,"Cuartero BG, et al.

We have attempted to reduce dapsone-dependent methaemoglobinaemia formation in six dermatitis herpetiformis patients stabilised on dapsone by the co-administration of cimetidine. 2. In comparison with control, i.e. dapsone alone, methaemoglobinaemia due to dapsone fell by 27.3 +/- 6.7% and 26.6 +/- 5.6% the first and second weeks after commencement of cimetidine administration. The normally cyanotic appearance of the patient on the highest dose of dapsone (350 mg day-1), underwent marked improvement. 3. There was a significant increase in the trough plasma concentration of dapsone (2.8 +/- 0.8 x 10(-5)% dose ml-1) at day 21 in the presence of cimetidine compared with control (day 7, 1.9 +/- 0.6 x 10(-5)% dose ml-1, P less than 0.01). During the period of the study, dapsone-mediated control of the dermatitis herpetiformis in all six patients was unchanged. 4. Trough plasma concentrations of monoacetyl dapsone were significantly increased (P less than 0.05) at day 21 (1.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(-5)% dose ml-1) compared with day 7 (1.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(-5)% dose ml-1:control). 5. Over a 12 h period, 20.6 +/- 8.9% (day 0) of a dose of dapsone was detectable in urine as dapsone hydroxylamine. Significantly less dapsone hydroxylamine was recovered from urine at day 14 (15.0 +/- 8.4) in the presence of cimetidine, compared with day 0 (control: P less than 0.05). 6.

1430358,The site of blister formation in dermatitis herpetiformis is within the lamina lucida.,"BACKGROUND: Because the initial neutrophilic infiltrate in dermatitis herpetiformis is within the dermal papillae, most investigators have assumed the vesicles occur in this same area. This was supported by electron microscopy studies. In 1983 Klein et al. refuted this concept, suggesting that vesicle formation was within the lamina lucida above the lamina densa. Despite this study, current literature continues to state that blister formation is below the lamina densa.
OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the ultrastructural site of blister formation in early and late vesicles of dermatitis herpetiformis.
METHODS: We evaluated eight biopsy specimens from four patients by immunomapping with antibodies to bullous pemphigoid antigen, laminin, type IV collagen, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen.
RESULTS: In both early and late vesicles blister formation was found to be above the lamina densa in the lamina lucida.
CONCLUSION: These findings are contrary to the commonly held concept that the blister in dermatitis herpetiformis is below the lamina densa and confirm the findings of Klein et al. that the site of blister formation in dermatitis herpetiformis is above the lamina densa within the lamina lucida.","['Smith JB', 'Taylor TB', 'Zone JJ']",1992,27,2 Pt 1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Smith JB, et al.

METHODS: Serum H pylori IgG antibodies were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and intrinsic factor antibodies by radioimmunoassay in 99 patients with coeliac disease and 58 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis from two geographic areas.
RESULTS: H pylori positivity in patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis increased with age, reaching 50% and 70%, respectively, in patients over 50 years. The percentage H pylori seropositivity in coeliac disease did not differ from the percentage positivity observed in 250 similarly aged blood donors from the same geographic area (Leeds). Seropositivity in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was not significantly different from the level of positivity observed in 98 age matched patients without dermatitis herpetiformis attending the same Edinburgh dermatology clinic. Only one patient with coeliac disease had positive intrinsic factor antibodies. H pylori seropositivity in Edinburgh control subjects under 30 years of age (41.9%) was significantly higher (p less than 0.03) than in Leeds controls (18%) of corresponding age. An increasing prevalence of H pylori seropositivity with age in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis paralleled that of the control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Gastritis in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis is largely caused by H pylori infection at a level that is no different from that of the general population. Any increase in the prevalence of gastritis in these two diseases might be caused by lymphocytic gastritis rather than pernicious anaemia.","['Crabtree JE', ""O'Mahony S"", 'Wyatt JI', 'Heatley RV', 'Vestey JP', 'Howdle PD', 'Rathbone BJ', 'Losowsky MS']",1992,45,7,J Clin Pathol,"Crabtree JE, et al.

1627534,Immunoglobulin and HLA-DP genes contribute to the susceptibility to juvenile dermatitis herpetiformis.,"HLA-DQ genes and gluten diet are the main factors involved in the pathogenesis of Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH), as well as Coeliac Disease (CD). However other genetic factors are probably relevant, since about 10% of the patients with DH and CD lack the DQA1*0501/B1*0201 heterodimer while the majority of individuals presenting this genotype and also being exposed to gluten diets did not suffer from these diseases. To evaluate the role of other genes, 36 Northern Italian children with DH were analysed for DNA polymorphisms at HLA-DP and immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain loci. DPA1*0201 and DPB1*1301 frequencies were higher in patients than in controls (Pc = 0.0357 and Pc = 0.0273). With respect to immunoglobulin heavy chain restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), the 4.6 kb SacI RFLP at the switch alpha 2 gene was more frequent in patients (0.13) than in controls (0.019; Pc = 0.036). Moreover, rare alleles or duplications in the switch regions occurred more frequently in the patients than in the controls. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial inheritance of DH, the HLA and Ig constant heavy chain genes being some of the loci contributing to the susceptibility. In accordance with previous CD studies, these data also confirm that DP subregion is probably involved in the pathogenesis of DH.","['Mazzola G', 'Berrino M', 'Bersanti M', ""D'Alfonso S"", 'Cappello N', 'Bottaro A', 'Curtoni ES', 'Fusco P', 'Vallati M', 'Bundino S']",1992,19,3,Eur J Immunogenet,"Mazzola G, et al.

A significant correlation was found between these antibodies and the severity of gluten-induced jejunum damage. IgA EmA were positive in 19 (86%) of the 22 DH patients with subtotal villous atrophy, in comparison with the positivity of only one (11%) of the nine DH patients with less severe intestinal involvement (partial villous atrophy or mild abnormalities). The specificity of this test for gluten-sensitive enteropathy was 100%, these antibodies being consistently negative in biopsied disease controls showing a normal jejunal mucosa. Moreover, IgA EmA proved to be useful in monitoring the response to gluten withdrawal in DH patients, as these antibodies always disappeared in all the DH cases studied after 1 year of gluten-free diet together with the regrowth of jejunal villi. The strict relationship between IgA EmA and subtotal villous atrophy is more helpful still since the enteropathy present in DH is usually symptomless and therefore difficult to suspect.","['Volta U', 'Molinaro N', 'De Franchis R', 'Forzenigo L', 'Landoni M', 'Fratangelo D', 'Bianchi FB']",1992,14,4,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Volta U, et al.

1600929,Dietary treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Essentially all patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and dermal granular IgA deposits have a gluten-sensitive enteropathy as seen in coeliac disease. A gluten-free diet would normally restore mucosal morphology within months. The dapsone medication required to suppress the skin lesions could be gradually reduced and/or finally discontinued in most patients if they constantly adhere to the diet. The immunological reactions may also be reduced. The gluten-free diet could thus be successful both concerning manifestations from the skin and the gut. Although well known in dermatological literature, diet therapy in DH has attracted little interest in journals of nutrition. A survey of this causal diet therapy for the disease therefore seems appropriate.","['Andersson H', 'Mobacken H']",1992,46,5,Eur J Clin Nutr,Andersson H and Mobacken H.

1528793,[Celiac disease and its diagnostic evolution. Comparisons and experiences in a hospital pediatric department (1975-1992). I].,"The coeliac disease (CD) or gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) is a permanent intolerance to wheat gliadin and to correlated proteins inducing malabsorption and typical damages of the jejunal mucosa (total or subtotal villous atrophy = SVA) in genetically-predisposed individuals (""DQW2""). A large amount of research has been devoted to CD pathogenesis: the most recent studies, thanks to sophisticated and experimental methods, support the pathogenetic immunological theory and the one of direct cytotoxicity. The correct diagnostic procedure for CD, established in 1970 by the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN), suggested three small bowel mucosal biopsies. In the last years, because of the difficulties of such a practice, the necessity of non-invasive diagnostic approaches has developed; such approaches have been verified in absorption tests (one-hour blood xylose, intestinal permeability methods) and in immunogenetic tests (antibodies antigliadin, anti-reticulin, anti-endomysium, anti 90 KD glycoprotein, anti-human jejunum, HLA I/II antigens). The specific MHC antigens establish CD's incidence in several population and in particular situations, as in first-degree relatives and in diseases associated with CD (dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and other auto-immune syndromes). The specific serum antibodies singly used as first level screening if estimated in combination with absorption tests, reach the highest levels of specificity and sensibility in CD diagnosis. It's anyway fundamental the comparison with at least a typical CD histological feature, caused by a challenge with a sufficient gluten to be carried in dubious cases and in non high auxological risk age (ESPGAN 1989). Adolescence is a period of frequent non compliance with a gluten-free diet and of particular psychological and physical problems: the apparent ""gluten insensitivity"", typical of teen-agers and adults, recalls the definitions of silent CD and latent CD (iceberg like). In the first case the jejunal mucosa is abnormal and the symptomatology isn't evident. In latent CD, genetically restricted, the mucosa is normal but there are minimal markers of inappropriate immunity to gliadin (at intestinal humoral immunity level) and a possible worsening of histological lesions to the third stage under environmental stimuli.

1314748,Increased jejunal intraepithelial lymphocytes bearing gamma/delta T-cell receptor in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"T-cell receptor 1 (gamma/delta) expression was studied in 19 jejunal or duodenal specimens from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and in 16 jejunal or duodenal specimens showing normal histology. In normal specimens, gamma/delta+ cells represented 10.8% of intraepithelial CD3+ lymphocytes. Around 50% of these cells were recognized by the A13 monoclonal antibody, which detects products of the V gamma 1/V delta 1 gene rearrangement and the non-disulfide-linked form of T-cell receptor 1. The remaining 50% reacted with the BB3 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes products of the V gamma 9/V delta 2 rearrangement and the disulfide-linked form of receptor. Very few gamma/delta+ cells were observed in the lamina propria. In jejunal specimens from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, a significant increase in the prevalence of gamma/delta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes was observed (P less than 0.001). This finding was largely accounted for by an increase in those cells recognized by the A13 monoclonal antibody, thus possibly expressing the V gamma 1/V delta 1 rearrangement and the nondisulfide-linked form of receptor. These data suggest that similar pathogenetic mechanisms may be active in determining the jejunal damage in celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Vecchi M', 'Crosti L', 'Berti E', 'Agape D', 'Cerri A', 'De Franchis R']",1992,102,5,Gastroenterology,"Vecchi M, et al.

1632135,[Celiac disease in adults: clinical aspects--role of endoscopy].,"Adult coeliac disease has a broad clinical spectrum and remains undetected for years. Among subclinical deficiency states, attributable to coeliac enteropathy, combined iron and folic acid malabsorption is predominant. An unexplained recurrent iron anaemia is an indication for small intestinal biopsy. Gastro-intestinal disorders are present in only 50% of the cases. Coeliac disease is frequently associated with other major histocompatibility complex (MMC)-linked diseases which are mediated by immunological mechanisms: dermatitis herpetiformis, oral ulcerations, IgA nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a useful model for examination of the spectrum of mucosal changes that typify gluten sensitivity and subliminal lesions without villous atrophy. An increased interest is devoted to the intra-epithelial T-lymphocyte population, not only in the small intestine, but at the level of the stomach and the colon. A ""rectal challenge"" test has been proposed for detecting gluten sensitivity in coeliac patients. Such a test could be an original method of screening, reducing so the need of small intestinal biopsy. The preliminary results are to be confirmed. Until now, jejunoscopy remains mandatory for the diagnosis and the survey of intestinal lesions related to coeliac disease.","['Mainguet P', 'Degrez T', 'Jouret A', 'Haot J']",1992,55,2,Acta Gastroenterol Belg,"Mainguet P, et al.

1537512,Association of subepithelial deposition of activated complement and immunoglobulin G and M response to gluten in celiac disease.,"Patients with celiac disease produce not only immunoglobulin A (IgA) but also immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) antibodies to gluten. Intake of dietary gluten may hence induce local complement activation and mucosal damage. Jejunal tissue sections from adult patients with celiac disease were examined by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies to activation neoepitopes in C3b and the terminal complement complex (TCC). Subepithelial deposition of TCC was observed in 93% of 28 untreated and in 57% of 23 partly treated study subjects. The immunofluorescence staining intensity was well correlated with the serum level of gluten-specific IgG and IgM (but not IgA), the number of mucosal IgG-producing cells, and the degree of villous atrophy. Similar immune deposits were not observed in 5 successfully treated patients with celiac disease, 5 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis without jejunal villous atrophy, and 90% of 21 control patients with histologically normal jejunal mucosa. Gluten challenge increased the amount of subepithelial TCC and produced additional C3b deposition, suggesting recent complement activation. Ingested gluten might thus, via Ig-mediated subepithelial complement activation, damage the surface epithelium in celiac disease and induce compensatory crypt hyperplasia.","['Halstensen TS', 'Hvatum M', 'Scott H', 'Fausa O', 'Brandtzaeg P']",1992,102,3,Gastroenterology,"Halstensen TS, et al.

1739299,The protective effect of vitamin E on the hemolysis associated with dapsone treatment in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study looked at whether oral vitamin C and vitamin E would protect the erythrocyte from oxidant damage caused by dapsone in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.
DESIGN: Fifteen consecutive patients with dermatitis herpetiformis taking dapsone therapy received, in addition, 800 U/d of vitamin E for 4 weeks; then 1000 mg of vitamin C per day for 4 weeks, and, finally, combined vitamin E and vitamin C therapy for 4 weeks. Hemolysis indexes were assessed at baseline and after each 4-week period.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the results suggests that oral administration of 800 units of vitamin E daily for 4 weeks confers partial protective effect against dapsone-induced hemolysis in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.
CONCLUSION: Partial protection against dapsone-induced hemolysis by orally administered vitamin E, if confirmed as being clinically relevant by further trials, may allow clinicians to continue dapsone therapy orally in patients who develop significant hemolysis. Prophylactic vitamin E to minimize potential hemolysis at the initiation of dapsone therapy may also be appropriate.","['Prussick R', 'Ali MA', 'Rosenthal D', 'Guyatt G']",1992,128,2,Arch Dermatol,"Prussick R, et al.

1732379,Dapsone suppresses integrin-mediated neutrophil adherence function.,"The anti-inflammatory influence of dapsone may involve suppression of neutrophil chemotaxis to selected attractants, but other actions of the drug are likely also involved. We have discovered that dapsone may suppress migration of neutrophils to extravascular sites through inhibition of adherence functions required for neutrophil recruitment. Neutrophil adherence mediated by integrins (CD11/CD18 or Mac-1 family receptors) was measured in vitro in terms of binding of stimulated cells to albumin-coated wells of microtiter plates, using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) as stimuli. Adherence was assessed by staining attached cells with crystal violet dye and measuring the dye concentration at OD590 using an automated plate reader. The role of integrins in this assay was confirmed by the ability of anti-integrin antibody to suppress stimulated neutrophil adherence. The OD590 value for cells adhering to albumin in the absence of stimulus and dapsone averaged 0.2 +/- 0.04 (SEM) over five experiments. In the presence of 0.1 microM PMA or 10(-6) M FMLP, the OD590 values averaged 0.88 +/- 0.1 and 0.75 +/- 0.12, respectively. Dapsone did not affect unstimulated neutrophil adherence but, when present with stimulus, produced a dose-related inhibitory effect on adherence. Fifty percent inhibitory doses were approximately 150 micrograms/ml dapsone for both stimuli. Sulfapyridine reproduced the inhibitory effect of dapsone, but two structurally related compounds, hydrochlorothiazide and furosamide, did not. The observed ability of dapsone to inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis under agarose to FMLP and interleukin-8 may also be explained by interference with integrin-mediated adherence required for motility in this assay system. To consider if dapsone might have a similar inhibitory influence on neutrophil adherence in vivo, we tested the stimulated adherence function of neutrophils isolated from three individuals on dapsone therapy for dermatitis herpetiformis. Stimulated adherence of patients' cells averaged less than 40 percent of the control value. Suppression of leukocyte integrin function may therefore also contribute to the ability of dapsone to inhibit neutrophil infiltration in neutrophilic dermatoses.","['Booth SA', 'Moody CE', 'Dahl MV', 'Herron MJ', 'Nelson RD']",1992,98,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Booth SA, et al.

Endomysium antibodies from sera of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and with coeliac disease bound in an identical manner in a non-fibrillar material closely associated with fine collagenous-reticulin fibrils and also with similar fibrils connecting smooth muscle cells and elastic tissue in the endomysial connective tissue. These observations suggest that IgA antibodies in sera from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease recognise a common antigen in an amorphous component associated with the reticular connective tissue of oesophageal lamina muscularis mucosae and thus confirm the probable identity of IgA class endomysium and jejunal antibodies.","['Kárpáti S', 'Meurer M', 'Stolz W', 'Bürgin-Wolff A', 'Braun-Falco O', 'Krieg T']",1992,33,2,Gut,"Kárpáti S, et al.

1531801,Increase of lymphocytes bearing the gamma/delta T cell receptor in the jejunum of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The densities of T cells and of cells bearing the T cell receptors gamma/delta and alpha/delta and the surface antigens CD4 and CD8 in jejunal specimens from 21 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were compared with those in specimens from 13 untreated adults with coeliac disease and 13 control subjects. In the lamina propria of the jejunum the median density of gamma/delta+ cells was significantly (p less than 0.001) greater in untreated patients with dermatitis herpetiformis than in control subjects (114 v 36 cells/mm2) and similar to that found in the patients with coeliac disease (115 cells/mm2). The difference in gamma/delta+ cell density between patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and control subjects was much greater in the surface epithelium of the jejunum: the median density for 14 untreated patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was 39 cells/mm, for seven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a gluten free diet 34 cells/mm, and for control subjects 2 cells/mm; the coeliac patients had the same density as the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (45 cells/mm). The higher density of cells bearing the alpha/delta T cell receptor in the epithelium (median 77 cells/mm) of untreated patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was associated with a gluten containing diet; in specimens taken from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a gluten free diet the median density was similar to that in the control subjects (44 v 39 cells/mm). The increase in the number of lymphocytes bearing the T cell receptor gamma/delta, particularly in the epithelium of the jejunum, seems to be a constant marker for these closely related diseases, whereas the density of alpha/delta+ T cells is dependent on the diet.","['Savilahti E', 'Reunala T', 'Mäki M']",1992,33,2,Gut,"Savilahti E, et al.

1737688,Bullous diseases in Malaysia: epidemiology and natural history.,"The characteristics of three primary bullous diseases, pemphigus, pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis, seen in this country, probably reflecting this region, are discussed and compared to those reported in the literature in the West. One hundred and forty-eight patients with bullous diseases were seen over a period of 15 years. The criteria for confirmation of clinical diagnosis were the findings of the direct immunofluorescent test. Pemphigus vulgaris was the commonest bullous disease. The incidence of bullous pemphigoid was highest in the Indians of Malaysian origin, and they are also more likely to develop pemphigus vulgaris than any other ethnic group. Linear IgA type formed the entire group of dermatitis herpetiformis. The granular type was not seen at all. The patients were treated with prednisolone alone or together with methotrexate or azathioprine. Dapsone alone controlled the dermatitis herpetiformis. The known association between pemphigus and other diseases with immunologic disturbances was not found in this study. The natural history of the bullous disease as seen in the follow-up patients is described. Deaths in pemphigus and pemphigoid were more due to either complications of steroid therapy or unassociated diseases than the primary disease itself. Introduction of immunofluorescence as a diagnostic tool in pemphigus and extension of this facility to other bullous diseases has led to detailed characterization of these diseases as seen in the West; however, publications in English dealing with epidemiologic aspects of bullous diseases in this region are rare.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['Adam BA'],1992,31,1,Int J Dermatol,Adam BA.

1728978,Comparison of the intestinal and serum antibody response in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an intensely pruritic, blistering skin disease characterized by cutaneous IgA deposits and an associated, most often asymptomatic, gluten-sensitive enteropathy. When patients with DH are placed on a gluten-free diet both the intestinal abnormality and the cutaneous manifestations of the disease are controlled, suggesting that a mucosal immune response is important in the pathogenesis of DH. Although patients with DH continue to ingest gluten only 40-50% have evidence of an ongoing mucosal immune response in their serum. In order to investigate directly the mucosal immune response in patients with DH the antibody response to dietary antigens was analyzed in intestinal secretions and compared to that found in the serum. Intestinal secretions from six patients with DH and five normal subjects were collected using an intestinal lavage solution and analyzed for total IgA, IgG, IgM, and IgA subclasses, and for IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against the dietary antigens bovine beta-lactoglobulin and gliadin. Intestinal secretions from patients with DH contained more IgA than those from normal subjects (mean total IgA: DH = 2.3 mg/ml; normal subjects (NL) = 0.143 mg/ml, P = 0.017). This increase in IgA in intestinal secretions from patients with DH was composed primarily of IgA1 (intestinal IgA: 86% IgA1, 14% IgA2; NL gut secretions: IgA1 = 54%; IgA2 = 46%). Increased IgA antibodies directed against beta-lactoglobulin and gliadin were detected in gut secretions of two of six patients with DH and in none of the normal subjects. Serum IgA antibodies against beta-lactoglobulin and gliadin were detected only in the two subjects who had detectable IgA antibodies in their intestinal secretions. Serum and intestinal IgA anti-beta-lactoglobulin antibodies had similar isoelectric spectrotypes (pI 5.0-6.5), IgA subclass composition, and antigenic reactivity by immunoblot analysis, demonstrating the close relationship between the serum and intestinal IgA antibodies. These data demonstrate that in patients with DH an ongoing mucosal immune response is present in the gut as evidenced by a significantly increased concentration of IgA, predominately IgA1. The strong correlation between detectable serum and intestinal IgA antibodies against dietary antigens demonstrates that the lack of serum IgA antibodies against dietary antigens in some patients with DH is not due to the presence of ""blocking"" IgA anti-dietary antigen antibodies in intestinal secretions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hall RP', 'McKenzie KD']",1992,62,1 Pt 1,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Hall RP and McKenzie KD.

1314989,HLA-DP region gene polymorphism in primary IgA nephropathy: no association.,"Many features suggest that a genetically mediated abnormality of the IgA immune response is central in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Candidate disease susceptibility genes include those encoding the MHC class II antigens, HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP, and we have recently described an HLA-DQB1 association in IgAN. Polymorphisms of the HLA-DP region loci have been shown to associate with autoimmune diseases which share immunological features with IgAN; coeliac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). We have therefore examined restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of the DP alpha and DP beta chain genes (DPA1 and DPB1 respectively) in IgAN, and have studied three caucasoid populations (North, Mid, Southern Europe) to determine whether ethnic variation in genetic susceptibility exists. DNA was extracted from blood (IgAN, UK n = 89, Italy n = 75, Finland n = 49; Controls, UK n = 99, Italy n = 54, Finland n = 45), and studied by Southern blot hybridization techniques using the restriction enzymes BgI II and Msp I and cDNA 32P-labelled DPA1 and DPB1 probes respectively. The frequency distribution of the DPA1 and DPB1 fragments was similar between the three caucasoid IgAN patient groups compared to their respective controls. There was no association of DPA1 or DPB1 RFLPs with clinical features. These results suggest that HLA-DP region genes are not important in conferring disease susceptibility to IgAN and do not influence clinical disease expression. Moreover, different immunogenetic mechanisms operate in IgAN, CD, and DH.","['Moore RH', 'Hitman GA', 'Medcraft J', 'Sinico RA', 'Mustonen J', 'Lucas EY', ""D'Amico G""]",1992,7,3,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Moore RH, et al.

1764360,"Iron deficiency: structural and microchemical changes in hair, nails, and skin.","Deficiency of nutritional iron represents a public health problem recognized throughout much of the world. The overall prevalence rate of patients with iron deficiency (ID) who need supplementary iron therapy ranges markedly from less than 10% to as high as 70% among various ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Dermatologically, the iron-deficit state can be a secondary condition or trigger a wide range of mucocutaneous alterations. Early appreciation of adverse cutaneous manifestations of ID seems to have commensurate significance not only in predicting the presence of undiagnosed ID, but also for providing specified avenues for rational therapeutic approaches to patients with ID. Dermatopathic anemia has attracted the attention of clinicians because ID was found to be a metabolic consequence of skin diseases such as erythroderma, exfoliative dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, and many others. Previous studies had suggested that iron may be lost in accelerated turnover of the keratinocyte from scaling; currently, malabsorption of iron is accepted implication accounting for dermatopathic anemia. However, mucocutaneous affections adversely manifested by ID have not been extensively reviewed and published in the current dermatologic literature because of the potentially benign course of the adverse conditions and the limited degree of clinical expression. Therefore, changes in hair, nails, mucosa and tongue, pruritus, chronically sustained inflammation, dermatitis herpetiformis, and photodermatitis are among the adverse cutaneous sequelae whose relation to ID are highlighted and discussed in the present review. Because of their clinical and diagnostic importance, other extracutaneous physical signs of ID, such as blue sclerae and pica, are also included in this review.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['Sato S'],1991,10,4,Semin Dermatol,"Sato S.

Several antibody tests are claimed as markers for this condition but a direct comparison of the available tests has not been reported. The probands and healthy first-degree relatives of 42 families with coeliac disease were studied. Histological examination of biopsy specimens revealed jejunal mucosal villous atrophy compatible with coeliac disease in 13 of 122 relatives. Reticulin-antibody-positive relatives with or without jejunal mucosal atrophy were genetically similar to the probands of the families (DR3 gene frequencies 55.3%-60.0%). Gliadin-antibody-positive relatives with normal mucosa were genetically different from the probands (DR3 gene frequency 16.7% versus 55.3%). IgA reticulin and endomysium antibodies detected 92.3% of subjects with silent coeliac disease. The only case that was missed had selective IgA deficiency and was positive for IgG-class reticulin antibodies. By contrast, gliadin antibodies detected only half of the cases. Follow-up of the 7 reticulin-antibody-positive relatives with normal mucosa revealed 2 further cases of coeliac disease and 1 of dermatitis herpetiformis during the next three years. Our family study shows that healthy reticulin-antibody-positive first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients, irrespective of the state of the jejunal mucosa, are genetically similar to known coeliac disease patients.

1919059,Polymorphonuclear leukocyte-induced detachment of cultured epidermal carcinoma cells from the substratum.,"In an in vitro study, intended to develop tumoricidal therapy with the use of human leukocyte, an interesting phenomenon was found. Normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) plated on a cell line established from malignant trichilemmal cyst (DJM-1), a kind of squamous cell carcinoma, in a serum-free media and incubated for 48 h induced the detachment of DJM-1. The detachment was more extensive as the number of PMN increased. The detachment rate was 97.0% when the number of PMN and DJM-1 in a well was in a ratio 2.4:1 and the viability of detached DJM-1 was 96.5%. Two kinds of proteinase inhibitors, especially the inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, fetal bovine serum, and monoclonal anti-laminin antibody inhibited the detachment significantly. Furthermore, when PMN were seeded in a chamber with a filter membrane bottom to prevent direct contact with DJM-1, DJM-1 detachment decreased to 14.2%. In view of these results, the following mechanism was postulated. Activated by their adhesion to DJM-1, especially between laminin receptor on PMN and laminin on DJM-1, PMN secreted proteinases, resulting in DJM-1 detachment. This phenomenon might be an expression of cytotoxicity of PMN to cancer cells, because cultured cancer cells of epithelium origin such as DJM-1 can grow only after they are firmly attached to the substratum. This phenomenon, in turn, may explain the final step in the induction of epidermal-dermal separation in subepidermal bullous diseases with PMN infiltration such as bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis if we could regard DJM-1 as normal keratinocyte.","['Katayama H', 'Kitagawa S', 'Masuyama J', 'Yaoita H']",1991,97,5,J Invest Dermatol,"Katayama H, et al.

1919044,Molecular analysis of HLA DP and DQ genes associated with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"HLA class II DQ and DP genes from dermatitis herpetiformis patients were amplified and analyzed using molecular probes and compared to those from celiac disease patients and to an HLA and ethnically matched control group. In dermatitis herpetiformis, as in celiac disease, the strongest association of disease was with the DQ subregion alleles DQB1*0201 and DQA1*0501 that are linked to the DRB1*0301 allele. DQB1*0201 determines the DQw2 serologic marker whereas DRB1*0301 determines the DRw17 serologic marker (formerly termed DR3). A DP subregion allele DPB1*0301 was increased and a constellation of DPB1 alleles that included DPB1*0202, *0901, and *1301 was decreased in dermatitis herpetiformis. DPB1*0101, an allele reported to be increased in celiac disease, was not increased in dermatitis herpetiformis. DP beta chains that lack a negatively charged amino acid residue at position 69 of the DP beta chain are significantly over-represented both in dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease patients with the DRw17, DQw2 haplotype, compared to healthy controls with that haplotype. These data favor a multigenic model for the contribution of HLA class II D region genes to dermatitis herpetiformis susceptibility. Further, they indicate that a specific DQ molecule, when present in combination with the product of one of several different DPB1 alleles, may contribute to susceptibility to the intestinal lesion, which is common to dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease.","['Fronek Z', 'Cheung MM', 'Hanbury AM', 'Kagnoff MF']",1991,97,5,J Invest Dermatol,"Fronek Z, et al.

In this case-referent study 105 cases of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis were compared with 237 referents from the general population by means of a mail inquiry regarding exposure to various environmental factors. Increased odds ratios were obtained with exposure to various farm animals and more clearly for cotton dust, although numbers were few. Animal husbandry in Sweden invariably means heavy exposure to organic dust. The fact that comparatively few persons reported dust exposure may be of doubtful validity in view of the high frequency of exposure to farm animals reported by the cases.","['Axmacher B', 'Axelson O', 'Frödin T', 'Gotthard R', 'Hed J', 'Molin L', 'Brage HN', 'Ström M']",1991,48,10,Br J Ind Med,"Axmacher B, et al.

Vulvar ulcers can occur in dermatoses resulting from systemic disease (Behçet's syndrome, lupus, pellagra, and Reiter's disease) or malignancies resembling dermatoses (extramammary Paget's disease, squamous cell carcinoma, and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia). Many vulvar dermatoses itch or burn. Vulvodynia occurs with irritant and allergic dermatitis, vulvar dermatoses, complications of steroid use, candidiasis, papillomatosis, vestibulitis, or essential (dysesthetic) vulvodynia. Diagnostic tests (potassium hydroxide, cultures, and biopsy) should establish the diagnosis and therapy should be specific.

1931573,Immunogenetics of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a pruritic, papulovesicular skin disease characterized in part by the presence of granular deposits of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction, an associated gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE), and a strong association with specific human histocompatibility leukocyte antigens (HLA). Initial investigations revealed that 60% to 70% of patients with DH expressed the HLA antigen B8 (normal subjects = 21%). Further investigation of the HLA associations seen in patients with DH has revealed an even higher frequency of the HLA class II antigens HLA-DR3 (DH = 95%; normal = 23%), HLA-DQw2 (DH = 100%; normal = 40%), and HLA-DPw1 (DH = 42%; normal = 11%). Analysis of the genetic linkage of HLA antigens has revealed that the strongest HLA association in patients with DH is with the HLA class II antigens DR3 and DQw2. This article will discuss current studies regarding the role of HLA associations and DH and the role this strong HLA association may play in the pathophysiology of DH.","['Hall RP', 'Otley C']",1991,10,3,Semin Dermatol,Hall RP and Otley C.

1875055,Soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"To determine the role of T-cell activation in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), soluble IL-2R levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the sera of 30 patients with DH. Levels of this shed receptor are considered to be a measure of in vivo T-lymphocyte activation, and are elevated in the sera of many patients with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Fifteen of the thirty (50%) patients with DH had elevated levels of soluble IL-2R compared to one of 31 (3%) healthy HLA-B8 or HLA-DR3 control subjects (p less than 0.00001) and one of 10 (10%) healthy non-HLA-B8/-DR3 subjects (p less than 0.0018). In addition, the mean soluble IL-2R level in the patients with DH (744 +/- 381 U/ml) was also significantly higher than that seen in 31 healthy HLA B8 or HLA DR3 individuals (388 +/- 160 U/ml, p = 0.0001) and 10 healthy non-HLA-B8/DR3 individuals (397 +/- 201 U/ml, p = 0.002). Only two of the 30 patients with DH had active skin lesions at the time of serum sampling, one of whom had elevated levels of IL-2R. Measurement of soluble IL-2R levels in sequential serum samples, available in four patients with DH at times of active and inactive skin disease, demonstrated a temporal association between soluble IL-2R level elevations and active skin disease in two patients and no association in two patients. In one patient a marked elevation in soluble IL-2R levels occurred with the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, which decreased by 14% with institution of a gluten-free diet. In order to determine if soluble IL-2R levels are related to the mucosal immune response, the IL-2R levels were compared to the level of IgA antibodies directed against the dietary antigen beta-lactoglobulin. Ten of eleven (91%) patients with circulating IgA anti-beta lactoglobulin antibodies were also found to have elevated levels of IL-2R. In contrast, in the patients with no detectable IgA anti-beta lactoglobulin antibodies, only four of 16 (25%) had elevated levels of IL-2R (p = 0.001). Because IL-2R levels are not related to activity of the skin disease in patients with DH but are associated with the presence of IgA antibodies against the dietary antigen beta-lactoglobulin, these results suggest that some of the T-cell activation commonly present in DH reflects an ongoing immune response in the gastrointestinal tract.","['Ward MM', 'Pisetsky DS', 'Hall RP']",1991,97,3,J Invest Dermatol,"Ward MM, et al.

2071933,The effect of an elemental diet with and without gluten on disease activity in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Elemental diets are reported to decrease activity of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. We tested the hypothesis that gluten, given in addition to an elemental diet, is responsible for the intestinal abnormalities, cutaneous immunoreactant deposition, and skin disease activity in dermatitis herpetiformis. At entry eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, who were consuming unrestricted diets, were stabilized on their suppressive medications at dosage levels that allowed individual lesions to erupt. Six patients were then given an elemental diet plus 30 of gluten for 2 weeks, followed by the elemental diet alone for 2 weeks. Conversely, two patients received an elemental diet alone for 2 weeks followed by an elemental diet plus gluten during the final 2 weeks. Small bowel biopsies, skin biopsies, and clinical assessments were done at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. Suppressive medication dose requirement decreased over the 4 weeks by a mean of 66%. Six of eight subjects significantly improved clinically during the gluten-challenge phase of the elemental diet and all were improved at the end of the study. The amount of IgA in perilesional skin did not change significantly, but the amount of C3 increased in five of seven evaluable subjects after gluten challenge. Circulating anti-gluten and anti-endomysial antibodies were not significantly affected by the diets. All subjects completing evaluable small bowel biopsies (seven of seven) demonstrated worsening of their villus architecture (by scanning electron microscopy and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts) during gluten challenge and improvement (six of six subjects) after 2 weeks of elemental dietary intake. We conclude that 1) there is a significant improvement in clinical disease activity on an elemental diet, independent of gluten administration, 2) small bowel morphology improves rapidly on an elemental diet, and 3) complement deposition but neither IgA deposition nor circulating antibody levels correlate with gluten intake. It seems likely that dietary factors other than gluten are important in the pathogenesis of the skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Kadunce DP', 'McMurry MP', 'Avots-Avotins A', 'Chandler JP', 'Meyer LJ', 'Zone JJ']",1991,97,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Kadunce DP, et al.

1885069,Fc receptor function and circulating immune complexes in gluten sensitive enteropathy--possible significance of serum IgA.,"The capacity to clear IgG containing immune complexes from the circulation was studied in patients with coeliac disease (n = 13), dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 8), and coeliac disease with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (n = 4). A small group of patients with active ulcerative colitis (n = 4) was included as a bowel disease control group. Clearance was estimated by measuring the disappearance rate of a bolus dose of intravenously injected IgG coated autologous erythrocytes. The mean T1/2 of clearance was prolonged in both coeliac disease (86 (24) minutes) and dermatitis herpetiformis (111 (35) minutes), compared with healthy subjects (20 (5) minutes) and coeliac patients with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (T1/2 = 17 (6) minutes). Patients with ulcerative colitis had a prolonged clearance, with a T1/2 of 195 (63) minutes. Values of circulating immune complexes were measured by four assays; C1q binding and C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes. C1q binding immune complexes were detected only in IgA deficient gluten sensitive enteropathy. Patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis had higher values of C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes than control subjects and serum IgA deficient patients with coeliac disease. The clearance rate was inversely correlated to the amount of immune complexes for the subgroups of gluten sensitive enteropathy.","['Lavö B', 'Nilsson B', 'Lööf L', 'Nilsson UR', 'Ekdahl KN']",1991,32,8,Gut,"Lavö B, et al.

1677025,DNA sequence analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of the HLA-DQw2 alleles associated with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering autoimmune skin disease associated with a 95-100% incidence of the HLA class II antigen HLA-DQw2. Although the precise role of this antigen in the pathogenesis of DH is unclear, one theory proposes that patients with DH possess a molecularly unique subtype of the HLA-DQw2 antigen that causes immune abnormalities eventuating in the clinical manifestations of DH. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA sequence analysis on the highly polymorphic HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 loci of eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. All DQB1 alleles sequenced were identical to the previously described HLA-DQB*0201 allele from HLA-DQw2 normal subjects. In addition, DQA1 alleles sequenced were identical to those alleles previously associated with HLA-DQw2 (DQA*0201, DQA*0501). These data document that although HLA-DQw2 appears to be a necessary element in the pathogenesis of DH, the development of DH is not dependent on the presence of a unique HLA-DQw2 antigen. HLA-DQ allelic typing by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 fragments was also performed in ten patients with DH to determine the allelic distribution among both HLA-DR3 (eight patients) and non-DR3 (two patients) DH patients. At the HLA-DQ beta chain locus, all patients possessed the DQB1*0201 allele. At the HLA-DQ alpha chain locus, all HLA-DR3 patients and one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0501 allele, whereas one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0201 allele. These data document that patients with DH do not express a unique HLA-DQw2 heterodimer, that the HLA-DQw2 molecules present in patients with DH have no DNA sequence differences from those found in normal HLA-DQw2 subjects and therefore that susceptibility to DH is not due to a unique HLA-DQw2 molecule.","['Otley CC', 'Wenstrup RJ', 'Hall RP']",1991,97,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Otley CC, et al.

Except for the difference in immunofluorescence (IMF) there were no definite clinical, histological or therapeutic differences between the two groups. All the children were Africans with the exception of one Indian girl. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 12 years with a mean of 5 years. The females outnumbered the males in a ratio of 3:2. All children had a generalized eruption consisting of large tense blisters arising on normal skin. The blisters were more profuse on the lower trunk, pelvic region and limbs. Face and scalp were also affected. Histological features of BP and DH were seen. Direct IMF in the CBDC patients showed linear deposits of IgA at the basement membrane zone (BMZ) while linear deposits of IgG were seen in the BP group. Complement and IgM were also seen in some cases in both groups. Sixty per cent of the CBDC patients showed IgA BMZ antibodies by indirect IMF. There were no symptoms or signs of malabsorption. Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal. HLA studies showed the B-8 antigen in five of the 20 patients studied. Therapy was difficult in most cases.

1674926,HLA association with dermatitis herpetiformis is accounted for by a cis or transassociated DQ heterodimer.,"HLA-DR, DQ, and DP restriction fragment genotyping was undertaken in 23 dermatitis herpetiformis patients and 53 healthy control subjects. HLA-DQw2 was present in 100% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (23 of 23) versus 40% of control subjects (21 of 53). Significant secondary associations occurred with HLA-DR3 (91% of patients versus 28% of control subjects) and DPw1 (39% of patients versus 11% of control subjects). Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease thus share an identical HLA class II association. It is likely that HLA class II genes directly influence the immune responses leading to mucosal damage in both diseases. The strongest candidate for disease susceptibility to dermatitis herpetiformis is DQw2. The HLA molecule most likely to be involved in coeliac disease is a specific DQ alpha/DQ beta heterodimer, encoded in cis arrangement in DR3 haplotypes or in trans arrangement in a DR5, 7 genotype. Our data on dermatitis herpetiformis patients fits this model perfectly. All these patients are capable of expressing this molecule, which may be responsible for the gluten sensitive enteropathy seen in a subgroup of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease.","['Hall MA', 'Lanchbury JS', 'Bolsover WJ', 'Welsh KI', 'Ciclitira PJ']",1991,32,5,Gut,"Hall MA, et al.

2026337,Small intestinal function and dietary status in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Small intestinal morphology and function were assessed in 82 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, 51 of whom were taking a normal diet and 31 a gluten free diet. Methods used were histopathological evaluation of jejunal mucosal biopsy specimens, quantitation of intraepithelial lymphocytes, cellobiose/mannitol permeability test, tissue disaccharidase values, serum antigliadin antibodies, and formal assessment of dietary gluten content by a dietician. There was no correlation between dietary gluten intake and the degree of enteropathy in the 51 patients taking a normal diet, whereas biopsy specimens were normal in 24 of the 31 patients on a gluten free diet, all previously having been abnormal. Eighteen patients on gluten containing diets had normal jejunal histology and in seven of these all tests of small intestinal morphology and function were entirely normal. Intestinal permeability was abnormal and serum antigliadin antibodies were present in most patients with enteropathy. Studies of acid secretion in seven patients showed that hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria did not lead to abnormal permeability in the absence of enteropathy. This study shows that a combination of objective tests of small intestinal architecture and function will detect abnormalities in most dermatitis herpetiformis patients, including some with histologically normal jejunal biopsy specimens. Nevertheless there is a small group in whom all conventional intestinal investigations are entirely normal.","['Gawkrodger DJ', 'McDonald C', ""O'Mahony S"", 'Ferguson A']",1991,32,4,Gut,"Gawkrodger DJ, et al.

1994137,Immunodermatology update: the immunologically mediated vesiculobullous diseases.,"Before a specific diagnosis of an immunologically mediated blistering disease can be made, the clinical and histologic features and the results of direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies (with use of multiple substrates in some cases) must be assessed. For both subepidermal and intraepidermal groups of blistering diseases, direct immunofluorescence testing of perilesional tissue is critical for diagnosis. For these conditions, indirect immunofluorescence testing of serum is important for diagnosis and has a role in management of selected diseases. In dermatitis herpetiformis, indirect testing of serum for IgA antiendomysial antibodies is useful for both diagnosis and management. Indirect testing of serum for IgG antibodies to intercellular substance is important for diagnosis and, in conjunction with the clinical findings, can be used as a guide for monitoring disease activity in patients with pemphigus. Immunoelectron microscopy, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting studies have identified the sites of immune deposits and the specific antigens in most of the immunologically mediated bullous diseases. From a practical standpoint, however, direct and indirect immunofluorescence testing, in conjunction with clinical and histologic evaluations, is a simple, rapid, and relatively inexpensive tool for diagnosis and management.","['Helm KF', 'Peters MS']",1991,66,2,Mayo Clin Proc,Helm KF and Peters MS.

1899445,Extracellular binding sites of IgA anti-jejunal antibodies on normal small bowel detected by indirect immunoelectronmicroscopy.,"Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have IgA deposition in the papillary dermis and in the lamina propria of the small bowel. In addition, most of DH patients' sera contain IgA class anti-reticulin antibodies, anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA), and anti-jejunal antibodies (JAB) during times of gluten intake. In previous studies, JAB and EMA seemed to be identical and related to the group of anti-reticulin antibodies. In the present study, pre-embedding en bloc immunoelectronmicroscopic methods were applied for analysis of the ultrastructural binding sites of JAB on monkey and rabbit small bowels. These substrates were incubated with sera from DH patients strongly positive for JAB. Simultaneous investigations with the PAP technique and with 5 nm gold-labeled protein A or second antibodies visualized the bound IgA identically: it was associated with collagen fibrils underlying the epithelial and cryptal basement membranes and with collagen fibrils around capillaries. Staining was also detected along the endomysial collagen fibrils of smooth muscle layers, around elastica and smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls, and along collagen fibrils near smooth muscle cells in the lamina propria. Neither the peroxidase product nor gold deposition was detected directly on the fibers, but was associated with amorphous material surrounding collagen fibers of different diameters. The distribution of JAB-stained structures corresponded to the localization of reticulin network of the small bowel. Our data indicate that JAB recognize an antigen or antigens associated with an amorphous component of the reticulin-collagen structure of jejunum and may have identical binding sites, as anti-reticulin antibodies and EMA.","['Kárpáti S', 'Stolz W', 'Meurer M', 'Krieg T', 'Braun-Falco O']",1991,96,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Kárpáti S, et al.

The dermatoses were: dermatitis herpetiformis, lichen ruber planus, chronic eczema, atopic eczema, neurodermatitis circumscriptus, prurico psychogenous and lichen obtusus corneus. Both psychiatric and dermatological examinations were performed. Psychiatric disturbance was clearly greater than in the average population. The chronifying mechanisms were the following: personality disorder as a treatment problem; emotional infantility, which makes the illness itself an important security factor; itching and scratching as pleasure and content of life; the accumulation of various other diseases, both somatic and psychiatric; and untreated depression.

1993147,Induction of lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis by autologous serum.,"In the present study various factors which contribute to the initiation of lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) were examined. Thirty-one patients with DH, seven with bullous pemphigoid, two with linear IgA disease and two healthy subjects were studied either before starting treatment or after stopping dapsone for up to 5 days. Intradermal inoculation of freshly prepared autologous serum was followed after 18-24 h by the formation of DH-like lesions in 24/31 DH patients. The lesions were erythematous papules, often with vesicles and microscopically showed papillary tip microabscesses. Serum-induced formation of lesions only occurred in patients with active DH with some spontaneous lesion formation: it did not occur in any of the non-DH controls. The formation of lesions was dose-related, declining proportionately with dilution of the serum down to 1/16. Plasma prepared by various methods of anticoagulation (heparin, citrate, EDTA) caused lesser reactions, while addition of heparin or epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA), but not citrate, to serum substantially inhibited the formation of lesions. This suggested the responsible factor might be a protease. Other vasoactive agents including histamine (1-4 micrograms) and compound 48/80 (1-5 micrograms) caused normal immediate wealing. DH-like lesions occurred in only one of 13 subjects challenged with histamine and two of nine challenged with 48/80. In all these, autologous serum elicited large vesicular responses. There is a factor(s) in serum in DH which can initiate the formation of lesions. This factor appears to be activated by clotting and can be inhibited by heparin and EACA, suggesting it may be a protease.","['Cox NH', 'Friedmann PS']",1991,124,1,Br J Dermatol,Cox NH and Friedmann PS.

The study included 19 lepromatous (LL), 19 borderline lepromatous (BL), and five borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy patients and involved 25 healthy volunteers, 10 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and eight with Duhring disease.

Moreover, the PCT of the leprosy patients without any intraocular involvement was higher than in the controls. These results show that in the ophthalmic examination of leprosy patients without any symptoms the fact that autonomic nerve system of the eye is affected by the leprosy can often be determined by measuring the PCT.","['Karaçorlu MA', 'Sürel Z', 'Cakiner T', 'Hanyaloğlu E', 'Saylan T', 'Mat C']",1991,75,1,Br J Ophthalmol,"Karaçorlu MA, et al.

1987301,IgA-binding structures in dermatitis herpetiformis skin are independent of elastic-microfibrillar bundles.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized in part by the presence of granular deposits of IgA in the papillary dermis just beneath the dermal-epidermal junction. The nature of the structures to which IgA binds in DH skin, however, has not been clearly demonstrated. Previous immunoelectron-microscopy studies using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique have concluded that the IgA may bind to abnormal elastic microfibrillar bundles. Recently, antibodies have been developed against a major component of the elastic microfibril bundles, fibrillin. In addition, another dermal matrix protein, hexabrachion, has been characterized and found in normal human skin in a distribution similar to the IgA deposits of DH. Utilizing antibodies against fibrillin, hexabrachion, and human IgA and immunoelectronmicroscopy with immunogold staining techniques, we have examined the skin from patients with DH in order to localize the IgA deposits. Normal-appearing skin from five patients with DH exhibited electron-dense patches within the dermis, which were not seen in skin from normal subjects. These structures were sometimes adjacent to the basement membrane zone, but appeared amorphous and without a well-defined fibrillar structure. The electron-dense patches were labeled with anti-human IgA, but not with antibodies to fibrillin or hexabrachion. The anti-IgA antibody did not label the normal basement membrane. These studies confirm the presence of abnormal electron-dense, amorphous structures in the skin of patients with DH. Due to this lack of association with the elastic microfibril bundles and the lack of labeling with antibodies against fibrillin, we suggest that these deposits are distinct from the microfibrillar bundles of elastic tissue and may represent IgA bound to degraded basement membrane or isolated dermal deposits of IgA.","['Lightner VA', 'Sakai LY', 'Hall RP']",1991,96,1,J Invest Dermatol,"Lightner VA, et al.

2090932,Dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten sensitive enteropathy (including celiac disease)--increased subepithelial extracellular matrix viscosity due to gliadin.,"It is now firmly established that dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is associated with gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE), although the GSE of DH is generally milder than that form which occurs in celiac disease. The toxic fraction of gluten is in the gliadin, a protein fraction. Gliadin is absorbed in GSE and antigliadin antibodies are present in both DH and celiac disease. There is a question of a cross reactivity between reticulin and gliadin. Gliadin is reported to bind to reticulin. Reticulin has a glycosaminoglycan component. Fibronectin, another component of ground substance, also binds to reticulin. Reticulin and fibronectin are important in basement membrane areas and play a role in basement membrane attachment. Gluten may also exert a lectin effect on gastrointestinal mucosa which contributes to the underlying extracellular matrix. DH and GSE have different pathologies because of their different anatomical sites. The pathomechanisms of both diseases can be explained by one mechanism. Gliadin, or a peptide fraction from it, enters or combines with the extracellular matrix and increases tissue viscosity. The protein fraction of glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix is known to control viscosity. In DH the increased extracellular matrix viscosity would interfere with the diffusion of tissue fluid in the dermal papillae and leads to vesicle formation. The intestinal villi serve a very different function. In GSE the increased extracellular matrix viscosity would decrease adsorption from the intestinal tract producing villi with less volume (shortened or atrophic). The shortened villi decrease the production of digestive enzymes and the absorptive surface. The decreased movement of nutrient tissue fluid supplied to the intestinal epithelial cells also eliminates the microvilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['Stone OJ'],1990,33,4,Med Hypotheses,Stone OJ.

The previously reported 11 cases showing similar direct IF findings, as well as our two patients, illustrate the main differences between IgA-pemphigus and classic forms of this condition: (a) different clinical manifestations with the absence of Nikolsky's sign; (b) scanty acantholysis; an abundance of neutrophils, with occasional neutrophilic spongiosis; (c) absence of C3 on direct IF; (d) the lower sensitivity of indirect IF and low levels of circulating antibodies; (e) the relatively benign course of the disease; (f) the apparent responsiveness to sulphones in many cases. It is suggested that IgA pemphigus should be considered as an entity separate from, but closely related to, classic pemphigus.","['Hodak E', 'David M', 'Ingber A', 'Rotem A', 'Hazaz B', 'Shamai-Lubovitz O', 'Sandbank M']",1990,15,6,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Hodak E, et al.

2241200,Dermatitis herpetiformis bodies. Ultrastructural study on the skin of patients using direct preembedding immunogold labeling.,"Skin samples from three adult patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and granular IgA deposits in the papillary tips were studied using ultrastructural immunogold technique. IgA positive, so-called DH bodies were identified as amorphous clumps--most probably immunocomplex aggregates--scattered throughout the upper papillary dermis. Dermatitis herpetiformis bodies were seen underneath the basement membrane, sometimes along microfibrillar bundles, as well as adjacent to the papillary collagen fibers and within the surface (microfibrillar) region of elastic tissue. Some DH bodies, however, were not related to any fibrillar components. The collagen and elastic fibers, microfibrillar bundles, anchoring fibrils, and elastic microfibrils themselves were unlabeled. Dermatitis herpetiformis bodies were not found in normal human skin. The results of our ultrastructural study indicate that DH bodies either are bound to a nonfibrillar component of dermal connective tissue or represent deposits of immune complexes trapped in DH skin.","['Kárpáti S', 'Meurer M', 'Stolz W', 'Schrallhammer K', 'Krieg T', 'Braun-Falco O']",1990,126,11,Arch Dermatol,"Kárpáti S, et al.

2249367,Dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The state of our understanding of the pathogenesis of DH relies on the integration of several key characteristics: (1) a high frequency of the HLA antigens HLA-B8, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DQw2, (2) an associated GSE, (3) the resolution of both the skin lesions and gut abnormalities in response to a gluten-free diet, and (4) the presence of granular deposits of IgA in normal and perilesional skin. The role of the HLA class II antigens expressed in patients with DH most likely relates to the afferent or initiating arm of the immune system. The association of the HLA-A1, -B8, -DR3, -DQw2 haplotype with Sjogren's syndrome, chronic hepatitis, Graves' disease, and other presumably immunologically mediated diseases, as well as the evidence that some normal HLA-B8, -DR3 individuals have an abnormal in vitro lymphocyte response to wheat protein and mitogens and have abnormal Fc-IgG receptor-mediated functions, suggests that this HLA haplotype or genes linked closely to it may confer a generalized state of immune susceptibility on its carrier, the exact phenotypic expression of which depends on other genetic or environmental determinants. It also is clear, from the association of DH with GSE and the ability to control the cutaneous manifestations of DH with a gluten-free diet, that the gut disease is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of DH. Several pathogenetic theories about the origin of the cutaneous IgA deposits in DH have been proposed, one of which states that the IgA is produced in the gut mucosa as a response to a dietary antigen or gut epithelial antigen and then cross-reacts with the skin of patients with DH. A second hypothesis is that the IgA produced in the gut binds to an antigen and is deposited in skin as an antigen-antibody complex. Finally, it could be that the gut mucosal abnormality simply allows an unknown antigen access to the central immune system where an IgA antibody is produced that binds to skin. The failure to detect circulating IgA anti-basement membrane zone antibodies in patients with DH suggests that either the structures to which the IgA binds are not present in normal skin without DH, that IgA cannot bind to these structures in vitro, or that the circulating IgA is too scant for detection with conventional methods. Finally, it must be considered that the IgA deposited in DH skin may bind as a result of non-antigen-antibody interactions that cannot be duplicated in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Otley C', 'Hall RP']",1990,8,4,Dermatol Clin,Otley C and Hall RP.

1974277,An HLA class II region restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis: association with HLA-DP phenotype.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized in part by an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE), and a strong association with the HLA antigens HLA-A1, -B8, -DR3, and -DQw2, essentially identical to that seen in patients with isolated GSE (celiac disease). A 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP has been identified using a DQ beta-chain cDNA and localized to the HLA-DP beta-chain region. This RFLP has been found more frequently in patients with isolated GSE than in normal HLA matched controls. We have analyzed genomic DNA from 24 patients with DH and 15 HLA-matched controls to determine if this 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP was present in patients with DH. Twenty-one of 24 (87%) of patients with DH were found to have this RFLP as compared to 7 of 10 (70%) HLA-DR3, -DQw2 matched control subjects (p = 0.23). Thus, the 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP detected in patients with isolated GSE is also present in patients with DH; however, its frequency in DH patients does not differ significantly from that of HLA matched controls. Family studies of patients with DH revealed that although the 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP segregated with the HLA-A1, -B8, -DR3, -DQw2 haplotype in one family, it did not segregate with this disease-associated haplotype in two other families. In both patient and control populations, this RFLP was associated with HLA-DPw1 or -DPw3 phenotypes; 25 of 26 (96%) HLA-DPw1 or -DPw3 subjects were found to have this RFLP compared to only 1 of 6 (17%) who did not express HLA-DPw1 or -DPw3 (pc = 0.0009). These population and family data suggest that this 4.0-kb RsaI RFLP is primarily associated with the HLA-DPw1, -DPw3 phenotype, rather than the clinical manifestations of DH. These data further document that the strongest association of DH with HLA antigens remains with HLA-DQw2 and HLA-DR3 antigens.","['Hall RP', 'Ward FE', 'Wenstrup RJ']",1990,95,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Hall RP, et al.

Jejunal aspirate was taken at the time of jejunal biopsy, and levels of total immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) and specific antibody to gliadin and two other dietary proteins, betalactoglobulin and ovalbumin, were measured. The pattern of secretory immune responses in the dermatitis herpetiformis patients was similar to that in twenty-six patients with untreated coeliac disease--ie, higher than normal concentrations of IgA, IgM, and IgG and high levels of specific antibodies (IgA and IgM) to the three dietary proteins. Serum levels of IgA antigliadin were similar in the dermatitis herpetiformis and control (twenty-eight patients who underwent jejunal biopsy to exclude coeliac disease) groups, and serum levels of IgG antigliadin were intermediate between those of the control and coeliac disease groups.

DNA RFLPs obtained with TaqI enzyme were investigated with cDNA probes specific for DR beta, DQ alpha and DQ beta genes. The results were correlated with intestinal involvement and age at onset of the disease. The following observations were made: (1) the intestinal biopsies revealed a direct correlation between degree of lesions and age at onset of DH; (2) a significantly increased relative risk (RR) was found for the following HLA antigens: A1 (RR = 2.2), B8 (RR = 6.2), Cw7 (RR = 3.9), C4AQ0 (RR = 7.4), DR3 (RR = 5.2), DR7 (RR = 4.4), DRw53 (RR = 4.7), DQw2 (RR = 6.0); (3) B8 and DR3 were significantly more frequent in patients with severe intestinal lesions; and (4) of the two DR3 subtypes revealed by RFLP typing, only 3.1 showed an increased frequency in DH patients (RR = 8.4).

However, disease frequency was still increased in the DP alpha 3.5 positive/DP beta 4.9 negative group. In seven families, each with at least two affected members, while the DP alpha 3.5 fragment was frequently present in patients it did not preferentially segregate with any particular HLA haplotype--for example, those associated with DR3 or DR7--and therefore is not part of an extended haplotype associated with coeliac disease.

Expression of Hermes-defined CD44 class of lymphocyte homing receptor and HECA-452 antigen specific for high-endothelium-mediating physiologic lymphocyte extravasation was studied in dermatitis herpetiformis, celiac disease, psoriasis, mycosis fungoides, lymphocytosis cutis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis. Also, duodenal biopsies of patients suffering from dermatitis herpetiformis or celiac disease were studied for existence of these antigens. Infiltrating lymphocytes in the skin and in the duodenal area expressed homing receptor molecules when studied with monoclonal antibodies, Hermes-1 and Hermes-3, that recognize the CD44 class of molecules involved in lymphocyte binding to high endothelial venules in peripheral lymph nodes, mucosa-associated lymphatic tissues, and inflamed synovium. However, the HECA-452 antigen was not detected on the venules, neither in the skin nor in the duodenum. Even the venules possessing high endothelium morphologically were HECA-452 negative. These findings suggest the CD44 class of lymphocyte homing receptor(s) is also involved in lymphocyte homing to inflamed skin and the duodenal area of the gut. However, on the basis of HECA-452 staining, high endothelial venules in inflamed skin and duodenum are not antigenically identical with high endothelial venules in organized lymphoid tissues. This finding indirectly supports the idea that molecules and/or mechanisms mediating lymphocyte extravasation might be distinct in these organs.","['Jalkanen S', 'Saari S', 'Kalimo H', 'Lammintausta K', 'Vainio E', 'Leino R', 'Duijvestijn AM', 'Kalimo K']",1990,94,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Jalkanen S, et al.

2362935,Antireticulin antibodies in collagenous and lymphocytic (microscopic) colitis.,"Serum antireticulin antibodies (ARAs) are often present in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease (CD), especially before instituting a gluten-free diet. In both collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic (microscopic) colitis (LC) the colorectal mucosa shows surface epithelial damage with intraepithelial lymphocytes that is strikingly comparable to the small intestinal findings in CD. Also, CD may show subepithelial collagen deposition resembling that seen in CC. Because of these similarities, ARAs were measured in sera from patients with biopsy-proven CC and LC and compared with sera tested from CD patients. Antibody binding to reticulin was detected in frozen sections of rat liver and kidney by indirect immunofluorescent techniques. Whereas five of 14 CD patients (35.7%) had ARAs, only one of 29 CC patients (3.4%) (P = 0.010 versus CD) and none of 17 LC patients (0%) (P = 0.012 versus CD) had ARAs. The positive CC patient had IgA ARA titers of 1:20 noted in two sera taken 2 mo apart. The five positive CD patients had IgA ARA titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:320. The rare presence of ARAs noted in collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis was similar to its occurrence in normals, whereas the frequency of ARAs found in celiac disease (35.7%) was within the range reported for that disorder. Therefore, ARAs do not appear to be associated with CC or LC despite the morphologic similarities to CD.","['Greenson JK', 'Giardiello FM', 'Lazenby AJ', 'Peña SA', 'Bayless TM', 'Yardley JH']",1990,3,3,Mod Pathol,"Greenson JK, et al.

Serum samples from 10 patients affected by bullous pemphigoid, 1 patients with linear IgA dermatitis and 10 patients with other bullous dermatosis were included as controls. Whereas the presence of these antibodies in varying titres, ranging from 1:10 to 1:80, was confirmed in all case of dermatitis herpetiformis, no antibody activity was observed in control patients. On the basis of these findings and of other published data, it is possible to conclude that these antibodies are directly correlated to intestinal damage, but there is no relationship with the clinical characteristics of skin symptoms or with junctional immunopathological evidence.","['Di Blasi A', 'Fuligni A', 'Geti V', 'Battini ML', 'Fabbri P']",1990,125,5,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Di Blasi A, et al.

2182721,Cutaneous IgA deposits in bullous diseases function as ligands to mediate adherence of activated neutrophils.,"Linear IgA bullous dermatosis and dermatitis herpetiformis are inflammatory subepidermal blistering diseases characterized by IgA deposits at the cutaneous epithelial basement membrane and in dermal papillae, respectively. Inflammation in both disorders localizes to sites of IgA deposition and is characterized by a predominance of neutrophils. From these observations we postulate that IgA deposits in both diseases may contribute to the recruitment and/or localization of neutrophils. In this study we examined the ability of in vitro and in vivo bound IgA anti-basement membrane autoantibodies from patients with linear IgA bullous dermatosis and in vivo bound IgA deposits in dermal papillae from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis to mediate adherence of neutrophils stimulated by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The study showed that stimulated neutrophils adhered to basement membranes and dermal papillae containing IgA deposits. Adherence was IgA anti-basement membrane antibody concentration dependent and correlated with the immunofluorescence staining intensity of IgA deposits in dermal papillae. Adherence to IgA deposits but not IgG deposits could be inhibited by purified exogenous secretory IgA but not IgG and adherence to IgG deposits could be inhibited by purified exogenous IgG but not secretory IgA. These results provide direct experimental evidence that cutaneous IgA deposits in linear IgA bullous dermatosis and dermatitis herpetiformis can function as ligands for neutrophil adherence and have a role in the localization of inflammation in these disorders.","['Hendrix JD', 'Mangum KL', 'Zone JJ', 'Gammon WR']",1990,94,5,J Invest Dermatol,"Hendrix JD, et al.

One hundred and forty-nine patients with nonulcer dyspepsia served as reference population for the prevalence of atrophic gastritis of the body. Seventeen DH patients (30%) and 23 controls (15.4%) showed atrophic gastritis of the body mucosa (p less than 0.05). Nine of the DH patients with atrophic gastritis of the body also had atrophic changes in the antrum. Six patients, all with severe atrophic gastritis, had high gastrin levels and PCA; five of these six also had low Pg I levels. We found an increased prevalence of abnormal indirect function tests among patients with atrophic gastritis is due to the younger age of the patients in our series. Thus, atrophic gastritis can be detected early on a histologic basis, but functional impairment occurs later, as the mucosal damage increases in severity.","['Primignani M', 'Agape D', 'Ronchi G', 'Forzenigo L', 'Bonato C', 'Meroni P', 'Falsitta M', 'Malesci A', 'de Franchis R']",1990,25,4,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Primignani M, et al.

2320948,Measurements of serum IgA and IgG activities to dietary antigens. A prospective study of the diagnostic usefulness in adult coeliac disease.,"Serum samples from 458 consecutive adult patients with intestinal symptoms and/or suspected food intolerance were examined for IgG and IgA antibody activities to gluten, egg, and cow's milk antigens by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased IgA and/or IgG activities to gluten were seen in 61 patients: 35 had coeliac disease (CD) as suggested by jejunal villous atrophy and subsequent histologic and/or clinical improvement on a gluten-free diet; 4 were previously diagnosed CD patients with clinically suspected dietary failure; 2 had dermatitis herpetiformis with a CD-like intestinal morphology; and 3 had possible gluten intolerance without villous atrophy. The rest had other disorders that might have affected the permeability of the gastrointestinal mucosa or the hepatic IgA catabolism. When the IgA activity to gluten was increased, neither the IgA/IgG activities to nongluten antigens nor the ratio of nongluten to gluten antibodies could discriminate between CD patients and those without CD. However, the median IgA activity to gluten was significantly higher in the CD group. The probability for CD thus increased from 33% in patients with IgA activity to gluten between 0.4 and 0.8 OD units to 90% in those with such activity above 2.4 OD units. Nevertheless, seven untreated CD patients had IgG and IgA activities to gluten within the normal range. ELISA determinations of serum antibodies to gluten antigens are a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of adult CD, but a negative test does not exclude this disorder.","['Scott H', 'Fausa O', 'Ek J', 'Valnes K', 'Blystad L', 'Brandtzaeg P']",1990,25,3,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Scott H, et al.

2312829,Dermatitis herpetiformis in two American blacks: HLA type and clinical characteristics.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is a rare blistering skin disease characterized in part by granular IgA deposits at the dermoepidermal junction, an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and a strong association with the human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 (74% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis), -B8 (88%), -DR3 (95%), and -DQw2 (100%). Dermatitis herpetiformis is rarely seen in American blacks and some investigators have postulated that this finding may be due to the decreased frequency of HLA-A1 and -B8 in American blacks compared with Caucasians (American blacks: HLA-A1 = 15.3%, HLA-B8 = 10.7%; Caucasian: HLA-A1 = 26.4%, HLA-B8 = 18.3%). This report describes two American blacks with dermatitis herpetiformis and reports the results of HLA typing of these subjects for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ antigens. HLA typing revealed that neither patient expressed HLA-A1 or -B8; however, both patients did express the class II antigens most frequently seen in dermatitis herpetiformis, HLA-DR3 and -DQw2. Comparison of HLA class II antigen frequency in normal American blacks and Caucasians reveals a similar frequency of HLA-DR3 and -DQw2 (American blacks: HLA-DR3 = 27.6%, HLA-DQw2 = 40.9%; Caucasian: HLA-DR3 = 22.6%, HLA-DQw2 = 32.9%). These data confirm the importance of the HLA class II region in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis. In addition, these data suggest that the rare occurrence of dermatitis herpetiformis in American blacks is not due to the decreased frequency of the HLA class I antigens -A1 and/or -B8 but rather is related to differences in the HLA class II region not detected by routine HLA typing.","['Hall RP', 'Clark RE', 'Ward FE']",1990,22,3,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Hall RP, et al.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 56 patients with DH and 26 control subjects with the HLA-B8/-DR3 haplotype. All were examined for thyroid function abnormalities and thyroid autoantibodies.
RESULTS: Patients with DH had a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of abnormal thyroid function test results and autoantibodies: 32% versus 4% for controls (Z = 2.01, p less than 0.02). In patients with DH, hypothyroidism was the most common thyroid abnormality (12 of 56) followed by hyperthyroidism (four of 56). Two patients had normal thyroid function test results with thyroid autoantibodies. Risk factors for thyroid abnormalities in patients with DH were increasing age (chi 2 = 6.55, p less than 0.02, significant) and the presence of thyroid microsomal antibodies. The HLA-B8/-DR3 haplotype was not a risk factor for thyroid abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that thyroid disease is independently associated with DH. Examination of patients with DH should include thyroid function tests along with assays for antithyroid antibodies.","['Gaspari AA', 'Huang CM', 'Davey RJ', 'Bondy C', 'Lawley TJ', 'Katz SI']",1990,88,2,Am J Med,"Gaspari AA, et al.

Because both types of antibodies occur in both forms of gluten-sensitive enteropathy, studies were conducted to determine if the two types of antibodies can be distinguished by species and organ specificity. The results of these studies indicate that distinct endomysium-specific and reticulin-specific antibodies can be found and that these differ in their species specificity; i.e., endomysium antigen occurs in primate and not in rodent tissues while the reticulin antigen occurs in rodent and not in primate tissues. However, the activity of both endomysium and reticulin antibodies demonstrates similar tissue distribution, in that both react to antigens associated with gastrointestinal smooth muscles, peritubular and periglomerular areas of the kidney, and sinusoidal and periportal areas of the liver. Also, both antigens seem to be present in sheep and goat tissue.

1977254,"Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, acne, psoriasis and Darier's disease have low epidermal zinc concentrations.","Zinc concentration was determined in epidermis, papillary dermis and serum in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, acne or psoriasis and in two small groups of patients with ichthyosis vulgaris and Darier's disease. Except in ichthyosis vulgaris the zinc level in epidermis was decreased in all these disorders. The mean serum zinc concentration was, however, significantly decreased only in men with dermatitis herpetiformis. There was no correlation between the concentration of zinc in epidermis or dermis and that in serum. The decreased epidermal zinc concentration indicates that many of the patients have a zinc deficiency in spite of a ""normal"" serum zinc value. Supplementation of zinc might therefore be of value in patients with these disorders.","['Michaëlsson G', 'Ljunghall K']",1990,70,4,Acta Derm Venereol,"Michaëlsson G and Ljunghall K.

1972829,IgA immunoreactive deposits collocal with fibrillin immunoreactive fibers in dermatitis herpetiformis skin.,"The IgA immunoreactive granules or fibrils, characteristically found in dermal papillae of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, were previously reported to be associated with microfibrillar bundles. Recently, fibrillin, a component of such 8-12 nm microfibrils, was identified. In normal skin, the fibrillin immunoreactive microfibrils are present at the periphery of elastic fibers and are also present without concomitant amorphous elastin in the dermal papillae close to the lamina densa. The localization of the IgA immunoreactive material in the dermal papillae of 17 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was compared with the distribution of the fibrillin immunoreactive fiber network. Immunofluorescence methods using FITC- and TRITC-labelled antibodies, an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique, and standard elastin staining procedures, were used in several sequential and double staining procedures. In 13 specimens, in which the IgA reactivity was granular, most of the granules were located at the sites of fibrillin-reactive structures. As it could not be excluded that the collocality was coincidental, it could not be ascertained whether the IgA granules were in fact related to the fibrillin immunoreactive fibers in these specimens. However, in 4 specimens with both granular and fibrillar IgA immunoreactive deposits, these were clearly related to and located at the sites of fibrillin-reactive fibrils in the dermal papillae. The results confirm earlier reports of an association of IgA reactive deposits with microfibrillar bundles in dermatitis herpetiformis skin, though the possibility of their binding to other extracellular matrix component(s) has not been ruled out. The findings suggest that fibrillin may be the structural component (or one of them) to which IgA reactive deposits bind in the skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Dahlbäck K', 'Sakai L']",1990,70,3,Acta Derm Venereol,Dahlbäck K and Sakai L.

Direct immunofluorescence testing of a skin biopsy demonstrated both granular deposition of IgA, predominantly in the papillary bodies, and linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the basement membrane zone. This mixed direct immunofluorescence pattern, typical for dermatitis herpetiformis in the type of IgA deposits, but also typical for pemphigoid in the linear localization of IgG and C3, is unusual. This case emphasizes that even after a specific diagnosis has been established, if the clinical morphology or response to therapy changes, repeat histologic and immunofluorescence studies may be indicated in diagnosis and management of patients with bullous disease.","['Sander HM', 'Utz MM', 'Peters MS']",1989,16,6,J Cutan Pathol,"Sander HM, et al.

The overall sensitivity of IgA-EMA for the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis was 79% and the specificity was 96%. When the three patients with dermatitis herpetiformis who were faithfully following gluten-free diets were excluded, the sensitivity was 90% and the specificity was 96%. No patient in the bullous disease control group (including patients with linear IgA bullous dermatosis) had circulating IgA-EMA. One patient, who did not have direct immunofluorescence evidence for dermatitis herpetiformis but had IgA nephropathy, had a positive IgA-EMA result, an interesting association in light of the rare reports of dermatitis herpetiformis in patients with IgA nephropathy and IgA antigliadin antibodies associated with IgA nephropathy.

There was no significant difference in the prevalence of antibodies (79%) in patients on a gluten-free diet or not on a gluten-free diet (72%). These serum antibodies reactive with gliadin, milk and ovalbumin were of the IgG isotype. However, IgA anti-gliadin antibodies were also detected in DH patients, but only in patients who were not on a gluten-free diet. In contrast, IgA anti-milk antibodies were also detected in DH patients irrespective of whether the patient was on a gluten-free diet. In DH patients, antibodies reactive with ovalbumin were often restricted to the IgG4 subclass and antibodies reactive with bovine milk antigens (notably casein) were distributed predominantly in both IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses, a similar IgG isotype distribution to that observed in healthy individuals. However, anti-gliadin antibodies in DH patients showed no predominant IgG4 subclass restriction. IgG4 anti-ovalbumin antibodies and IgG4 and/or IgG2 anti-casein antibodies persisted for up to 4 yr without fluctuation, irrespective of whether DH patients were on a gluten-free diet.","['Barnes RM', 'Lewis-Jones MS']",1989,30,2,J Clin Lab Immunol,Barnes RM and Lewis-Jones MS.

2570807,Alterations in HLA-DP and HLA-DQ antigen frequency in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is associated with a markedly increased frequency of the HLA class II antigens DR3 and DQw2. To investigate a possible role of HLA-DP (or closely associated genes) in the pathogenesis of DH as well as to confirm the previously described alterations of HLA-DR3 and HLA-DQw2 antigen frequency, we have typed 43 patients with DH for HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR antigens. All patients with DH had typical clinical and histologic features, as well as granular deposits of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence. HLA-DR3 was expressed in 41 of 43 (95%) DH patients, whereas HLA-DQw2 was expressed in all 43 (100%). The overall distribution of HLA-DP antigens in patients with DH was significantly different from that seen in all controls and in HLA-DR3 and HLA-DQw2 controls (p less than 0.02). Examination of the frequency of individual DP antigens revealed that HLA-DPw1 was increased (42% of patients with DH vs 11% of all controls and 26% of DR3 positive controls), but this increase was not statistically greater than that expected due to the disequilibrium linkage of DPw1 with DR3/DQw2. Patients with DH, however, did have a statistically significant decreased frequency of DPw2 (14% of patients vs 31% of all controls and 41% of DR3 positive controls) (pc less than 0.05). Studies of three informative families demonstrated that the DPw2 genes of the DH patients were not present on the haplotype thought to carry a DH susceptibility gene (HLA-A1, HLA-B8, HLA-DR3, HLA-DQw2). A role of HLA-DP region genes in the pathogenesis of DH is further suggested by the observation that HLA-DPw1 was expressed in 82% (9 of 11) of DH patients with IgA antibodies against dietary antigens as compared with only 33% (4 of 12) of patients without IgA antibodies. HLA-DP genes or genes closely linked to them may be important in DH either as markers of the disease haplotype or by direct involvement in its pathogenesis.","['Hall RP', 'Sanders ME', 'Duquesnoy RJ', 'Katz SI', 'Shaw S']",1989,93,4,J Invest Dermatol,"Hall RP, et al.

2806989,Comparison of IgA-class reticulin and endomysium antibodies in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The occurrence of IgA class reticulin and endomysium antibodies was examined with the standard immunofluorescence method in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. Similar high antibody frequencies were detected in 32 untreated adults (91%) and 18 children (100%) with coeliac disease and in 14 dermatitis herpetiformis patients with subtotal villous atrophy (reticulin antibodies 93% and endomysium antibodies 100%). The specificity of IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies was high because all 45 adult patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, 24 non-coeliac children with abdominal symptoms and 99/100 healthy blood donors were negative for these antibodies. The only positive blood donor had both IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies but also she was found to have coeliac disease. IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies declined in parallel during treatment with a gluten free diet and increased on gluten challenge. This suggests that these antibodies can be used to screen for gluten sensitive enteropathy and to monitor dietary treatment. To characterise the tissue specificity of reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies four positive sera were absorbed with human and several rodent liver homogenates. Absorption with rat or other rodent livers removed the rodent-specific reticulin antibodies but not the reticulin antibodies detectable with human tissues or the endomysium antibodies detectable with monkey oesophagus. These results show that reticulin antibodies can be divided into the rat and human subtypes. The human subtype could not be separated from endomysium antibodies in the present absorption experiments.",['Hällström O'],1989,30,9,Gut,Hällström O.

To test the hypothesis that a circulating IgA class antibody in DH patients binds to constituents of normal human skin, we employed the highly sensitive methods of immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence. Sera from 64 DH patients, 67 randomly selected normal control subjects, 29 histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) B8/DR3/DQw2 controls, and 12 psoriatic patients were tested for IgA binding to various substrates, including dermal and epidermal extracts, fibroblast and keratinocyte supernatants, monkey esophagus sections, and whole and saline-split normal human skin sections. Significant differences observed among the groups in the frequency of detectable IgA antibodies reacting with various substrates were as follows: 1) IgA antibodies in 30% of both DH and HLA B8/DR3/DQw2 sera bound to a 60-Kd protein in dermal extracts (p less than 0.25 versus non-HLA matched controls); 2) IgA antiendomysial antibodies were present in 38% of DH patients (predominantly those not on gluten-free diets), whereas both normal control groups had frequencies of 5-10% (p less than 0.025); 3) there was more nonspecific IgA antibody-binding to dermal, epidermal, and bovine proteins in DH and HLA control sera than in normal sera; and 4) IgA antibodies directed against the basement membrane were present with an increased frequency of 25% in both DH and HLA B8/DR3/DQw2 sera (p less than 0.1 versus non-HLA matched controls). Therefore, these results do not support the hypothesis that there is an unique antigen within normal human skin to which IgA antibodies from DH sera bind.","['Kadunce DP', 'Meyer LJ', 'Zone JJ']",1989,93,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Kadunce DP, et al.

The present study was designed to elucidate whether the C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity represents deposition of membrane attack complexes or non-lytic SC5b-9 complexes. Skin specimens from 11 patients with pemphigoid, five patients with discoid lupus erythematosus and from nine patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were studied with immunofluorescence using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against C9 neoantigen and against vitronectin (S-protein), an inhibitor to the membrane attack complex of complement. Specimens from the pemphigoid patients demonstrated C9 neoantigen reactivity along the DEZ without detectable colocalized vitronectin. This suggests deposition of membrane attack complexes in the pemphigoid lesions. Immunoreactivity of both C9 neoantigen and vitronectin was detected in the DEZ in specimens of discoid lupus erythematosus and in the tips of dermal papillae in specimens of dermatitis herpetiformis. The combined presence of C9 neoantigen- and vitronectin immunoreactivity may indicate deposition of C9 as part of the non-lytic SC5b-9 complex. The finding reported here of differential deposition of vitronectin and C9 in different diseases indicates that the presence of C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity in tissue per se does not represent the deposition of membrane attack complexes, but that it may also be C9 deposited as part of the nonlytic SC5b-9 complex.","['Dahlbäck K', 'Löfberg H', 'Dahlbäck B']",1989,120,6,Br J Dermatol,"Dahlbäck K, et al.

2707632,Subclass distribution of mucosal IgG-producing cells in gastritis.,"IgG-mediated immune reactions are probably involved in the maintenance of gastritis and glandular atrophy; the mucosal IgG-subclass pattern may therefore influence the effect of local hypersensitivity mechanisms. In this study the proportions of IgG1-, IgG2-, IgG3-, and IgG4-producing immunocytes were determined by paired immunofluorescence staining in specimens from simple gastritis, gastritis after Billroth II (BII) resection, and gastritis associated with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). The results were related to histopathological degree of inflammation and atrophy. Generally, IgG1 immunocytes predominated (48-60%) in all types of gastritis. With increasing severity of inflammation, the IgG2-cell proportion was significantly increased from 4-6% to 26-34% in simple and BII gastritis, whereas the ratio of IgG1 immunocytes was correspondingly decreased from 58-69% to 38-43%. In the same types of gastritis the proportion of IgG3 cells was increased in association with severe (35-38%) compared with mild (15-23%) atrophy, whereas the proportion of IgG1 cells was correspondingly decreased. In severe gastritis associated with DH, the proportion of IgG1 cells was relatively high (60%) and that of IgG2 cells relatively low (13%), and severe atrophy did not seem to influence significantly the subclass proportions.","['Valnes K', 'Brandtzaeg P']",1989,30,3,Gut,Valnes K and Brandtzaeg P.

Positive FAIgG staining was seen in both skin biopsy specimens yielding a fluorescence pattern similar to that of immunoglobulin and complement deposits. Tissue antiglobulin activity was no more detectable in a second skin biopsy obtained from one patient whose rash was controlled by Dapsone. These findings suggest an involvement of tissue antiglobulin activity in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis.

Combination chemotherapy was given. Although the abdominal mass and systemic symptoms resolved, the splenomegaly did not and the patient developed severe prolonged anaemia and pancytopaenia. Splenectomy resulted in a complete reversal of the haematological abnormalities. Histopathological examination of the spleen revealed fungal granulomas of Candida albicans.

2786501,The immunopathology of the small intestinal reaction in gluten-sensitivity.,"Computerised image-analysis was used to define the spectrum of immunopathological changes in small intestinal mucosa in established celiac sprue disease; dermatitis herpetiformis; 1 degree relatives of celiac sprue patients, and treated celiac sprue patients challenged with varying doses of a peptic-tryptic digest of gluten. Typically, in flat ('Type 2') lesion there was a reduced number of large, mitotically active lymphocytes in surface epithelium, but an increased lymphocyte population in crypts. In approximately 50% untreated DH patients and in 20% 1 degree celiac sprue relatives, mucosal architecture was well-preserved although surface (villous) epithelium contained an expanded population of small, non-mitotic lymphocytes ('Type 1' lesion), with or without crypt hyperplasia. Similar changes were also induced by small dose gluten challenge. Larger dose challenges caused a progression from a Type 1 to a Type 2 lesion during a 5 day period of observation. In addition, observations on a few patients over 2-4 years showed a similar sequence of mucosal changes. A major feature of this sequence was the early appearance of crypt hypertrophy, before significant villous flattening had occurred. These changes parallel T lymphocyte-mediated graft- versus-host reactions in animals, suggesting that the specific immunopathologic features seen in gluten sensitivity are fundamentally cell-mediated in type, the degree of change probably dependent on host genetic factors. Finally, these data show that in becoming flat the mucosa must initially pass through the earlier Type 1 lesion in which crypt hypertrophy is a prominent response.",['Marsh MN'],1989,18,1-4,Immunol Invest,Marsh MN.

In order to do so, one must first be able to elute these immune reactants from the skin. We describe here a simple method of eluting not only specifically bound IgG, but also IgA and other immunoglobulins and complement components from skin biopsy material. The method involves cutaneous washing of the entrapped serum proteins in PBS pH 7 and pH 5 buffers followed by specific immunoglobulin elutions at pH 3 and 2. The IgA deposits which could not be removed by this treatment were eluted by a combination of low pH (0.5 M citrate pH 2) and a chaotropic agent (2 M NaCl). The relative concentration of IgA in eluates when quantitated by fluoroimmunoassay were three- to five-fold higher in dermatitis herpetiformis skin biopsy specimens, than in eluates of bullous pemphigoid or normal skin biopsy specimens.","['Jones P', 'Kumar V', 'Beutner EH', 'Chorzelski TP']",1989,281,6,Arch Dermatol Res,"Jones P, et al.

Results of a study of 29 patients suffering from chronic oral mucosal disease, in which such methods were applied are reported. Auto-antibodies against epithelial intercellular substance (AICSA) were found in three patients, two of whom had pemphigus. Only one of the two patients diagnosed as having pemphigoid had circulating antibodies to basement membrane zone (ABMZA). Auto-antibodies to reticulin (IgA-ARA) were found in one patient in whom a diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) was confirmed by intestinal biopsy. In addition to the patient with CD, another patient had IgA class antibodies against gliadin (IgA-AGA). IgG-AGA were found in five other patients, in one of whom dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) was diagnosed. Antibodies to cow's milk (ACMA) were detected in 10 patients and CIC in 4 patients.

Three distinctive patterns of mucosal abnormality were identified: (a) the ""infiltrative"" lesion in which normal villus epithelium was infiltrated by small, non-mitotic lymphocytes: (b) the ""hyperplastic"" type, in which crypt hyperplasia and hypertrophy together with lymphoid infiltration of crypt epithelium was additional to the ""infiltrative"" lesion, and in which lamina propria was swollen and contained modest neutrophilic and basophilic infiltration: and (c) the ""destructive"" lesion, identical to the classic celiac sprue appearances with effacement of villi, crypt hypertrophy and more intensive polymorph infiltration of lamina propria. These progressive lesions parallel those seen in experimental graft-versus-host reactions, so that the entire spectrum of changes described here in DH appear consistent with a cell-mediated mucosal response to gluten.

3049830,Immunoglobulin A deposition in jejunal mucosa of children with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Previously we have shown by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) technique that a special IgA antibody in the sera of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) binds to the structures of the normal jejunum. Now we show by direct IF that specific IgA deposits are present in the proximal jejunum of 11/12 DH and 2/2 celiac patients before a gluten-free diet (GFD). The IgA deposition was in a tubular pattern underlying the villous and crypt epithelial basement membranes and in the lamina propria. This IgA deposition diminished or was not detectable in DH patients under a GFD for a year, and became detectable under gluten challenge in three DH patients. One patient with celiac disease and IgA deficiency, four with other intestinal diseases, and four without jejunal damage had neither jejunal IgA deposition nor circulating IgA anti-jejunal antibody. The deposition of IgA in the jejunum seemed to be correlated with the presence of IgA anti-jejunal antibody in the serum and with the presence of jejunal damage, but the degree of jejunal atrophy, the titer of the anti-jejunal antibody, and the intensity of jejunal IgA deposition in DH patient were not clearly related. Deposition of IgA in the jejunum in DH did not clearly correlate with the activity of the skin symptoms and thus may not be directly related to the pathogenesis of the skin disease of DH.","['Kárpáti S', 'Kósnai I', 'Török E', 'Kovács JB']",1988,91,4,J Invest Dermatol,"Kárpáti S, et al.

3201202,Studies of intestinal lymphoid tissue. XI--The immunopathology of cell-mediated reactions in gluten sensitivity and other enteropathies.,"Computerised image-analysis was used to quantitate small intestinal mucosae from celiac sprue and dermatitis herpetiformis patients, Gambian children with tropical-sprue-like malabsorption, first-degree celiac sprue relatives, and treated celiac sprue patients during challenge with a peptic-tryptic digest of gluten. A wide range of mucosal appearances was observed. Typically, 'flat' lesions (Type 2) revealed a reduced number of epithelial lymphocytes that were large and mitotically active. At the other extreme, mucosal architecture was relatively well preserved (Type 1) but surface epithelium contained an expanded population of small, non-mitotic lymphocytes, with or without crypt hyperplasia. Similar changes were observed in one-third of celiac relatives and following small dose gluten challenge. Larger dose challenges revealed a transition from Type 1 to Type 2 lesions over a 5-day period. Studies in a few patients over 2-4 years showed a similar type of progression. A major feature of this sequence was early appearance of crypt hypertrophy while villi persisted, indicating a role for factors other than increased loss of enterocytes from surface epithelium. These changes parallel the T lymphocyte-mediated events in graft-versus-host reactions in animals. It is thus concluded that the spectrum of immunopathologic changes observed in gluten sensitivity is fundamentally a cell-mediated effect, the degree of change being controlled by host genetic factors.

Apart from two patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, nonclassical clinical presentations were observed in 16 of 50 (32%) patients overall and in 13 of 28 (46%) patients diagnosed since 1981. Diarrhea was the most common complaint leading to the diagnosis; since 1981, hematologic abnormalities warranted investigation in 38% of the patients. Decreased iron stores (88%), decreased red cell folate (82%), or both (74%), and abnormal radiographic studies of the small bowel (83%) were the most sensitive tests in the diagnostic investigation. We conclude that atypical or nonclassical presentations of adult celiac sprue, mostly with hematologic abnormalities, are not uncommon.","['Paré P', 'Douville P', 'Caron D', 'Lagacé R']",1988,10,4,J Clin Gastroenterol,"Paré P, et al.

3407614,Nutritional status in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Nutritional status of 86 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) was defined by anthropometric measurements and hematological and biochemical laboratory tests to establish prevalence of malabsorption and malnutrition. Anthropometric measurements in DH patients were comparable to normal control patients. Four individuals were of short stature; two had had diarrhea and failed to thrive in childhood. Abnormalities attributable to nutritional deficiency were detected in only 6 of the 86, whereas drug-associated hematological or biochemical changes were present in 36 of 55 subjects treated with dapsone or sulfapyridine. Twenty patients had hemolytic anemia or macrocytosis related to drug therapy. Only two had anemias attributable to malabsorption; one was iron deficient, the other folate deficient. Two other patients were mildly Fe deficient and two had slight folate deficiency; they lacked other stigmata of malabsorption. Drug-induced hematological and biochemical abnormalities were more common than changes that suggest nutritional disease, even though most DH patients had an enteropathy at presentation.","['Gawkrodger DJ', 'Ferguson A', 'Barnetson RS']",1988,48,2,Am J Clin Nutr,"Gawkrodger DJ, et al.

3397588,Intestinal permeability in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Differential absorption of D-xylose and 3-0-methyl-D-glucose, and unmediated intestinal permeation (simple diffusion) of lactulose and L-rhamnose, have been investigated in 20 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Both iso-osmolar and hyperosmolar test solutions were employed and the results were compared with those obtained from a group of healthy adult volunteers. The findings in each patient have been correlated with small intestinal histology. The majority of patients with villous atrophy had abnormally raised intestinal lactulose permeation and lactulose/rhamnose permeability ratios, whereas patients with normal small intestinal morphological grading did not differ significantly from the healthy control group in this respect. There was a high incidence of delayed plasma D-xylose absorption peaks in dermatitis herpetiformis irrespective of small intestinal histological findings. These results imply that abnormal intestinal permeability in dermatitis herpetiformis is the result of gluten-induced damage to the mucosa rather than an inherent primary defect. It is therefore improbable that the rash in this condition is purely a manifestation of increased intestinal permeation of antigen.","['Griffiths CE', 'Menzies IS', 'Barrison IG', 'Leonard JN', 'Fry L']",1988,91,2,J Invest Dermatol,"Griffiths CE, et al.

3052972,Colchicine in therapy. State of the art and new perspectives for an old drug.,"Colchicine is the most specific treatment in acute gouty attacks. In several European countries, oral colchicine is still used for routine treatment of acute gout. Its selectivity is used as a diagnostic tool. It is also active in the treatment of acute crises of chondrocalcinosis and more occasionally of other arthritic crises (e.g. sarcoidosis). Colchicine appears to be the necessary adjuvant prophylactic drug when starting a hypouricemic treatment with uricosuric or uricolytic drugs for avoiding acute gouty crisis due to sudden mobilisation of the uric acid pool. Besides gout, colchicine is the drug of choice for treating familial mediterranean fever. It appears to be helpful in the treatment of Behçet's disease. It seems also useful for treating fibrosing conditions such as liver cirrhosis and scleroderma. As an adjuvant therapy, it helps treating dermatological disorders which are associated with leucocyte migration as an essential pathogenic factor (e.g. psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis, necrotising vasculitis ...). It has been advocated as an adjuvant therapy in malignant diseases as a support in radiotherapy and as an useful drug in various other diseases where it has been tried occasionally (e.g. Paget's disease of the bone, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, disc syndrome). This very old drug remains a modern therapeutic agent.",['Famaey JP'],1988,6,3,Clin Exp Rheumatol,Famaey JP. Colchicine in therapy. State of the art and new perspectives for an old drug.

3261663,Preferential activation of CD4 T lymphocytes in the lamina propria of gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"The distribution and activation of T-lymphocyte subsets in the small intestinal mucosa of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis subjects on a normal diet has been studied and compared to normal controls. Double-labelling immunofluorescence techniques with monoclonal antibodies were used on cryostat tissue sections. Intestinal epithelial cells demonstrated staining for HLA-DR, the intensity being proportional to the degree of enteropathy. In both patients and controls nearly all (97%) intra-epithelial lymphocytes were of the CD8 subset and not activated as judged by HLA-DR expression. In the lamina propria there was an approximate 50-fold increase in T cells in the patients as compared with the controls. Whilst the ratio of total CD4 to total CD8 cells was unchanged, the CD4 subset was preferentially activated in the patients. Thus in the normal controls the median ratio of activated CD4 cells to activated CD8 cells was 1.67 whilst for dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease it was 3.42 and 6.07 respectively. These findings suggest that the lamina propria is a site of vigorous T-cell activity in gluten-sensitive individuals and is consistent with the view that the enteropathy of dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease is the result of a delayed-type hypersensitivity against gliadin.","['Griffiths CE', 'Barrison IG', 'Leonard JN', 'Caun K', 'Valdimarsson H', 'Fry L']",1988,72,2,Clin Exp Immunol,"Griffiths CE, et al.

3258898,Characterization of the mucosal immune response to dietary antigens in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The association of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) with granular IgA deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction and a gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE) suggests that a mucosal immune response may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DH. The degree of antigenic restriction, the immunoglobulin class and subclass response to dietary antigens, and the relationship of antibodies against dietary antigens to IgA-containing circulating immune complexes (CIC) in patients with DH, however, are not known. We have examined the serum of 33 patients with DH for IgG and IgA antibodies against gliadin, and against 3 dietary proteins not thought to be related to GSE, beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lacto), bovine gamma globulin (BGG), and casein. Eleven of 33 (33%) patients with DH had IgA anti-gliadin antibodies, whereas IgA antibodies against beta-lacto were found in 11 of 33 patients (33%), against BGG in 15 of 32 (47%), and against casein in 6 of 33 (18%); 17 of 32 (53%) patients had IgA antibodies against one or more of these dietary antigens. Significantly higher levels of IgA antibodies were detected against beta-lacto (2,500 +/- 2,320 ng/ml, mean +/- SEM) and BGG (2,340 +/- 1,890 ng/ml) than gliadin (1,250 +/- 851 ng/ml) in this group of antibody positive patients (p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). Eleven of 17 patients with IgA antibodies against dietary antigens were found to have IgA-containing CIC, whereas only one of the 15 antibody negative patients had IgA-containing CIC (p = 0.0008, Fisher's exact test). IgA anti-gliadin antibodies were found to contain both IgA1 and IgA2 with a significantly increased proportion of IgA2 when compared with the IgA2 composition of the total serum IgA (IgA2: anti-gliadin antibodies = 34 +/- 4.2%; total serum IgA = 19 +/- 4.8%, p = 0.02, Students paired t test). IgG antibodies against these antigens were found to occur slightly more frequently in amounts not significantly greater than IgA antibodies. This data demonstrates that a serum IgA and IgG antibody response to dietary antigens occurs in approximately 50% of DH patients with a higher proportion of IgA2 than total serum IgA and does not appear to be restricted to gliadin. This is significantly different from the pattern of cutaneous immunoreactants in patients with DH, and suggests that the deposition of IgA in DH skin may be the result of an atypical mucosal immune response, a non-immunologic interaction of IgA1 and DH skin, or arise from a non-mucosal source.","['Hall RP', 'Waldbauer GV']",1988,90,5,J Invest Dermatol,Hall RP and Waldbauer GV.

For diagnosis of the early stage of internal malignancy, paraneoplastic dermatoses are the most important among other skin changes. Above all, dermatomyositis, figurate erythemas, erythroderma and a number of bullous dermatoses (e.g., bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris and dermatitis herpetiformis, Sweet' syndrome, pruritus, prurigo, acanthosis nigricans, Leser-Trélat sign, alopecia mucinosa, acquired ichthyosis, Bazex' syndrome, hypertrichosis aquisita lanuginosa) are among the paraneoplastic dermatoses.

3372760,Aggressive gluten challenge of dermatitis herpetiformis cases converts them from seronegative to seropositive for IgA-class endomysial antibodies.,"The responses to aggressive gluten challenge of two dermatitis herpetiformis patients with normal gut mucosa and negative serum findings for IgA endomysial antibodies while on normal diets indicate that these patients have a latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy. This was shown further by the control of skin lesions in both cases and in one case by the clearance of the induced gut lesions with a gluten-free diet. Specifically, for 12 to 20 weeks, aggressive gluten challenge (1 to 2 gm/kg/day) of these two patients was followed by both the appearance of and a rise in titer of IgA endomysial antibodies with an exacerbation of skin lesions. After 27 weeks of gluten challenge, histologic studies of the gut showed grade III flattening of the jejunal mucosa in the patient who developed IgA endomysial antibodies 19 weeks before biopsy was performed but not in the patient in whom IgA endomysial antibodies appeared 7 weeks before biopsy was performed. When both patients were placed on a gluten-free diet, IgA endomysial antibodies titers showed negative findings and the skin lesions subsided. It was possible to discontinue dapsone treatment after 30 weeks on a gluten-free diet in one patient and after 33 weeks in the other. It is important to note in the patient who developed grade III (significant) gut pathology after gluten challenge that a third biopsy taken 59 weeks after starting a gluten-free diet revealed a return to a grade II (insignificant) level of villus atrophy. Thus if sulfones are contraindicated in such cases, patients can be treated successfully with a gluten-free diet.","['Chorzelski TP', 'Rosinska D', 'Beutner EH', 'Sulej J', 'Kumar V']",1988,18,4 Pt 1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Chorzelski TP, et al.

Overt thyroid disease had been diagnosed in six (5%) of the dermatitis herpetiformis group and a further six patients had elevated TSH levels. The presence of thyroid antibodies was not associated with particular HLA-DR antigens. These results demonstrate the frequent occurrence of thyroid antibodies in dermatitis herpetiformis, although thyroid failure is less commonly associated with this condition.

To all 61 serial clinical controls, one-hour-blood-xylose absorption test every three months and a jejunal biopsy was suggested. The jejunal biopsy was performed when symptoms recurred, or when xylose-test showed an impaired absorption, or after 2 years. If the first jejunal biopsy showed a villous atrophy the GFD was restarted, while if a normal mucosa was found the gluten challenge was continued and the jejunal biopsy repeated every year. 52 children (85%) showed a villous atrophy after 1.5 to 72 months. 6 (10%) did not show a clinical or histological relapse, 2 refused the jejunal biopsy because symptomless, and 1 had to restart the GFD because she developed a dermatitis herpetiformis. One-hour-blood-xylose test was performed in 29 children and 20 (69%) showed a low absorbtion, the majority of them in the first year of challenge, and the remaining refused it. 36 of the relapsed children presented with mild clinical symptoms while 16 were symptomless.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Ansaldi N', 'Tavassoli K', 'Faussone D', 'Forni M', 'Oderda G']",1988,10,1,Pediatr Med Chir,"Ansaldi N, et al.

3127345,Identification of IgA subclasses in skin of dermatitis herpetiformis patients.,"There is a controversy as to the origin and to the subclass of IgA in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) skin. The present study was undertaken to reexamine the subclasses of IgA and the presence of J-chain in biopsies of DH patients. Skin biopsies from 12 DH patients were examined for IgA, its subclasses and for J-chain by a modified direct immunofluorescence (IF) method. All DH skin biopsies were positive for IgA. Ten of the twelve biopsies were positive for IgA1. IgA2 was detected in only 3 cases, notably in those which gave the strongest IgA reactions. In general, the fluorescent staining intensity for IgA2 was weaker than IgA1 and IgA1 was less than the total IgA. This may be due to differences in the concentrations of the immunoglobulin subclasses in the skin and may also be due to the restricted specificity of antisera used in the study. Direct IF studies of the presence of J-chain yielded negative findings in all DH cases examined including those which were positive for IgA2. The higher frequency of IgA1 over that of IgA2 and the absence of J-chain indicate that the IgA immune deposits in the DH skin may not necessarily be of mucosal origin.","['Barghuthy FS', 'Kumar V', 'Valeski E', 'Beutner EH', 'Chorzelski TP']",1988,85,3,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol,"Barghuthy FS, et al.

3069024,[Autoimmune pemphigus combined with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency].,"It has been demonstrated experimentally that the bullae observed in autoimmune pemphigus are due to the action of proteases. So far, no case of pemphigus associated with deficiency in antiprotease has been reported. We present a case of pemphigus associated with familial deficiency in alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT), a major human body antiprotease. A 35-year old man presented with pemphigus preceded during 18 months, and accompanied by pruritus. The lesions were polymorphous, being made of solitary bullae, circinate vesiculobullae and squamous scabie plaques. Histopathological examination showed an intraepidermal bulla with acantholysis, a very spongiosis. The diagnosis of autoimmune pemphigus was confirmed by fluorescence of the epidermis in IgG and C3 and by the presence of antibodies directed against the intracellular substance. The initial treatment, which consisted of prednisolone 10 mg/kg/day and 10 plasma exchanges, was rapidly successful, but several relapses occurred thereafter. Two years after the pemphigus was diagnosed, a panlobular emphysema was discovered which made it possible to demonstrate a severe familial deficiency in alpha 1-AT of the Pi phenotype. This is the first published case of alpha 1-AT deficiency associated with autoimmune pemphigus. In our patient the skin disease presented as herpetiform pemphigus (initial features of dermatitis herpetiformis, followed by misleading polymorphous lesions, rare acantholytic cells, good response to corticosteroids), but there was no eosinophilic spongiosis. The frequency of alpha1-AT deficiency (estimated at 1 in 1,000 in northern Europe) and the lack of published cases with such an association may suggest a pure coincidence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Vaillant L', 'Weisbecker MC', 'de Muret A', 'Lorette G']",1988,115,10,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Vaillant L, et al.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) producing cells were enumerated by paired immunofluorescence staining in a 500 microns wide section area from the muscularis mucosae to the lumen (mucosal 'tissue unit'). The number of immunocytes of the three main classes (IgA, IgM, and IgG) was significantly raised with increasing degree of gastritis. All three classes were increased in specimens showing atrophy compared with those without atrophy. IgA cells predominated as in simple gastritis, but a striking difference was a marked increase of IgM cells in specimens with the most pronounced DH-associated gastritis. Relative class distribution of immunocytes within different mucosal zones showed that the percentage of IgA cells was significantly higher in the luminal than in the basal zone, whereas the contrary was true for IgG cells. IgM cells did not show any zonal preference. No relation was seen between small bowel and gastric lesions. The disproportionate increase of gastric IgM producing cells in DH might nevertheless reflect seeding of precursor cells of the secretory immune system generated in the proximal small intestine where the local IgM response is relatively pronounced.","['Valnes K', 'Brandtzaeg P', 'Elgjo K', 'Stave R', 'Baklien K', 'Fausa O']",1987,28,12,Gut,"Valnes K, et al.

3662571,Dietary management of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an extremely itchy, papulovesicular skin disease characterized in part by the presence of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction. Eighty-five percent to 90% of DH patients have granular deposits of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction, and essentially all of these patients have an associated, for the most part asymptomatic, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). The association of GSE and DH suggested that the cutaneous manifestations of DH could be controlled by the use of a gluten-free diet. Institution of a gluten-free diet in patients with DH and granular IgA deposits has been shown to be effective in controlling the cutaneous eruption of DH. Seventy percent to 100% of patients who begin a strict gluten-free diet have been shown to be able to decrease the dosage of medication needed to control their DH after a mean of eight to 18 months on the diet. Furthermore, 40% to 70% of patients with DH can control their skin disease completely, without any medication, after longer periods of time on the gluten-free diet (two years and longer). Although the gluten-free diet has been shown to be of great benefit in the control of the skin manifestations of DH, at the present time there is no evidence to suggest that the gluten-free diet is in any way protective against the risk of intestinal lymphoma that has been documented in GSE. Evaluation of the cutaneous IgA deposits in DH skin after long periods of time on a gluten-free diet suggests that there may be a slight decrease in the intensity of the IgA deposits, but the true pathogenetic relationship between the cutaneous IgA deposits, the cutaneous manifestations of DH, and the associated GSE remains unknown.",['Hall RP'],1987,123,10,Arch Dermatol,Hall RP.

3312315,Familial incidence of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis and gluten-sensitive enteropathy are diseases in which exposure to gluten results in an inflammatory response. Both diseases are associated with certain human lymphocyte antigen alleles, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy is well known to cluster in families. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy has also been reported in families of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Despite this evidence that dermatitis herpetiformis is a genetic disease, reports of the familial occurrence of dermatitis herpetiformis are rare. We have obtained family histories from 92 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis with 740 first-degree relatives. Six of these relatives have dermatitis herpetiformis. Comparison of these data with the expected prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis shows this incidence to be highly significant (p less than 0.0001), strongly suggesting that dermatitis herpetiformis is a familial disease, presumably because of shared genetic factors but possibly because of a shared environment.","['Meyer LJ', 'Zone JJ']",1987,17,4,J Am Acad Dermatol,Meyer LJ and Zone JJ.

There was a significant correlation between EmA titres and AGA levels in individual patients. Gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment caused a rapid decrease in EmA titres; only three of the 12 patients still showed raised EmA after 6-12 months on a GFD and two of these three had failed to adhere to a strict diet. In contrast, no decrease in EmA titres occurred in four patients maintained on a normal diet, and two of the three patients with initially negative EmA developed positive titres when continuing on a normal diet. These results show that both IgA-class EmA and AGA are good indicators of jejunal damage in DH.

Of the 10 patients who underwent both procedures, one had lesions only in the duodenum, one had more severe lesions in the duodenum than in the jejunum, while the remaining 8 patients showed identical lesions at both sites. The 1-h blood d-xylose test after a dose of 5 g proved more sensitive than xylosuria or serum folic acid assay in detecting subclinical malabsorption. Finally, histological features of gluten-sensitive enteropathy can be found in nearly 100% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies is at least as sensitive as jejunal suction biopsy in assessing small bowel involvement in dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Primignani M', 'Agape D', 'Ronchi G', 'Falsitta M', 'Cipolla M', 'Vecchi M', 'Torgano G', 'Monti M', 'Berti E', 'de Franchis R']",1987,17,3,Ric Clin Lab,"Primignani M, et al.

3623744,The absolute oral bioavailability of dapsone in dogs and humans.,"The absolute oral bioavailability of dapsone (DDS) was established in dogs and healthy volunteers by comparing AUC's after oral and intravenous administration. Five female inbred beagles each received 100 mg DDS orally and intravenously as a bolus injection in a randomized cross-over study. DDS serum concentrations were determined using HPLC. After both routes of administration, linear pharmacokinetics were observed, the elimination half-life (t1/2) amounting between 5.8 and 10.2 h. After oral administration, AUC values between 56.1 and 99.2 mg X h X l-1 were found, while after intravenous administration AUC's were between 63.5 and 98.1 mg X h X l-1. The absolute oral bioavailability, corrected for differences in t1/2, averaged 107 +/- 9% (SD). A similar study was carried out in 2 female and 3 male healthy volunteers. The intravenous dose was reduced to 50 mg and given as an infusion. Pharmacokinetics were linear after both routes of administration. The t1/2 values amounted between 15.6 and 30.4 h. AUC's ranged from 24.0 to 75.4 mg X h X l-1 after oral administration and from 13.3 to 37.5 mg X h X l-1 after intravenous infusion of half of the oral dose. The absolute, t1/2-corrected oral bioavailability was calculated to be 86 to 104%. Complete bioavailability of DDS was demonstrated in dogs and healthy volunteers. The method used in this study might help to detect possible DDS malabsorption in leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis patients.","['Pieters FA', 'Zuidema J']",1987,25,7,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther Toxicol,Pieters FA and Zuidema J.

3298445,IgA immune complexes in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis occur in the absence of IgA rheumatoid factor.,"Thirty to forty percent of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) have IgA-containing circulating immune complexes (IgA-CIC); however, the antigenic composition of these complexes as well as the role they play in the pathogenesis of DH are unknown. The failure to detect wheat protein in these IgA-CIC, despite the association of DH with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, suggests that the IgA-CIC in DH may be similar to those seen in the IgA nephropathies and represent IgA rheumatoid factor (RF)-IgG complexes. We have examined the sera of 32 patients with DH, 16 non-DH patients positive for RF by latex fixation, and 15 normal subjects for IgA and IgM RF using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and for IgA-CIC using an anti-C3 ELISA. Thirteen of 16 (81%) latex fixation test-positive patients had IgA RF by ELISA and 15/16 (94%) had IgM RF by ELISA. The total amount of RF detected by the ELISA (IgA + IgM RF) correlated with the latex fixation titer (r = 0.678, p = 0.004) in these latex fixation-positive patients. Six of the 16 (38%) latex fixation-positive patients also were found to have IgA-CIC. Solid phase absorption using goat antihuman C3 decreased the levels of immune complexes but not the level of IgA RF, suggesting the IgA-CIC detected do not represent uncomplexed IgA RF. In contrast, although 12 of 31 (39%) patients with DH had IgA-CIC ranging in amount from 0.331-26.0 micrograms IgA/ml (nl less than 0.150 microgram IgA/ml), only 1 of 32 (3%) DH patients had detectable levels of IgA RF (7.0 micrograms IgA/ml, nl less than 2.0 micrograms IgA/ml). Low levels of IgM RF were found in 8/32 (25%) of patients with DH (1.1-1.6 micrograms IgM/ml, nl less than 1.0 microgram IgM/ml). These data document that IgA RF is not present in the sera of patients with DH independent of the presence or absence of IgA-CIC and that it is unlikely that the IgA-CIC present are IgA RF complexed with autologous IgG.","['Hall RP', 'Eyre RW']",1987,89,1,J Invest Dermatol,Hall RP and Eyre RW.

Six of the DH patients had entirely normal jejunal morphology on a normal diet. Jejunal biopsy specimens were taken before and at the end of the study. Measurements of crypts, villi, and crypt mitoses were made on microdissected specimens; disaccharidases were assayed, and intraepithelial lymphocyte counts performed. In one of the six adult volunteers, gluten loading produced diarrhoea and jejunal biopsy abnormalities. Five DH patients on a gluten-free diet had deterioration of biopsy pathology after the gluten challenge. Features suggestive of a latent gluten-sensitive enteropathy were found in one of the other six DH patients; he developed disaccharidase deficiencies and villus atrophy when 20 g gluten was added to his usual gluten-containing diet. This study supports previous suggestions that a gluten-sensitive enteropathy may be latent and dose-related.","['Ferguson A', 'Blackwell JN', 'Barnetson RS']",1987,22,5,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Ferguson A, et al.

3298333,The pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis: recent advances.,"Over the last two decades a rapid expansion of our knowledge regarding dermatitis herpetiformis has occurred, including the discovery of IgA in the skin, the discovery of an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy, the noting of an increased prevalence of the human lymphocyte antigens (HLA)-B8 and -DRw3, and the documentation that the skin disease of many dermatitis herpetiformis patients can be controlled by a gluten-free diet. It has also been noted that two distinct forms of dermatitis herpetiformis occur, those with granular deposits of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction (85%-95% of dermatitis herpetiformis patients) and those with linear IgA deposits (10%-15% of dermatitis herpetiformis patients). These findings are reviewed with particular emphasis on the form of dermatitis herpetiformis associated with granular IgA deposits. The current findings regarding the nature and origin of the cutaneous IgA deposits, the role of the gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and the spectrum of both the immunologic and the nonimmunologic abnormalities associated with dermatitis herpetiformis are presented, and from these data pathophysiologic mechanisms are proposed that may be involved in dermatitis herpetiformis.",['Hall RP'],1987,16,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,Hall RP.

3553340,Dermatitis herpetiformis: extraction of intact IgA from granular deposits in dermal papillae.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized by the granular deposition of IgA in the dermal papillary tips. The source and antigenic specificity of this IgA are unknown, largely because of the previous inability to isolate it for study. These granular IgA deposits, pathognomonic of DH, have been specifically isolated from 4-mm punch biopsies. Specific isolation was achieved by removing contaminating serum IgA by a combination of washes in saline and sodium dodecyl sulfate without a reducing agent present and mechanical isolation of papillary dermis. The tissue IgA was then solubilized by a buffer containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, a reducing agent. Immunoreactive alpha chains were recovered in eluates of DH skin in 6-fold greater amounts than in eluates of normal skin, coincident with disappearance of immunofluorescent-staining granular deposits of IgA. Extracted specific IgA was recovered in sufficient quantity for detection by immunoenzymatic stain, was partially composed of a native (165 Kd) molecular mass, and had alpha and kappa staining material, all indicating that the extracted immunoglobulin was in part intact.","['Meyer LJ', 'Carioto L', 'Zone JJ']",1987,88,5,J Invest Dermatol,"Meyer LJ, et al.

3294944,Bullous pemphigoid.,"Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering dermatologic disease characterized clinically by tense bullae that may develop on normal or erythematous skin. The major histologic feature is a subepidermal blister with variable degrees of dermal inflammation. Other immunologically mediated blistering skin diseases may mimic bullous pemphigoid, including herpes gestationis, cicatricial pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. These diseases will be discussed. Most patients with bullous pemphigoid demonstrate circulating autoantibodies reactive with an antigen located in the lamina lucida region of the basement membrane zone. Complement activation by these autoantibodies initiates influx and activation of mast cells along with other inflammatory cells. Tissue injury with damage and eventual destruction of the basement membrane occurs as a result of the release of inflammatory mediators. The final result is subepidermal blister formation. The course of bullous pemphigoid tends to be self-limited, and successful treatment is usually effected with systemic glucocorticosteroids.",['Korman N'],1987,16,5 Pt 1,J Am Acad Dermatol,Korman N.

IgA deposits in the dermal papillae of the skin are the hallmark of DH and are employed routinely in establishing its diagnosis. The incidence of IgA deposits in skin varies depending upon the site and type of biopsy specimen taken. We studied sera and skin biopsy specimens for EmA and for IgA deposits in the skin from 11 DH patients. EmA were detected in the sera of 10 of the 11 cases. Of these 11 patients, 9 were positive for IgA deposits in their skin, as revealed by direct immunofluorescence (IF). The immune deposits were detected in the normal, and not in the lesional skin. DH cases that were initially negative on biopsy and serum positive for EmA were found to be positive when a repeat biopsy of the normal skin was performed.

Arotinoid ethyl ester and arotinoid-free carboxylic acid are effective in minimal doses 500-fold lower than etretinate. Arotinoid ethyl ester was shown not to increase serum lipids. Arotinoid ethyl sulfone is the first retinoid without bone toxicity in animal experiments. Motretinide is the ethylamide of tretinoin and is reported to be effective in the local treatment of acne. Some of the new polyaromatic retinoids appear to have sebosuppressive, antikeratinizing and/or anti--inflammatory effects via topical application.",['Gollnick H'],1987,175 Suppl 1,,Dermatologica,Gollnick H.

3294600,Detection of antigliadin antibodies in bullous diseases and their recognition of similar antigenic polypeptides.,"The presence of antigliadin antibodies (AGA) in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) has been associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Because of the discrepancies in the specificity of AGA, we examined the sera of patients with DH, pemphigus and pemphigoid for AGA both by enzyme immunoassay and by immunofluorescence. Approximately 80-90% of sera of patients with DH had AGA. AGA were not disease-specific, they also occurred in about 40-80% of patients with pemphigus and pemphigoid depending on the method employed. In addition, AGA were also present in normal subjects. The incidence of AGA increased with age. AGA from patients with various bullous diseases recognized the same polypeptides thus suggesting that the presence of AGA cannot be regarded as a serological marker of DH.","['Kumar V', 'Jain N', 'Beutner EH', 'Chorzelski TP']",1987,83,2,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol,"Kumar V, et al.

3118821,Gliadins bind to reticulin in a lectin-like manner.,"It has previously been reported that gliadins bind to reticulin in tissue sections. Three lines of evidence are reported in this study which indicate that the gliadins bind to reticulins because they are lectins which bind to sugars expressed on glycoproteins in reticulin and other sites. First, immunofluorescence studies on tissue sections showed that although gliadin binding is largely confined to areas rich in reticulin, it is, nonetheless, also seen in one or two other sites devoid of reticulin. Second, by using fluorescein-labelled lectins of known specificity, it has been shown that the areas to which gliadins bind in tissue sections (including those sites devoid of reticulin) are rich in particular sugars. Third, it has been shown that one of these sugars, alpha-D-mannose, partially inhibited gliadin binding to tissue sections.","['Unsworth DJ', 'Leonard JN', 'Hobday CM', 'Griffiths CE', 'Powles AV', 'Haffenden GP', 'Fry L']",1987,279,4,Arch Dermatol Res,"Unsworth DJ, et al.

The relevant findings of this study were as follows: herpes simplex virus 2 was isolated in 10% of the patients, 6% of cases occurred in the first six months of life, infection was multifocal in 36% of cases, autoinoculation was a frequent route of transmission of genital primary infection in young children, herpetic Kaposi-Juliusberg's pustulosis in infants with atopic dermatitis was the most severe presentation of primary infection and should be more adequately prevented.","['Taieb A', 'Body S', 'Astar I', 'du Pasquier P', 'Maleville J']",1987,76,1,Acta Paediatr Scand,"Taieb A, et al.

2442946,Relationship of dietary gluten intake to dapsone dose in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The gluten intake was quantitated utilizing a dietary history method in 43 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on non-restricted diet. The mean daily gluten intake was 15 g. The individual intake of gluten was related to the maintenance dose of dapsone. It was significantly higher in patients on 100-150 mg dapsone daily than in those taking 0-25 mg daily. There was a significant correlation between amount of gluten in the diet and the dapsone dose (p less than 0.01, rs = 0.43). Villous atrophy was not related to the dapsone dose. It is suggested that the gluten-sensitive enteropathy changes the intestinal permeability and thus contributes to the development of blisters.","['Mobacken H', 'Andersson H', 'Dahlberg E', 'Kastrup W']",1987,67,3,Acta Derm Venereol,"Mobacken H, et al.

2438879,Experience with a gluten free diet in the treatment of linear IgA disease.,"A study was undertaken to determine whether the skin eruption of linear IgA disease (LAD) was gluten dependent. Six patients with LAD were treated with a gluten free diet (GFD) for an average period of 33 months (range 19-48). Although one patient with LAD had an enteropathy which was clearly gluten sensitive, there was no convincing evidence that the rash of any of the patients responded to a GFD. Four of the six patients showed no significant alteration in their drug requirements. The remaining 2 patients showed a fall in minimum drug requirement but there was no increase after gluten challenge indicating that they were entering spontaneous remission. This contrasts to the situation in dermatitis herpetiformis, where both the rash and the enteropathy are gluten dependent. These data add further to the evidence that LAD and dermatitis herpetiformis are separate entities.","['Leonard JN', 'Griffiths CE', 'Powles AV', 'Haffenden GP', 'Fry L']",1987,67,2,Acta Derm Venereol,"Leonard JN, et al.

In all of the 15 patients whose jejunal biopsy was studied after the eventual gluten challenge the jejunal lesion had returned in 2.4 to 28 months. The numbers of IgA- and IgM-containing cells were similarly raised in primary and postchallenge biopsies. In the 13 patients whose skin improved during a gluten free diet and who were challenged with gluten the rash worsened and the dapsone/sulphapyridine requirement increased. The jejunal deterioration was equally marked in the six patients whose gluten challenge was stopped because of an intractable rash as it was in those who completed the preplanned challenge. The specimens of the former, however, had significantly more IgA-containing cells than specimens of the latter. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes clearly reflected the degree of intestinal damage. IgA-containing cells proved to be the most sensitive indicator of an immune reaction taking place in the gut of these patients. Even in the two children with initially normal or nearly normal jejunal mucosa, the IgA cell counts in the jejunal lamina propria were markedly raised.","['Kósnai I', 'Kárpati S', 'Savilahti E', 'Verkasalo M', 'Bucsky P', 'Török E']",1986,27,12,Gut,"Kósnai I, et al.

3541947,Juvenile blistering diseases: the problems of diagnosis and treatment.,"Correct clinical diagnosis in cases of chronic, relapsing, non-hereditary, blistering diseases in childhood could not be made without the aid of histopathology and immunofluorescence, since the morphology and the distribution of the lesions of bullous pemphigoid (BP), linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LAD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) may be similar. Histopathology was helpful in about half of the cases. The results of immunopathology were very useful for the final diagnosis. Of twenty-one cases of juvenile blistering diseases, two cases which showed IgG on direct test with circulating antibodies were BP; three cases with deposition of IgG but without circulating antibodies were probably BP; three cases were either BP or LAD (IgG and IgA on direct test without circulating antibodies); nine cases were definite LAD (linear IgA only); one case which showed granular IgA in the dermal papillae and linear IgA was DH; and the last three cases were probably LAD and BP with non-immunoreactant deposits. Regardless of the diagnosis, dapsone and co-trimoxazole controlled eight cases and could be discontinued without relapse, while the other six cases were maintained on dapsone therapy alone. Prednisolone, when added in cases of poor response to either dapsone or co-trimoxazole, caused remission and was discontinued in three out of the five cases. Two cases were lost to follow up.","['Piamphongsant T', 'Sirimachan S', 'Himmunknan P']",1986,4,2,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,"Piamphongsant T, et al.

Eighteen of 25 patients on a normal diet had an IgA class antibody showing the following staining patterns on substrate jejunums: tubular positivity in the lamina propria--around the crypts, beneath the villous epithelial basement membrane, and in some instances in the middle of the villous also, following the capillary system of villi; coalescence of tubular positivity at the muscularis mucosae; and positive blood vessels and smooth muscle endomysium. Eleven of 18 children with positive sera were put on a gluten-free diet (GFD) and their sera became negative. One of these 11 patients was challenged with gluten and the antibody reappeared. Nineteen patients examined only on a GFD and 30 healthy blood donors did not have this antibody. There was no strict correlation between the titer of antibody and the severity of jejunal mucosal damage.","['Kárpáti S', 'Török E', 'Kósnai I']",1986,87,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Kárpáti S, et al.

3802182,Evidence for cell generation controlled proliferation in the small intestinal crypt.,"In this paper we discuss the hypothesis that cell proliferation is controlled by the number of generations after leaving an 'eternal' stem cell. The theory is based on a simulation of the kinetic behaviour of cells in the intestinal crypts. There is evidence of three, four and five generations of cells which are allowed to enter mitosis in the lower and upper part of the normal intestinal tract, and in some disease states, respectively. We suggest an internal proliferation control: some kind of knowledge that cells carry from generation to generation. It is an open question what sets and changes the generation counter: internal genetic information or external influences such as growth factors or chalones. The geometric shape of the epithelial tissue in the intestinal tract can be understood as the steady state of a highly dynamic process. Age and death are determined from the beginning; cell-cell interaction or communication is not necessary and can be neglected. Our theory will be illustrated using the intestinal crypts as they are easily accessible, of a simple structure and completely described in the literature.","['Meinzer HP', 'Sandblad B']",1986,19,6,Cell Tissue Kinet,Meinzer HP and Sandblad B.

3769223,Avidity of antigliadin IgA and IgG antibodies in gluten-sensitive enteropathy and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Antigliadin antibodies (AGA) of IgG and IgA class were assayed with a modified enzymeimmunoassay in serum samples of 18 patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy and 30 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. No difference between antibody amount or avidity of the two groups of patients was observed. Avidity and total amount of AGA were also compared in 15 patients with a recent diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis and in 15 patients with a disease history of several years without a proper gluten-free diet. No difference in IgG antibodies was found but the amount of high avidity IgA antibodies was significantly higher in patients with several years' experience of dermatitis herpetiformis than in those with a recent diagnosis. The results indicate that in dermatitis herpetiformis, maturation of IgA response occurs. Further, clinically, maturation of anti-gliadin IgA response during the disease can increase the sensitivity of the patient against diet-derived gliadin.","['Vainio E', 'Collin P', 'Lehtonen OP']",1986,41,2,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,"Vainio E, et al.

Monomeric serum IgA is assumed to originate in the gastrointestinal tract, and circulating IgA immune complexes, as seen in dermatitis herpetiformis, should make us suspicious of a gastrointestinal tract source. These circulating immune complexes and perhaps polyclonal increases in serum IgA may be the result of minor perturbations of mucosal permeability or the failure of locally produced dimeric serum IgA to inactivate bacterial or dietary antigens. Such disparate entities as Reiter's syndrome, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as the pustular eruptions of Behçet's syndrome, pustular psoriasis, and lithium therapy, may share this common pathogenesis.","['Person JR', 'Bernhard JD']",1986,15,3,J Am Acad Dermatol,Person JR and Bernhard JD.

AGA were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ARA with an immunofluorescence method. Increased IgA or IgG class AGA levels were found in four of ten children on a normal diet, in two of 25 on a gluten-free diet (GFD), and in two of four children on gluten challenge. The corresponding figures for ARA were nine of ten, two of 25, and four of four, respectively. All nine patients with ARA on a normal diet had either subtotal or partial villous atrophy, whereas the patient negative for ARA had a normal jejunal mucosa. ARA were mostly of IgA class, and after gluten withdrawal, increased levels fell to normal range. Four children were challenged with gluten, and they all developed subtotal villous atrophy and demonstrated IgA class ARA. These results suggest that in childhood DH, ARA is a more sensitive indicator of gluten-sensitive enteropathy than AGA, but both antibody determinations can be used in monitoring adherence to GFD treatment.","['Vainio E', 'Kosnai I', 'Hällström O', 'Karpati S', 'Mäki M', 'Reunala T']",1986,5,5,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,"Vainio E, et al.

3093545,Sensitivity and specificity of IgA-class antiendomysial antibodies for dermatitis herpetiformis and findings relevant to their pathogenic significance.,"The specificity and sensitivity of the recently reported IgA-class antiendomysial antibody test for gluten-sensitive enteropathy were evaluated in four double-blind studies involving the sera of fifty-seven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis who were not on a gluten-free diet and ninety-seven assorted control sera. The control sera provided by the four centers included the sera of nineteen patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and two with celiac disease who were on a gluten-free diet, the sera of five normal subjects with human lymphocyte antigens (B8 locus), the sera of thirteen patients with linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and fifty-eight other control sera, mostly from patients with other bullous diseases and other dermatoses. The frequency of IgA antiendomysial antibody in these coded studies was zero of ninety-seven control sera and thirty-four of fifty-seven sera (60%) from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis who were not on a gluten-free diet. The pathogenic role of IgA antiendomysial antibodies in dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease is suggested not only by their high degree of disease sensitivity and specificity but also by their formation in response to gluten challenge, their appearance before gut changes, and the in vitro binding of gliadin to the antiendomysial antibody antigen sites.

Its epidermal and dermal occurrence was investigated in formalin-fixed routine biopsy material from eleven different inflammatory skin disorders. Localization was performed with a rabbit antiserum to L1 applied in an unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. L1 antigen was not found in normal skin except in epithelial cells of pilosebaceous units. However, epidermal L1 antigen was demonstrated in every biopsy specimen from lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, dermatitis herpetiformis, and atopic dermatitis, whereas granuloma annulare test results were usually negative. The occurrence of dermal L1 antigen depended on the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate; specimens rich in neutrophilic granulocytes (e.g., dermatitis herpetiformis) were particularly strongly stained. Extracellular dermal staining was also seen, especially in areas adjacent to accumulation of positive leukocytes. The varying epidermal occurrence of L1 antigen in skin diseases probably signified different degrees of proliferative activity of the epithelial cells and could apparently not be ascribed to uptake from the dermis.","['Gabrielsen TO', 'Dale I', 'Brandtzaeg P', 'Hoel PS', 'Fagerhol MK', 'Larsen TE', 'Thune PO']",1986,15,2 Pt 1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Gabrielsen TO, et al.

Enteric alterations demonstrated by measurement of D-xylose absorption and by small intestinal biopsies were detected in over 90% of all patients. A complete follow-up was obtained for all children who were followed for 3 to 10 years. Treatment with a gluten-free diet alone led to a reversal of the intestinal abnormality in 100% of our children and to the disappearance of cutaneous lesions in 82% of reported cases. This suggests that a complete remission of symptoms can be obtained with a gluten-free diet alone. Dapsone alone is effective therapy for the rash but does not affect the intestinal alterations. Furthermore, the lack of side effects to dietetic therapy for a long period of time makes the diet the treatment of choice in this disease.","['Ermacora E', 'Prampolini L', 'Tribbia G', 'Pezzoli G', 'Gelmetti C', 'Cucchi G', 'Tettamanti A', 'Giunta A', 'Gianotti F']",1986,15,1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Ermacora E, et al.

3530584,Clinical pharmacokinetics of dapsone.,"Dapsone (DDS) has for about 4 decades been the most important antileprosy drug. Concentrations of dapsone and its monoacetyl metabolite, MADDS, can be determined in biological media by high-performance liquid chromatography. After oral administration, the drug is slowly absorbed, the maximum concentration in plasma being reached at about 4 hours, with an absorption half-life of about 1.1 hours. However, the extent of absorption has not been adequately determined. The elimination half-life of dapsone is about 30 hours. The drug shows linear pharmacokinetics within the therapeutic range and the time-course after oral administration fits a 2-compartment model. The concentration-time profile of dapsone after parenteral administration is reviewed. Of clinical importance is the development of a new long acting injection, which permits monthly supervised administration as recommended by the World Health Organization. Following dapsone injection in gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue, a sufficiently sustained absorption for this purpose has been reported. Dapsone is about 70 to 90% protein bound and its monoacetylated metabolite (MADDS) is almost completely protein bound. The volume of distribution of dapsone is estimated to be 1.5 L/kg. It is distributed in most tissues, but M. leprae living in the Schwann cells of the nerves might be unaffected. Dapsone crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk and saliva. Dapsone is extensively metabolised. Dapsone, some MADDS and their hydroxylated metabolites are found in urine, partly conjugated as N-glucuronides and N-sulphates. The acetylation ratio (MADDS:dapsone) shows a genetically determined bimodal distribution and allows the definition of 'slow' and 'rapid' acetylators. As enterohepatic circulation occurs, the elimination half-life of dapsone is markedly decreased after oral administration of activated charcoal. This permits successful treatment in cases of intoxication. The daily dose of dapsone in leprosy is 50 to 100mg, but varies from 50 to 400mg in the treatment of other dermatological disorders. In malaria prophylaxis, a weekly dose of 100mg is used in combination with pyrimethamine. Side effects are mostly not serious below a daily dose of 100mg and are mainly haematological effects. The dapsone therapeutic serum concentration range can be defined as 0.5 to 5 mg/L. Alcoholic liver disease decreases the protein binding of dapsone; coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis may delay its oral absorption and severe leprosy has been reported to affect the extent of absorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Zuidema J', 'Hilbers-Modderman ES', 'Merkus FW']",1986,11,4,Clin Pharmacokinet,"Zuidema J, et al.

We have examined the significance of IEL mitosis in jejunal biopsies with normal villi. Counts of IEL per 100 villus enterocytes, and IEL mitosis per 1000 IEL, were carried out in 81 jejunal biopsies. Thirty one were from patients with coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, and many of these, from treated patients, were histologically normal; 40 were from patients with other diagnoses, selected to include biopsies with a high IEL count (greater than 40 IEL per 100 enterocytes) but normal villi. Three coeliacs and 10 dermatitis herpetiformis patients had an IEL count of less than 40, and no IEL mitoses were found in these biopsies. Two dermatitis herpetiformis patients had IEL counts of 43.7% and 43.9%, with no IEL mitoses, but in all other coeliac and dermatitis herpetiformis biopsies high IEL counts were associated with IEL mitotic indices between 0.05% and 1.77%. In the non-coeliac, non-dermatitis herpetiformis group, no IEL mitoses were found in the 22 biopsies with IEL count less than 43%. In the others, IEL counts ranged from 44.8% to 127.0%, and IEL mitoses were present, with mitotic indices ranging from 0.06% to 0.49%.

The eruptions presented small, tense bullae with or without erythematous changes of the surrounding skin, some of which clustered around the resolving lesions. Histologic examination of the eruptions showed subepidermal, ultrastructurally suprabasal laminar blister formation with infiltration of the polymorphonuclear cells and large mononuclear cells in the blister cavity. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed IgA deposits at the basilar surface of the basal keratinocytes of the lesional skin, as well as the presence of circulating IgA-class antibodies reacting to the basilar surface of the hemidesmosomes. The eruptions responded well to a combination therapy of small doses of a corticosteroid agent and a sulfonamide. There were neither clinical nor laboratory findings suggesting dermatitis herpetiformis.

A serologic marker of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Direct immunofluorescence (IF) studies of skin biopsies are of value in the diagnosis of most, but not all, cases of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Similarly, histologic studies are of help but may be questionable or completely nonspecific. Serologic studies for the presence of IgA-class anti-endomysial antibodies are very specific and are found in 70% of patients with DH and in all untreated patients with celiac disease. The titers of these antibodies are directly associated with the degree of gut disease in these patients. Thus, the presence of these antibodies even in the absence of classic direct IF and histologic findings are diagnostically important. We encountered three cases in which both direct IF and histologic studies were equivocal toward confirming the clinical diagnosis of DH. Serologic studies for the presence of IgA-class anti-endomysial antibodies provided evidence for the diagnosis of DH, and, in each case, results were confirmed by further direct IF studies. Since these antibodies are disease specific for DH and celiac disease and are found in most active cases of DH, they may be considered an adjunct to the direct IF and histologic studies of the skin.","['Accetta P', 'Kumar V', 'Beutner EH', 'Chorzelski TP', 'Helm F']",1986,122,4,Arch Dermatol,"Accetta P, et al.

3082293,Dermatitis herpetiformis. Cutaneous deposition of polyclonal IgA1.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a pruritic papulovesicular skin disorder of unknown cause, characterized by granular IgA deposits in the dermis along the dermoepidermal junction. It is associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy and increased IgA production by gut lymphoid tissue. We report four cases of immunologically documented DH studied by immunofluorescence technique. Monoclonal antibodies against the IgA subclasses IgA1 and IgA2 were used. IgA1 without IgA2 was found in the cutaneous deposits in each case. The IgA1 had both kappa and lambda light chains in approximately equal quantities. Because normal gut-associated lymphoid tissue produces 70% IgA1 and 30% IgA2, while circulating IgA is primarily IgA1, it could be concluded that the IgA in the skin of DH patients is not produced in the gut. However, the subclass restriction of the IgA produced by pathologic gut-associated lymphoid tissue is unknown. Alternatively, both IgA1 and IgA2 may be produced by the gut, but only IgA1 is involved in the production of cutaneous lesions.","['Olbricht SM', 'Flotte TJ', 'Collins AB', 'Chapman CM', 'Harrist TJ']",1986,122,4,Arch Dermatol,"Olbricht SM, et al.

The prevalence in men showed no significant variation with age, whereas in women age-specific prevalence varied markedly, with a peak of 126/100,000 at ages 35-44 yr and a low of 28/100,000 at ages 45-54 yr. This variation could not readily be explained, although reduced case ascertainment among women born between 1925 and 1934 could be the basis of a modest cohort effect. There was no evidence that migration or increased mortality at particular ages might be alternative explanations. In children the incidence of celiac disease, as measured by cumulative prevalence with age, increased more than twofold between 1960 and 1975, but since 1976 it has fallen sharply. The fall in incidence in children and the unexplained variations in prevalence in women provide epidemiologic evidence for the role of environmental factors other than gluten ingestion in the etiology of celiac disease.","['Logan RF', 'Rifkind EA', 'Busuttil A', 'Gilmour HM', 'Ferguson A']",1986,90,2,Gastroenterology,"Logan RF, et al.

3954818,"The relationship between dapsone dose, serum concentration and disease severity in dermatitis herpetiformis.","20 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis maintained on once daily dosing of dapsone were studied to investigate the pharmacodynamics of dapsone in suppressing clinical disease. Multiple correlation analysis was performed on variables including dosage requirements, serum concentration of dapsone and monoacetyl dapsone, acetylation ratio, IgA-containing circulating immune complexes, adherence to a gluten-free diet, and clinical disease severity. It was found that: 1. dapsone exhibits good bioavailability in dermatitis herpetiformis with absorption being unaffected by presumed gluten-sensitive enteropathy; 2. there is wide variation in serum concentrations of dapsone and monoacetyl dapsone with no specific ""therapeutic level""; 3. acetylator phenotype was unrelated to dapsone dose requirement; 4. serum dapsone concentration had only a weak correlation with disease severity; and 5. there was poor correlation between IgA circulating immune complexes and dapsone serum concentration. The use of daily dapsone dose requirements or dapsone serum concentration necessary for disease suppression as an indicator of disease severity in the research setting is inappropriate. Measurements of serum concentration of the parent drug (dapsone) or principal metabolite (monoacetyl dapsone) do not serve as a useful guide to therapeutic management.","['Sanders SW', 'Zone JJ']",1986,36,1,Arzneimittelforschung,"Sanders SW and Zone JJ.

The incidence of DH was 1.05-1.13/100,000 inhabitants/year and the prevalence was approximately 20-25/100,000 inhabitants. In one-third of DH patients the age at onset was greater than 60 years. In women with DH a strong connection to thyroid dysfunction was observed, but also other conditions of probable autoimmune pathogenesis were found in both sexes. No connection to malignant disease was observed. DH seems to be less active the later in life it starts. Several patients with DH manage without dapsone or need dapsone just occasionally in connection with bouts. This is the case even without a gluten-free diet. Many mild cases of DH were observed without a gluten-free diet; therefore, this restricting regimen should be prescribed only in more active cases of DH.","['Christensen OB', 'Hindsén M', 'Svensson A']",1986,173,6,Dermatologica,"Christensen OB, et al.

3789802,Serum antibodies to wheat germ agglutinin and gluten in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"It has been speculated that gluten may play a role in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) because it can act as a lectin. The lectin activity of gluten preparations was recently identified as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). IgG and IgA serum antibodies to WGA and gluten were therefore measured in patients with DH and coeliac disease (CD) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Compared with healthy controls, both patients categories had increased IgG and IgA activities to WGA and gluten, the CD group showing the highest antibody levels. DH patients with subtotal villous atrophy tended to have higher activities than those with no villous changes or only minor changes. No significant difference in the gluten-to-WGA ratio of IgA or IgG antibodies was found when DH patients were compared with CD patients. If WGA plays a pathogenetic role in DH, then DH patients must have dermal characteristics, as yet undefined, that explain the initiation of their skin disease.","['Sollid LM', 'Scott H', 'Kolberg J', 'Brandtzaeg P']",1986,278,6,Arch Dermatol Res,"Sollid LM, et al.

Low serum vitamin B12 levels were found in 27 patients (21%) and achlorhydria in 30. Forty-two patients with achlorhydria and/or vitamin B12 deficiency were subjected to further haematological and gastrointestinal investigations. Functional or morphological involvement of the small intestine was seen in almost all patients with vitamin B12 deficiency but, in addition, atrophic gastritis resulting in defective secretion of intrinsic factor (pernicious anaemia) was found in 8 cases (7% of all DH patients). Thus, a low vitamin B12 level in DH patients should result in a careful gastrointestinal examination as both an atrophic gastritis and a coeliac-like enteropathy have further clinical implications.","['Kastrup W', 'Mobacken H', 'Stockbrügger R', 'Swolin B', 'Westin J']",1986,220,3,Acta Med Scand,"Kastrup W, et al.

Serum anti-milk antibodies were shown to be distributed predominantly between the IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses, whereas anti-gliadin antibodies in atopic eczema were predominantly of the IgG4 subclass. Furthermore, as antibodies to each of these dietary antigens in healthy adults were markedly restricted to the IgG4 subclass, their production may be part of a normal immune response to dietary proteins. There was no correlation between serum IgG4 antibody and total serum IgG4 level. In contrast, restricted IgG4 anti-gliadin antibodies were less prevalent in the serum of patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, suggesting defective downstream switching of Ig heavy-chain genes in these conditions.","['Barnes RM', 'Harvey MM', 'Blears J', 'Finn R', 'Johnson PM']",1986,81,2,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol,"Barnes RM, et al.

The results were correlated to the jejunal morphology and to the serum AGA values as quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunoblotting analysis disclosed a distinct pattern of AGA which was similar in patients with DH and GSE. In both diseases individual variation in IgG class AGA patterns was large, suggesting that several antigenic determinants are involved in the AGA response. The IgA class AGA pattern was clearly more homogeneous. The sera with several bands in immunoblotting had the highest AGA levels in ELISA. Strong staining in the main gliadin area (bands from 31 to 38 kd) indicated severely damaged intestinal mucosa whereas the serum of DH patients with partial villous atrophy or normal mucosa showed usually weaker staining. The immunoblotting pattern of sera from healthy controls was even weaker but was directed against the same polypeptides as in the patients suggesting a quantitative rather than qualitative difference between healthy and diseased subjects. This difference was, however, more obvious in the IgA than in the IgG class AGA pattern possibly indicating a more fundamental defect in the regulation of synthesis of IgA isotype in DH and GSE.",['Vainio E'],1986,80,2,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol,Vainio E.

3551745,[Erythema annulare centrifugum revealing linear IgA dermatitis of childhood].,"Linear IgA dermatitis was diagnosed in a 13-year old girl with erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) on the basis of the criteria laid down by Jablonska: vesiculo-bullous eruption with specific patterns on subsequent flare-ups, subepidermal vesicles and bullae with papillary eosinophilic abscesses in erythematous areas, positive linear IgA antibody response at direct immunofluorescence in the lamina basal, absence of intolerance to gluten and responsiveness to sulfapyridine and dapsone. This patient was followed up for 10 years. During the first 5 years any attempt at withdrawing dapsone resulted in quick relapse which always remained responsive to that drug. After 5 years discontinuing dapsone was no longer followed by relapse, and the girl was considered clinically cured. Yet direct immunofluorescence in healthy skin remained positive for 2 years after treatment was stopped, as has previously been reported. At the age of 23, after 5 years without treatment the patient remained cured. This case demonstrates that linear IgA dermatitis is one of the causes of EAC. Autoimmune bullous diseases, such as pemphigus with eosinophilic spongiosis, bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis, are known to present as EAC. Direct cutaneous immunofluorescence is necessary to the aetiological diagnosis of EAC.","['Larrègue M', 'Bressieux JM', 'Laidet B', 'Cavaroc Y', 'Gallet P', 'de Giacomoni P', 'Touchard G']",1986,113,12,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Larrègue M, et al.

This effect was not influenced by simultaneous gluten challenge in one patient. A possible explanation is a reduction in the amount of harmful immune complexes due to the elimination of proteins from the diet. Subsequent introduction of a more comprehensive diet led to an increase of the minimal effective dose of Dapsone.

3909813,The sprue syndromes.,"The sprue syndromes, tropical and nontropical sprue, were both described as disease entities in the 1880s and share similar morphological features with varying degrees of villus atrophy of the small intestinal mucosa, and both present clinically with malabsorption. Recent cell kinetic studies of the turnover of the intestinal epithelium in sprue have convincingly demonstrated that the flat mucosa is caused by increased efflux (cell death) with compensatory crypt hyperplasia. The pathogenetic insult in tropical sprue appears to be a persistent overgrowth of the small intestine by enteric pathogens after a bout of turista. The pathogenesis of nontropical sprue is determined by both genetic factors, demonstrated with a strong association with certain HLA haplotypes (B8, DR3, DR7 and DC3) and presumably also environmental events (virus infection?), which render the mucosa susceptible to gluten. The cause of the malabsorption syndrome is multifactorial and results from both intraluminal and cellular events. The digestion of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids is compromised due to decreased pancreatic and biliary secretion. The absorption of the digestive products is also severely affected due to decreased activity of microvillus enzymes (dipeptidases and disaccharidases) and a presumed reduction in the number of transport carriers. The clinical presentation is identical and the distinction between tropical and nontropical sprue is based on the history (ie, exposure to a tropical environment) and the response to treatment. Tropical sprue is cured by treatment with tetracycline and folic acid, whereas nontropical sprue responds to a gluten-free diet. Nontropical sprue is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis by common genetic and morphological features, and the skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis are also responsive to a gluten-free diet. Finally, there appears to be an increased incidence of intestinal malignancies (lymphoma, adenocarcinoma) in nontropical sprue.",['Westergaard H'],1985,290,6,Am J Med Sci,Westergaard H.

The mean (+/- SD) 24 hour urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA in 34 healthy volunteers was 1.9 +/- 0.5% of the orally administered test dose. Patients with untreated coeliac disease (19) or untreated dermatitis herpetiformis (five) excreted significantly more 51Cr-EDTA than controls (5.9 +/- 2.7% and 4.6 +/- 2.1%, respectively, p less than 0.001) and all were outside the normal range of 1.0-2.6%. Patients with coeliac disease (42) treated for 6 months-23 years (mean 5 years) and patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (11) treated for 6 months-8 years (mean 3 years) excreted significantly more 51Cr-EDTA than controls, 4.2 +/- 2.4% p less than 0.0001 and 3.0 +/- 0.9% p less than 0.003 respectively. Eleven of 14 (79%) treated patients with coeliac disease with an entirely normal jejunal mucosae demonstrated abnormal intestinal permeability. Intestinal permeability did not correlate significantly with either the mucosal height/crypt depth ratio or intraepithelial lymphocyte counts in jejunal biopsies from patients with untreated or treated coeliac disease. The demonstration of a persistent increase in intestinal permeability in patients with both coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis may suggest a common pathogenetic mechanism in both disorders. It is postulated that altered permeability may facilitate the entry of gluten or a fraction thereof into the lamina propria where it causes a cascade of immunological events.","['Bjarnason I', 'Marsh MN', 'Price A', 'Levi AJ', 'Peters TJ']",1985,26,11,Gut,"Bjarnason I, et al.

A retrospective study of 234 cases of BP, 27 cases of LABD, 60 cases of DH, and 20 cases of cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) revealed that BP patients are significantly older than LABD or DH patients and LABD patients are significantly older than DH patients. BP and CP occur more frequently in women (65-70%) than LABD or DH (44-48%). The frequencies of C3 deposits in the basement membrane zone (BMZ) are significantly higher in BP (85%) compared with LABD (18.5%) and DH (28.3%). LABD patients varied in their response to various therapeutic agents. Some responded to corticosteroids and some to sulfones alone, whereas others required a combination of corticosteroids and sulfones.","['Wilson BD', 'Beutner EH', 'Kumar V', 'Chorzelski TP', 'Jablonska S']",1985,24,9,Int J Dermatol,"Wilson BD, et al.

3904541,Interactions between food antigens and the immune system in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases.,"This review details the evidence that interactions between food antigens and the immune system may play a role in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal diseases. In immediate hypersensitivity reactions to foods involving the gastrointestinal system, in milk-induced gastrointestinal disease in infants and children, and in some forms of hypereosinophilic gastroenteritis, the evidence for the participation of food antigens is extensive. Gluten-induced enteropathy and some forms of dermatitis herpetiformis are also induced by defined food proteins where the response is specific and characteristic. The role of food antigens in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear, and warrants further studies.","['Saavedra-Delgado AM', 'Metcalfe DD']",1985,55,5,Ann Allergy,Saavedra-Delgado AM and Metcalfe DD.

A controlled clinical study of the effect of treatment with a gluten-free diet.,"Serum gliadin antibodies of the IgA and IgG classes were determined by the diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 41 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis before treatment with a gluten-free diet. Increased gliadin antibody levels were found more frequently in patients with subtotal villous atrophy (9 out of 17 patients, or 53%; p less than 0.05) than in patients with partial villous atrophy (2 out of 13 patients, or 15%) or normal villous appearance (2 out of 10 patients, or 20%). The gliadin antibody levels were negatively correlated with the urinary xylose excretion (r = -0.40, p less than 0.02 for the IgA class and r = -0.64, p less than 0.001 for the IgG class). Intestinal morphology improved and mean gliadin antibody levels of the IgA and IgG classes decreased during treatment with a gluten-free diet for 16-36 months (mean, 20 months) (p less than 0.005, n = 26), whereas no significant changes of the gliadin antibody levels or the small-intestinal morphology were observed in the other 15 patients, who continued on a non-restricted diet for 17-35 months (mean, 20 months). Thus, gliadin antibody levels in sera from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis seem to be correlated with the severity of the intestinal disease. However, all patients with villous atrophy are not detected by determination of serum gliadin antibodies.","['Kilander AF', 'Gillberg RE', 'Kastrup W', 'Mobacken H', 'Nilsson LA']",1985,20,8,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Kilander AF, et al.

4020133,Characterization of circulating and cutaneous IgA immune complexes in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic, blistering skin disease characterized in part by deposits of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction. Eighty-five percent of DH patients have granular IgA deposits and have an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). In contrast, 15% of DH patients have a linear pattern of IgA deposits and no associated intestinal abnormality. Although circulating IgA antibodies against skin are not present in these patients, 40% of DH patients do have IgA-containing circulating immune complexes (IgA-CIC). The role and origin of the cutaneous IgA and the IgA-CIC in patients with DH are unknown; however, the association of GSE with the granular IgA deposits suggests that a mucosal immune response may be important in the pathogenesis of DH. We have characterized the IgA subclass composition of the cutaneous IgA deposits in patients with DH, and have isolated and characterized the IgA-CIC from these patients. Twenty-nine of 29 patients with DH and granular IgA deposits were found to have only IgA1 deposits. Ten of 11 patients with linear IgA deposits also had only IgA1 deposits; one of 11 had IgA2 deposits. Isolated IgA-CIC from the sera of eight patients with DH and granular IgA deposits were found to contain both IgA1 (58% +/- 5, mean percent of total IgA +/- SEM) and IgA2 (42% +/- 5), as were IgA-CIC from two patients with ordinary GSE without cutaneous IgA deposits. The IgA subclass composition of the isolated immune complexes was significantly different from the serum IgA1 and IgA2 composition (serum IgA1 = 76% +/- 6; IgA2 = 24% +/- 5, p less than 0.025, Student's t-test), and suggests that the IgA-CIC may arise from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Sequential anti-IgA1 absorption of serum which contained IgA-CIC did not remove all the IgA-CIC, suggesting that the complexes circulate as separate IgA1 and IgA2 complexes. The finding of IgA1 alone in the skin of patients with DH suggests that the cutaneous IgA may not arise from GALT, or that IgA1, possibly arising in GALT, is preferentially bound to DH skin. Because IgA-containing CIC which contain both IgA1 and IgA2 were found in the serum of patients with DH and with ordinary GSE, it seems unlikely that IgA-containing CIC are responsible for the cutaneous IgA deposits seen in DH.","['Hall RP', 'Lawley TJ']",1985,135,3,J Immunol,Hall RP and Lawley TJ.

3933045,Small intestinal permeability in dermatological disease.,"Passive small intestinal permeability was investigated in 62 patients with atopic eczema, 29 with psoriasis and 18 with dermatitis herpetiformis, using the cellobiose/mannitol differential sugar absorption test. Urinary recovery of cellobiose and mannitol in patients with both psoriasis and eczema were similar to values in a control population, and were not affected by the extent or activity of skin disease. The cellobiose/mannitol recovery ratio was abnormally high in seven patients with eczema, six of whom underwent jejunal biopsy. Jejunal mucosal morphology was normal in five, and one patient was found to have coeliac disease. Cellobiose/mannitol recovery ratio was also abnormal in seven patients with psoriasis, and in 11 with dermatitis herpetiformis, seven of whom had a normal jejunal biopsy. These findings demonstrate that the passive permeability of the small intestine is normal in the majority of patients with atopic eczema and psoriasis. Increased absorption of macromolecules from the gut lumen cannot be ascribed to defective intestinal integrity, and is unlikely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of eczema. Abnormal intestinal permeability may be a more sensitive manifestation of gluten-sensitive enteropathy than jejunal biopsy in dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Hamilton I', 'Fairris GM', 'Rothwell J', 'Cunliffe WJ', 'Dixon MF', 'Axon AT']",1985,56,221,Q J Med,"Hamilton I, et al.

4008982,Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita of the immunopathological type (dermolytic pemphigoid).,"Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) of the immunopathological type is a distinct disease entity which we propose to name dermolytic pemphigoid. Clinical features of this disease are heterogeneous. An inflammatory phase may mimic bullous pemphigoid or, less commonly, mucosal pemphigoid or dermatitis herpetiformis. The noninflammatory mechanobullous phase equates with classic EBA and features marked skin fragility, bullae and/or erosions at sites of trauma, which result in scarring and milia. The inflammatory or the noninflammatory phase may occur separately or in combination. Transition from inflammatory to noninflammatory phases has been seen. Linear basement membrane zone (BMZ) immune deposits of immunoglobulin G (IgG) are present in the lesional and uninvolved skin of affected patients by immunofluorescence and are essential for the diagnosis. Many patients also have circulating antibasement membrane zone IgG antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy localizes the immune deposits in the lamina densa and sublamina densa zone and serves to distinguish this disease from diseases with lamina lucida antibodies, such as bullous pemphigoid and mucosal pemphigoid. The EBA antigen has recently been identified and partially characterized from human skin using circulating antibasement membrane zone antibodies from patients with EBA. The EBA antigen consists of 2 components of Mr 290,000 and 145,000, and were shown to be distinct from other known basement membrane components. Mouse monoclonal antibody, H3a, recognizes the same 290 kilodaltons (kd) and 145 kd proteins and localizes to the lamina densa and sublamina densa zone of human skin. The EBA antigen is a newly recognized basement membrane component that is restricted in its distribution to the BMZ of stratified squamous epithelium of both keratinizing and nonkeratinizing types.","['Briggaman RA', 'Gammon WR', 'Woodley DT']",1985,85,1 Suppl,J Invest Dermatol,"Briggaman RA, et al.

3885903,Immunopathologic studies of adult linear IgA bullous dermatosis.,"Three cases of adult linear IgA bullous dermatosis were examined to determine the types of IgA present in the basement membrane zone. IgA 1 subclass, without IgA2, was identified in all three cases; J chain was identified in only one case. Secretory component was absent in all cases. Two observations can be made from this study. First, the predominance of monomeric IgA1 is more compatible with the pattern of antibody secretion of plasma cells present in extragut sites than in intestinal sites. These findings are further evidence of the distinction between dermatitis herpetiformis, which has polymeric IgA1, and adult linear IgA bullous dermatosis and may suggest an extragut site for the origin of the antibodies. The second observation is that the antibodies in adult linear IgA bullous dermatosis show limited expression of heavy and light chains and molecular size that cannot be explained by origin in any compartment. The origin of this limitation cannot be determined from the present data, but possible explanations include a monoclonal or oligoclonal origin of the plasma cells secreting the anti-basement membrane antibodies, genetic restriction of either the immunoglobulin repertoire or helper T-cell response such that only an IgA subpopulation is permitted to be produced in response to the antigen, and selective absorption from the sera or deposition in the skin.","['Flotte TJ', 'Olbricht SM', 'Collins AB', 'Harrist TJ']",1985,109,5,Arch Pathol Lab Med,"Flotte TJ, et al.

In addition, when taking lithium continuously, psoriasis can be triggered or worsened and the psoriasis tends to be resistant to treatment. Maculo papular eruptions, ulcers, keratosis pilaris like folliculitis, exfoliative dermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis like eruption, and hair loss have been described. Possibly the blood level of lithium plays a decisive role in developing a dermatosis. If the skin side effect is mild, the dermatosis should be treated topically. If the dermatoses under lithium treatment are severe, a reduction in the lithium dosage should possibly be discussed with the psychiatrist. Only rarely does lithium have to be entirely discontinued.",['Albrecht G'],1985,36,2,Hautarzt,Albrecht G. [Undesirable skin reactions to lithium].

3992162,Influence of gluten-free diet on the gastric condition in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Achlorhydric atrophic gastritis occurs in approximately 25% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). The effect of gluten withdrawal on the gastric condition was studied in 35 patients, with a control group of 20 patients continuing their habitual diet. Gastrointestinal examinations were performed initially and repeated after about 1 3/4 years. Adherence to the diet was confirmed by dietary interviews, improvement of malabsorption test results and intestinal villous structure, and decreased dapsone requirement. Neither the non-restricted diet nor the gluten-free diet had any effect on gastric morphology, the ability to secrete gastric acid, serum gastrin levels, or the frequency or titres of circulating parietal cell antibodies. The findings indicate that gluten is not responsible for the perpetuation of the gastric affection in DH, in contrast to the enteropathy.","['Kastrup W', 'Andersson H', 'Gillberg R', 'Mobacken H', 'Stockbrügger R']",1985,20,1,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Kastrup W, et al.

The introduction of a gluten-free diet in patients with villous atrophy produced a statistically significant fall in the testosterone level in those able to discontinue their drug treatment but not in those noticing no change or only a reduction in drug requirements. The serum levels of luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone were increased in nine patients; only one of these had a raised testosterone level and six were over 60 years of age. Four out of twenty married males with DH had no children, a figure higher than expected. Three of these men had elevated gonadotrophin levels although none had an increased serum testosterone. Thus, raised levels of testosterone and gonadotrophin were found in only a minority of men with DH, in contrast to the more marked changes previously reported in males with coeliac disease.","['Gawkrodger DJ', 'Sweeting VM', 'Edwards CR', 'Barnetson RS']",1985,112,1,Br J Dermatol,"Gawkrodger DJ, et al.

Early detection and treatment of these patients may help to slow down the scarring process that eventually leads to a dry eye and blindness. The same is true for a group of patients who present to the dermatologist with a non-scarring bullous dermatosis distinguished by the presence of a linear deposit of IgA along the dermo-epidermal junction of uninvolved skin examined by direct immunofluorescence. The cicatrising conjunctivitis found in about 50 per cent of adults with this condition is indistinguishable from that of cicatricial pemphigoid. Ten per cent of patients with cicatricial pemphigoid affecting mucous membranes alone were found to have linear deposits of IgA along the dermo-epidermal junction of uninvolved skin. This suggested that there may be a common pathogenic pathway with varying clinical expression in these groups of patients and presents new possibilities for therapy in some patients with cicatricial pemphigoid.","['Leonard JN', 'Wright P', 'Haffenden GP', 'Williams DM', 'Griffiths CE', 'Fry L']",1985,104 ( Pt 4),,Trans Ophthalmol Soc U K (1962),"Leonard JN, et al.

Cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical-cord vein were also incubated with the patients' neutrophils to assess AO-induced tissue injury. The AO production by patients' neutrophils was significantly elevated. The patients' neutrophils, as well as those from healthy controls preincubated with patients' serum, produced significantly increased levels of cytotoxic response on coincubation with chromium 51-labeled human endothelial cells. These results suggest that the tissue damage observed in BD may be partially due to both excessive production of AOs by neutrophils and a serum factor present in the patients, and further postulate the similar pathogenic process in dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Niwa Y', 'Sakane T', 'Shingu M', 'Yanagida I', 'Komura J', 'Miyachi Y']",1985,121,1,Arch Dermatol,"Niwa Y, et al.

Liposomal SOD injection (2.5 mg twice a week) resulted in marked remission in 12 out of 16 patients with active Behcet's disease. The drug was impressively effective on patients with intestinal Behcet. Remission rates in the other diseases was 7 out of 8 mucocutaneous lymphnode syndrome (MCLS, Kawasaki disease) 3 out of 5 dermatitis herpetiformis, IgA linear bullous dermatosis or severe cement dermatitis, 4 out of 9 active and severe RA, 3 out of 3 PSS, 4 out of 4 Crohn's disease, 3 out of 4 colitis ulcerosa, and 2 out of 2 unresponsive (hemolytic) anemia. To be emphasized was that three severe active RA patients and two terminal-stage PSS patients with dyspnea due to lung fibrosis showed dramatic improvement after administration of liposomal SOD. In addition, in 13 out of 15 malignant neo plastic patients including cancer, malignant lymphoma and leucemia who were receiving radiotherapy (total dose, more than 4000 rads) and chemotherapy including anthracycline analogs (total over 450 mg/m2) and bleomycin, the drug also prevented the appearance of myocardiac injury and fibrosis, sometimes seen as a consequence of chemotherapy.

The epidermal basement membrane zone consists of four major structural components--the basal cell plasma membrane, the lamina lucida, the lamina densa, and the sublamina densa zone, which contains anchoring fibrils. The lamina lucida is composed of laminin, bullous pemphigoid antigen (a disease-specific glycoprotein identified by antibodies circulating in patients' sera), and other as yet poorly defined antigens identified by in vivo bound and circulating antibodies in the sera of patients with herpes gestationis, scarring pemphigoid, and others. The lamina densa consists of type IV collagen and KF-1 antigen, which is noncollagenous and is identified by a skin-specific monoclonal antibody.

Erythrocyte survival measured in four patients before and at the end of vitamin E therapy also showed no substantial change. Erythrocyte Heinz body count, however, fell in nine of 15 patients studied, and none showed an increase in this measurement while receiving vitamin E.

6391291,Diagnosis and management of skin disorders caused by food allergy.,"A major aetiologic role for foods has been demonstrated in urticaria, atopic eczema and dermatitis herpetiformis. In some patients with urticaria, whealing occurs within minutes of the ingestion of a particular food. In most, but not necessarily all cases, this appears to be a consequence of IgE-mediated cutaneous mast cell degranulation, i.e. a classical type I hypersensitivity response. In other patients with recurrent urticaria, the whealing may be provoked by foods by a much slower and more insidious reaction. This type of reaction has been established in the case of several common food additives, notably azo dyes, but other foods may be able to cause urticaria in a similar fashion. Foods appear to play an important provocative role in many patients with atopic eczema. The reaction in such cases appears to be slow and insidious, almost always unrecognized by the patient and not detected by skin testing or tests for IgE antibodies. There can be no real doubt that dietary gluten is responsible for most, if not all dermatitis herpetiformis, though this relationship was revealed only by the finding of concurrent and usually asymptomatic jejunal villous atrophy in affected individuals. The mechanisms responsible for the slow food reactions in urticaria, atopic eczema and dermatitis herpetiformis remain largely unknown, but are likely to be different in each case.",['Atherton DJ'],1984,53,6 Pt 2,Ann Allergy,Atherton DJ.

Direct immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated linear bandlike depositions of IgA and IgG at the basement membrane zone in both peribullous and normal-appearing skin. By immunoelectron microscopy, the IgA and IgG deposits were found beneath the basal lamina, extending beyond the anchoring fibril zone into the deeper portion of the dermis. The immunoelectron microscopic features supported the conclusion that this patient had SLE with vesiculobullous lesions rather than SLE concurrent with dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, or bullous pemphigoid. Oral dapsone therapy gave the patient dramatic relief from the cutaneous lesions, although he was unable to tolerate extended treatment with the drug.","['Tani M', 'Shimizu R', 'Ban M', 'Murata Y', 'Tamaki A']",1984,120,11,Arch Dermatol,"Tani M, et al.

The staining pattern of both antigens was mostly fragmented and sometimes absent on papillary microabscesses, but when present it was attached to the epidermal basal cells. On papillary microblisters and larger blisters the staining of both antigens showed discontinuities and was located in the floor of the blister, except for two cases where tiny fragments of laminin staining were also seen in the roof of larger blisters. These results suggest that blister formation in dermatitis herpetiformis takes place between the epidermal basal cells and the basement membrane.","['Karttunen T', 'Autio-Harmainen H', 'Räsänen O', 'Risteli J', 'Risteli L']",1984,111,4,Br J Dermatol,"Karttunen T, et al.

6386905,Diagnosis of bullous disease and studies in the pathogenesis of blister formation using immunopathological techniques.,"Several skin diseases may present as vesicles or bullae. Immunofluorescent studies are very helpful in differentiating the various disease entities. Familiarity with the procedure and the various kinds of patterns that are specific and non-specific is essential for the practicing dermatologist. Immunofluorescent patterns are particularly helpful in differentiating pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, cicatrical pemphigoid, herpes gestationis, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA dermatosis and porphyria. Immunofluorescent studies of the skin and sera of these patients were vital to an understanding their pathogenesis. Immunoelectron microscopy has further helped in delineating the exact sites of immunoglobulin deposition, and, thus, identifying the location of the antigens. In pemphigus, studies at the molecular level reveal that the basic pathological process is mediated by an anti-cellular cement substance antibody. The binding of this antibody at the cell surface level results in a process that is seen at the light microscopy level in the form of acantholysis. In bullous pemphigoid cells may play an important role. It appears that the mast cell, eosinophil, and the lymphocyte in harmony with the polymorphonuclear leucocyte work together to bring about an enzymatic degradation of the basement membrane. The specific role of the anti-basement membrane zone antibody is also under current study. With advances in molecular immunology, especially monoclonal antibodies and gene technology, it is hoped that these cellular and molecular interactions will be better understood and further defined.",['Razzaque Ahmed A'],1984,11,4,J Cutan Pathol,Razzaque Ahmed A.

6087824,Dissociation of the inhibitory effect of dapsone on the generation of oxygen intermediates--in comparison with that of colchicine and various scavengers.,"4,4'-Diaminodiphenyl sulfone (dapsone, DDS) is highly effective in dermatitis herpetiformis and immune complex disease in which polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) play an important role. We studied the dose-response effect of DDS (10-1 mM) on the generation of oxygen intermediates (OI:O2-, H2O2, OH.) and chemiluminescence using PMN and the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. The effect of colchicine and five oxygen radical scavengers on OI production in both systems was also examined and compared with that of DDS. We found that, except for O2- generation, which was slightly enhanced, DDS decreased the levels of OI measured as effectively as scavengers. Scavengers also capable of degrading OH. and 1O2 markedly reduced the levels of OH. and chemiluminescence while slightly increasing the level of O2-. Therefore, DDS was considered to exert effects similar to H2O2, and OH. and 1O2 scavengers. Colchicine did not decrease OI values produced in the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system but affected PMN-mediated OI generation, possibly by its cytoxic effect. Our results suggest that DDS, in contrast to colchicine brings about rapid clinical improvement in PMN-mediated autooxidative disorders by quenching reactive OI such as H2O2, OH. and chemiluminescence.","['Niwa Y', 'Sakane T', 'Miyachi Y']",1984,33,15,Biochem Pharmacol,"Niwa Y, et al.

6469705,Influence of the amount of dietary gluten on gastrointestinal morphology and function in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The individual daily intake of gluten was calculated in 45 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) on the basis of a depth interview about food habits. Gastric and small intestinal morphology and function were studied concurrently. Mean daily gluten intake was estimated to be 15 g, a figure which corresponds well to the average gluten intake in Sweden. There was a significant correlation between the degree of morphological mucosal changes of the small intestine and the quantity of gluten ingested. All patients with jejunal villous atrophy consumed more than 10 g gluten daily and all but one patient with normal jejunal villous structure had a gluten intake of less than 10 g/d. The findings suggest a dose-dependent effect of gluten on the intestinal mucosa. Conversely, the daily gluten intake was not correlated to gastric morphology, gastric acid secretion, serum gastrin levels or serum parietal cell antibodies. Patients with reduced ability to secrete gastric acid did not differ from the remaining patients in this respect. Whereas the coeliac-like enteropathy in DH seems to be caused by ingested gluten, the frequently occurring achlorhydric atrophic gastritis must be assumed to be of different immunopathogenesis.","['Andersson H', 'Björkman AC', 'Gillberg R', 'Kastrup W', 'Mobacken H', 'Stockbrügger R']",1984,38,4,Hum Nutr Clin Nutr,"Andersson H, et al.

6742871,Dermatitis herpetiformis: jejunal findings and skin response to gluten free diet.,"Fifty seven children with dermatitis herpetiformis, 18 from Finland and 39 from Hungary, were studied. Diagnostic criteria included the finding of granular IgA deposits in the skin of all patients. The mean age at onset of the rash was 7 X 2 years and favoured sites were the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Symptoms suggesting small intestinal disease were rare but in 35 (61%) of the children subtotal villous atrophy and in 16 (28%) partial villous atrophy were found on jejunal biopsy. Eighteen children underwent a second biopsy after a mean of 21 months on a gluten free diet; villous height was found to be increased and the intraepithelial lymphocyte count decreased in all these patients. Gluten challenge caused a reversal in the two children who underwent a third biopsy. The effect of the gluten free diet on the rash was examined in Finnish children by observing the daily requirements of dapsone, a drug used to control the rash at the beginning of the diet. Eight (67%) of the 12 children were able to stop taking dapsone after a mean of 11 months on the diet and all three patients treated with diet alone became asymptomatic after three to 6 months on the diet. These results confirm that most children with dermatitis herpetiformis have jejunal villous atrophy, though they rarely have gastrointestinal symptoms. The central role of gluten in childhood dermatitis herpetiformis is evidenced by the fact that a gluten free diet helps the damaged jejunal mucosa to recover and controls the rash even in those children who do not have an abnormal jejunal biopsy.","['Reunala T', 'Kosnai I', 'Karpati S', 'Kuitunen P', 'Török E', 'Savilahti E']",1984,59,6,Arch Dis Child,"Reunala T, et al.

IgA deposits were found just below the basement membrane zone or slightly deeper in the connective tissue, i.e. a deposition pattern which is pathognomonic to DH. In three patients C3 deposits occurred in the same area as IgA. The patient with linear IgA disease had small white erythematous patches, nonspecific both clinically and histologically, on the palatal mucosa. However, oral IFL specimens showed heavy linear IgA deposits in the basement membrane zone, indicating that the oral mucosa is also involved in this rare disease. Buccal mucosal biopsy specimens were stained with four FITC-conjugated lectins (Ulex europaeus I, soybean, peanut and lentil). The lectin staining was similar in patients with DH and linear IgA disease and did not markedly differ from normal oral mucosa.

Papillary dermis has been treated with various proteolytic enzymes in order to release or solubilize the granular IgA deposits from the papillary dermis of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. Incubation of the thin skin preparations with pepsin caused a disappearance of the specific fluorescence with antibodies to human IgA. After peptic digestion small amounts of IgA could be detected in the supernatants. There was some evidence that this amount was larger for preparations from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis than from controls.

6367664,Linear IgA bullous dermatosis v dermatitis herpetiformis. Quantitative measurements of dermoepidermal alterations.,"Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LAD), also known as ""atypical dermatitis herpetiformis,"" is a disorder that is distinct from classic dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). In eight patients with DH and six with LAD, quantitative assessment of a variety of histopathologic variables was made. The number of rete tips with neutrophils in basal vacuoles and the length of the epidermal basement membrane zone (BMZ) associated with these findings were greater in LAD than DH. The number of microabscesses of neutrophils in the dermal papillae and the length of epidermal BMZ associated with them were greater in DH than in LAD. By using the number of microabscesses and the number of rete tips with neutrophils in basal vacuoles in a probability model, we found by retrospective analysis that a correct diagnosis could be made for LAD in 75% of biopsy specimens with a probability of 97% and in all cases of DH with a probability of 92%. Using this model, we made no misdiagnoses. This is the first diagnostic probability model in dermatopathology that expresses a confidence level in diagnosis.","['Smith SB', 'Harrist TJ', 'Murphy GF', 'Halperin AJ', 'Newell JB', 'Fallon JT', 'Fine JD', 'Mihm MC']",1984,120,3,Arch Dermatol,"Smith SB, et al.

6322702,Dapsone-induced peripheral neuropathy. Case report and review.,"A severe motor and a minor sensory neuropathy developed in a man being treated with dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) for dermatitis herpetiformis. He had received dapsone for 16 years before any signs of neurotoxicity became evident. Electrodiagnostic and clinical features were consistent with an axonal neuropathy. Clinical characteristics of dapsone-induced neuropathy include a motor neuropathy affecting the extremities, usual onset within five years after the initiation of dapsone therapy, dapsone dosage usually equal to or greater than 300 mg/day, and, almost always, complete recovery from the neuropathy after dapsone-dose reduction or withdrawal. The patient was found to be a slow acetylator of sulfamethazine, and therefore is a slow acetylator of dapsone. An HLA typing was done on the patient. New cases of dapsone-induced neuropathy should be HLA typed and have acetylation profiles in an attempt to identify future high-risk patients. This case is noteworthy for the length of time of dapsone usage (16 years) and the low daily dosage of dapsone (100 mg) taken prior to the development of neuropathy.","['Waldinger TP', 'Siegle RJ', 'Weber W', 'Voorhees JJ']",1984,120,3,Arch Dermatol,"Waldinger TP, et al.

6230405,Characterization of T lymphocyte and monocyte populations in HLA B8/DRw3 normal individuals and in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Normal individuals who possess the HLA B8/DRw3 haplotype as well as patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have been found to have a number of immunologic abnormalities including decreased numbers of E rosette-positive, Fc IgG receptor-bearing lymphocytes (referred to as TG cells), and increased numbers of cells which spontaneously secrete immunoglobulin. HLA B8/DRw3-positive normal individuals also have an increased risk for the development of a number of immunologically mediated diseases. Since many of these findings are suggestive of B-cell hyperreactivity and since TG cells were initially thought to represent a portion of the T suppressor cell network, we have examined the peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cell populations of 14 normal HLA B8/DRw3-positive individuals, 14 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (all of whom were HLA B8/DRw3-positive), and 9 non-HLA B8/DRw3 individuals using flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies of the OK and Leu series directed against cell surface antigens. Normal HLA B8/DRw3 individuals were found to have a significantly lower percentage of PBM cells that expressed both OKT8 and Leu-2a when compared to normal non-HLA B8/DRw3 individuals (p less than .05 Student's t-test). When the ratio of T helper cells (OKT4 and Leu-3a) to T suppressor cells (OKT8 and Leu-2a) was calculated for each individual studied, normal HLA B8/DRw3 individuals were found to have a significantly elevated ratio (Leu-3a/Leu-2a = 2.41 +/- .16, mean +/- SEM) when compared to non-HLA selected individuals (Leu-3a/Leu-2a = 1.73 +/- .05) (p less than 0.025). In addition, normal HLA B8/DRw3 individuals had decreased numbers of TG cells when compared to normal non-HLA B8/DRw3 individuals (B8/DRw3 = 6.4 +/- .74%, non-B8/DRw3 = 13.2 +/- 1.0%, mean +/- SEM, p less than .01). In order to determine the cell surface marker characteristics of TG cells, purified TG cells from both normal HLA B8/DRw3 individuals and non-HLA B8/DRw3 individuals were studied using the Leu series monoclonal antibodies and OKM1. Good agreement was found in the percentages of cells expressing each cell surface marker between the two groups. In addition, the TG cells were found to be predominately T cells (78% Leu-1-positive), with both T helper cells (40% Leu-3a-positive) and T suppressor cells (30% Leu-2a-positive) present. These results suggest that the suppressor cell activity associated with the TG subset is not due to a depletion of the T helper cell subset, and that the decreased numbers of TG cells in HLA B8/DRw3 individuals is not due to a preferential loss of cells bearing Leu-1, Leu-2a, Leu-3a, or OKM1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Hall RP', 'Leiserson WM', 'Chused TM', 'Lawley TJ']",1984,82,3,J Invest Dermatol,"Hall RP, et al.

Faecal fat excretion was determined in 71 patients without dermatitis herpetiformis (coeliac group). A comparison was made between three patient groups, the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and the coeliac patients studied in 1970-74 and 1975-79, respectively. From clinical and biochemical analyses of these patients we conclude that although a combination of the four malabsorption tests used here still detect a majority of coeliac patients, small intestinal biopsy may reveal villous atrophy also in patients without any laboratory evidence for malabsorption by these commonly used tests. In dermatitis herpetiformis, however, the sensitivity of the tests used was low; these malabsorption tests therefore have little diagnostic value in this category of patients.","['Gillberg R', 'Dotevall G', 'Kastrup W', 'Lindstedt G', 'Mobacken H', 'Swolin B']",1984,44,1,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,"Gillberg R, et al.

Unlike patients with coeliac disease, where the peak incidence was during the first and fourth decades, no dermatitis herpetiformis patients presented in the first decade; also, there was a male preponderance in dermatitis herpetiformis which contrasts with the excess of females in coeliac disease. The apparent prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis was 11 per 100 000 in our population; approximately one fifth of that of coeliac disease. Jejunal villous atrophy was present in 78% of our dermatitis herpetiformis patients, and a single jejunal biopsy was as effective at detecting this as the multiple biopsy technique. A majority of patients were able to stop, or radically reduce their dapsone or sulphapyridine treatment after the institution of a gluten free diet. Spontaneous remission of the skin lesion occurred in only two patients not receiving a gluten free diet. Gastric parietal or thyroid antibodies were detected in 38% of patients, and three cases of thyroid disease and two cases of pernicious anaemia were detected. Lymphoma developed in two patients, one being intestinal in origin. We conclude that a gluten free diet is of therapeutic benefit in dermatitis herpetiformis and that spontaneous remission is uncommon in those not on a diet. Despite patchiness of the enteropathy, a single jejunal biopsy is quite adequate to diagnose the presence of upper intestinal villous atrophy.","['Gawkrodger DJ', 'Blackwell JN', 'Gilmour HM', 'Rifkind EA', 'Heading RC', 'Barnetson RS']",1984,25,2,Gut,"Gawkrodger DJ, et al.

Most of the serum gliadin antibodies detected were of IgG class, but in several patients IgA gliadin antibodies were found in addition. When the patients were on a normal diet, 63% had elevated IgG gliadin antibody titres (titres which exceeded the maximum titre of the controls by one dilution) and there were no significant differences between the three groups. When the patients were followed up, there was a significant fall in the gliadin antibody titres in those who responded to a gluten-free diet compared to the two other groups of patients. Thus assays of IgG gliadin antibodies might be helpful in some patients in judging the compliance of patients on a gluten-free diet.","['Kieffer M', 'Barnetson RS', 'Blackwell JN']",1984,276,2,Arch Dermatol Res,"Kieffer M, et al.

Although the sensitivity of the two tests was relatively low in the whole groups, it increased when only cases with severe jejunum abnormalities were considered (93% for coeliac disease and 81% for dermatitis herpetiformis). A significant correlation was found between antigliadin antibodies and the severity of jejunum damage in both diseases. Moreover, most coeliac and dermatitis herpetiformis patients with antigliadin antibodies were on normal diet. The specificity of the tests was 100% for the immunofluorescence and fairly good for the micro-ELISA, as only 5 (11%) of the 46 disease control patients (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) were positive for antigliadin antibodies. R1-reticulin antibody test was equally specific but less sensitive in both groups.

Leukocyte iodination was documented using a quantitative assay to measure the iodination of protein by human neutrophils undergoing phagocytosis. Cytotoxicity for the tumor cell line LSTRA by human neutrophils activated by exposure to phorbol myristate acetate was measured by a 51Cr release assay. Dapsone, diasone, and sulfapyridine, at concentrations comparable to serum levels obtained by therapeutic doses of drug, effectively inhibited iodination and cytotoxicity mediated by human neutrophils. Other sulfonamides showed little inhibition of either iodination or cytotoxicity. The amount of inhibition was comparable to that seen with the inhibitors azide or cyanide and occurred in a dose dependent manner with all three drugs. A cell-free cytotoxic system using myeloperoxidase, iodide, a H2O2 generating system, and target cells also showed inhibition by dapsone, diasone and sulfapyridine in a similar fashion. The active drugs inhibited both the intra- and the extracellular myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide cytotoxic systems. Serial iodination studies of four dermatitis herpetiformis patients, evaluated while taking dapsone or sulfapyridine, showed inhibition of iodination by either drug. Levels of IgA immune complexes, as measured by the Raji cell radioimmune assay adapted for IgA, did not change when medication was withheld. These studies demonstrate that dapsone, diasone, and sulfapyridine inhibit both neutrophil iodination and cytotoxicity for tumor cells, while other sulfonamides have no effect. This confirms previous studies showing inhibition by myeloperoxidase mediated iodination by dapsone. Furthermore, the effect on neutrophils is quickly reversible; in vivo administered drug has no effect on in vitro function. The active drugs inhibit both intra- and extracellular cytotoxic systems. This may represent an important mechanism by which these drugs produce their therapeutic effects when used to treat inflammatory skin diseases.","['Kazmierowski JA', 'Ross JE', 'Peizner DS', 'Wuepper KD']",1984,4,1,J Clin Immunol,"Kazmierowski JA, et al.

After a period extending from 11 to 47 months, none of the patients who were eating a gluten-free diet had reticulin or gluten antibodies. The patients eating a normal diet had the same incidence of reticulin autoantibodies at the end of the study as at its beginning, and gluten antibodies developed in some additional patients during the follow-up period. Thus, we have shown that the elimination of gluten from the diet of patients with DH has an important influence on the occurrence of antibodies to both reticulin and gluten.","['Ljunghall K', 'Scheynius A', 'Jonsson J', 'Schilling W', 'Forsum U']",1983,119,12,Arch Dermatol,"Ljunghall K, et al.

Those with linear and granular IgA and dermatitis herpetiformis differed from those with bullous pemphigoid in five respects. Multiple microabscesses and fibrin at tips of papillae and leukocytoclasis were less common in bullous pemphigoid, whereas a dense infiltrate of eosinophils in and below bullae and a linear infiltrate of eosinophils along the basement membrane were more common in bullous pemphigoid. Also, multilocular bullae and acantholysis were more common in dermatitis herpetiformis than in bullous pemphigoid. Linear IgA disease differed from dermatitis herpetiformis in two respects. Acantholysis and fibrin at the tips of papillae and leukocytoclasis were more common in dermatitis herpetiformis. The specimens from patients with granular IgA did not differ significantly from those with linear IgA or dermatitis herpetiformis.

6358284,Vesiculobullous systemic lupus erythematosus. Report of two cases and a review of the literature.,"Vesicles and bullae complicating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are relatively uncommon. Two young women with SLE presented with vesiculobullous eruptions on sun-exposed areas that resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) histologically. There were active visceral manifestations of SLE in both patients, including mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Granular deposits of IgG and/or IgM, along with IgA, were demonstrated along the basement membrane of skin by direct immunofluorescence microscopy. Review of fifteen additional cases of vesiculobullous SLE reported in the literature suggests that this cutaneous manifestation of SLE is associated with a high incidence of IgA deposits in skin and glomerulonephritis. The following criteria for the diagnosis of a distinct subset of vesiculobullous skin lesions occurring in patients with SLE are proposed: (1) a diagnosis of SLE based upon American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria; (2) vesicles and bullae arising upon but not limited to sun-exposed skin; (3) histopathology compatible with DH; (4) negative indirect immunofluorescence for circulating basement membrane zone (BMZ) antibodies; (5) direct immunofluorescence reveals IgG and/or IgM and often IgA at the BMZ.","['Camisa C', 'Sharma HM']",1983,9,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,Camisa C and Sharma HM.

We used an indirect immunofluorescence technique to examine the basal membrane zone with anti-type IV collagen and anti-laminin antisera and bullous pemphigoid sera. The majority of blisters examined proved to be junctional, including those from disorders hitherto considered to be dermolytic. Dermolytic cleavage was encountered only sporadically in microvesicles of dermatitis herpetiformis, in one small vesicle and in one out of five large blisters of porphyria cutanea tarda and in a large lesion of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. We conclude that in acquired bullous disorders of the dermal-epidermal junction zone the preferential site of split formation is the lamina lucida which appears to act as a locus minoris resistentiae; dermolytic split formation of substantial extent occurs only when the sublaminal fibrillar apparatus is mechanically compromised.","['Klein GF', 'Hintner H', 'Schuler G', 'Fritsch P']",1983,109,5,Br J Dermatol,"Klein GF, et al.

Malabsorption with mucosal ulcerations can be due to: a) chronic ulcerative duodeno-jejuno-ileitis or Jeffries' disease; b) coeliac disease which may be classified as possible, probable, or certain according to the strictness of criteria. Our case is the fourth in which a villous response was proven after gluten-free diet. It is also particular in that the erosions were superficial; c) malignant lymphoma which can reasonably be excluded here. This observation confirms that a gluten-free diet may be effective after surgical resection of the ulcerated segment in complicated coeliac disease and shows that antibiotics may be an useful adjuvant to therapy.","['Eugène C', 'Fingerhut A', 'Bergue A', 'Bergal S', 'Gerbal JL', 'Quevauvilliers J']",1983,7,10,Gastroenterol Clin Biol,"Eugène C, et al.

None of the patients showed clinical signs or symptoms of malabsorption. Morphological jejunal changes consistent with gluten-sensitive enteropathy were found in 82% of DH patients and in 60% of BD patients. However, BD patients showed only mild jejunal histologic abnormalities, whereas more severe jejunal lesions were found in most patients with DH. Functional tests showed a rough correlation with the severity of the jejunal lesions, being almost completely normal in BD patients and DH patients with mild intestinal damage, whereas most of DH patients with subtotal or total villous atrophy showed abnormal d-xylose tests and folic acid assays. Lactose tolerance tests (H2 breath test and blood glucose after oral lactose load) showed no correlation with the degree of jejunal damage.","['deFranchis R', 'Primignani M', 'Cipolla M', 'Vecchi M', 'Agape D', 'Monti M', 'Berti E', 'Zuccato E', 'Mussini E']",1983,5,5,J Clin Gastroenterol,"deFranchis R, et al.

6309988,Demonstration of collagenase and elastase activities in the blister fluids from bullous skin diseases. Comparison between dermatitis herpetiformis and bullous pemphigoid.,"We have investigated potential mechanisms for blister formation by assaying proteolytic enzymes in the blister fluids of patients with various bullous diseases. Blister fluids were obtained from patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), bullous pemphigoid (BP), chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV). The cells were recovered by centrifugation, and the supernatants as well as the cell pellets were assayed first for collagenase activity using [3H]proline-labeled type I collagen as substrate. Collagenase activity could be detected in most cases with DH, BP, and CBDC, while no activity was found in 2 cases of PV or in 5 control blister fluids obtained from suction blisters induced in healthy control subjects. Elastase activity was assayed in the same blister fluids by using a synthetic substrate succinyl-(L-alanyl)3-paranitroanilide or soluble [14C]valine-labeled tropoelastin. High levels of elastase activity were present in all DH patients, while lower, but clearly detectable, levels were found in BP, CBDC, and PV. The enzyme activity in BP was inhibited by Na2EDTA, but not by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and Ca2+ stimulated the activity, suggesting that the enzyme in BP was a metalloproteinase. In cell-free supernatants of the DH blister fluids, the elastase activity was markedly decreased by PMSF, indicating that most of the enzyme activity was due to a serine protease. The cells recovered from DH blister fluids also contained high levels of elastase activity which could be inhibited by PMSF but not by Na2EDTA. Thus, in DH, the elastase activity is probably derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes abundantly present in the lesions. The results indicate that active proteases are present in the blister fluids of skin diseases, and they may play a mechanistic role in the blister formation by degrading connective tissue components of the dermis and the dermal-epidermal junction.","['Oikarinen AI', 'Zone JJ', 'Ahmed AR', 'Kiistala U', 'Uitto J']",1983,81,3,J Invest Dermatol,"Oikarinen AI, et al.

A subsequent conventional renal biopsy was obtained from one of these five, and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed IgA and complement deposits in the glomeruli. Renal involvement was not related either to the degree of jejunal villous atrophy or to the deposition of IgA and complement in the skin. Glomerular deposits, however, were associated with a high frequency of circulating IgA and IgG class immune complexes and IgA class antigliadin and antireticulin antibodies. These results suggest that, in DH, immune complexes or antibodies derived from the gut can be deposited in the kidney.","['Reunala T', 'Helin H', 'Pasternack A', 'Linder E', 'Kalimo K']",1983,9,2,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Reunala T, et al.

In direct immunofluorescence studies, two of the three cases showed fine fibrillar deposition of IgA and the other case fine granules in the dermal papillae. In the former, the reaction products of IgA were present in the upper dermis forming various-sized aggregates which were occasionally arranged perpendicularly to the epidermis and appeared to be associated with microfibrillar bundles of the elastic tissue. Reaction products were also deposited to a lesser extent on the microfibrillar component of the elastic fibers at the lower part of the dermal papillae. However, in the latter, the reaction products were found to form smaller aggregates on and around the collagen fibrils rather than on the elastic tissue. Such a localization of IgA reaction products has not yet been reported in DH.

Within days of taking this medication, he developed recurrent edema of the face and a generalized urticarial eruption which waxed and waned. The salient and unusual features of this person's disease were: 1) A senile appearance of his face with flaccid folds and sagging of the skin. Histopathologic findings were dense dermal inflammatory-cell infiltrates with numerous eosinophils and destruction of elastic fibers. Findings by electron microscopy were fragmentation and clumping of elastic fibers and accumulation of granular material in the dermis. 2) Dermatitis herpetiformis-like cutaneous lesions and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. 3) Elastolysis increased in time and led to further deterioration of the patient's physical appearance. Six years later, the patient developed severe internal manifestations and died. We assume that the inflammatory-cell infiltrates and prolonged edema following therapy with penicillin caused the dissolution of elastic tissue and resultant systemic elastolysis.","['Kerl H', 'Burg G', 'Hashimoto K']",1983,5,3,Am J Dermatopathol,"Kerl H, et al.

In order to detect and characterize antibodies to gluten in human sera, we developed an enzyme immunoassay for class-specific antibodies. Results of this assay in 49 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were compared with those of 38 normal control subjects, 11 patients with celiac disease, and 6 small-bowel bypass patients. IgA antibodies to gluten were significantly more frequent in dermatitis herpetiformis sera (28/49) than in normal control sera (4/38). IgG antibodies to gluten were significantly more frequent in both celiac disease (10/11) and dermatitis herpetiformis (16/49) sera than in control (5/38) sera. Dermatitis herpetiformis sera also had an increased prevalence of IgM antibodies to gluten (19/49). Small-bowel bypass patients demonstrated no antibody to gluten.

Secretory products participate in inflammation and immunoregulation. Endocytosis mediated by specific receptors for immunoglobulin and complement or by other opsonins is important in removal of damaged self or foreign particles. The ability to assess receptor-specific endocytosis has led to the recognition of Fc-receptor dysfunction in certain autoimmune diseases. This defect in membrane receptor function, whether inherited or acquired, may be important in the pathogenesis of these diseases.","['Kimberly RP', 'Ralph P']",1983,74,3,Am J Med,Kimberly RP and Ralph P.

6186607,Granulocyte-mediated release of histamine from mast cells. Effect of myeloperoxidase and its inhibition by antiinflammatory sulfone compounds.,"During phagocytosis, neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes undergo metabolic activation and degranulation. This leads to accumulation of H2O2 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) or eosinophilic peroxidase (EPO) in the extracellular environment in inflammation. In the present investigation we show that the MPO-H2O2-halide system can degranulate isolated mast cells with release of histamine and 3H-serotonin. This is accomplished both in a system containing purified human MPO and in one containing phagocytosing neutrophils. When using purified MPO and a H2O2-generating system, the release was rapid, with 50% release after less than 20 min. The direct histamine release required less (0.65-2 micrograms/ml) MPO than did the release of 3H-serotonin (1-6 micrograms/ml). The release reaction was inhibited by azide, catalase but not superoxide dismutase. Studying the effect of the antiinflammatory sulfone compounds dapsone and sulfapyridine on the MPO-mediated histamine release, we show effective inhibition of the histamine release at concentrations of 0.025-0.2 mM of sulfone. 5-aminosalicylic acid exhibited some inhibition only in the cell-free system, whereas sulfasalazine was inactive. The antiinflammatory effect of dapsone in dermatitis herpetiformis and sulfasalazine in ulcerative colitis may in part be explained by their inhibitory effects on the granulocyte-mediated histamine release from mast cells in skin and mucosal tissue.","['Stendahl O', 'Molin L', 'Lindroth M']",1983,70,3,Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol,"Stendahl O, et al.

6405504,Investigation of the mode of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases by the method of antigen genotype frequencies among diseased individuals.,"Statistical features of the method of antigen genotype frequencies among the diseased, for single and multiple disease associations at a locus, will be presented. A methodology to determine when a true intermediate mode of inheritance can be distinguished from strict recessive or additive inheritance will be developed. The effect of sporadics and ascertainment bias on the observed antigen genotype frequencies will be investigated. Data on ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis and dermatitis herpetiformis are very close to expectations for an additive (or dominant) mode of inheritance for the HLA-linked disease-predisposing gene, and data on hemochromatosis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and celiac disease are close to recessive expectations. If an intermediate model does apply in any of these cases, it must be an intermediate model that is fairly close to a strict recessive or dominant model; as appropriate. DR data for insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) strongly indicate that there are two separate ""disease"" alleles, which exhibit negative complementation, predisposing individuals to IDDM, where the mode of inheritance of the ""disease"" alleles considered separately is close to recessive. In general, this method cannot rule out the existence of sporadics or a second disease-predisposing gene, when the penetrance values over the two disease-predisposing genes are strictly additive, for diseases showing agreement with additive (or dominant) modes of inheritance.",['Thomson G'],1983,21,2,Tissue Antigens,Thomson G.

Immunohistological techniques and, to a lesser degree, immunocytological techniques, have been developed to include not only IF, but also immunoenzymatic methods. Even if not all immunological findings may be disease specific and diagnostic, immunohistological techniques have become a very useful tool for studying skin biopsies in connection with serological methods.

Direct immunofluorescent methods applied to specimens of perilesional skin are extremely reliable to demonstrate characteristic deposition of various immunoreactants in pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis. Autoantibodies in serum revealed by indirect immunofluorescent techniques, are demonstrable in most cases of pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid.

No differences in DDS disposition were observed between the two groups. The maintenance dose of DDS for individual patients was not significantly correlated with jejunal biopsy morphology, DDS or MADDS half-lives, or the area under the plasma concentration-time curves for DDS or MADDS. DDS plasma protein binding was normal in patients and did not apparently determine the concentration of DDS in skin biopsies, for which the skin/plasma DDS concentration ratio was approximately unity. There was no undue representation of acetylator phenotype in the patient group and no correlation between maintenance dose and MADDS/DDS ratio was noted. The determinants of the maintenance DDS dose have not been found. This may relate to pharmacodynamic differences, but alternatively the concentration of oxidative metabolites rather than DDS or MADDS could be responsible for the therapeutic activity in dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Swain AF', 'Ahmad RA', 'Rogers HJ', 'Leonard JN', 'Fry L']",1983,108,1,Br J Dermatol,"Swain AF, et al.

6680766,Permeation of lipophilic drugs through synthetic elastomers.,"Permeability studies were carried out with three lipophilic drugs, namely, phenytoin and primidone (both widely used in the treatment of epilepsies and convulsive disorders), and dapsone (a sulfone antimicrobial agent used in the treatment of leprosy and to a lesser extent in dermatitis herpetiformis) through silica-filled poly(dimethyl siloxane) (Silastic) membranes, and anisotropic membranes of poly(ether-urethane)/poly(dimethyl siloxane) block copolymer (Avcothane, Cardiothane). These polymers are used in medical implants and in various cardiovascular devices. While both polymers were permeable to the drugs, the transport properties differed significantly. In the case of the poly(dimethyl siloxane) there was an initial large burst effect, followed by an exponential decrease in the rate of drugs released through the polymer films, although with dapsone the release rate became essentially constant between 100-180 h at 37 degrees C. In the case of the anisotropic films of the poly(ether-urethane)/poly(dimethyl siloxane) block copolymer, the permeabilities were much higher. Significantly, phenytoin exhibited essentially constant rate (zero-order) kinetics between 25-150 h, showing only a moderate burst effect that is probably not significant therapeutically. Importantly, dapsone showed neither a burst effect nor any significant time lag, and the release followed constant rate (zero-order) kinetics between 12-80 h, followed by only a moderate decrease in drug concentration up to 140 h (the experimental end-point). The diffusion coefficients calculated from initial desorption data at 37 degrees C for the poly(ether-urethane)/poly(dimethyl siloxane) block copolymer are as follows: phenytoin = 8.6 X 10(-9) cm2/s, primidone = 2.8 X 10(-9) cm2/s, and dapsone = 2.4 X 10(-8) cm2/s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bruck SD', 'Kojima M', 'Kadoma Y', 'Masuhara E']",1983,10,3,Med Prog Technol,"Bruck SD, et al.

In almost half of the cases proven or suspected to be coeliac disease, the blood xylose level was low. In 69 patients the result was compared to that of small bowel biopsy. Abnormal levels were found in 98% of total or subtotal villous atrophy. It is therefore suggested to apply the test for screening in severe cases. Since with increasing age the absorption of xylose improves, this is to be considered when evaluating the test. At the time of gluten readministration the D-xylose test suggests the presence of histological changes well before their clinical manifestation. Therefore the result of the D-xylose test serves as an indication for small bowel biopsy.

A small subgroup of eight patients with linear IgA dermatitis herpetiformis were also studied: three developed malignant disease and in one the tumour was a lymphoma.","['Leonard JN', 'Tucker WF', 'Fry JS', 'Coulter CA', 'Boylston AW', 'McMinn RM', 'Haffenden GP', 'Swain AF', 'Fry L']",1983,286,6358,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),"Leonard JN, et al.

This is in keeping with previous reports that the familial incidence of DH is low. Study of the family in which two siblings were affected showed both to have HLA-B9 whereas a third, unaffected sibling did not have this antigen.

6191485,"Dermatitis herpetiformis: relation between circulating antibodies against reticulin and gluten, small-intestinal mucosal status and absorptive capacity.","The status of the jejunal mucosa and of the intestinal absorptive capacity were investigated and related to the occurrence of antibodies against reticulin and gluten in 55 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), 28 on a normal, 11 on a gluten-reduced and 16 on a gluten-free diet. The mucosal status was characterized on the basis of histopathological findings and the numbers of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Absorption was evaluated by 5-h urine and 1-h serum D-xylose tests. There was a positive correlation between the degree of pathological mucosal changes, malabsorption and the occurrence of circulating antibodies against reticulin and gluten. The serum xylose test was more sensitive than the urine xylose test for screening of the relatively mild enteropathy of DH and identified 88% of the patients with an abnormal mucosal status. The serological test (antibodies to reticulin and gluten) identified 80% of such patients. Among patients on a gluten-free diet there was some discrepancy between the serum xylose and the serological test, in that 5 of the 16 patients on this diet had an abnormal serum xylose test result, but no antibodies. In DH patients on a normal diet, the presence of antibodies to reticulin and gluten provided the same information about the presence of mucosal lesions as the serum xylose test. In the whole material a combination of the serum xylose test and the serological test identified 24 of 25 patients with an abnormal mucosal status.","['Ljunghall K', 'Lööf L', 'Grimelius L', 'Forsum U', 'Jonsson J', 'Scheynius A', 'Schilling W']",1983,63,1,Acta Derm Venereol,"Ljunghall K, et al.

Forty-two patients were treated with gluten-free diet (GFD) and thirty-six took a normal diet (ND). Thirty of the forty-two (71%) taking the GFD were able to discontinue drugs previously needed to control their rash compared with five (14%) of the thirty-six patients taking a ND.

The incidence of macroscopic abnormality of the small intestine decreased from 69 to 15%, and the mean intra-epithelial lymphocyte count decreased significantly in those patients taking a GFD, whereas there was no significant change in patients taking a ND. The improvement in the skin and intestinal lesions was related to the strictness of the GFD.","['Fry L', 'Leonard JN', 'Swain F', 'Tucker WF', 'Haffenden G', 'Ring N', 'McMinn RM']",1982,107,6,Br J Dermatol,"Fry L, et al.

7142518,The healing of suction blisters in pig skin.,"The healing of intact suction blisters in pig skin was studied using fluorescein-labelled lectins as well as conventional histological techniques. After blistering, initially overt separation was observed at the dermo-epidermal junction, but the separated epidermis appeared to re-attach within 9 h. Massive infiltration of the dermis and the epidermis by inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, was observed. By day 4 focal detachment of the epidermis occurred spontaneously, and towards day 9 the appearance of the blistered areas had almost returned to normal, apart from isolated patches of thin epidermis devoid of rete ridges. It is proposed that the sloughing the of the epidermis on day 4 is related to the presence of inflammatory cells and that the restoration of normal dermo-epidermal relations is dependent on the basement membrane zone remaining intact. The secondary blistering seen in day 4 specimens and the inflammatory cell involvement are in many ways similar to the blistering processes observed in certain human cutaneous disorders, such as dermatitis herpetiformis and bullous pemphigoid, and therefore suction blisters in pig skin might provide a suitable animal model for these diseases.","['Nanchahal J', 'Riches DJ']",1982,9,5,J Cutan Pathol,Nanchahal J and Riches DJ.

7052113,Linear IgA disease in adults.,"A multi-centre study is described in which thirty-five adult patients with papillary IgA dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) were compared with forty-two patients with linear IgA deposits, of whom thirty-four had homogeneous-linear (HL) and eight had granular-linear (GL) IgA deposits. The three groups were similar with regard to age of onset, presence of circulating immune complexes and auto-antibodies, incidence of spontaneous remission, histology of lesional skin and response to dapsone. There was a female predominance in the HL group in contrast to the male predominance in the other two. It was not possible to diagnose the HL group clinically. Some patients had a rash typical of DH whilst others resembled pemphigoid. In the majority, however, no specific diagnosis could be made with confidence. The GL group clinically resembled the DH group. The incidence of positive potassium iodide patch tests was greater in the DH group than in the other two. An associated enteropathy was found in 24% of patients in the HL group, 30% of patients in the GL group and 85% of patients in the DH group. Fifty-six percent of HL patients had HLA-B8 compared with 50% in the GL group and 88% in the DH group. Patients with linear IgA deposits may not be a uniform group, but until they can be divided into specific subgroups (e.g. by ultrastructural localization of the deposit or by response to a gluten-free diet) we propose that the term adult linear IgA diseases should be used to distinguish these patients from those with papillary IgA deposits.","['Leonard JN', 'Haffenden GP', 'Ring NP', 'McMinn RM', 'Sidgwick A', 'Mowbray JF', 'Unsworth DJ', 'Holborow EJ', 'Blenkinsopp WK', 'Swain AF', 'Fry L']",1982,107,3,Br J Dermatol,"Leonard JN, et al.

By light microscopy, her renal biopsy specimen showed heavy immunofluorescence for IgA, a mixed proliferative and membranous lesion with occasional crescents and focal sclerosis. Electron microscopic examination revealed three main lesions: (1) swelling and bleb formation in endothelial cells, (2) extensive fusion of foot processes of podocytes, and (3) a dense quasi-linear, continuous deposition of immune complexes, encompassing several loops; they were characteristically located within the basement membrane at the boundary between the lamina densa and the lamina rara interna. At occasional points where the immune complexes had reached the outer aspects of the basement membrane, there was damage to the podocyte cytoplasm. This electron microscopic aspect supports the interpretation that these immune complexes, although non-complement fixing, exhibit a high damaging potential, leading to relentless disease progression.","['Bartoli E', 'Bosincu L', 'Costanzi G', 'Denti S', 'Olmeo NA', 'Soggia G']",1982,78,3,Am J Clin Pathol,"Bartoli E, et al.

In order to quantify these receptors and assess their contribution to the clearance phenomenon in man, Scatchard analysis has been applied to 125I-IgG1 myeloma protein binding by a model mononuclear phagocyte, the peripheral blood monocyte. Close compliance to the criteria for linear Scatchard plots has been obtained. The kinetics of binding at 37 degrees C were consistent with a simple, reversible, bimolecular reaction. A saturable, single class of high-affinity binding sites was discerned with a Ka of 2.61 +/- 0.13 x 10(8) M-1 and a mean of 35,500 +/- 1700 receptors per monocyte. These receptors expressed approximately equal affinities for IgG subclasses 1 and 3, with progressively lower affinities for IgG subclasses 4 and 2, respectively. Parameters of IgG1 binding to monocytes of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and normal individuals of HLA-B8/Drw3 haplotype were not significantly different from controls, despite the previous demonstration of retarded IgG-mediated clearance in one-half of such subjects. Receptor number and affinity failed to correlate with T 1/2 for sensitized erythrocyte clearance in vivo. Functional defects in in vivo clearance, even in the absence of circulating immune complexes, are not necessarily related to abnormal expression of Fc gamma receptors by phagocytes.","['Fries LF', 'Hall RP', 'Lawley TJ', 'Crabtree GR', 'Frank MM']",1982,129,3,J Immunol,"Fries LF, et al.

Dramatic response to dapsone therapy.,"Four patients with systemic lupus erythematosus developed a nonpruritic vesiculobullous eruption that was unresponsive to high-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy. In three patients the eruption was not associated with a flare of systemic disease. Biopsy results showed neutrophilic microabscesses at the dermal papillary tips and perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates. Direct immunofluorescence of normal appearing skin not exposed to the sun was positive in all four patients. Due to the unresponsiveness to corticosteroid therapy and the striking histologic resemblance to dermatitis herpetiformis, each of the patients was treated with dapsone. Within 24 hours each patient had prompt cessation of the appearance of new lesions. Improvement of the eruption did not correlate with improvement of the systemic manifestations of their lupus erythematosus.

7046642,Case for diagnosis: vesicular pemphigoid?,"A 47-year-old man was diagnosed as having dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) in 1957. His failure to respond to therapy and the advent of immunofluorescent techniques led to a subsequent tentative diagnosis of vesicular pemphigoid (VP). High-titered, antibasal zone antibodies were present. However, unlike previously reported cases, direct immunofluorescence microscopy initially showed a DH-like and, later, an atypical granular band instead of a tubular (linear) band but with bullous pemphigoid (BP)-like immunoglobulin composition. No IgA was present. The patient's serum antibasal zone antibodies reacted with his perilesional skin despite granular deposits present at the same site, suggesting concomitant BP- and DH-like immunologic phenomena. The non-IgA-containing atypical granular band might be an immunologic marker for a subset of VP or another distinct disease entity demonstrating an immunologic overlap between BP and DH.","['Burnham TK', 'Nims LP']",1982,118,7,Arch Dermatol,Burnham TK and Nims LP.

In each patient biopsy specimens of normal gingiva, buccal mucosa, and perilesional skin were examined for IgA and IgG deposits. Depending on the method of handling biopsy specimens for immunofluorescence, IgA deposits were detected in 21 to 25 percent of gingival specimens, 27 to 46 percent of buccal mucosal specimens, and 64 to 76 percent of skin specimens. The occurrence of IgA deposits in the gingival papillae, a site where lesions of DH have not been reported in the past or observed in this study, suggests that these IgA deposits alone may not play a primary role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Similar immunofluorescent findings of IgA deposits were observed in both quick-frozen biopsy specimens and those placed in holding solution, indicating the suitability of the holding solution for transporting suggested DH biopsy material.","['Nisengard RJ', 'Chorzelski T', 'Maciejowska E', 'Kryst L']",1982,54,1,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol,"Nisengard RJ, et al.

Quantitative analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes.,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with various skin disorders were studied by indirect immunofluorescence using the monoclonal antibodies OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8 which react with human T cells (OKT3+ cells), helper-inducer (OKT4+) and suppressor-cytotoxic (OKT8+) T cell subsets, respectively. In parallel, the balance between peripheral blood helper and suppressor subsets was established by the determination of OKT4+/OKT8+ ratios (helper/suppressor ratios). In patients with the Sézary syndrome, but not in patients with mycosis fungoides or parapsoriasis ""en plaques,"" highly significant increases in the helper/suppressor ratios accompanied by decreased levels of suppressor cells were found compared to controls. T cell imbalance with high helper/suppressor ratios and low percentages of circulating OKT8+ suppressor cells were also observed in patients with atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, or acute sarcoidosis (i.e. patients with erythema nodosum sarcoidosis and bilateral hilar adenopathy). In patients with cutaneous manifestations of chronic graft vs. host diseases, low helper/suppressor ratios and elevated OKT8+ cell levels were observed. T cells and T cell subset enumerations and related helper/suppressor ratios were found to be within normal range in patients with psoriasis, systemic lupus, erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus, bullous disorders (bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, pemphigus vulgaris), and miscellaneous diseases.","['Faure M', 'Thivolet J']",1982,2,3 Suppl,J Clin Immunol,Faure M and Thivolet J.

IV--The predictive value of raised mitotic indices among jejunal epithelial lymphocytes in the diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"It has been established that considerable blast-transformation and mitotic activity occurs among epithelial lymphocytes of untreated coeliac mucosa. This paper is concerned solely with the proliferative activity of epithelial lymphocytes (expressed as percentage ""mitotic index"") in the prospective diagnosis of coeliac disease, in comparison with other conditions such as lymphoma. Crohn's disease and immunodeficiency which are often associated with malabsorption and flattening of jejunal mucosa. The results demonstrate that a high mitotic index (greater than 0.2%) clearly distinguishes, and hence predicts, gluten-associated enteropathies (including dermatitis herpetiformis and malignant histiocytosis) from others in which gluten plays no aetiological role and where the mitotic index differs insignificantly from normal control mucosae (much less than 0.2%). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the mitotic index is raised in so-called ""non-responsive coeliacs,"" thus suggesting that such patients may also be gluten-sensitive despite their subsequent failure to respond morphologically to dietary gluten restriction.",['Marsh MN'],1982,35,5,J Clin Pathol,Marsh MN.

7044699,Benign chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood: a review.,"Chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood is one of the nonhereditary blistering diseases of children. Clinically, it is characterized by predominantly monomorphous, large tense bullae, which often form a ""rosette pattern"" or ""jewel-like"" clustering and have a predilection for the lower trunk, pelvic region, and lower extremities. Histologically, a subepidermal blister is seen, which is indistinguishable from either bullous pemphigoid or dermatitis herpetiformis. Although usually responsive to sulfone therapy, some cases require the combination of sulfones and systemic corticosteroids or corticosteroids alone to control the disease. Recent advances in immunologic techniques reveal: 1. a linear band of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction on direct immunofluorescence that has been reported both in the lamina lucida and below the basal lamina on immunoelectron microscopy; 2. IgA antibasement membrane antibodies on indirect immunofluorescence; 3. normal jejunal biopsies; and 4. a high association with HLA-B8. It remains unclear whether chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood represents a separate disease entity or is merely a variant of dermatitis herpetiformis. Chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood also differs from linear IgA dermatosis of the adult in that the latter is not associated with HLA-B8, and thus should not be confused with this disease by similar nomenclature.","['Sweren RJ', 'Burnett JW']",1982,29,4,Cutis,"Sweren RJ and Burnett JW.

The aim of this study was to investigate how the morphometric parameters correlate with each other. All cases with CMA, CD, and DH had villous atrophy with hyperplasia of the crypts, both signs being more severe in cases with CD and DH than with CMA. IE lymphocyte infiltration was more intense in specimens of patients with CD and DH (mean 76.0), than those with CMA (mean 62.5). The ECH were equally reduced in patients with CD and CMA. In a follow-up specimen at 1 year and 10 months for CD patients and 11 months for CMA patients the inflammation was reduced, and the VH were increased but still differed from the controls. In CLD cases the morphology of the villi and crypts of the jejunum was quite normal, with no IE lymphocyte infiltration; ECH were reduced. Minor morphological changes were seen in the specimens of patients with AE and giardiasis.

7125487,[Atopy and associated diseases].,"In this study of the literature, the authors review the possible association between atopy and other conditions. The mostly reported observations are related to atopic dermatitis, but there is also some real relationship with respiratory allergy: this is true for mucoviscidosis. Some association are significant and interesting from the pathogenetic point of view: they may be classified under three headings (digestive and renal diseases, immunologic disturbances). Therefore, this study refers to intestinal absorption disturbance, gluten sensitive enteropathy, dermatitis herpetiformis, colic diseases, and also to glomerulopathies, immediate and delayed hypersensitivity deficiency and polymorphonuclear functional deficiency. Other associations do exist, but the low number of cases and the absence of a common pathogenesis allow no conclusion to be drawn (ectodermal anidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, Dubowitz syndrome). Some of them are certainly only fortuitous: this should be more definitely established by later studies. Some diseases may be accompanied by an eczematiform dermatitis (phenylketonuria, anomalies of histidin metabolism). Frequency of associations with alopecia areata and dominant ichthyosis vulgaris is also discussed. This review gives the possibility of emphasizing the absence of statistically significant hematopathic evolution of atopic dermatitis and calls attention on the Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome as a model for the studies on atopy.","['Prigent F', 'Civatte J']",1982,109,4,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Prigent F and Civatte J.

6959238,Adaptive cell-proliferative changes in the small-intestinal mucosa in coeliac disease.,"Cell proliferation in the small-intestinal crypts of rodents has been intensively investigated and lends itself to the deployment of techniques which are inapplicable in man. In particular there are ethical and economic objections to methods involving the use of tritiated thymidine in vivo for specific labelling of DNA, while the validity of in vitro studies using organ culture is uncertain. It is possible, nevertheless to construct a profile of the size and cytokinetic status of the mucosal crypts by analysis of serial sections prepared from well orientated routine diagnostic biopsy specimens. Such studies can provide a measure of mean total crypt-cell population, and by studying the distribution of mitoses in the crypts relative measurements can be obtained of proliferation and maturation compartment sizes, and of crypt cell production rate (CCPR). These parameters have been compared in 62 patients with 'flat' avillous coeliac mucosae and in 85 patients with normal villous mucosae. A heterogeneous group of 47 patients with lesser degrees of abnormality (convoluted mucosae) were similarly studied. In addition, estimates of cell cycle times were obtained in a small group of patients with normal, convoluted and 'flat' mucosae by taking biopsies before and after the administration of the metaphase-arresting agent vincristine. 'Flat' coeliac mucosae show a threefold increase in the size of the proliferation compartment compared with normal and the cell cycle time is approximately halved leading to a net sixfold increase in CCPR. This is the basis of the change in mucosal morphology and presumably represents a compensatory reaction to the gluten-induced increase in loss of enterocytes from the mucosal surface.

6764239,[Juvenile Duhring's disease. Apropos of 7 cases].,"Chronic non hereditary subepidermal blistering diseases are in childhood and present mainly problems on its clinical and histological diagnosis. Immunopathologic, immunogenetic and ultrastructural studies play a definitive role in the classification of this group of entities. In this paper we report and comment seven children affected of dermatitis herpetiformis. The clinical diagnosis was assessed by direct immunofluorescence studies of the skin, which showed granular Ig A deposits at the MBZ. In five out of our seven patients we were able to demonstrate by clinic and laboratory malabsorption syndrome. A bibliographic review of the subject is carried out, stressing specially the differential aspects with other subepidermal blistering disease of the childhood (i. e. bullous pemphigoid and chronic benign blistering disease of the childhood) as well as some other acute and chronic infantile blistering entities.","['Fernando Giménez M', 'Guillermo Crespi H', 'Martí R', 'Ferrando J']",1982,10,6,Med Cutan Ibero Lat Am,"Fernando Giménez M, et al.

6223392,Mesangial IgA nephritis.,"Current data suggest that mesangial IgA nephritis is mediated by the mesangial deposition of soluble antigen-IgA class antibody complexes from the circulation. It is likely that common infectious gut flora and dietary antigens contribute to the immune complex load. Defects in antigen exclusion at the mucosa, in the control of IgA production, and in immune complex clearance are postulated to account for each of the recognized clinical syndromes. As yet no effective treatment is available, and a detailed analysis of the mediation pathways will be required before prevention or therapy can be attempted.","['Woodroffe AJ', 'Clarkson AR', 'Seymour AE', 'Lomax-Smith JD']",1982,5,3,Springer Semin Immunopathol,"Woodroffe AJ, et al.

6187152,T lymphocyte subsets in the duodenal epithelium in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Monoclonal antibodies to human T lymphocyte subsets and HLA-DR antigens were used to characterize the intra-epithelial T lymphocytes and HLA-DR reactive cells in the duodenal epithelium in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). The expression of HLA-DR antigens on the epithelial cells was similar in patients and controls. There were significantly more Leu 2a (suppressor/ cytotoxic phenotype) reactive cells, as related to epithelial length, in 7 patients with DH than in the epithelium of 5 controls. However, the ratio of Leu 2a (suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype) to Leu 3a (helper/inducer phenotype) reactive cells was the same in the patients as in the controls. Thus this study indicates that there is a quantitative rather than a qualitative difference in T lymphocyte subpopulations in duodenal epithelium between patients with DH and normal persons.","['Ljunghall K', 'Lööf L', 'Forsum U']",1982,62,6,Acta Derm Venereol,"Ljunghall K, et al.

The reaction products were observed as electron-dense materials, not only immediately below the cytomembrane of the basal cells but also in the uppermost dermis just below the basal lamina. The major portion of the lamina lucida was free of the reaction products. These findings suggest a diversity in the mode of IgA deposition and the possibility of the presence of different antigens in the basement membrane zone, to which IgA class antibodies may be bound respectively.","['Yamasaki Y', 'Hashimoto T', 'Nishikawa T']",1982,62,5,Acta Derm Venereol,"Yamasaki Y, et al.

The second patient died of histiocytic lymphoma disseminated in the ileum, colon, stomach and mesenterium. This patient had been operated on 14 years earlier for a solitary ulcerating lymphoma in the ileum. The third patient had a localized histiocytic lymphoma in the colon. This was successfully removed by hemicholectomy. The fourth patient had a lymphocytic lymphoma of B-cell origin in the inguinal lymph nodes which was treated with radiotherapy. These 4 patients with lymphomas suggest that, like coeliac disease patients, DH patients also run an increased risk of developing lymphomas.","['Reunala T', 'Helin H', 'Kuokkanen K', 'Hakala T']",1982,62,4,Acta Derm Venereol,"Reunala T, et al.

Low values of GSH-Px were also found in some patients with pemphigoid, acne conglobata, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematodes. Vegetarian diet, malnutrition and alcohol abuse could possibly account for the low values in some patients. Fifty patients with low GSH-Px levels were treated with tablets containing 0.2 mg selenium as Na2SeO3 and 10 mg tocopheryl succinate. The GSH-Px levels increased slowly within 6-8 weeks of treatment.

AGA were present in fifteen out of thirty-two patients taking a normal diet, but in none of the fourteen taking a gluten-free diet (GFD). The presence of circulating AGA was related to the severity of the enteropathy. AGA were present in all ten patients with a flat mucosa and in four of six with a convoluted mucosa, but in only one out of thirty patients with normal morphology of the small intestine. However, in those patients taking a normal diet and with a normal morphology of the intestine there was evidence of gluten sensitivity compared to those taking a GFD, as the intraepithelial lymphocyte count (IELC) was significantly raised in the peri-nuclear and supra-nuclear positions. The study shows that the presence of AGA in the serum is a good indication of the degree of gluten sensitivity as expressed by severe mucosal damage in patients with DH.","['Unsworth DJ', 'Leonard JN', 'McMinn RM', 'Swain AF', 'Holborow EJ', 'Fry L']",1981,105,6,Br J Dermatol,"Unsworth DJ, et al.

Perivascular cellular infiltrates were found to be characteristic of developing lesions. The cells were mainly round cells; alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase staining revealed that in 24-h lesions the mean percentage of T-lymphocytes was 43%, that of mononuclear phagocytes 6% and that of non-T/non-M cells (mainly B-lymphocytes) 44%. The percentage of the latter was highest (mean 81%) in 6-h specimens, suggesting that these cells are participating in the early stages of lesion formation. The infiltrating cells in dermal papillae and within subepidermal vesicles were predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes (mean 86%) with some mononuclear phagocytes and non-T/non-M cells. Immunofluorescence examination confirmed that fibrin deposition is characteristic of the initial lesions of DH and showed that the same is true of fibronectin. Seven out of eight patients had fibronectin deposits in dermal papillae. IgA was found in all and C3 in most of the specimens and, with the exception of papillary vesicles and blister cavities, the intensity of IgA and C3 fluorescence showed no marked alterations during the development of lesions.","['Reitamo S', 'Reunala T', 'Konttinen YT', 'Saksela O', 'Salo OP']",1981,105,2,Br J Dermatol,"Reitamo S, et al.

7014663,Childhood dermatitis herpetiformis. Review of the new aspects and report of a case.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) of linear IgA type occurred in a 6-month-old boy shortly after initiating sulfisoxazole therapy for a urinary tract infection. Generalized pruritic bullae on erythematous bases were present on his trunk and extremities. There were no clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of gastrointestinal involvement. Direct immunofluorescent studies of skin biopsies taken early in the course of the disease and while the child was on systemic corticosteroid therapy were negative. Eventually a linear deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction of involved skin on direct immunofluorescence was demonstrated. No circulating antibodies to the basement membrane were found. Because of close proximity of the initiation of sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin) therapy and the eruption of the initial bullous lesions, this case also presents an interesting diagnostic and therapeutic problem. Negative assays of lymphocyte migration inhibition factor (LMIF) to sulfisoxazole indicated that the likelihood of a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfa drugs was slight. The patient's clinical response to dapsone therapy was dramatic. The conflicting views of subepidermal bullous dermatosis of childhood and the difficulties in confirming a diagnosis of DH are discussed. We contend that when DH is suspected in children, various laboratory tests should be repeated several times before the diagnosis can be confirmed. The case presented here is the youngest child reported with this type of DH.","['Safai B', 'Rappaport I', 'Matsuoka L', 'Sogn D', 'Haines K', 'Lewin M']",1981,4,4,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Safai B, et al.

Gliadin was seen to bind to fibrils throughout the dermis of both normal and dermatitis herpetiformis skin, and this was particularly striking in the dermal papillae. Serum from 2 dermatitis herpetiformis patients who did not have antireticulin antibody gave reticulin staining when retested by immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of rat tissue pretreated with gliadin. Gliadin treated sections may prove useful in screening patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy for anti-gliadin antibody.

Since removal of immune complexes from the circulation is thought to depend on the Fc-receptor function of tissue macrophages, we studied this function by measuring the clearance of IgG-sensitized autologous erythrocytes in 16 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, in normal controls with the HLA-B8/DRw3 haplotype, and in randomly selected controls. All patients were HLA-B8 positive, and all of 12 patients tested were HLA-DRw3 positive. Erythrocyte clearance was reduced in eight of the 16 patients, but did not correlate with immune-complex levels. Four of eight controls with HLA-B8/DRw3 also had delayed Fc-receptor-mediated clearance as compared with normal controls. In addition, both patients and HLA-B8/DRw3-positive controls had decreased percentages and total numbers of T cells bearing Fc receptors for IgG. These findings indicate a functional Fc-receptor defect associated with the HLA-B8/DRw3 antigens.","['Lawley TJ', 'Hall RP', 'Fauci AS', 'Katz SI', 'Hamburger MI', 'Frank MM']",1981,304,4,N Engl J Med,"Lawley TJ, et al.

Results from a gastroenterological routine practice with a high detection rate of coeliac disease showed that a low concentration of serum folate was the commonest abnormality in the serum of adults with this disorder unaccompanied by dermatitis herpetiformis. It occurred in 85%, ranking with steatorrhoea in frequency, and suggests that a serum folate determination could help to refer subjects for jejunal biopsy to detect coeliac disease. In patients found to have a low serum folate recording without a known cause, the predictive value of the low value for adult coeliac disease was examined, and the findings indicate that the investigation of such patients should include jejunal biopsy.","['Hallert C', 'Tobiasson P', 'Walan A']",1981,16,2,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Hallert C, et al.

On 1 July 1979, the overall prevalence rate was found to be 58/100,000 (1:1700). The age-adjusted rates were unevenly distributed. The peak rate, 130/100,00 (1:750), appearing in the age interval of 45-54 years, indicates that unrecognized middle-aged coeliacs are not symptom-free and that they can be found in routine practice. Our peak rate of coeliac disease unaccompanied by dermatitis herpetiformis is in the same range as the rate found in Swedish children.","['Hallert C', 'Gotthard R', 'Norrby K', 'Walan A']",1981,16,2,Scand J Gastroenterol,"Hallert C, et al.

Study and literature data (author's transl)].,"Circulating immune complexes (C.I.C.) were investigated in 244 patients with various skin diseases and 100 healthy subjects. C.I.C. were detected by the PEG-C4 assay, firstly proposed by Digeon et al. using the precipitation by polyethylene glycol (PEG 3,5 p. 100) and the determination by laser nephelometry of complement component C4 in sera and in precipitates. The percentage of C4 precipitated and of positive subjects were significantly increased in numerous cutaneous diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, contact dermatitis and lichen planus. Two cases of dermatomyositis, 3 cases of post herpetic erythema multiformis and 2 cases of Kaposi-Juliusberg syndroma were also positives but no definite conclusion can be given because of the few patients tested. On the contrary, the values of precipitated C4 are normal in most cases of atopic dermatitis (the method does not detect IgE-C.I.C.) scabies, porphyria cutanea tarda, cutaneous epithelioma and discoid lupus. In chronic urticaria and in mycosis fongoides the mean values of precipitated C4 are significantly increased but the number of positive subjects is low and the significance of these results is uncertain because of the wide range of the values. The results of the present study are compared with the literature data.

Erythrocytes with membrane abnormalities seen on interference contrast microscopy ('pitted erythrocytes') were counted in venous blood samples from patients with treated coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, and from control subjects and patients who had had an elective splenectomy. 2. The percentage of 'pitted erythrocytes' was compared with the 99mTc-labelled heat-damaged erythrocyte clearance, and with the splenic size computed from scintiscans. 3. There was a significant correlation between percentage 'pitted erythrocytes' and the above methods of measuring splenic function and size. Increase in the percentage of 'pitted erythrocytes' above the control range indicated splenic hypofunction. 4. The number of coeliac patients with percentage 'pitted erythrocytes' above the control range increased with increasing age at which they started a gluten-free diet. 5. Counting of 'pitted erythrocytes' is a simple and sensitive method of assessing splenic hypofunction in treated coeliac disease. It avoids radiation exposure, and is applicable to all ages and repeatable without risk. 6.

Histological and immunofluorescent (IF) study of the skin and local provocation of skin lesions by Trafuril test were carried out in every case, intestinal biopsy in twelve cases. Four patients were found to have IgG, and three IgA, along the skin basement membrane. In nine patients, no immunoglobulins were detectable; these IF negative cases seemed to be pseudonegative. Repeated biopsy and immunoelectronmicroscopic study of the skin may be helpful. In the three patient groups classified on the basis of skin IF studies, there was no difference in the clinical and histological picture, in reaction to Trafuril test and in the result of treatment. The small intestinal mucosa was abnormal in three of twelve patients. A gluten-free diet introduced in two patients had no effect on the course of the disease.

7447195,Dermatitis herpetiformis: the skin and the gut.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is an intensely itchy, chronic, papulovesicular eruption that is usually symmetrically distributed on extensor surfaces. Histologically, it is characterized by dermal papillary collections of neutrophils and subepidermal vesicle formation. The skin has IgA deposits in areas corresponding to the earliest histopathologic change; that is, at the epidermal-dermal junction. Most patients have an associated asymptomatic gluten-sensitive enteropathy that mimics ordinary gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease) both morphologically and in its response to gluten protein. There is a marked increase in the prevalence of the major histocompatibility antigens, HLA-B8 and HLA-Dw3, and in certain B cell antigens in these patients. Although the sulfones or sulfapyridine have been the mainstay of treatment, it is now clear that the skin disease responds to strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. These findings are reviewed and from them are drawn certain conclusions as to possible pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Katz SI', 'Hall RP', 'Lawley TJ', 'Strober W']",1980,93,6,Ann Intern Med,"Katz SI, et al.

A critical review.,"Acquired bullous dermatoses, including pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid (BP), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), have been reported in association with multiple internal disorders. These associations, as well as those cases of bullous lesions in specific systemic disorders, may prove to be important markers of internal disease. Patients with acquired bullous disorders may require specialized evaluation or follow-up. Pemphigus is associated with thymoma and/or myasthenia gravis; however, the course of disease is rarely affected. Pemphigus, pemphigoid, and DH are associated with other autoimmune disorders. Particularly important are the associations of pemphigoid and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and DH and thyroid disorders. PCT may occur with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE).

This condition is distinguished from cases of dermatitis herpetiformis with linear IgA by the clinical features and the site of IgA deposition on immunoelectronmicroscopy. It is distinguished from cases of bullous pemphigoid with linear IgA by the absence of circulating IgG antibasement membrane zone antibody, the therapeutic response to dapsone and the frequent occurrence of circulating IgA antibasement membrane zone antibody.

Twenty-six were referred by other consultant dermatologists. The diagnosis had been made by the clinical features and response of the rash to dapsone. Seventeen patients were found to have IgA in the uninvolved skin (IgA positive) and in sixteen no IgA was found (IgA negative). The duration of the rash prior to referral to the DH clinic was 3 months to 19 years (mean 5.0 years) for the IgA negative patients and 2 months to 22 years (mean 5.2 years) for the IgA positive group. The length of follow-up was 3 months to 11 years (mean 5.0 years) for the IgA negative, and 2--11 years (mean 5.6 years) for the IgA positive group. During follow-up the rash cleared completely and required no treatment in seven of the sixteen IgA negative patients. Thirteen of these sixteen patients no longer required dapsone, but six patients were receiving alternative treatment. In the three patients still taking dapsone IgA has not been found on subsequent biopsy. Of the seventeen IgA positive patients only three were able to stop dapsone during follow-up and in these three the IgA was still detected in the skin. Small intestinal mucosa was abnormal in eight of eleven IgA positive patients, but was normal in all thirteen IgA negative patients in whom jejunal biopsies were performed. An alternative diagnosis to DH has subsequently been made in thirteen of the sixteen IgA negative patients. Although the significance of IgA in the skin in DH is not known it appears to be part of the disease process. Patients who have a rash suggestive of DH and which is dapsone responsive, but in whom IgA is not found in the uninvolved skin, usually turn out to have a dermatosis other than dermatitis herpetiformis. Referral to a unit with expertise in immunofluorescence techniques of skin biopsies would appear to be helpful.","['Fry L', 'Walkden V', 'Wojnarowska F', 'Haffenden G', 'McMinn RM']",1980,102,4,Br J Dermatol,"Fry L, et al.

Among non-lichen planus cases, C3 was detected in 11 of 49, and fibrinogen in only four of 49. These findings indicate that globular deposits of Ig in the dermis, though suggestive, are not pathognomonic of lichen planus.","['Gogate P', 'Valenzuela R', 'Deodhar SD', 'Bergfeld WF', 'Yeip M']",1980,73,4,Am J Clin Pathol,"Gogate P, et al.

Their histologic and ultrastructural characteristics are a more accurate mean of differenciation: employed essentially with respect to early lesions and the mode of bullous formation. But immunologic analysis is especially helpful in distinguishing the two. This study involves the analysis of acquired data concerning these two entities: 1) The nature, form, and topography of immunoglobulin and complement deposits examined under the light microscope and by immuno-electron microscopy methods. 2) Other modifications of he immunologic status of affected subjects. 3) The supposed nature of causative antigens. 4) The suggested pathogenic mechanisms. There exist discrepancies in the information at hand concerning these domains: the most important number of latest data relate to DH and notably: - The relationship between DH and gluten sensitive enteropathy for which are considered the clinical, histologic, immunologic characteristics and the relationship of this enteropathy with celiac sprue disease, the role of a gluten free diet on skin lesions and immune deposits. - The relationship between DH and specific histocompatible antigens.

We performed multiple Rubin tube intestinal biopsies on 11 patients, 6 with linear and 5 with granular IgA deposits. The gut biopsies were evaluated histopathologically in a blinded fashion. We found that none of the patients with linear deposits (5 with lamina lucida and 1 with sub-basal lamina deposits) h-d detectable jejunal abnormalities whereas all of those with granular deposits had jejunal abnormalitites (villous atrophy and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes). In parallel studies HLA typing was performed in 10 patients with linear IgA deposits and in 49 patients with granular deposits. Only 30% of those with linear deposits had HLA-B8, a prevalence not significantly different from that of the normal population (24%); in contrast, 88% of those with granular deposits had HLA-B8, a prevalence significantly greater than in the normal population ( less than 0.001).

6808558,Immunohistochemical studies of the immunoglobulin-producing cell systems of the human intestinal mucosa.,"Since the reliability of immunohistochemical observations is highly dependent on the quality of the immunological reagents, the importance of purification, characterization and performances testing of the fluorochrome conjugates is discussed. The methods of tissue processing, immunohistochemical staining and differential enumeration of fluorescing cells used in our laboratory are described. The normal intestinal mucosa shows a striking preponderance (80-90%) of IgA immunocytes, and these cells produce J chains which are incorporated into dimeric IgA. The dimers are taken up by the columnar epithelial cells which produce ""secretory component"" (SC). Complexing of dimeric IgA with SC seems to explain the selective transport of IgA through the crypt epithelium. A similar transport mechanism operates for J-chain-containing pentameric IgM. Marked alterations of the intestinal immunocyte populations are seen associated with various bowel diseases. In coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, a numerical increase takes place for all Ig-producing cell classes--in relative terms most prominent for IgG and IgM cells. In ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the IgG-cell response is very striking, In alpha-chain disease, the lamina propria is infiltrated with IgA cells that lack light-chain-producing capacity but show some ability to synthesize J chains; dimers of alpha chain are hence transported to the intestinal lumen but cannot function as antibodies. In patients with a complete and selective lack of IgA in serum, IgA-producing cells are absent from the intestinal mucosa, and there is a numerical increase of local IgG- and specially IgM-producing cells. Conversely, patients with a partial deficiency of serum IgA may show a fairly normal intestinal IgA-cell population, although the proportion of IgM-producing cells is often increased. The intestinal mucosa of patients with a generalized hypogrammaglobulinaemia is sometimes devoid of plasma cells, but rare Ig-producing immunocytes, especially of the IgM class, are often seen.

This equation is valid if the gene is dominant and its gene frequency is low. An analysis of HLA data of 61 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) showed that the HLA-associated DH susceptibility gene is obviously dominant.

Linear continuous IgA deposits along basement membrane zone (BMZ) are a most characteristic finding. They differ from the granular IgA deposits in DH, even if these are also distributed along the BMZ (however, preserving as a rule their granular pattern). IgG circulating anti-BMZ antibodies are absent, whereas in some cases IgA anti-BMZ antibodies may be found. In contrast to DH, there is no gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and the gluten-free diet is ineffective. The recognition of this bullous disease as a distinct entity is of practical significance because these cases respond well to combined treatment with sulfones and corticosteroids, all in small doses. Because of diagnostic importance of linear IgA deposits at BMZ we have proposed the name IgA linear dermatosis.

To prove this hypothesis, skin of normal volunteers and uninvolved skin of 3 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis was investigated for the presence of gliadin and gliadin binding sites. In vivo bound gliadin was not found by direct immunofluorescence using 3 different rabbit antigliadin antisera. In order to test skin for gliadin binding sites, normal sera and autologous dermatitis herpetiformis sera containing 25 mg% gliadin and tritium labeled gliadin, respectively, were used for incubation of normal and dermatitis herpetiformis skin cryocut sections and of normal and dermatitis herpetiformis skin specimens, grown under organ culture conditions. As checked by direct immunofluorescence and autoradiography, there was no specific in vitro binding of gliadin, indicating that gliadin does not fix to normal human or dermatitis herpetiformis skin.

Ultrastructurally, the IgA deposits were located chiefly below the lamina basalis (the dermal type) but also, though less abundantly, in the lamina lucida, very much as we have seen them to be in adult cases with linear IgA immune deposits at the basement membrane zone. The investigations have supplied further evidence showing the chronic bullous disease of childhood to be actually a counterpart of the form in adults with the same linear localization of IgA deposits.","['Dabrowski J', 'Chorzelski TP', 'Jablońska S', 'Kraińska T', 'Jarzabek-Chorzelska M']",1979,72,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Dabrowski J, et al.

156243,Dermatoses of the scalp.,"By judicious consideration of the clinical appearance, by direct examination with magnification, and by culture results, skin biopsy, and other laboratory results, the clinician is able to diagnose most pathological conditions of the scalp. The scalp participates in many systemic disorders and frequently is the chief site of involvement. Similarly, many generalized disorders limited to the skin exhibit their most typical manifestations in the scalp. Whenever a diagnosis eludes the investigator, more than likely he or she has not considered all of the etiological possibilities or has not pursued an adequate laboratory investigation. A few scalp diseases initially present nonspecific clinical pictures. By utilizing follow-up examinations at appropriate intervals, the diagnosis can eventually be made. Once a diagnosis is made, appropriate treatment will generally produce satisfactory improvement or cure. Nevertheless, a few generally rare conditions will defy the physician's most enlightened and aggressive therapy.",['Osment LS'],1979,8,6,J Fam Pract,Osment LS. Dermatoses of the scalp.

42142,Covert transport dysfunction in the choroid plexus as a possible cause of schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia and certain forms of idiopathic mental retardation may result from covert immune complex disease of the basal lamina of the choroid plexus, a process already known to cause covert transport dysfunction in similar structures of, for example, skin, bowel, kidney, and endocrines. Plexial attack could lead to cerebrospinal fluid contamination and then, via an ""open"" ependyma, to neurotransmitter dysfunction in the periventricular limbic brain. The immune complex mechanism implies polygenic induction, direct or autoimmune, of immune sensitivity to exogenous agents and is thus compatible with the genetic picture in schizophrenia. Candidate agents include viral coat peptides and cereal grain glutens. The glutens are known to cause immune complex skin and bowell disease variants, and some empirical evidence links them to schizophrenia. Only newer immunofluorescence methods can detect the pathology, which is otherwise silent. Systemic lupus erythematosus provides a model since it is a genetic immune complex disease strongly associated with schizophreniform psychoses, exhibits choroid plexial immunofluorescence but no central nervous system pathology by ordinary methods, and may be triggered by viruses.",['Rudin DO'],1979,5,4,Schizophr Bull,Rudin DO.

737127,Dermatoglyphics in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"In a dermatoglyphic study of 101 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, comparison was made with their normal relatives and several random normal series. The results of the several comparisons are quite consistent, considering the nature of the data, for the all point to an attenuation of qualitative and quantitative digital and palmar traits in the patients. It is argued that these differences are associated with the disease itself, and that some of the female relatives have an inherited tendency to the disorder, but do not express it. The findings suggest the involvement of genetic factors in the aetiology, and possibly intrauterine environmental influences as well.","['Roberts DF', 'Abdullah N', 'Marks J', 'Shuster S']",1978,99,6,Br J Dermatol,"Roberts DF, et al.

Taking in account clinical features, photon and electron-microscopical data, investigation for basement membrane antibodies, search for intestinal villous atrophy, effectiveness of dapsone or sulfapyridine, it is indeed possible to distinguish:1) bullous pemphigoid (very rarely); 2) dermatitis herpetiformis (not frequently), those two affections being similar to adult forms; 3) benign chronic bullous dermatitis of childhood. This last child specific disease, is the most frequently observed. Its clinical features are comparable to pemphigoids, but histopathology and immunology data are different.

Direct and indirect methods were performed for the detection of fixed immunoglobulins and complement deposits. With large deposits, immunoperoxydase and immunofluorescence show an equal sensibility and the labeling obtained with IPo is never more intensive than the labeling obtained with IF. In contrast, with small deposits, IPo was less sensitive than IF and appears negative in the majority of the cases and especially in dermatitis herpetiformis.

The colloid osmotic pressure and the total osmolality were determined in suction blister fluid after mild suction blister production by a modified ""Dermovac"" and in blister fluid of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous allergic contact dermatitis and pemphigus vulgaris and in the sera of healthy persons. The colloid osmotic pressure was measured by means of a recently developed osmometer with a semipermeable membrane between 2 chambers, one of them filled with Ringer solution, the other with the blister fluid or serum sample. The negative pressure in the first chamber was determined. The colloid osmotic pressure of suction blister fluid averages approximately 7 cm H2O, the values reach about 20 cm H2O in bullous diseases and about 38 cm H2O in the normal sera. The blister fluid colloid osmotic pressure has to rise to about 15 cm H2O or more to cause the fluid transport from the interstitial spaces of the surrounding tissue into the blister because of the negative interstitial fluid pressure and the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid. Otherwise the blister fluid is reabsorbed back into the interstitial spaces. The total osmolality does not differ in the serum and in the blister fluid.

207742,The inhibition of polymorphonuclear leukocyte cytotoxicity by dapsone. A possible mechanism in the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The effect of the sulfone compound 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (dapsone) on normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) has been investigated in vitro. The drug has a dramatically beneficial effect in dermatitis herpetiformis in which the PMNL and immune complexes has been stressed to be of importance for the development of the skin lesions. Pruritus disappears and the inflammatory eruptions clear within a few days of starting therapy. The effect of dapsone has been evaluated on the different stages of phagocytosis. Using dapsone concentrations (1-30 mug/ml) comparable with those found after therapeutic doses, we have found that the drug interferes primarily with the myeloperoxidase (MPO)-H(2)O(2)-halide-mediated cytotoxic system in the PMNL. No effect was observed on random locomotion, chemotaxis, phagocytic ingestion, oxidative metabolism, or the release of lysosomal enzymes. Kinetic studies in a cell-free system with purified MPO revealed a competitive type of inhibition using varying concentrations of NaI. Furthermore, the inhibition resulted in reduced candidicidal activity during phagocytosis of Candida albicans, and reduced cytotoxicity to adjacent mammalian cells measured as the (51)Cr release from virus-induced lymphoma cells. Because the MPO-H(2)O(2)-halide system not only fulfills the antimicrobial activity but is suggested to be a modulator of the inflammatory reaction as well, the action of dapsone in dermatitis herpetiformis may in part be explained by its effect on this system.","['Stendahl O', 'Molin L', 'Dahlgren C']",1978,62,1,J Clin Invest,"Stendahl O, et al.

684157,Dermatitis herpetiformis--a skin manifestation of a generalized disturbance in immunity.,"Detailed investigations on 42 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) are presented, emphasis being placed on the presence of other disorders having a prominent immunopathogenic basis. These patients and 42 age and sex matched controls were submitted to an extensive clinical and investigative search for the presence of disorders with an immunological basis including the atopic disorders. The findings provided further evidence supporting the association of dermatitis herpetiformis with thyroid disease and pernicious anaemia. A statistically increased incidence of Raynaud's phenomenon and atopy was found in the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis compared to the control group. In addition, of the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, two had rheumatoid arthritis, two had ulcerative colitis, one had systemic lupus erythematosus and four had splenomegaly. The possible basis for these associations is discussed and it is suggested that dermatitis herpetiformis may be part of a wider spectrum of disease. Genetic linkage and the formation of immune complexes following exposure to a dietary antigen may both be responsible for the disorders associated with DH.","['Davies MG', 'Marks R', 'Nuki G']",1978,47,186,Q J Med,"Davies MG, et al.

Autoimmune diseases appeared to occur more often in patients with coeliac disease than in the normal population, 52 such diseases being found in 45 patients. Of individual disorders, diabetes mellitus, thyroid diseases, and ulcerative colitis seemed to be more common than expected. Atopy (asthma and eczema) occurred in 7% of the patients. Most of these immunological disorders developed when the patients were on normal diet. A gluten-free diet and virtually normal jejunum did not prevent their development, and the diet had little ameliorating effect on their course apart from an occasional dramatic improvement in atopic patients.","['Cooper BT', 'Holmes GK', 'Cooke WT']",1978,1,6112,Br Med J,"Cooper BT, et al.

Recently, there was a case reported from Sweden; we present here the first observation in the FRG. The disease is characterized by eruptions of aggregated pustules, containing numerous eosinophils, and by blood eosinophilia. In our patient the disease first appeared on the scalp, leading to scarring alopecia. Since in our and in some other patients the lesions were not limited to the follicles, we feel that the term 'sterile eosinophilic pustulosis"" is more appropriate to reflect the clinical picture. For differential diagnosis Morbus Duhring and M. Sneddon-Wilkinson have to be considered. ""Sterile eosinophilic pustulosis"" differs from these mainly because of the eosinophilic infiltrations deep in the dermis. Immunofluorescence tests are negative.

639353,Antibodies to gluten and reticulin in gastrointestinal diseases.,"Antibodies to reticulin were found in 33% of coeliac patients on a normal diet. These antibodies were found in only 11% of coeliac patients on a gluten-free diet. In patients with dermatitis herpitiformis, 12% had these antibodies, whereas the highest frequency in the other diseases studied (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis and `recurrent diarrhoea') was 7% (compared to 2% in healthy controls). Antibodies to gluten, demonstrated with the immunofluorescence technique, were found in all coeliac children on a normal diet that were studied, and in half of the adults with the untreated disease. In children and adults on a gluten-free diet these frequencies decreased to 87 and 32%. In Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, recurrent diarrhoea, dermatitis herpetiformis and ulcerative colitis, the frequencies were 52, 42, 37, 18 and 18%, respectively (and in 4% of controls). It was therefore concluded that antibodies to gluten were sensitive markers for gastrointestinal diseases, but were not specific for gluten enteropathy. Antibodies to reticulin, on the other hand, were less sensitive but of far greater specificity for coeliac disease. Gluten antibodies were of the IgA, IgM and IgG classes, whereas antibodies to reticulin were only of the IgA and IgG classes. Both types of antibody were found to be non-complement-fixing. Autoantibodies to smooth muscle were found in 5% of the coeliac patients (and in 0% of controls). No relationship with hepatic complications was found. In the patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, autoantibodies to gastric parietal cells were found in 24% (and in 5% of controls). No relationship was established between the occurrence of HLA-B8 and the presence or absence of any of the antibodies studied.","['Eterman KP', 'Feltkamp TE']",1978,31,1,Clin Exp Immunol,Eterman KP and Feltkamp TE.

The findings were compared with those in matched patients on a normal diet. Jejunal histology revealed morphological improvement in every patient on a GFD whereas all patients on a normal diet continued to have villous atrophy. Intra-epithelial lymphocyte counts were normal in 8 patients on a GFD in contrast to one on a normal diet. Immunofluorescence examination of the jejunal mucosa revealed that the numbers of cells containing IgA and IgM were increased significantly in the normal diet group. The figures were lower in the GFD group but these also exceeded the values in the controls. IgA deposits were found in the uninvolved skin of every patient irrespective of the diet treatment, but the fluorescence seemed to be less intense in patients on a GFD. A clear difference was found in the occurrence of C3 deposits in the uninvolved skin. Three patients on a GFD had C3 deposits; two of these did not follow a strict diet. However C3 was found in 8 patients on a normal diet. Circulating dietary and auto-antibodies were found in two patients on a GFD and in 9 on a normal diet.

These figures show that DH is a rather common disease in Finland--much more so in Finland than in Britain. Its incidence does not differ much from that approximated for coeliac disease in Finland. DH occured in all parts of the country. The birth-places of the patients were distributed evenly over the whole country, in contrast to the distribution pattern of rare hereditary diseases in Finland.

The surrent examination (Ex II) also included microbiological culture of gastric juice and estimation of gastrin(s), parietal cell and thyroidal antibodies. Most of the controls had increased their maximum acidity and maximum acid output (MAO) between the examinations. This may indicate an altered potency of pentagastrin in recent years. Conversely, 5 of the 6 patients with atrophic gastritis showed a further reduction of maximum acidity and MAO, indicating progressive parietal cell atrophy. In the DH-group, two tendencies were observed: 6/12 patients had an increased MAO at Ex II. They had had lower mean age and higher mean MAO at Ex I, as compared with the remaining 6 patients who had a decreased MAO at Ex II.

The colloid osmotic pressure was determined in suction blister fluid after mild suction blister production by a modified ""Dermovac"" and in blister fluid of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous allergic contact dermatitis and pemphrigus vulgaris and in the sera of healthy persons. The colloid osmotic pressure was measured by means of a recently developed osmometer with a semipermeable membrane between two chambers, one of them filled with Ringer solution, the other with the blister fluid sample. The negative pressure in the first chamber was determined. The colloid osmotic pressure of suction blister fluid averages approximately 7 cm H2O, the values reach about 20 cm H2O in bullous diseases and about 38 cm H2O in the normal sera. The blister fluid colloid osmotic pressure has to rise to about 15 cm H2O or more to cause the fluid transport from the interstitial spaces of the surrounding tissue into the blister because of the negative interstitial fluid pressure and the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid. Otherwise the blister fluid is reabsorbed back into the interstitial spaces.",['Bork K'],1977,260,3,Arch Dermatol Res (1975),Bork K. [Physical forces in blister formation. I.

In all patients, IgA deposits were found in the tips of the dermal papillae of the uninvolved skin. With the anti-wheat and anti-reticulin conjugates, as well as with the rabbit anti-gliadin antiserum, no specific immunofluorescence was observed in any of the skin specimens. Skin biopsy sections of three DH patients were treated with an acid solution (pH 3.2) in an effort to dissociate antigen-antibody complexes that might be present. After the elution procedure the sections showed undiminished IgA fluorescence, and retesting with the anti-wheat- and anti-reticulin antisera again gave negative results. The skin eluates, two of which contained IgA, had no antibodies to wheat or reticulin.

588461,Gluten-free diet in dermatitis herpetiformis. I. Clinical response of skin lesions in 81 patients.,Eighty-one patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) for periods varying from 6 to 36 months. At the end of the treatment the daily requirement of dapsone was significantly lower in patients treated with a GFD than in 49 patients on a normal diet. 93% of the patients on a GFD were able to reduce the dose of dapsone whereas only 16% of the patients on a normal diet were able to do this. Complete remissions occurred only in patients on a GFD. 28% of the patients on a GFD were able to stop dapsone completely and were continuously asymptomatic when they observed a strict diet. A response to a GFD was noted on the mean daily requirement of dapsone as soon as the treatment was initiated although the length of time for an individual response varied. After one year on a GFD the patients needed on average about 40% and after 3 years about 20% of the dose required to control skin symptoms at the beginning of the diet. The patients responded to a GFD irrespective of changes found in the jejunal mucosa and irrespective of the presence of absence of HLA-B8.,"['Reunala T', 'Blomqvist K', 'Tarpila S', 'Halme H', 'Kangas K']",1977,97,5,Br J Dermatol,"Reunala T, et al.

Patients with ACD and DH frequently had IgM and IgG cells above the normal range even before re-exposure to gluten, although the range of IgA cells was normal. In both diseases IgA and IgM cells increased after gluten with a proportionally greater rise in the latter, so that numbers of IgM cells, but not of IgA, exceeded the control range in all but one patient. There were increased quantities of IgA and IgM extracellularly in the lamina propria and in epithelial cells after challenge with gluten. Third component of complement was also found in some biopsies after re-exposure to gluten. These findings support the suggestion that gluten induces a humoral immunological response within the small intestinal mucosa and that both IgA and IgM systems are involved.","['Lancaster-Smith M', 'Joyce S', 'Kumar P']",1977,18,11,Gut,"Lancaster-Smith M, et al.

Diagnosis was confirmed by finding IgA deposits in the dermal papillae of unaffected skin. Dapsone was discontinued and biopsy of affected skin was carried out when the typical rash reappeared. The biopsy findings were graded according to the severity of the histological changes. Small bowel tissue from each patient was examined and graded by stereo- and routine microscopy. Thirteen specimens (72%) were stereomicroscopically abnormal; all 18 showed villous atrophy, either partial or subtotal; and in 13 (72%) the interepithelial lymphocyte count was increased. No correlation was found between the histological severity of the skin and the small bowel lesions.

334089,A simple technique for immunoelectronmicroscopic localization of Ig on tissue sections with special reference to cutaneous pathology.,"A simple technique using immunoperoxidase-labelled antibodies is reported for the ultrastructural localization of fixed immunoglobulins in tissue lesions. This technique allows the immunolabeling of frozen sections of 15 mu mounted on glass slides. These sections are then closed over for ultrastructural examination, using an Epon-filled gelatin capsule, and then returned to the glass slide. After polymerization, the capsule containing the tissue section is separated from the glass by immersion in liquid nitrogen. This technique is applied to the study of fixed Ig in the skin lesions of lupus erythematosus, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis. The results obtained show a fine localization of fixed Ig, good tissue conservation and easy orientation of the biological material. It can be applied to the study of tissue antigens.","['Schmitt D', 'Germain D', 'Thivolet J']",1977,259,3,Arch Dermatol Res (1975),"Schmitt D, et al.

The mean age of 18 patients with morphological changes in small bowel (38 years) was significantly lower (P less than 0-001) than the mean age of nine patients with normal bowel mucosa (60 years). HLA typing confirmed the high frequency of HLA-B8 in DH (64%) but HLA-B8 was unrelated to the presence or severity of small bowel lesions. Four patients had diarrhoea with progressive weight loss or abdominal cramps subsequently responsive to gluten withdrawal. In this subgroup serum levels of IgG and IgM were significantly lower than in patients with normal small bowel mucosa. Small bowel involvement appeared to be independent of the duration and severity of skin disease, and the deposition of immunoglobulin and complement (C3) in the dermal papillae of skin adjacent to skin lesions.","['Roberts-Thompson IC', 'Stevens DP', 'Michel B', 'Braun WE', 'Morris PJ', 'Wall AJ', 'Fone DJ', 'Dworken HJ']",1977,7,4,Aust N Z J Med,"Roberts-Thompson IC, et al.

Urinary oxalate excretion decreased in two of the three patients with coeliac sprue when their fat malabsorption had improved after three months of dietary gluten restriction. Neither patient with dermatitis herpetiformis and sprue had steatorrhoea. In these patients, urinary oxalate excretion was always within normal limits. A significant positive linear relationship (y=28.25 +4-84x; r=0-82; P less than 0-01) was demonstrated between faecal fat and urinary oxalate excretion.

While the small-blister variety closely resembles adult-type dermatitis herpetiformis, the large-blister, or bullous, variety has clinical and histologic resemblances to bullous pemphigoid. The patient presented in this report clearly fits previous descriptions of the large-blister type of juvenile dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid, or benign chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood both clinically and histologically, while his therapeutic response to dapsone and the presence of in vivo bound IgA at the basement membrane of normal and perilesional skin are highly characteristic of the adult type of dermatitis herpetiformis. Immunofluorescent studies of similar cases reported in the literature, however, have shown variable results, thus obscuring their classification. Though the proper place of all such cases in the nosology of blistering diseases is not yet clear, at least some of them closely resemble adult-type dermatitis herpetiformis by two important criteria--immunologic and therapeutic.","['Hertz KC', 'Katz SI']",1977,59,6,Pediatrics,Hertz KC and Katz SI.

The indices used to assess improvement included deposition of sub-epidermal IgA in unaffected skin, counts of intraepithelial lymphocytes, deposition of IgA in jejunal villi, and electrical tests of glucose absorption. In every patient subepidermal IgA concentrations fell after gluten withdrawal. In all but one patient the dose of dapsone necessary to control symptoms was reduced. Indeed, six patients stopped taking the drug completely within a year. In nine patients biopsy specimens were taken from the jejunum; seven showed abnormalities in jejunal morphology, eight had increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, and five had increased numbers of IgA-reactive cells in the lamina propria. Two of these three indices improved after gluten withdrawal, which confirmed that all nine patients were adhering to their diet. Routine screening for malabsorption proved to be unsatisfactory for showing the mild jejunal disease found in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. The electrical test of glucose absorption showed subnormal results in all eight patients tested, however, and in six the results improved after gluten withdrawal.","['Harrington CI', 'Read NW']",1977,1,6065,Br Med J,Harrington CI and Read NW.

The specimens were categorized stereomicroscopically in three groups. Compared with controls, the total number of Ig-producing cells in a defined ""mucosal tissue unit"" was for group I (normal or minor abnormality) found to be raised by a factor of 1.4, but the class ratios remained normal. In group II (major abnormality) the total immunocyte number was raised 2.6 times; IgA, IgM, and IgG cells showed a 2.4-, 3.5-, and 5.1-fold increase, respectively. Group II (intermediate abnormality) fell between the two other groups with regard to changes in the immunocyte population. Altogether the local immunocyte pattern was very similar to that previously found in coeliac disease (CD) specimens of comparable mucosal abnormalities. IgD cells were few, and showed no increase compared with controls. Also IgE cells were few, but were encountered more frequently than in controls. As in CD, staining for extracellular Ig in the lamina propria tended to be more intense than in controls. Normal or increased staining for SC, IgA and IgM in the crypt epithelium indicated a normal external transfer of these components. DH differed from DC in showing no significant rise in the level of serum IgA.

From 4 patients with pemphigoid, samples of fluid were collected, adequate to permit of analysis regarding the identity of the spasmogenic material. In silicic acid column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and in reversed phase partition chromatography, the major part of the biological activity co-chromatographed with 3H-PGE2. In one patient part of the activity coincided with PGF2alpha.

1017719,Patchiness and duodenal-jejunal variation of the mucosal abnormality in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"The incidence and degree of patchiness of mucosal abnormality in both coeliac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is documented. As judged by both stereomicroscopy and subjective histology, patchiness occurred frequently in both CDand DH patients. In most cases the difference of abnormality was of only one grade, but in approximately 25% as assessed by stereomicroscopy and 10% as assessed by histology the difference was of two or more grades. In control subjects with normal small bowel mucosa the variation of the mucosal appearance between the duodenum and proximal jejunum was studied. Contrary to popular belief, no significant difference of villous and crypt measurements or of apparent villous ""bridging"" and ""branching"" between these two sites was found, if only well-orientated sections were studied. The stereomicroscopic appearances were also similar at these two sites, although villi tended to be broader in the duodenal biopsies. The duodenal-jejunal variation was also studied in CD and DH patients and although by both stereomicroscopy and subjective histology the appearances were similar in most patients, in approximately 33% the duodenal abnormality was the most severe and, surprisingly, the jejunal abnormality was more severe in approximately 15%. It is concluded that multiple, precisely located biopsies of both the duodenum and proximal jejunum are invaluable in the investigation of small bowel disease and in assessing response to treatment.","['Scott BB', 'Losowsky MS']",1976,17,12,Gut,Scott BB and Losowsky MS.

Thirty-eight DH patients were studied. Twenty-four of 25 perilesional skin biopsies and 50 of 67 normal-appearing skin biopsies showed the third component of complement (C3) deposited in areas corresponding to those of IgA deposition. Nine of 10 patients with bound C3 in normal-appearing and perilesional skin during periods of active disease continued to have C3 in normal-appearing skin when treatment with sulfones kept them completely free of lesions for 2 to 8 weeks. When either Hartley-strain or C4-deficient guinea pigs were given up to 150 mg/kg sulfoxone (a water-soluble sulfone) intraperitoneally for 8 days before elicitation of active Arthus, reverse passive Arthrus reactions, or Forssman shock, there was no difference in time course, character, or intensity of reactions when compared to saline-treated control animals. We were therefore unable to demonstrate any effect of sulfones on complement deposition in DH skin or on complement activation in classical or alternate complement pathway-mediated guinea-pig reactions.","['Katz SI', 'Hertz KC', 'Crawford PS', 'Gazze LA', 'Frank MM', 'Lawley TJ']",1976,67,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Katz SI, et al.

63524,Immunofluorescent localization of basement membrane in lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering disease with a characteristic histology that includes papillary edema, neutrophilic papillary microabscesses, and development of subepidermal blisters. In spite of this pathologic sequence occurring entirely beneath the basement membrane zone, prior studies have indicated that the basement membrane, as defined by period acid-Schiff (PAS) or silver stains, lies at the floor of fully formed blisters or is destroyed by the disease process. To more accurately assess its location in primary lesions of DH, the basement membrane was stained using immunofluorescent techniques. Lesional skin from 5 patients with DH was used as substrate for indirect immunofluorescence with sera from patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) and fluoresceinated antihuman IgG. The BP-stained basement membrane was attached to the roofs of early blisters, where it would be expected from the pathologic sequence of blister formation. PAS stains of the same or serial sections show the basement membrane to be in the roof or at the floor of the blisters. PAS stains of sections from formalin-fixed lesional skin, on the other hand, show the basement membrane to routinely lie at the blister floor, when not destroyed. The BP-stained epidermal basement membrane has greater anatomic and functional significance than either the PAS-or silver-stained basement membrane for two reasons: (1) it corresponds to a specific morphologic structure, the lamina lucida, a part of the epidermis, and remains attached to the rest of the epidermis unless destroyed; and (2) it is antigenic, capable of binding with BP antibodies.","['Hertz KC', 'Gazze LA', 'Katz SI']",1976,67,6,J Invest Dermatol,"Hertz KC, et al.

972258,Ultrastructural localization of immunoglobulins in skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.,"A multistep immunocytochemical method utilizing horseradish peroxidase as an immunologically bound marker was used to detect and localize IgA deposits in skin of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis at the ultrastructural level. IgA was found in the upper papillary dermis forming irregular aggregates in seemingly haphazard distribution. These aggregates were associated with microfibrillar bundles and with the microfibrillar component of the elastic tissue. IgA was also detected on anchoring fibrils, but showed no topical relationship to the basal lamina which was always spared. This finding indicates that basal lamina components do not serve as target sites for the immunologic reaction occurring in dermatitis herpetiformis. The selective affinity of IgA deposits to microbfibrillar bundles may be relevant to the hypothesis that the skin pathology in dermatitis herpetiformis is caused by circulating gluten-antigluten complexes, trapped in the skin by reticulin-bound antireticulin antibodies which cross-react with gluten.","['Stingl G', 'Hönigsmann H', 'Holubar K', 'Wolff K']",1976,67,4,J Invest Dermatol,"Stingl G, et al.

The most common type of reaction product deposition, that which is identified by direct immunofluorescence as the speckled type of IgA deposit, shows up as clumps and yarnlike fibrils. The second type of IgA deposition, which is a linear band by direct immunofluorescence, appears to be associated with anchoring fibrils.

1252347,A comparison of histocompatibility antigens in dermatitis herpetiformis and adult coeliac disease.,"The incidence of histocompatibility antigens HL-A, 4a and 4b was studied in thirty-eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and thirty-six patients with adult coeliac disease (ACD). The 4b antigen was found in all the DH and ACD patients. HL-A 8 was found in 89% of patients with ACD--similar to the incidence reported in previous studies--and in 79% of patients with DH, a higher incidence than in previous studies which may be due to stricter criteria being used here to diagnose DH. There was no significant difference in the incidence of HL-A 8 between those patients with DH whose small intestinal biopsies appeared macroscopically abnormal and those with a normal macroscopic appearance. These findings suggest that patients with DH form a single disease group and do not support the concept previously postulated that there are two groups of patients with DH, one with an increased incidence of HL-A 8 antigen similar to that in ACD who have a gluten sensitive enteropathy (GSE), and another with a normal incidence of HL-A 8 antigen and without enteropathy.","['Seah PP', 'Fry L', 'Kearney JW', 'Campbell E', 'Mowbray JF', 'Stewart JS', 'Hoffbrand AV']",1976,94,2,Br J Dermatol,"Seah PP, et al.

This type of mixed bullous disease is more common in children (juvenile DH), although typical DH and BP cases as in adults occur also in childhood. Also herpes gestationis seems to be related to mixed bullous diseases with prevalence of immunologic phenomena characteristic of BP, although its IF pattern may be regarded as diagnostic (usually absence of circulating and in vivo bound antibasement antibodies, and presence of some complement components at the dermal-epidermal juncti0n). Especially controversial is in this group a variety of pemphigus with clinical features of DH, and good response to sulfapyridine of some cases, presenting acantholysis and immunological phenomena specific for pemphigus. For this form of pemphigus the term herpetiform pemphigus has been proposed. In the group of mixed bullous diseases should also be included cases of coexistence-in different periods, or concomitantly-of pemphigus and BP.","['Chorzelski T', 'Jablonska S']",1976,27,2,Hautarzt,Chorzelski T and Jablonska S.

766815,International mortality from bullous diseases since 1950.,"National mortality figures hold information about our overall success in treating bullous disorders which cannot be found elsewhere. The official data, since 1950, for England and Wales, the Unites States, France, Japan, Scotland, Ireland and Denmark have been analysed after corrections for changes in the population structure and in the International Classification of Disease. A steep fall in deaths occurred in England and Wales between 1952 (121 deaths) and 1955 (55 deaths). The low rate persisted from 1955 to 1962 (40 deaths) when it fell to a steady even lower level lasting until the present. The United States figures showed a sharp drop in mortality starting about 2 years earlier (from 283 deaths in 1950 to 150 deaths in 1954), followed by a gradual fall to the present. Mortality in Scotland, Ireland and Denmark has followed the same general pattern but the figures from France, after a steady fall between 1951 (68 deaths) and 1965 (29 deaths), have risen again until 1971 (62 deaths). The number of deaths has not fallen in Japan but the data are difficult to interpret. The timing of the improvement in mortality in England and Wales, and in the United States, fits well with the introduction of systemic steroids into general use. A fall to about one-third of the presteroid level is in general agreement with the improvement recorded in smaller personal series from several centres.",['Savin JA'],1976,94,2,Br J Dermatol,Savin JA.

Two antisera (B-1 and W-1) reacted with B lymphocytes form G.S.E. and D.H. patients. Antiserum B-1 reacted with cells from thirteen of sixteen G.S.E. patients and from fifteen of nineteen D.H. patients, while antiserum W-1 reacted with cells from fifteen of sixteen G.S.E. patients and from fifteen of fifteen D.H. patients. None of the sera tested reacted with B lymphocytes from thirty-seven normal individuals, whether or not they were HL8-B8 positive.

1252338,The ultrastructural changes in the skin in dermatitis herpetiformis after withdrawal of dapsone.,"The development of skin lesions in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis after the withdrawal of their dapsone therapy was studied with the electron microscope. In control biopsies from patients prior to cessation of treatment, membrane-bound vacuoles were found beneath the basal lamina of the epidermis as previously described. After dapsone withdrawal, there was an apparent increase in the number of vacuoles and occasionally several vacuoles appeared to have coalesced forming an early blister. At this stage, the basal lamina and associated hemidesmosomes were normal although in places there were small discontinuities in the basal lamina. Where the reaction was more intense, vacuoles and cells, mainly eosinophils, were embedded in fibrin de posits. Above this, the basal lamina was usually disrupted with involvement of the basal epidermal cells. These results suggest that the vacuoles do play a part in the formation of the pathological lesion in dermatitis herpetiformis. In addition, the basal lamina is shown to be only secondarily involved. The nature of the vacuoles has still to be elucidated.","['Riches DJ', 'Martin BG', 'Seah PP', 'Fry L']",1976,94,1,Br J Dermatol,"Riches DJ, et al.

Immunofluorescence studies showed IgA deposits in a linear homogeneous pattern at the basement membrane zone in all patients, and IgG was present in five. No circulating anti-basement membrane antibodies were detected by repeated immunofluorescence examinations. The authors conclude that the occasional overlapping of BP and DH should not lead to dropping the distinction between the two entities. For overlap cases that cannot be classified as BP or DH, the term ""intermediate or mixed form of DH and BP"" seems to be most suitable.","['Jablonska S', 'Chorzelski TP', 'Beutner EH', 'Maciejowska E', 'Rzesa G']",1976,112,1,Arch Dermatol,"Jablonska S, et al.

133599,[Chronic mucosynechial pemphigoid: so-called ocular pemphigus].,"The so-called ocular pemphigus is an oculocutaneomucosal disease, the clinical manifestations of which have been recognized for over a century while its recognition as a nosological and histopathological unit is quite recent. The clinical picture in the eye consists essentially of progressive scar contraction which, preceded by a transient bullous phase, leads to symblepharon, entropion and trichiasis. Corneal complications, such as bullous eruption, erosions, proliferation of vasculoconnective tissue, supervene later. The final appearance is that of complete xerosis with total symblepharon producing a typical 'statute eye'. This local process may be accompanied by bullous lesions of the skin and mucous membranes but the general condition of the patient invariably remains good. In the advanced stages of the disease the appearance is described as 'pemphigoid facies'. The nosological place of ocular pemphigus has been a matter of debate. At various times it has been identified with pemphigus vulgaris, dermatitis herpetiformis of Duhring-Brocq, erythema multiforme of Hebra, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syphilitic dermatitis bullosa and other bullous dermatoses. At present the condition is universally recognized as a clinical entity, referred to as chronic mucosynechial pemphigoid (CMSP). The anatomopathological picture is quite peculiar. The elementary lesion is a sub-epidermic bulla, hence easily distinguished from that of pemphigus vulgaris, which is situated in the Malpighian layer. This difference applies to the lesions of the skin as well as to those of the mucous membranes including the conjuctiva. In the conjunctiva, epithelial changes suggestive of its epidermization were demonstrated. The Malpighian layer shows a high glycogen and DNA content with overall reduction in enzyme activity. The dermis shows infiltration by lymphocytes, histiocytes and plasma cells, and a considerable increase in hyaluronic acid content. There are many areas of dermoepidermal separation with formation of bullae and the basal membrane is often missing. In some cases, in the centre of the bullae, we were able to demonstrate one or more lumps, consisting almost exclusively of hyaluronic acid, probably filtered in from the dermis across the altered basal membrane. Similar changes are met with also in other mucous membranes, that of buccal cavity in particular, even in ostensibly healthy areas. The histological and histochemical findings are sufficiently typical to justify early diagnostic biopsy in all suspected cases. The aetiology of the CMSP still remains debated. Two theories are under consideration at the moment, viral and autoimmune. The main argument in favour of the viral theory is that a cytopathogenic agent can be isolated from the blood of patients with different dermatoses of the pemphigus group, including the CMSP, whose cytotoxic activity can be passed through and potentiated by passage in cell cultures...",['Zingirian M'],1976,32,,Adv Ophthalmol,Zingirian M.

Are these immunologic diseases?","Seven cases of juvenile dermatitis herpetiformis have been investigated. Immunofluorescence and histologic studies were made in all and jejunal biopsies in three. Immunopathologic results were positive in all cases including one that had previously been reported to be negative. Two groups could be distinguished according to clinical and histologic criteria, response to sulfapyridine, and character of the immunoglobulin deposits. The first corresponded to dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) of adults, with characteristic lesions of the jejunal mucosa; the second corresponded either to bullous pemphigoid (BP), although in the majority of the cases without circulating antibasement-membrane antibodies, or to a mixed type with the combined features of DH and BP. Repeated biopsies with serial sections are essential for demonstrating immune deposits. The question arises whether any immunologically negative cases of ""benign chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood"" actually exist.","['Chorzelski TP', 'Jablonska S', 'Beutner EE', 'Maciejowska E', 'Jarzabek-Chorzelska M']",1975,65,5,J Invest Dermatol,"Chorzelski TP, et al.

1193423,The cellular infiltrate of the jejunum in adult coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis following the reintroduction of dietary gluten.,"The cellular infiltrate of the jejunal mucosa has been studied in patients with both treated and untreated adult coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis and serially in treated patients before and after the reintroduction of gluten to the diet. In adult coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis the jejunal mucosa showed similar abnormalities of the cellular infiltrate which was characterized by an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria plasma cells and eosinophils, with the greatest numbers of cells occurring in untreated patients. At 24-48 hours following a single 25-g gluten challenge there was an increase in lamina propria plasma cells, lymphocytes and eosinophils and intraepithelial lymphocytes. This rise was sustained after seven days on a gluten-containing diet for all of these cell groups except lamina propria lymphocytes. These responses were essentially similar in both adult coeliac disease and in those dermatitis herpetiformis patients who had jejunal lesions before treatment. In dermatitis herpetiformis patients with normal jejunal morphology on a normal diet there was an upward trend in lamina propria plasma cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes within one to three weeks of taking extra dietary gluten. These results are compatible with the view that more than one immunological mechanism may be responsible for the pathogenesis of the jejunal lesion of coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Lancaster-Smith M', 'Kumar PJ', 'Dawson AM']",1975,16,9,Gut,"Lancaster-Smith M, et al.

Recordings were made of all-night electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, submental electromyogram, and muscle potentials from both forearms. Bouts of scratching during orthodox (NREM) sleep occurred more frequently in stages 1 and 2 than in stages 3 and 4. The frequency in paradoxial (REM) sleep was close to that in stage 2 sleep.

1170802,The pathogenesis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is characterized by flattening of intestinal villi and malabsorption caused by the toxic effect of gluten, a wheat protein. Gluten activates an endogenous mechanism of toxicity that may be the local mucosal immune system: local mucosal immunoglobulin and antigluten antibody production occur soon after gluten ingestion. Approximately 80% of patients with this disease possess HL-A8, a second segregant series antigen. This association also occurs in dermatitis herpetiformis, a disease with vesicular skin lesions and gluten-sensitive flattening of intestinal villi. The association suggests that the fundamental abnormality in enteropathy is a binding reaction involving gluten protein and a binding site on a cell surface, determined in part by the histocompatibility gene; this reaction then results in a local mucosal immune response to gluten. Alternatively, the fundamental abnormality may be the presence of an abnormal immune-response gene linked to the HL-A8 gene or acting in concert with it; this immune-response gene results in local mucosal production of antigluten antibody.","['Strober W', 'Falchuk ZM', 'Rogentine GN', 'Nelson DL', 'Klaeveman HL']",1975,83,2,Ann Intern Med,"Strober W, et al.

In one case IgG were found at the BM zone in one biopsy specimen, but were not demonstrable in several other biopsies. The IF findings seem to indicate both the alternate and classical pathways of complement activation, and speak in favor of a relation between herpes gestationis and bullous pemphigoid, in which sometimes the immunoglobulins are also not demonstrable and the immunofluorescent pattern is very much like that of herpes gestationis.","['Jablonska S', 'Chorzelski TP', 'Beutner EH', 'Maciejowska E', 'Rzesa G']",1975,252,4,Arch Dermatol Forsch,"Jablonska S, et al.

In fifteen of these cases uninvolved skin sites were also examined. Globular or cytoid body-like deposits of immunoglobulins, mainly IgM, were detected in forty-six of the active lesions, and in half the uninvolved skin biopsies. The deposition of fibrin in the papillary dermis and around follicular structures was seen only in the active lichen planus papules. The significance of these findings was assessed by comparison with the IF results obtained in 252 biopsies from various cutaneous disorders, stained by the same technique during the period of this study. Although the presence of immunoglobulin cytoid bodies and fibrin was found to be highly characteristic of lichen planus, these findings were not specifically diagnostic. Morphologically identical deposits were seen not infrequently in lupus erythematosus and in eczema. Active lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis, erythema multiforme and other rare dermatoses also showed these cytoid body-like immunoglobulin deposits.","['Abell E', 'Presbury DG', 'Marks R', 'Ramnarain D']",1975,93,1,Br J Dermatol,"Abell E, et al.

In pemphigus, early complement components (C1, C4, and C2) appear to be activated in addition to later components (C3 and C5), suggestive of classical pathway activation. Participation of properdin in addition to early complement components suggests local activation of both complement pathways in bullous pemphigoid and cicatricial pemphigoid.

In the methotrexate-treated psoriatic group (24) and mean and variability did not differ significantly from normal. In most hospitalized patients a low glutathione reductase activity rose within a few weeks, but in a case of dermatitis herpetiformis a very low level persisted for 3 months. Blood samples with very low glutathione reductase activity, taken from a case of psoriasis and from a patient on griseofulvin treatment, gave a positive peroxide test and tended to hemolyze; these returned to normal together with the glutathione reductase activity.","['Seutter E', 'Colsen ML', 'van de Staak WJ', 'Seutter-Berlage F']",1975,151,4,Dermatologica,"Seutter E, et al.

Two patterns of tissue staining were demonstrated, one of which was almost invariably associated with jejunal subtotal villous atrophy.

The appearance of the reaction to Trafuril is similar to DH lesions. It differs markedly from the reactions to iodide where, as a rule, only one large blister results. The reaction is most pronounced 12-24 hours after application of Trafuril. The reactivity is strongest in the predilection areas for dermatitis herpetiformis. Strongly increased reactivity to Trafuril in DH is induced by pretreatment with streptokinase, streptokinase-streptodornase, or urokinase. Diminished reactivity to Trafuril is seen after pretreatment with injections of Compound 48/80, tranexamic acid, cromoglycate, or application of fluocinolone-acetonide, as well as after stroking the skin.","['Michaëlsson G', 'Svensson L']",1975,55,5,Acta Derm Venereol,Michaëlsson G and Svensson L.

4426977,The small intestine in dermatitis herpetiformis.,"Small intestinal biopsies from 43 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have been studied. The diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis was made on clinical and histological criteria and the presence of IgA deposits in the uninvolved skin. The macroscopic appearance of the intestinal biopsy was flat in 13, convoluted in 10, leaves only in eight, and fingers and leaves in 12. Twenty small intestinal biopsies from patients who did not have dermatitis herpetiformis or gastrointestinal disorder showed leaves only in three and fingers and leaves in 17. The mean total lymphocyte count per 1000 epithelial cells for this control group was 159 +/- SE 13; for the dermatitis herpetiformis patients with flat biopsies it was 464 +/- SE 27; for the convoluted biopsies 365 +/- SE 59; for leaves only 535 +/- SE 39; and for the fingers and leaves biopsies 301 +/- SE 31. The counts for all four groups are significantly greater than the control group (P < 0.001). Three of the 43 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis had lymphocyte counts below 200 per 1000 epithelial cells, and four of our controls had counts greater than 200 but none above 300. In the control group the mean counts for lymphocytes per 1000 epithelial cells in the basal position of the intestinal epithelium was 79 +/- SE 8; in the dermatitis herpetiformis flat biopsies it was 89 +/- SE 11; for the convoluted biopsies 93 +/- SE 12; for the leaves only biopsies 121 +/- SE 18 and for the fingers and leaves 98 +/- SE 13. However, the mean lymphocyte count in the perinuclear position was 81 +/- SE 7 for the controls, 362 +/- SE 23 for the flat dermatitis herpetiformis biopsies; 251 +/- SE 46 for the convoluted specimens; 402 +/- SE 43 for the leaves only specimens, and 195 +/- SE 25 for the fingers and leaves biopsies. The mean lymphocyte count for the supranuclear position was 0.55 +/- SE 0.22 for the control group; 13.7 +/- SE 2.3 for the flat dermatitis herpetiformis biopsies; 20.0 +/- SE 6.9 for the convoluted biopsies; 14.5 +/- SE 3.3 for the leaves only biopsies; and 8.3 +/- SE 2.6 for the fingers and leaves biopsies. Thus in gluten-sensitive enteropathy the increase in lymphocytes in the intestinal epithelium is in the perinuclear and supranuclear position. The ratio of basal lymphocytes to peri- and supranuclear lymphocytes appears to be 1:1 in normal intestinal epithelium, but approximately 1:4 in the gluten-sensitive enteropathy of dermatitis herpetiformis.","['Fry L', 'Seah PP', 'Harper PG', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'McMinn RM']",1974,27,10,J Clin Pathol,"Fry L, et al.

4834885,Dermatitis herpetiformis. Immunologic concomitants of small intestinal disease and relationship to histocompatibility antigen HL-A8.,"In the present study the relation between the gluten-sensitive intestinal lesion observed in dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and in gluten-sensitive enteropathy (coeliac sprue) (GSE) was analyzed. Jejunal IgA synthesis in DH was estimated from the extent of incorporation of [(14)C]leucine into IgA in jejunal biopsy specimens during short-term in vitro culture. Patients with DH have significantly elevated incorporation values as compared to normal control individuals (18,880+/-13,614 vs. 5,830+/-3,190 cpm/mg tissue protein/ 90 min) (P < 0.02) and the degree of elevation correlates well with the degree of morphologic abnormality. Thus patients with DH are similar to patients with GSE where elevated local mucosal IgA synthesis has also been observed. By using both morphologic and immunologic criteria for evaluating intestinal status, patients with DH and intestinal disease were distinguished from patients with DH free of intestinal disease. Of the eight patients in the former group, seven carried HL-A8 (87.5%), an incidence which is strikingly similar to that observed in patients with GSE alone (88.5%). In contrast, of the seven patients in the latter group (without gastro-intestinal disease) two had HL-A8, an incidence (27%) not significantly different from that in the normal population (20%) (P > 0.1).Thus, both in respect to local mucosal increase in IgA synthetic rates and in respect to the association with HL-A8, the intestinal lesion of DH is similar to that of GSE.","['Gebhard RL', 'Falchuk ZM', 'Katz SI', 'Sessoms C', 'Rogentine GN', 'Strober W']",1974,54,1,J Clin Invest,"Gebhard RL, et al.

4601207,Trophic skin ulceration of leprosy: skin and serum zinc concentrations.,"Skin and serum zinc measurements have been made in patients with leprosy with and without trophic skin ulceration and in several other groups. Serum zinc concentrations were decreased in leprosy irrespective of the presence or absence of skin ulceration. Serum zinc concentrations in leprosy were also unrelated to smears positive for Mycobacterium leprae and to the clinical type of leprosy. Since a decrease of the serum zinc was also found in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and pulmonary tuberculosis it seems likely that the decreased serum zinc in leprosy is a nonspecific metabolic consequence of chronic skin and internal disease. The mean skin zinc concentration in leprosy did not differ significantly from the corresponding value in control subjects, the lack of agreement between serum and skin concentrations being possibly related to the presence of nonexchangeable keratin-bound zinc in skin. Though the clinical significance of lowered serum zinc concentrations in leprosy is uncertain therapeutic trials of zinc treatment in leprosy with trophic skin ulceration seem justifiable.","['Oon BB', 'Khong KY', 'Greaves MW', 'Plummer VM']",1974,2,5918,Br Med J,"Oon BB, et al.

Studies were performed in patients before and after treatment of the jejunal lesion.Total immunofluorescent plasma cells were increased in untreated adult coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis patients with jejunal lesions, but in general the normal predominance of IgA > IgM > IgG was found. There was no difference from controls in IgA-containing cells in the two conditions before or after treatment. The numbers of IgM-containing cells were significantly increased both before and after treatment in groups of patients with adult coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis who had jejunal lesions. IgG-containing cells were significantly raised in only the before-treatment groups. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis without jejunal lesions, even whilst on gluten-containing diets, had normal numbers of immunoglobulin-containing cells. IgA and IgM jejunal fluid immunoglobulins were significantly raised in dermatitis herpetiformis and adult coeliac disease.It is concluded that patients with dermatitis herpetiformis with jejunal morphological abnormality have a comparable immunological disturbance of the jejunal mucosa to that found in adult coeliac disease.","['Lancaster-Smith M', 'Kumar P', 'Marks R', 'Clark ML', 'Dawson AM']",1974,15,5,Gut,"Lancaster-Smith M, et al.

The geometric means of the IgG, IgA and IgM concentrations of each of the patient groups were compared with those of a control group comprising 156 individuals. A significantly raised IgG level was found only in patients with pemphigus; in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, other eczemas, and psoriasis vulgaris the IgG level was significantly lowered. The IgA level was significantly elevated in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus and (bullous) pemphigoid, and the IgM level was significantly depressed in patients with atopic dermatitis. IgE determinations, done with the Ouchterlony technique in a selected group of patients, showed raised levels in some patients with malignant reticulosis and other eczemas but not in those with atopic dermatitis. Comparison of the results of the serum immunoglobulin determinations with the immunoglobulin synthesis of lesional skin showed no correlation between the local synthesis of immunoglobulins in the skin and changes in the serum levels.","['Lai A Fat RF', 'van Furth R']",1974,17,1,Clin Exp Immunol,Lai A Fat RF and van Furth R.

4820629,Amino acid and peptide absorption in patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis.,"A double-lumen perfusion technique has been used to study amino acid and peptide absorption in eight normal control subjects, 13 patients with untreated adult coeliac disease, and 16 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis who had varying morphological abnormalities of the small bowel. All subjects were perfused with isotonic solutions containing 10 mM glycyl-L-alanine and 10 mM glycine + 10 mM L-alanine. Patients with adult coeliac disease had impaired absorption of glycine (p < 0.01) and L-alanine (p < 0.05) from the amino acid solution compared with the control subjects. Amino acid uptake from the dipeptide solution was not significantly impaired, although four individual patients had impaired uptake of both amino acids. In contrast to these findings, very few patients with dermatitis herpetiformis had impaired amino acid absorption from either solution. Sodium absorption was impaired from both solutions when the groups of patients with adult coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis with subtotal villous atrophy and partial villous atrophy were studied, and there were patients in each group who secreted sodium and water. The results suggest that malabsorption of dietary protein is unlikely to occur in dermatitis herpetiformis but may occur and contribute to protein deficiency seen in some severe cases of adult coeliac disease. The impairment of sodium and water absorption provides evidence that there may be functional impairment of the jejunal mucosa in dermatitis herpetiformis as well as in adult coeliac disease.","['Silk DB', 'Kumar PJ', 'Perrett D', 'Clark ML', 'Dawson AM']",1974,15,1,Gut,"Silk DB, et al.

4587940,Types of 'reticulin' antibodies detected in human sera by immunofluorescence.,"Reticulin antibodies have been classified by immunofluorescence into five types reacting with distinct antigens of intra- and extracellular components in mesenchyme. Two types of fibrillar antigens can be distinguished on the basis of the staining patterns, anatomical distribution, and species specificity. A third antibody reacts with either small fibres, amorphous proteins, or mucopolysaccharides lining the hepatic sinusoids (ground substance antigens). In addition, at least two kinds of intrasinusoidal cells show cytoplasmic fluorescence, ie, Kupffer cells and glass-adherent, blood-borne cells antigenically related to peritoneal macrophages. Some sera may contain antibodies reacting with sinusoidal endothelial cells though this has not yet been proven. It has been confirmed that all these distinct antibodies related to reticulin antigens are most frequent in dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease, but they are also found with increased frequency in chronic heroin addicts and in rheumatoid and Sjögren's syndromes. About 5% of normal individuals had such antibodies and no significant increase could be demonstrated in autoimmune disorders or in liver cirrhosis. The antibodies appear to be stimulated by bacterial or nutritional antigens and are likely to represent anamnestic responses rather than direct cross reactions with a multiplicity of foreign antigens.","['Rizzetto M', 'Doniach D']",1973,26,11,J Clin Pathol,Rizzetto M and Doniach D.

4752034,Cell kinetics in flat (avillous) mucosa of the human small intestine.,"A new method for the analysis of small-intestinal crypt-cell kinetics using routine peroral diagnostic biopsies is described. Untreated patients with childhood and adult coeliac disease and adults with the gluten-sensitive enteropathy of dermatitis herpetiformis were studied, together with groups of adult and childhood controls. In the classical flat avillous mucosae the increase in crypt size was found to be three-dimensional. The number of proliferating cells per crypt was shown to be markedly increased, and an even greater rise in the crypt-cell production rate was demonstrated. A significant increase in the mitotic index was also confirmed in the avillous mucosae. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that the characteristic crypt morphology in glutensensitive enteropathy can be explained as an adjustment to accommodate the expanded mass of proliferating and maturing cells necessary to support the augmented cell production rate. We may speculate that this in turn is a response to a pathologically rapid loss of cells from the mucosal surface.","['Wright N', 'Watson A', 'Morley A', 'Appleton D', 'Marks J']",1973,14,9,Gut,"Wright N, et al.

4199092,"In vitro synthesis of immunoglobulins, secretory component and complement in normal and pathological skin and the adjacent mucous membranes.","A study on the synthesis of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE), secretory component and complement in normal and pathological skin and in the adjacent mucous membranes (i.e. conjunctiva, nasal, oral and vaginal mucosa) is reported. The results are based on the culture of tissue samples in a medium with two radioactive amino acids and the detection of synthesized proteins by autoradiography of the immunoelectrophoretic pattern of the culture fluid, except in the case of IgE for which the Ouchterlony technique was used. The results indicate that the normal skin does not synthesize immunoglobulins, whereas normal mucous membranes produce IgG and IgA. In the lesions of various skin diseases immunoglobulins are synthesized, mainly IgG but sometimes also IgA and IgE. The cells responsible for the production of immunoglobulins are plasma cells and lymphoid cells present in the skin lesions and mucous membranes. Synthesis of the free secretory component could be demonstrated only in certain mucous membranes (i.e. conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, and oral mucosa). Complement (C3) synthesis was found in normal skin, mucous membranes (i.e. conjunctiva, nasal and oral mucosa), and in the lesions of such skin diseases as discoid lupus erythematosus, (bullous) pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, malignant reticulosis, eczema and lichen planus.

4574903,Antireticulin antibody: incidence and diagnostic significance.,"Sera from 101 patients with adult coeliac disease, 46 patients with childhood coeliac disease, 50 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, and 479 patients with various other diseases, including skin, gastrointestinal, haematological, and immunological disorders, have been tested for the presence of the antireticulin antibody. Positive sera were retested at higher dilutions. Antireticulin antibody was only found in a significant proportion of patients with three diseases, ie, coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, and Crohn's disease. Antireticulin antibody was present in 38 out of 101 patients (38%) with adult coeliac disease, 27 out of 46 patients (59%) with childhood coeliac disease, 11 out of 50 patients (22%) with dermatitis herpetiformis, and nine out of 38 patients (24%) with Crohn's disease. In the 434 other patients with various disorders the antireticulin antibody was present in only six 1.4%) (two patients were pregnant, one had vitiligo, one had tropical sprue, one had reticulum cell sarcoma, and one had pernicious anaemia). In patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy, ie, coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, there was a significantly higher incidence in patients taking a normal diet compared with those on a gluten-free diet. The presence of antireticulin antibody would appear to be particularly helpful in diagnosing childhood coeliac disease as it was found in 22 out of 26 patients (85%) taking a normal diet.","['Seah PP', 'Fry L', 'Holborow EJ', 'Rossiter MA', 'Doe WF', 'Magalhaes AF', 'Hoffbrand AV']",1973,14,4,Gut,"Seah PP, et al.

Clinical significance.,"Sera of 532 patients with bullous diseases, connective tissue diseases and malignancies were tested for pemphigus epidermal intercellular fluorescence (ICF) and for the bullous pemphigoid ;tubular' band by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique. Human normal skin cryostat sections were used. The band and ICF were seen primarily only in bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus respectively, Some indirect band and ICF-negative patients demonstrated positive direct results in involved skin. suggesting that direct tests should be performed in indirect negative patients clinically thought to have pemphigus or bullous pemphigoid.

5070159,Lymphocytic infiltration of epithelium in diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy.,"The macroscopic appearance of the mucosa of the small intestine and the lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium were studied in 27 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and in 11 control subjects. The mucosa was abnormal in appearance in 13 of the patients and normal in 14 patients and in all the controls. In 25 (93%) of the patients the intraepithelial lymphocyte count was significantly raised compared with the controls. The increased lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium in the patients probably represented an underlying immunological reaction of the small intestine to gluten, since the infiltration lessened in five out of six patients after a year on a gluten-free diet and in all of four patients after three years on a gluten-free diet.Increased lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium of the small intestine seems a surer sign of gluten sensitivity than the macroscopic appearance of the mucosa, and a diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy may no longer be excluded when the mucosa appears normal. Further evidence of the significance of increased lymphocytic infiltration is that patients with normal-looking mucosa but with raised intraepithelial lymphocyte counts often had low serum folate levels.","['Fry L', 'Seah PP', 'McMinn RM', 'Hoffbrand AV']",1972,3,5823,Br Med J,"Fry L, et al.

Eight of them had definite splenic atrophy. The average splenic cross-sectional area of the remaining 16 with normal clearance times was substantially smaller than normal, suggesting some degree of splenic atrophy. No relationship of splenic hypofunction to intestinal biopsy findings, folate status, reticulin antibody, or treatment with a gluten-free diet or dapsone was evident.","['Pettit JE', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Seah PP', 'Fry L']",1972,2,5811,Br Med J,"Pettit JE, et al.

5109407,"110 children with coeliac disease, 1950-1969.","110 children with coeliac disease investigated over a period of 19 years are presented in 2 groups, 74 children presenting under 4 years and 36 over 4 years. Sixty per cent of the older children showed extreme stunting of growth, while 28% in the younger group at referral were on or below the 3rd centile. 75% of the younger children were anaemic as compared with over 90% of the older children. Since 1952 all patients have been treated with a gluten-free diet, but in acute cases fluids only were allowed until dilatation of the small bowel had subsided. Thereafter, a low-fat-milk, and gluten-free diet was introduced in easy stages. Nearly all the younger children showed a good response to treatment, and an average weight gain of 1·6 kg was recorded 2 months after treatment had begun. There was no clinical evidence of lactase deficiency. Relapses occurred in every child who had returned to a gluten-containing diet for any length of time. In younger children symptoms soon became apparent, but in the older group symptoms were sometimes delayed for months—or even years. Methods for detecting such subclinical relapses are described. Forty-four children were followed up for periods of 8 to 19 years. 20 children who remained on a gluten-free diet gained weight, grew normally, and had no complications. The remainder, who did not, developed suboptimal growth and chronic ill health and were prone to diarrhoeal attacks, iron deficiency, and megaloblastic anaemia. 2 developed dermatitis herpetiformis. One had a crisis at pregnancy. Reasons are given for recommending a life-long gluten-free diet.","['Young WF', 'Pringle EM']",1971,46,248,Arch Dis Child,"Young WF and Pringle EM. 110 children with coeliac disease, 1950-1969. 110 children with coeliac disease, 1950-1969. 1971; 46:421-36. doi: 10.1136/adc.46.248.421",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5109407/

The pituitary component of the response was analysed by measuring plasma immunoreactive ACTH levels. Three patients showed a nyctohemeral ACTH rhythm and normal ACTH responses to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Consistently undetectable morning plasma ACTH levels were found in the fourth patient, who also showed an unusually delayed rise in both ACTH and corticosteroid levels in response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, though the peak values attained were normal.The lack of suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function together with the good clinical response in these four patients suggests that treatment with depot tetracosactrin should be considered when long-term corticosteroid therapy is required.","['Irvine WJ', 'Cullen DR', 'Khan SA', 'Ratcliffe JG']",1971,1,5750,Br Med J,"Irvine WJ, et al.

5428850,Dermatogenic enteropathy.,"Steatorrhoea has been found in a large proportion of patients with inflammatory dermatoses, especially eczema and psoriasis. It is due to the rash itself and disappears rapidly after topical treatment of the skin. This particular enteropathy, unlike that associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, is not accompanied by an alteration in the stereomicroscopic appearance of the small bowel mucosa. The mechanism is not known. It is important to differentiate dermatogenic enteropathy from gluten sensitivity which has produced a rash, as in the former condition a gluten-free diet is not indicated.","['Marks J', 'Shuster S']",1970,11,4,Gut,Marks J and Shuster S.

4246791,Small-intestinal mucosal abnormalities in various skin diseases--fact or fancy?,"Two-thirds of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have been found to have a flat or convoluted mucosa but no special association has been found in the other dermatoses studied with structural alterations in the small bowel mucosa. The frequency distribution of the predominant and individual small intestinal mucosal features is the same in the patients in the present series with eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea as in the local control population. A predominantly convoluted mucosa has been found in the upper small intestine in 8% of these patients and in 8% of subjects without a rash. The presence of convolutions in patients with these dermatoses is merely a reflection of the incidence in the normal population of Newcastle upon Tyne. Different findings in the same skin disease in different parts of the country are explicable on the basis of variations in the normal mucosa between one geographical region and another. The increased incidence of a convoluted mucosa in the north east of England requires further study to determine whether it is indicative of an increased incidence of the coeliac syndrome in the region, or whether it results from a minor population difference or a local peculiarity of diet.","['Marks J', 'Shuster S']",1970,11,4,Gut,Marks J and Shuster S.
