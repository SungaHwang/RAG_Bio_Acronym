37897436,Factors associated with assistive technology prescription and acceptance in motor neurone disease.,"PURPOSE: The risk of delaying assistive technology (AT) prescription and implementation has significant implications on the safety and quality of life of people with Motor Neurone Disease (PwMND). This study aims to explore the barriers and enablers of AT prescription and implementation identified by PwMND and clinicians.
METHODS: A qualitative study using semi-structured focus groups with clinicians and in-depth interviews with PwMND. Sixteen clinicians and ten PwMND were recruited. Thematic analysis was completed and results were compared and discussed to reach an agreement on the final themes.
RESULTS: Three main factors were identified - PwMND, Clinician and Extrapersonal. For PwMND, personal characteristics, such as mindset, was the strongest enabler and inability to accept diagnosis and AT was the key barrier. For Clinician, communication approach was both the most identified enabler and barrier. For Extrapersonal, the availability of interactive education of AT was the strongest enabler and long wait time was a significant barrier.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified themes that clinicians could have an impact on, such as, providing interactive education, engaging PwMND and their support network, and ongoing upskilling of clinicians working in this field. Themes identified that were beyond the control of clinicians were personal characteristics, acceptance and support networks. It highlights the importance for clinicians to be flexible with their communication approach to accommodate the needs of PwMND in the acceptance of AT.","['Connolly A', 'Bailey S', 'Lamont R', 'Tu A']",2023,,,Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol,"Connolly A, et al.

Here, we describe a 43-year-old man with progressive behavioral and cognitive change, myelopathy, clinical and electrophysiologic evidence of MND, and a FUS variant of unknown significance (VUS). This VUS, a heterozygous G559A transition (Gly187Ser), was previously reported in a patient with sporadic MND and affects important FUS biophysical properties. While this rare variant's presence in a second patient with a related neurodegenerative syndrome does not establish pathogenicity, it raises the question of whether its association with our patient is coincidental and increases the possibility that FUS G559A is pathogenic.","['Swerdlow RH', 'Jawdat O', 'Swint-Kruse L', 'Townley R']",2023,7,1,J Alzheimers Dis Rep,"Swerdlow RH, et al.

37830099,The complexity of multidisciplinary respiratory care in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"UNLABELLED: Motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure, where death is usually secondary to progressive respiratory failure. Assisting people with ALS through their disease journey is complex and supported by clinics that provide comprehensive multidisciplinary care (MDC). This review aims to apply both a respiratory and a complexity lens to the key roles and areas of practice within the MDC model in ALS. Models of noninvasive ventilation care, and considerations in the provision of palliative therapy, respiratory support, and speech and language therapy are discussed. The impact on people living with ALS of both inequitable funding models and the complexity of clinical care decisions are illustrated using case vignettes. Considerations of the impact of emerging antisense and gene modifying therapies on MDC challenges are also highlighted. The review seeks to illustrate how MDC members contribute to collective decision-making in ALS, how the sum of the parts is greater than any individual care component or health professional, and that the MDC

37828358,Neuropsychological impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal spectrum disorder.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with a rapid course, characterized by motor neuron dysfunction, leading to progressive disability and death. This Review, which is aimed at neurologists, psychologists and other health professionals who follow evidence-based practice relating to ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), examines the neuropsychological evidence that has driven the reconceptualization of ALS as a spectrum disorder ranging from a pure motor phenotype to ALS-FTD. It focuses on changes in cognition and behaviour, which vary in severity across the spectrum: around 50% individuals with ALS are within the normal range, 15% meet the criteria for ALS-FTD, and the remaining 35% are in the mid-spectrum range with milder and more focal impairments. The cognitive impairments include deficits in verbal fluency, executive functions, social cognition and language, and apathy is the most prevalent behavioural change. The pattern and severity of cognitive and behavioural change predicts underlying regional cerebral dysfunction from brain imaging and post-mortem pathology. Our increased recognition of cognition and behaviour as part of the ALS phenotype has led to the development and standardization of assessment tools, which have been incorporated into research and clinical care. Measuring change over the course of the disease is vital for clinical trials, and neuropsychology is proving to be a biomarker for the earliest preclinical changes.",['Abrahams S'],2023,,,Nat Rev Neurol,Abrahams S.

37796077,[Diagnostic capabilities of spinal MR angiography and spinal MR tractography in a patient with motor neuron disease].,"Motor neuron diseases (MND) include two main forms - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). A certain part of these diseases is hereditary, while etiology of sporadic cases remains unknown. Both entities are known to develop because of motoneurons damage. Difference between them lies in the state of the descending pyramidal pathways. The pyramidal pathways in SMA are intact, as brain pyramidal neurons are not affected, thus pathology of SMA is restricted to anterior horns of spinal cord. Meanwhile, most forms of ALS arise due to loss of both cerebral and spinal motoneurons, which, in addition to anterior horn lesion, leads to pyramidal descending pathways damage either in brain or in spinal cord. While pathological distinction between these two entities is clear and definite, the clinical difference remains obscure. We present the case of 41-year old patient with MND, in whom spinal MR tractography has revealed lateral columns to be intact that proves the utility of spinal MR tractography in differential diagnosis between ALS and SMA. Given that ischemic diseases of the spinal cord often occur with a clinical picture of MND, we also examined this patient using spinal MRI angiography, revealing a pronounced narrowing and tortuosity of the spinal arteries, complicated by occlusion of the right twelve intercostal artery.","['Belenky VV', 'Plakhotina NA', 'Skoromets AA', 'Dugaev PP', 'Komantsev VN', 'Leontiev OV']",2023,123,9,Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,"Belenky VV, et al.

37787812,Factors impacting trial participation in people with motor neuron disease.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. Historically, neurological trials have been plagued by suboptimal recruitment and high rates of attrition. The Motor Neuron Disease-Systematic Multi-Arm Randomised Adaptive Trial (MND-SMART) seeks to identify effective disease modifying drugs. This study investigates person-specific factors affecting recruitment and retention. Improved understanding of these factors may improve trial protocol design, optimise recruitment and retention. Participants with MND completed questionnaires and this was supplemented with clinical data. 12 months after completing the questionnaires we used MND-SMART recruitment data to establish if members of our cohort engaged with the trial. 120 people with MND completed questionnaires for this study. Mean age at participation was 66 (SD = 9), 14% (n = 17) were categorised as long survivors, with 68% (n = 81) of participants male and 60% (n = 73) had the ALS sub-type. Of the 120 study participants, 50% (n = 60) were randomised into MND-SMART and 78% (n = 94) expressed interest an in participating. After the 1-year follow-up period 65% (n = 39) of the 60 randomised participants remained in MND-SMART. Older age was significantly associated with reduced likelihood of participation (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.88-0.96, p = 0.000488). The findings show that people with MND are highly motivated to engage in research, but older individuals remain significantly less likely to participate. We recommend the inclusion of studies to explore characteristics of prospective and current participants alongside trials.","['Beswick E', 'Johnson M', 'Newton J', 'Dakin R', 'Stenson A', 'Abrahams S', 'Carson A', 'Chandran S', 'Pal S']",2023,,,J Neurol,"Beswick E, et al.

Diagnostic challenge, Mexican patient].","BACKGROUND: The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (ALS-PDC) was first described in the islands of Guam. This pathology presented its peak incidence in the 1950s. Due to the rarity of the association, we report a clinical case with this complex. The objective was to describe the nosological and pathogenic implications of these neurodegenerative disorder, since they are not frequent to find in our population.
CLINICAL CASE: We present a case of Latinoamerican origin who initially manifested systemic symptoms of more than 6 years of evolution, with subsequent cognitive alterations. Later, patient began with gait disturbances and motor symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism with atypical data and data of motor neurone disease (MND). More studies were carried out and confirmed findings compatible with upper and lower motor neuron involvement. A mutation in the POLG gene was observed, related to mitochondrial depletion syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Despite the knowledge of this association, it is an entity whose clinical diagnosis could be very difficult to achieve. In addition, molecular mechanisms have not been fully identified, the most common genes related to Parkinsonism and ALS have been excluded, and even attempts to locate the locus were made, without achieving accurate results. Unfortunately, being a neurodegenerative disease, the prognosis is fatal, with no disease-modifying treatment.","['Aguilar-Vázquez CA', 'Gallardo-González LI', 'Raymundo-Carrillo AD', 'Reyes-Sosa LC', 'Martínez-Romo ES']",2023,61,5,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc,"Aguilar-Vázquez CA, et al.

37739732,A critical view of the use of predictive energy equations for the identification of hypermetabolism in motor neuron disease: A pilot study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: People living with motor neuron disease (MND) frequently struggle to consume an optimal caloric intake. Often compounded by hypermetabolism, this can lead to dysregulated energy homeostasis, prompting the onset of malnutrition and associated weight loss. This is associated with a poorer prognosis and reduced survival. It is therefore important to establish appropriate nutritional goals to ensure adequate energy intake. This is best done by measuring resting energy expenditure (mREE) using indirect calorimetry. However, indirect calorimetry is not widely available in clinical practice, thus dietitians caring for people living with MND frequently use energy equations to predict resting energy expenditure (pREE) and estimate caloric requirements. Energy prediction equations have previously been shown to underestimate resting energy expenditure in over two-thirds of people living with MND. Hypermetabolism has previously been identified using the metabolic index. The metabolic index is a ratio of mREE to pREE, whereby an increase of mREE by ≥110% indicates hypermetabolism. We aim to critically reflect on the use of the Harris-Benedict (1919) and Henry (2005) energy prediction equations to inform a metabolic index to indicate hypermetabolism in people living with MND.
METHODS: mREE was derived using VO₂ and VCO₂ measurements from a GEMNutrition indirect calorimeter. pREE was estimated by Harris-Benedict (HB) (1919), Henry (2005) and kcal/kg/day predictive energy equations. The REE variation, described as the percentage difference between mREE and pREE, determined the accuracy of pREE ([pREE-mREE]/mREE) x 100), with accuracy defined as ≤ ± 10%. A metabolic index threshold of ≥110% was used to classify hypermetabolism. All resting energy expenditure data are presented as kcal/24hr.
RESULTS: Sixteen people living with MND were included in the analysis. The mean mREE was 1642 kcal/24hr ranging between 1110 and 2015 kcal/24hr. When REE variation was analysed for the entire cohort, the HB, Henry and kcal/kg/day equations all overestimated REE, but remained within the accuracy threshold (mean values were 2.81% for HB, 4.51% for Henry and 8.00% for kcal/kg/day). Conversely, inter-individual REE variation within the cohort revealed HB and Henry equations both inaccurately reflected mREE for 68.7% of participants, with kcal/kg/day inaccurately reflecting 41.7% of participants. Whilst the overall cohort was not classified as hypermetabolic (mean values were 101.04% for HB, 98.62% for Henry and 95.64% for kcal/kg/day), the metabolic index ranges within the cohort were 70.75%-141.58% for HB, 72.82%-127.69% for Henry and 66.09%-131.58% for kcal/kg/day, indicating both over- and under-estimation of REE by these equations. We have shown that pREE correlates with body weight (kg), whereby the lighter the individual, the greater the underprediction of REE. When applied to the metabolic index, this underprediction biases towards the classification of hypermetabolism in lighter individuals.
CONCLUSION: Whilst predicting resting energy expenditure using the HB, Henry or kcal/kg/day equations accurately reflects derived mREE at group level, these equations are not suitable for informing resting energy expenditure and classification of hypermetabolism when applied to individuals in clinical practice.","['Roscoe S', 'Skinner E', 'Kabucho Kibirige E', 'Childs C', 'Weekes CE', 'Wootton S', 'Allen S', 'McDermott C', 'Stavroulakis T']",2023,57,,Clin Nutr ESPEN,"Roscoe S, et al.

METHODS: Patients were identified through our ongoing, prospective population-based study on MND in The Netherlands, which also includes a standardized collection of patient characteristics, genetic testing, and family history. Only patients meeting the latest consensus criteria for definite PLS were included. The family history was considered positive for MND if any family members had been diagnosed with PLS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)(-FTD), or progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). Additionally, the literature was reviewed on PLS cases in which MND co-occurred within the same family.
RESULTS: We identified 392 definite PLS cases, resulting in 9 families with a PLS patient and a positive family history for MND (2.3%). In only one of these pedigrees, a pathogenic variant (
CONCLUSIONS: The consistent observation of PLS patients with a positive family history for MND, evident in both our study and the literature, implies the presence of shared underlying genetic factors between PLS and ALS.

37644692,Intranasal neuropeptide Y1 receptor antagonism improves motor deficits in symptomatic SOD1 ALS mice.,"OBJECTIVE: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino acid peptide widely considered to provide neuroprotection in a range of neurodegenerative diseases. In the fatal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), recent evidence supports a link between NPY and ALS disease processes. The goal of this study was to determine the therapeutic potential and role of NPY in ALS, harnessing the brain-targeted intranasal delivery of the peptide, previously utilised to correct motor and cognitive phenotypes in other neurological conditions.
METHODS: To confirm the association with clinical disease characteristics, NPY expression was quantified in post-mortem motor cortex tissue of ALS patients and age-matched controls. The effect of NPY on ALS cortical pathophysiology was investigated using slice electrophysiology and multi-electrode array recordings of SOD1
RESULTS: In the human post-mortem ALS motor cortex, we observe a significant increase in NPY expression, which is not present in the somatosensory cortex. In vitro, we demonstrate that NPY can ameliorate ALS hyperexcitability, while brain-targeted nasal delivery of NPY and a selective NPY Y1 receptor antagonist modified survival and motor deficits specifically within the symptomatic phase of the disease in the ALS SOD1
INTERPRETATION: Taken together, these findings highlight the capacity for non-invasive brain-targeted interventions in ALS and support antagonism of NPY Y1Rs as a novel strategy to improve ALS motor function.","['Clark RM', 'Clark CM', 'Lewis KEA', 'Dyer MS', 'Chuckowree JA', 'Hoyle JA', 'Blizzard CA', 'Dickson TC']",2023,,,Ann Clin Transl Neurol,"Clark RM, et al.

37642362,CNM-Au8: an experimental agent for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).,"INTRODUCTION: Two established disease-specific therapies for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are riluzole and edaravone. Limitations of these medications include minimal progression slowing or survival benefit, and effectiveness only in selected populations, particularly for edaravone. AMX0035 and tofersen received US FDA approval in September 2022 and April 2023, respectively. However, phase 3 trials, further examining both medications' efficacy, are ongoing. CNM-Au8 is an efficient catalyst of energy metabolism and is therefore a potential disease-modifying treatment for ALS, a neurodegenerative condition in which there is bioenergetics impairment.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we provide an overview of the current ALS treatment market, followed by a description of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of CNM-Au8. The main preclinical and available early clinical evidence of CNM-Au8 is then described, as well as its potential as an ALS treatment.
EXPERT OPINION: Oral treatment with CNM-Au8 failed to meet primary clinical and electrodiagnostic endpoints in phase 2/3 clinical trials. Despite this failure, a number of exploratory endpoints included in phase 2/3 trials suggest CNM-Au8 has the potential to significantly slow clinical worsening, improve quality of life, and prolong survival in ALS. Further study of CNM-Au8 in a phase 3 clinical trial is currently underway.","['Bireley JD', 'Morren JA']",2023,32,8,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Bireley JD and Morren JA.

37637210,Long-term muscle-specific overexpression of DOK7 in mice using AAV9-tMCK-DOK7.,"Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction underlies several diseases, including congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) and motor neuron disease (MND). Molecular pathways governing NMJ stability are therefore of interest from both biological and therapeutic perspectives. Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) is necessary for the formation and maintenance of post-synaptic elements of the NMJ, and downstream of tyrosine kinases 7 (DOK7) is crucial for activation of the MuSK pathway. Overexpression of DOK7 using AAV9 has been shown to ameliorate neuromuscular pathology in pre-clinical disease models of CMS and MND. However, long-term consequences of DOK7 expression have been sparsely investigated and targeted overexpression of DOK7 in skeletal muscle yet to be established. Here, we developed and characterized a novel AAV9-DOK7 facilitating forced expression of DOK7 under a skeletal muscle-specific promoter. AAV9-tMCK-DOK7 was systemically delivered to newborn mice that were monitored over 6 months. DOK7 overexpression was restricted to skeletal muscles. Body weight, blood biochemistry, and histopathological assessments were unaffected by AAV9-tMCK-DOK7 treatment. In contrast, forced expression of DOK7 resulted in enlargement of both the pre- and post-synaptic components of the NMJ, without causing denervation. We conclude that muscle-specific DOK7 overexpression can be achieved in a safe manner, with the capacity to target NMJs ","['Huang YT', 'Crick HR', 'Chaytow H', 'van der Hoorn D', 'Alhindi A', 'Jones RA', 'Hector RD', 'Cobb SR', 'Gillingwater TH']",2023,33,,Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,"Huang YT, et al.

37633302,Identification of genetic risk loci and causal insights associated with Parkinson's disease in African and African admixed populations: a genome-wide association study.,"BACKGROUND: An understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying diseases in ancestrally diverse populations is an important step towards development of targeted treatments. Research in African and African admixed populations can enable mapping of complex traits, because of their genetic diversity, extensive population substructure, and distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns. We aimed to do a comprehensive genome-wide assessment in African and African admixed individuals to better understand the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease in these underserved populations.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in people of African and African admixed ancestry with and without Parkinson's disease. Individuals were included from several cohorts that were available as a part of the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program, the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium Africa, and 23andMe. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was confirmed clinically by a movement disorder specialist for every individual in each cohort, except for 23andMe, in which it was self-reported based on clinical diagnosis. We characterised ancestry-specific risk, differential haplotype structure and admixture, coding and structural genetic variation, and enzymatic activity.
FINDINGS: We included 197 918 individuals (1488 cases and 196 430 controls) in our genome-wide analysis. We identified a novel common risk factor for Parkinson's disease (overall meta-analysis odds ratio for risk of Parkinson's disease 1·58 [95% CI 1·37-1·80], p=2·397 × 10
INTERPRETATION: Our study identified a novel genetic risk factor in GBA1 in people of African ancestry, which has not been seen in European populations, and it could be a major mechanistic basis of Parkinson's disease in African populations. This population-specific variant exerts substantial risk on Parkinson's disease as compared with common variation identified through GWAS and it was found to be present in 39% of the cases assessed in this study. This finding highlights the importance of understanding ancestry-specific genetic risk in complex diseases, a particularly crucial point as the Parkinson's disease field moves towards targeted treatments in clinical trials. The distinctive genetics of African populations highlights the need for equitable inclusion of ancestrally diverse groups in future trials, which will be a valuable step towards gaining insights into novel genetic determinants underlying the causes of Parkinson's disease. This finding opens new avenues towards RNA-based and other therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing lifetime risk of Parkinson's disease.

RESULTS: A total of N = 26 studies and 8 documents were included. Thematic analysis revealed six key areas of clinical management: i. Assessment, ii. Education, iii. Advance Care Planning, iv. Adaptation of Care Plan, v. Communication and vi. Carer Support.
CONCLUSIONS: The literature on management of cognitive and behavioural decline in MND is sparse. Most peer-reviewed literature consists of expert commentary and there is a lack of primary data to guide practitioners and families on how to manage cognitive and behavioural change in MND.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Determining as early as practicable the presence of cognitive and behavioural changes in pwMND will enable practitioners to make adaptations to communication, provide education and supported decision-making for forward planning. This will enable individualised care, planned in partnership with families with MND, which incorporates personal needs and wishes.","['Francis R', 'Attrill S', 'Radakovic R', 'Doeltgen S']",2023,116,,Patient Educ Couns,"Francis R, et al.

37579081,Enteral tube feeding for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining adequate nutrition is critical for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND). Enteral tube feeding is offered to people experiencing difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) to prevent weight loss and aspiration pneumonia. Among the types of enteral tube feeding, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the typical procedure offered to people with ALS and will be mainly discussed here.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or other enteral tube feeding in people with ALS, compared to oral feeds without enteral tube feeding on: 1. survival; 2. nutritional status; 3. quality of life. To examine the incidence of minor and major complications of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and other enteral tube feeding procedures in people with ALS.
SEARCH METHODS: On 3 January 2020 and 6 February 2021, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE. Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. We screened the results to identify randomized controlled studies on enteral tube feeding in ALS. We reviewed all references from the search in published articles to identify any additional references.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cross-over trials evaluating the effectiveness and complications of PEG or other enteral tube feeding placement in ALS.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
MAIN RESULTS: We found no RCTs or quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of enteral tube feeding versus oral feeds without enteral tube feeding.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are no RCTs or quasi-RCTs to indicate whether enteral tube feeding is effective compared to continuation of oral feeding for any of the outcome measures. Such RCTs are very unlikely to be performed for ethical reasons. RCTs evaluating the effect of different enteral tube insertion techniques and timings of tube placement on survival and quality of life of people with ALS dysphagia are feasible and warranted.","['Sulistyo A', 'Abrahao A', 'Freitas ME', 'Ritsma B', 'Zinman L']",2023,8,8,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Sulistyo A, et al.

37558576,"Efficacy, safety and tolerability of high caloric diet in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","BACKGROUND: Several randomized clinical trials were done to determine whether supplementation with a high caloric diet, either through carbohydrate or lipid supplementation, is safe, tolerable and improves survival. However, most of these trials are small and the results are conflicting.
METHODS: Randomized prospective trials utilizing high caloric supplementation among patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were searched using the terms [(""amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"" or ""motor neuron disease"" or ""ALS"" or ""MND"") and (""high calorie"" or ""high fat"" or ""high protein"" or ""high carbohydrate"" or ""supplementation"")] in Medline, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, Prospero and Herdin by two independent neurologists. Journal articles deemed relevant were assessed for eligibility.
MAIN RESULTS: There were 57 articles obtained from databases, 49 of which were excluded. Four articles were further excluded since all of them had different interventions. Overall, there were 311 ALS patients included in the study, 176 of them were from the intervention group while 135 were used as controls. Overall, high caloric supplementation in ALS was deemed safe and tolerable, and also when adverse events, tolerability and mortality are combined using meta-analysis. Although in most publications the efficacy of giving high caloric supplementation has been generally beneficial, some of the outcome parameters are not statistically different from controls when studies are combined using meta-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that high calorie supplementation is generally safe and tolerable for patients with ALS. However, it has not been shown to be efficacious in improving weight and functional disability.","['Prado MB', 'Pedro KM', 'Adiao KJB']",2023,,,Rev Neurol (Paris),"Prado MB, et al.

37528849,Quality appraisal of clinical practice guidelines for motor neuron diseases or related disorders using the AGREE II instrument.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically assess the quality of CPGs for motor neuron diseases (MNDs) or related disorders and identify the gaps that limit evidence-based practice.
METHODS: Four scientific databases and six guideline repositories were searched for eligible CPGs. Three researchers assessed the eligible CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II instrument. The distribution of the level of evidence and strength of recommendation of these CPGs were determined. The univariate regression analysis was used to explore the characteristic factors affecting the quality of CPGs.
RESULTS: Fifteen CPGs met the eligibility criteria: 10 were for MND and 5 were for spinal muscular atrophy. The mean overall rating score was 44.5%, and only 3 of 15 CPGs were of high quality. The domains that achieved low mean scores were applicability (24.4%), rigor of development (39.9%), and stakeholder involvement (40.3%). Most recommendations were based on low-quality evidence and had a weak strength. The CPGs that were updated, meant for adults, and evidence based, and used a CPG quality tool and a grading system were associated with higher scores in certain specific domains and overall rating.
CONCLUSION: The overall quality of CPGs for MNDs or related disorders was poor and recommendations were largely based on low-quality evidence. Many areas still need improvement to develop high-quality CPGs, and the use of CPG quality tools should be emphasized. A great deal of research on MNDs or related disorders is still needed to fill the large evidence gap.","['Ou JY', 'Liu JJ', 'Xu J', 'Li JY', 'Liu Y', 'Liu YZ', 'Lu LM', 'Pan HF', 'Wang L']",2023,14,,Front Neurol,"Ou JY, et al.

37509427,Computational Mechanics of Form-Fitting 3D-Printed Lattice-Based Wrist-Hand Orthosis for Motor Neuron Disease.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) patients often experience hand-wrist muscle atrophy resulting in severe social consequences and hampering their daily activities. Although hand-wrist orthosis is commonly used to assist weakened muscles, its effectiveness is limited due to the rapid progression of the disease and the need for customization to suit individual patient requirements. To address these challenges, this study investigates the application of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology to design and fabricate two lattice structures inspired by silkworm cocoons, using poly-ε-caprolactone as feedstock material. Finite element method (FEM) analysis is employed to study the mechanical behavior, enabling control over the geometric configuration incorporated into the hand-wrist orthosis. Through tensile displacement and three-point bending simulations, the stress distribution is examined for both lattice geometries. Geometry-1 demonstrates anisotropic behavior, while geometry-2 exhibits no strict directional dependence due to its symmetry and uniform node positioning. Moreover, the biocompatibility of lattices with human skin fibroblasts is investigated, confirming excellent biocompatibility. Lastly, the study involves semi-structured interviews with MND patients to gather feedback and develop prototypes of form-fitting 3D-printed lattice-based hand-wrist orthosis. By utilizing 3D printing technology, this study aims to provide customized orthosis that can effectively support weakened muscles and reposition the hand for individuals with MND.","['Badini S', 'Regondi S', 'Lammi C', 'Bollati C', 'Donvito G', 'Pugliese R']",2023,11,7,Biomedicines,"Badini S, et al.

37450244,"The Molecular Link Between TDP-43, Endogenous Retroviruses and Inflammatory Neurodegeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: a Potential Target for Triumeq, an Antiretroviral Therapy.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive neurological disorder, characterised by the death of upper and lower motor neurons. The aetiology of ALS remains unknown, and treatment options are limited. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), specifically human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERV-K), have been proposed to be involved in the propagation of neurodegeneration in ALS. ERVs are genomic remnants of ancient viral infection events, with most being inactive and not retaining the capacity to encode a fully infectious virus. However, some ERVs retain the ability to be activated and transcribed, and ERV transcripts have been found to be elevated within the brain tissue of MND patients. A hallmark of ALS pathology is altered localisation of the transactive response (TAR) DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43), which is normally found within the nucleus of neuronal and glial cells and is involved in RNA regulation. In ALS, TDP-43 aggregates within the cytoplasm and facilitates neurodegeneration. The involvement of ERVs in ALS pathology is thought to occur through TDP-43 and neuroinflammatory mediators. In this review, the proposed involvement of TDP-43, HERV-K and immune regulators on the onset and progression of ALS will be discussed. Furthermore, the evidence supporting a therapy based on targeting ERVs in ALS will be reviewed.","['Dubowsky M', 'Theunissen F', 'Carr JM', 'Rogers ML']",2023,60,11,Mol Neurobiol,"Dubowsky M, et al.

37420261,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for people living with motor neuron disease: an uncontrolled feasibility study.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive weakening and wasting of limb, bulbar, thoracic and abdominal muscles. Clear evidence-based guidance on how psychological distress should be managed in people living with MND (plwMND) is lacking. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form of psychological therapy that may be particularly suitable for this population. However, to the authors' knowledge, no study to date has evaluated ACT for plwMND. Consequently, the primary aim of this uncontrolled feasibility study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of ACT for improving the psychological health of plwMND.
METHODS: PlwMND aged ≥ 18 years were recruited from 10 UK MND Care Centres/Clinics. Participants received up to 8 one-to-one ACT sessions, developed specifically for plwMND, plus usual care. Co-primary feasibility and acceptability outcomes were uptake (≥ 80% of the target sample [N = 28] recruited) and initial engagement with the intervention (≥ 70% completing ≥ 2 sessions). Secondary outcomes included measures of quality of life, anxiety, depression, disease-related functioning, health status and psychological flexibility in plwMND and quality of life and burden in caregivers. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6 months.
RESULTS: Both a priori indicators of success were met: 29 plwMND (104%) were recruited and 76% (22/29) attended ≥ 2 sessions. Attrition at 6-months was higher than anticipated (8/29, 28%), but only two dropouts were due to lack of acceptability of the intervention. Acceptability was further supported by good satisfaction with therapy and session attendance. Data were possibly suggestive of small improvements in anxiety and psychological quality of life from baseline to 6 months in plwMND, despite a small but expected deterioration in disease-related functioning and health status.
CONCLUSIONS: There was good evidence of acceptability and feasibility. Limitations included the lack of a control group and small sample size, which complicate interpretation of findings. A fully powered RCT to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ACT for plwMND is underway.

37418099,Withdrawal of mechanical ventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: a multicenter Italian survey.,"BACKGROUND: Law 219/2017 was approved in Italy in December 2017, after a years-long debate on the autonomy of healthcare choices. This Law, for the first time in Italian legislation, guarantees the patient's right to request for withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments, including mechanical ventilation (MV).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current status of MV withdrawal in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients in Italy and to assess the impact of Law 219/2017 on this practice.
METHODS: We conducted a Web-based survey, addressed to Italian neurologists with expertise in ALS care, and members of the Motor Neuron Disease Study Group of the Italian Society of Neurology.
RESULTS: Out of 40 ALS Italian centers, 34 (85.0%) responded to the survey. Law 219/2017 was followed by an increasing trend in MV withdrawals, and a significant increase of neurologists involved in this procedure (p 0.004). However, variations across Italian ALS centers were observed, regarding the inconsistent involvement of community health services and palliative care (PC) services, and the intervention and composition of the multidisciplinary team.
CONCLUSIONS: Law 219/2017 has had a positive impact on the practice of MV withdrawal in ALS patients in Italy. The recent growing public attention on end-of-life care choices, along with the cultural and social changes in Italy, requires further regulatory frameworks that strengthen tools for self-determination, increased investment of resources in community and PC health services, and practical recommendations and guidelines for health workers involved.","['Moglia C', 'Palumbo F', 'Veronese S', 'M.

37382064,Promises and pitfalls of imaging-based biomarkers in motor neuron diseases.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although neuroimaging in motor neuron diseases (MNDs) continues to generate important novel academic insights, the translation of novel radiological protocols into viable biomarkers remains challenging.
RECENT FINDINGS: A multitude of technological advances contribute to the success of academic imaging in MND such as the availability of high-field MRI platforms, novel imaging techniques, quantitative spinal cord protocols to whole-brain spectroscopy. International collaborations, protocol harmonization efforts, open-source image analysis suites also fuel developments in the field. Despite the success of academic neuroimaging in MND, the meaningful interpretation of radiological data from single patients and accurate classification into relevant diagnostic, phenotypic and prognostic categories remain challenging. Appraising accruing disease burden over the short follow-up intervals typically used in pharmacological trials is also notoriously difficult.
SUMMARY: Although we acknowledge the academic achievements of large descriptive studies, an unmet priority of neuroimaging in MND is the development of robust diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring applications to meet the practical demands of clinical decision-making and pharmacological trials. A paradigm shift from group-level analyses to individual-level data interpretation, accurate single-subject classification and disease-burden tracking is therefore urgently needed to distil raw spatially coded imaging data into practical biomarkers.","['Tan EL', 'Bede P', 'Pradat PF']",2023,36,4,Curr Opin Neurol,"Tan EL, et al.

METHODS: We performed a chart review of all patients attending the ALS/MND clinic at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa, during the period 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2020. Cross-sectional demographic and clinical data captured at the time of diagnosis was collected.
RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included in the study. Males constituted 66% (n = 47), with a male to female sex ratio of 2:1. The median age at onset of symptoms was 46 years (IQR 40-57) with a median disease duration at diagnosis (diagnostic delay) of 2 years (IQR 1-3). The onset was spinal in 76% and bulbar in 23%. The median ALSFRS-R score at time of presentation was 29 (IQR 23-38.5). The median ALSFRS-R slope (unit/month) was 0.80 (IQR 0.43-1.39). Sixty five patients (92%) were diagnosed with the classic ALS phenotype. Fourteen patients were known to be HIV positive, and of those, 12 were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). None of the patients had familial ALS.

37371398,Palliative and End-of-Life Care for People Living with Motor Neurone Disease: Ongoing Challenges and Necessity for Shifting Directions.,"Although the progressive clinical trajectory of motor neurone disease (MND) is widely understood, multiple challenges remain preventing optimal end-of-life care for this population with unique needs from the patient, carer and service provider perspectives. This paper reports on the experiences, gaps in service and unmet needs of MND patients and family carers and explores public health palliative care approaches that would facilitate coordinated and integrated care to respond to their changing needs. This is a qualitative study of responses to questions in an online consumer survey (353 respondents) in Western Australia (2020), focusing on a subset of 29 current and bereaved carers of people with MND who have used health services in the last five years. The analysis identified themes, highlighting the insufficient integration of services across health and social care; poor and unequal access to coordinated palliative care; significant gaps in the knowledge base of the workforce and a failure to meet the consumer expectations of person-centred care. For palliative care to be accessible to those living with MND and other under-served conditions, there needs to be a shift to more comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable options, such as the public health approach to palliative/end-of-life care that engages the assets of local communities in partnership with health services, one example being the ""Compassionate Communities Connectors"" model of care. Further considerations include advocacy for policy changes, fostering partnerships and developing indicators for evaluating the impact of the proposed models of care. The end result is not only better care but substantial savings for the health system.","['Velaga VC', 'Cook A', 'Auret K', 'Jenkins T', 'Thomas G', 'Aoun SM']",2023,13,6,Brain Sci,"Velaga VC, et al.

37360165,The herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate and the cyanotoxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine induce long-term motor disorders following postnatal exposure: the importance of prior asymptomatic maternal inflammatory sensitization.,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal maternal immune activation (MIA) and/or perinatal exposure to various xenobiotics have been identified as risk factors for neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological data suggest an association between early multi-exposures to various insults and neuropathologies. The ""multiple-hit hypothesis"" assumes that prenatal inflammation makes the brain more susceptible to subsequent exposure to several kinds of neurotoxins. To explore this hypothesis and its pathological consequences, a behavioral longitudinal procedure was performed after prenatal sensitization and postnatal exposure to low doses of pollutants.
METHODS: Maternal exposure to an acute immune challenge (first hit) was induced by an asymptomatic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dose (0.008 mg/kg) in mice. This sensitization was followed by exposing the offspring to environmental chemicals (second hit) postnatally, by the oral route. The chemicals used were low doses of the cyanotoxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA; 50 mg/kg), the herbicide glufosinate ammonium (GLA; 0.2 mg/kg) or the pesticide glyphosate (GLY; 5 mg/kg). After assessing maternal parameters, a longitudinal behavioral assessment was carried out on the offspring in order to evaluate motor and emotional abilities in adolescence and adulthood.
RESULTS: We showed that the low LPS immune challenge was an asymptomatic MIA. Even though a significant increase in systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines was detected in the dams, no maternal behavioral defects were observed. In addition, as shown by rotarod assays and open field tests, this prenatal LPS administration alone did not show any behavioral disruption in offspring. Interestingly, our data showed that offspring subjected to both MIA and post-natal BMAA or GLA exposure displayed motor and anxiety behavioral impairments during adolescence and adulthood. However, this synergistic effect was not observed in the GLY-exposed offspring.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrated that prenatal and asymptomatic immune sensitization represents a priming effect to subsequent exposure to low doses of pollutants. These double hits act in synergy to induce motor neuron disease-related phenotypes in offspring. Thus, our data strongly emphasize that multiple exposures for developmental neurotoxicity regulatory assessment must be considered. This work paves the way for future studies aiming at deciphering cellular pathways involved in these sensitization processes.","['Oummadi A', 'Menuet A', 'Méresse S', 'Laugeray A', 'Guillemin G', 'Mortaud S']",2023,17,,Front Neurosci,"Oummadi A, et al.

37357676,The need to consider 'temporality' in person-centred care of people with motor neurone disease.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The overall aim of this paper is to provide practical insight into the way that professionals caring for a person with motor neurone disease (MND) can recognise, respect and respond to that person's temporality; that is, the person that they have been, that they are now and that they will be in the future.
BACKGROUND: MND is an umbrella term for a group of four rare, devastating neurodegenerative terminal diseases of middle/later life. Previously, we have acknowledged the importance of different time periods in the trajectory of MND as an illness, for example, during the diagnosis stage through to end of life and decision-making at that time. Living with MND can cause anxiety at all stages of the disease trajectory especially as it can be difficult for people living with MND to communicate their desires and concerns to professionals and carers. It is important that professionals continue to provide holistic care throughout the illness trajectory and the aim of this paper is to explore past research about caring for someone with MND in relation to the concept of person-centred care.
METHOD: The paper is based on the concatenated exploration of the findings of a hermeneutic phenomenological project. Thus, this discursive paper links elements/studies which have been published previously to develop a model of person-centred care for people with MND which recognises and respects their temporality.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest MND has a significant impact on a person's lifeworld. The proposed person-centred care model focuses on understanding (interpreting) a person in a wider temporal frame and beyond the context of their illness. The expected collaborative outcomes are that: a person is acknowledged as more than a 'patient with MND' and that a professional is providing person-centred care based on individuality of the person, through a temporal lens. This requires a collaborative approach between the person, others and professionals. Such person-centred care, focused on individuality, may prevent a person experiencing life in crisis and suffering towards the end of life.","['Harris DA', 'Jack K', 'Wibberley C']",2023,29,5,J Eval Clin Pract,"Harris DA, et al.

37356024,Economic evaluation of Motor Neuron Diseases: a nationwide cross-sectional analysis in Germany.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Motor Neuron Diseases (MND) are rare diseases but have a high impact on affected individuals and society. This study aims to perform an economic evaluation of MND in Germany.
METHODS: Primary patient-reported data were collected including individual impairment, the use of medical and non-medical resources, and self-rated Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Annual socio-economic costs per year as well as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were calculated.
RESULTS: 404 patients with a diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) or Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) were enrolled. Total annual costs per patient were estimated at 83,060€ in ALS, 206,856€ in SMA and 27,074€ in HSP. The main cost drivers were informal care (all MND) and disease-modifying treatments (SMA). Self-reported HRQoL was best in patients with HSP (mean EuroQoL Five Dimension Five Level (EQ-5D-5L) index value 0.67) and lowest in SMA patients (mean EQ-5D-5L index value 0.39). QALYs for patients with ALS were estimated to be 1.89 QALYs, 23.08 for patients with HSP and 14.97 for patients with SMA, respectively. Cost-utilities were estimated as follows: 138,960€/QALY for ALS, 525,033€/QALY for SMA, and 49,573€/QALY for HSP. The main predictors of the high cost of illness and low HRQoL were disease progression and loss of individual autonomy.
CONCLUSION: As loss of individual autonomy was the main cost predictor, therapeutic and supportive measures to maintain this autonomy may contribute to reducing high personal burden and also long-term costs, e.g., care dependency and absenteeism from work.","['Heinrich F', 'Cordts I', 'Günther R', 'Stolte B', 'Zeller D', 'Schröter C', 'Weyen U', 'Regensburger M', 'Wolf J', 'Schneider I', 'Hermann A', 'Metelmann M', 'Kohl Z', 'Linker RA', 'Koch JC', 'Radelfahr F', 'Schönfelder E', 'Gardt P', 'Mohajer-Peseschkian T', 'Osmanovic A', 'Klopstock T', 'Dorst J', 'Ludolph AC', 'Schöffski O', 'Boentert M', 'Hagenacker T', 'Deschauer M', 'Lingor P', 'Petri S', 'Schreiber-Katz O']",2023,270,10,J Neurol,"Heinrich F, et al.

37354059,Diagnostic accuracy of nerve excitability and compound muscle action potential scan derived biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The lack of reliable early biomarkers still causes substantial diagnostic delays in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a novel electrophysiological protocol in patients with suspected motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: Consecutive patients with suspected MND were prospectively recruited at our tertiary referral centre for MND in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Procedures were performed in accordance with the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy. In addition to the standard diagnostic workup, an electrophysiological protocol of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scans and nerve excitability tests was performed on patients' thenar muscles. The combined diagnostic yield of nerve excitability and CMAP scan based motor unit number estimation was compared to the Awaji and Gold Coast criteria and their added value was determined.
RESULTS: In all, 153 ALS or progressive muscular atrophy patients, 63 disease controls and 43 healthy controls were included. Our electrophysiological protocol had high diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.80-0.90), even in muscles with undetectable axon loss (AUC 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.85) and in bulbar-onset patients (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.95). Twenty-four of 33 (73%) ALS patients who could not be diagnosed during the same visit were correctly identified, as well as 8/13 (62%) ALS patients not meeting the Gold Coast criteria and 49/59 (83%) ALS patients not meeting the Awaji criteria during this first visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Our practical and non-invasive electrophysiological protocol may improve early diagnosis in clinically challenging patients with suspected ALS. Routine incorporation may boost early diagnosis, enhance patient selection and generate baseline measures for clinical trials.","['Stikvoort García DJL', 'Sleutjes BTHM', 'van Schelven LJ', 'Goedee HS', 'van den Berg LH']",2023,30,10,Eur J Neurol,"Stikvoort García DJL, et al.

37296656,Altered Metabolism in Motor Neuron Diseases: Mechanism and Potential Therapeutic Target.,"Motor Neuron Diseases (MND) are neurological disorders characterized by a loss of varying motor neurons resulting in decreased physical capabilities. Current research is focused on hindering disease progression by determining causes of motor neuron death. Metabolic malfunction has been proposed as a promising topic when targeting motor neuron loss. Alterations in metabolism have also been noted at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and skeletal muscle tissue, emphasizing the importance of a cohesive system. Finding metabolism changes consistent throughout both neurons and skeletal muscle tissue could pose as a target for therapeutic intervention. This review will focus on metabolic deficits reported in MNDs and propose potential therapeutic targets for future intervention.","['Barone C', 'Qi X']",2023,12,11,Cells,Barone C and Qi X.

37296644,Current State and Future Directions in the Therapy of ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons, with death resulting mainly from respiratory failure three to five years after symptom onset. As the exact underlying causative pathological pathway is unclear and potentially diverse, finding a suitable therapy to slow down or possibly stop disease progression remains challenging. Varying by country Riluzole, Edaravone, and Sodium phenylbutyrate/Taurursodiol are the only drugs currently approved in ALS treatment for their moderate effect on disease progression. Even though curative treatment options, able to prevent or stop disease progression, are still unknown, recent breakthroughs, especially in the field of targeting genetic disease forms, raise hope for improved care and therapy for ALS patients. In this review, we aim to summarize the current state of ALS therapy, including medication as well as supportive therapy, and discuss the ongoing developments and prospects in the field. Furthermore, we highlight the rationale behind the intense research on biomarkers and genetic testing as a feasible way to improve the classification of ALS patients towards personalized medicine.","['Tzeplaeff L', 'Wilfling S', 'Requardt MV', 'Herdick M']",2023,12,11,Cells,"Tzeplaeff L, et al.

37257710,Efficacy of mecasin for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A phase IIa multicenter randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive paralysis of voluntary muscles. Mecasin, the extract of modified jakyakgamchobuja-tang-a herbal preparation comprising of Radix Paeoniae Alba, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata, Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, Rhizoma Gastrodiae, Radix Polygalae, Curcuma Root, Fructus Chaenomelis, and Rhizoma Atractylodis Japonicae-shows neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects and alleviates the symptoms in patients with ALS.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mecasin in these patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive mecasin 1.6 g daily, mecasin 2.4 g daily, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the Korean version of ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (K-ALSFRS-R) score. The secondary endpoints were muscular atrophy measurements, pulmonary function test results, creatine kinase levels, body weight, safety, and scores of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength; Visual Analog Scale for pain (VAS pain); Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; and Fatigue Severity Scale.
RESULTS: Among the 30 patients randomized, 24 completed the follow-up. Significant between-group differences were detected in the primary endpoint using the omnibus F-test. The changes in the K-ALSFRS-R score between 12 weeks and baseline were -0·25, -1·32, and -2·78 in the mecasin 1.6 g, mecasin 2.4 g, and placebo groups, respectively. The difference in the K-ALSFRS-R score between the mecasin 1.6 g and placebo groups was 2·53 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0·61-4·45), and that between the 2.4 g and placebo groups was 1·46 points (95% CI: 0·48-3·40). However, no significant differences were detected in the secondary endpoints (MRC: dyspnea, p = 0·139; VAS pain, p = 0·916; forced vital capacity, p = 0·373). The incidence of adverse events was similar and low in all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Mecasin may retard symptomatic progression without major adverse effects. A phase IIb study to evaluate its long-term effects in ALS is ongoing.","['Kim S', 'Yang M', 'Ku B', 'Cha E', 'Seo W', 'Son I', 'Kang H', 'Kim D', 'Song B', 'Yang CS', 'Kim S']",2023,315,,J Ethnopharmacol,"Kim S, et al.

37248728,Needs of persons living with ALS at home and their family caregivers: A scoping review.,"INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Most persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) live at home with support of family caregivers, with escalating complexity of care over the trajectory of the disease requiring resources and support to mitigate negative physical, social, and emotional outcomes.
METHODS: This scoping review identifies the home health/home care needs of persons with ALS and their caregivers as a basis for creating a home health medical standard. We used the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) to examine studies describing home care needs published between 2011 and 2021.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 481 articles, of which 44 were included with a total of 3592 (9-273) participants. Most studies used a cross-sectional design and 20 (45%) were rated as high quality. We grouped the needs identified as emotional/psychological, assistive devices and technology, information and education, and human resources and professional services. Most studies demonstrated persistent unmet needs and that available interventions were helpful while needs generally were not met proactively, despite the predictable trajectory.
DISCUSSION: This review describes biopsychosocial and equipment interventions over the trajectory of ALS with implications for anticipatory planning by clinicians, as well as policy for coverage of necessary services and supports. Interdisciplinary expert teams could develop consensus around needs across the trajectory and recommended services and supports. To make knowledge more accessible, encourage availability of services, and clarify the need for coverage of services, we aim to develop an expert consensus-based ALS home health medical standard guidance document in collaboration with the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine.","['Young HM', 'Kilaberia TR', 'Whitney R', 'Link BM', 'Bell JF', 'Tonkikh O', 'Famula J', 'Oskarsson B']",2023,68,3,Muscle Nerve,"Young HM, et al.

37240881,"Hiccups, Hypersalivation, Hallucinations in Parkinson's Disease: New Insights, Mechanisms, Pathophysiology, and Management.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurological disorder and the second most common neurodegenerative condition. We report three common but overlooked symptoms in PD-hiccups, hypersalivation, and hallucinations-in terms of their prevalence, pathophysiology, and up-to-date evidence-based treatment strategies. Whilst all these three symptoms do occur in many other neurological and non-neurological conditions, early recognition and treatment are paramount. Whilst hiccups affect 3% of healthy people, their rate of occurrence is higher (20%) in patients with PD. Hypersalivation (Sialorrhea) is another common neurological manifestation of many neurological and other neurodegenerative conditions such as motor neuron disease (MND), with a median prevalence rate of 56% (range: 32-74%). A 42% prevalence of sialorrhea is also reported in sub-optimally treated patients with PD. Hallucinations, especially visual hallucinations, are commonly reported, with a prevalence of 32-63% in PD, and a 55-78% prevalence is noted in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), followed by tactile hallucinations, which are indicated by a sensation of crawling bugs or imaginary creatures across the skin surface. Whilst mainstay and primary management strategies for all these three symptoms are carried out through history taking, it is also essential to identify and treat possible potential triggers such as infection, minimise or avoid causative (such as drug-induced) factors, and especially carry out patient education before considering more definitive treatment strategies, such as botulinum toxin therapies for hypersalivation, to improve the quality of life of patients.

37205225,Neuroimaging findings in preclinical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis models-How well do they mimic the clinical phenotype? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Animal models for motor neuron diseases (MND) such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are commonly used in preclinical research. However, it is insufficiently understood how much findings from these model systems can be translated to humans. Thus, we aimed at systematically assessing the translational value of MND animal models to probe their external validity with regards to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features.
METHODS: In a comprehensive literature search in PubMed and Embase, we retrieved 201 unique publications of which 34 were deemed eligible for qualitative synthesis including risk of bias assessment.
RESULTS: ALS animal models can indeed present with human ALS neuroimaging features: Similar to the human paradigm, (regional) brain and spinal cord atrophy as well as signal changes in motor systems are commonly observed in ALS animal models. Blood-brain barrier breakdown seems to be more specific to ALS models, at least in the imaging domain. It is noteworthy that the G93A-SOD1 model, mimicking a rare clinical genotype, was the most frequently used ALS proxy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review provides high-grade evidence that preclinical ALS models indeed show imaging features highly reminiscent of human ALS assigning them a high external validity in this domain. This opposes the high attrition of drugs during bench-to-bedside translation and thus raises concerns that phenotypic reproducibility does not necessarily render an animal model appropriate for drug development. These findings emphasize a careful application of these model systems for ALS therapy development thereby benefiting refinement of animal experiments.

37166702,Targeting Sigma Receptors for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"The sigma-1 receptor is a 223 amino acid-long protein with a recently identified structure. The sigma-2 receptor is a genetically unrelated protein with a similarly shaped binding pocket and acts to influence cellular activities similar to the sigma-1 receptor. Both proteins are highly expressed in neuronal tissues. As such, they have become targets for treating neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Rett syndrome (RS), developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE), and motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS). In recent years, there have been many pre-clinical and clinical studies of sigma receptor (1 and 2) ligands for treating neurological disease. Drugs such as blarcamesine, dextromethorphan and pridopidine, which have sigma-1 receptor activity as part of their pharmacological profile, are effective in treating multiple aspects of several neurological diseases. Furthermore, several sigma-2 receptor ligands are under investigation, including CT1812, rivastigmine and SAS0132. This review aims to provide a current and up-to-date analysis of the current clinical and pre-clinical data of drugs with sigma receptor activities for treating neurological disease.","['Malar DS', 'Thitilertdecha P', 'Ruckvongacheep KS', 'Brimson S', 'Tencomnao T', 'Brimson JM']",2023,37,5,CNS Drugs,"Malar DS, et al.

37104886,Characteristic and management motor neuron disease in the largest tertiary hospital in the Philippines: A one-year period cross sectional analytic study.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND) is largely understudied in many underdeveloped and developing countries, including the Philippines. The practice and management of MND is generally insufficient, and thus, the quality of life of these patients are consequently compromised.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the clinical profile and describe the management of MND patients seen in the largest tertiary hospital in the Philippines for one year.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of MND patients diagnosed clinically and via electromyogram-nerve conduction study (EMG NCS) in the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) from January to December 2022. Clinical characteristics, diagnostics and management information were obtained and summarized.
RESULTS: The incidence of MND in our neurophysiology unit was 4.3% (28/648), with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) being the most common variant (67.9%, n = 19). Male to Female ratio was 1:1, with the median age of onset of 55 (36-72) years old and median onset duration to diagnosis of 1.5 (0.25-8) years. Limb onset was more prevalent (82.14%, n = 23) with upper limbs initially involved (79.1%, n = 18). Split hand syndrome was found in almost half (53.6%) of the patients. The median ALS functional rating score-revised (ALSFRS-R) and medical research council (MRC) scores were 34 (8-47) and 42(16-60) respectively while the median King's clinical stage was 3 (1-4). Only half of the patients were able to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and only one had neuromuscular ultrasound. Only one of the 28 patients was able to take riluzole, and only one was on oxygen support. None had gastrostomy and none used non-invasive ventilation.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the management of MND in the Philippines is largely inadequate and further improvement in the health care system in handling rare neurologic cases must be implemented to enhance their quality of life.","['Prado MB', 'Hamoy-Jimenez G', 'Adiao KJ']",2023,112,,J Clin Neurosci,"Prado MB, et al.

37091527,Experience with telemedicine in neuromuscular clinic during COVID-19 pandemic.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth for the care of neuromuscular patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Neuromuscular patients or their caregivers, as well as health care providers (HCPs), who completed a televisit during the pandemic received an online survey, assessing satisfaction with the visit, quality of care, and experience with the televisit interference.
RESULTS: Surveys from 46 neuromuscular patients (including 18 with motor neuron disease [MND])/caregivers and 7 HCPs were completed. Several aspects of televisits including good communication, adequate time to discuss concern, provision of equal care, and telemedicine interference were rated favorably among participants. Telehealth was strongly satisfactory in 30 (65.22%) and satisfactory in 15 (32.61%) neuromuscular patients/caregivers. In 18 MND patients, this was 10 (55.56%) and 7 (38.89%), respectively. Moreover, 24 (52.17%) neuromuscular patients/caregivers would strongly agree and 18 (39.13%) would agree to participate again in televisits. This was 10 (55.56%) and 4 (33.33%) for MND cases, respectively. Various medical issues were addressed during the televisits including medication management, ordering tests/referrals, discussion of goals of care, and research. The predictive stepwise logistic model found younger age as a predicting factor for higher satisfaction from, or participation again in, televisits in neuromuscular patients. Limb onset location was also a predicting factor for strong satisfaction from televisits in MND cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is feasible and highly effective at achieving personalized care that was rated satisfactory by the majority of neuromuscular patients/caregivers and HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Ghasemi M', 'Poulliot K', 'Daniello KM', 'Silver B']",2023,42,1,Acta Myol,"Ghasemi M, et al.

37075222,Regional spreading pattern is associated with clinical phenotype in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Increasing evidence shows that disease spreading in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) follows a preferential pattern with more frequent involvement of contiguous regions from the site of symptom onset. The aim of our study was to assess if: (i) the burden of upper (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement influences directionality of disease spreading; (ii) specific patterns of disease progression are associated with motor and neuropsychological features of different ALS subtypes (classic, bulbar, primary lateral sclerosis, UMN-predominant, progressive muscular atrophy, flail arm, flail leg); and (iii) specific clinical features may help identify ALS subtypes, which remain localized to the site of onset for a prolonged time (regionally entrenching ALS). A single-centre, retrospective cohort of 913 Italian ALS patients was evaluated to assess correlations between directionality of the disease process after symptom onset and motor/neuropsychological phenotype. All patients underwent an extensive evaluation including the following clinical scales: Penn Upper Motor Neuron Score (PUMNS), MRC Scale for Muscle Strength and the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS). The most frequent initial spreading pattern was that towards adjacent horizontal regions (77.3%), which occurred preferentially in patients with lower MRC scores (P = 0.038), while vertical diffusion (21.1%) was associated with higher PUMNS (P < 0.001) and with reduced survival (P < 0.001). Non-contiguous disease spreading was associated with more severe UMN impairment (P = 0.003), while contiguous disease pattern with lower MRC scores. Furthermore, non-contiguous disease spreading was associated with more severe cognitive impairment in both executive and visuospatial ECAS domains. Individuals with regionally entrenching ALS were more frequently female (45.6% versus 36.9%; P = 0.028) and had higher frequencies of symmetric disease onset (40.3% versus 19.7%; P < 0.001) and bulbar phenotype (38.5% versus 16.4%; P < 0.001). Our study suggests that motor phenotypes characterized by a predominant UMN involvement are associated with a vertical pattern of disease progression reflecting ipsilateral spreading within the motor cortex, while those with predominant LMN involvement display more frequently a horizontal spreading from one side of the spinal cord to the other. These observations raise the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms underlying disease spreading in ALS pathology is represented by diffusion of toxic factors in the neuron microenvironment. Finally, it is possible that in our cohort, regionally entrenching ALS forms are mainly observed in patients with atypical bulbar phenotypes, characterized by a slowly progressive course and relatively benign prognosis.","['Maranzano A', 'Verde F', 'Colombo E', 'Poletti B', 'Doretti A', 'Bonetti R', 'Gagliardi D', 'Meneri M', 'Maderna L', 'Messina S', 'Corti S', 'Morelli C', 'Silani V', 'Ticozzi N']",2023,146,10,Brain,"Maranzano A, et al.

37016529,An Update on Parkinson's Disease and its Neurodegenerative Counterparts.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurodegenerative disorders are a group of diseases that cause nerve cell degeneration in the brain, resulting in a variety of symptoms and are not treatable with drugs. Parkinson's disease (PD), prion disease, motor neuron disease (MND), Huntington's disease (HD), spinal cerebral dyskinesia (SCA), spinal muscle atrophy (SMA), multiple system atrophy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) (ALS), pantothenate kinase-related neurodegeneration, and TDP-43 protein disorder are examples of neurodegenerative diseases. Dementia is caused by the loss of brain and spinal cord nerve cells in neurodegenerative diseases.
BACKGROUND: Even though environmental and genetic predispositions have also been involved in the process, redox metal abuse plays a crucial role in neurodegeneration since the preponderance of symptoms originates from abnormal metal metabolism.
METHOD: Hence, this review investigates several neurodegenerative diseases that may occur symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease to understand the differences and similarities between Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders based on reviewing previously published papers.
RESULTS: Based on the findings, the aggregation of alpha-synuclein occurs in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Other neurodegenerative diseases occur with different protein aggregation or mutations.
CONCLUSION: We can conclude that Parkinson's disease, Multiple system atrophy, and Dementia with Lewy bodies are closely related. Therefore, researchers must distinguish among the three diseases to avoid misdiagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy and Dementia with Lewy bodies with Parkinson's disease symptoms.","['Adam H', 'Gopinath SCB', 'Md Arshad MK', 'Tijjani A', 'Subramaniam S', 'Hashim U']",2023,,,Curr Med Chem,"Adam H, et al.

37009451,Phenotypic correlates of serum neurofilament light chain levels in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between serum levels of the neuroaxonal degeneration biomarker neurofilament light chain (NFL) and phenotype in ALS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum NFL (sNFL) concentration was quantified in 209 ALS patients and 46 neurologically healthy controls (NHCs).
RESULTS: sNFL was clearly increased in ALS patients and discriminated them from NHCs with AUC = 0.9694. Among ALS patients, females had higher sNFL levels, especially in case of bulbar onset. sNFL was more increased in phenotypes with both upper (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs, and particularly in those with UMN predominance, compared to LMN forms. At the same time, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) had significantly lower levels compared to UMN-predominant ALS (AUC = 0.7667). sNFL correlated negatively with disease duration at sampling and ALSFRS-R score, positively with disease progression rate, differed among King's stages, and was negatively associated with survival. It also correlated with clinical/neurophysiological indices of UMN and LMN dysfunction (Penn UMN Score, LMN score, MRC composite score, active spinal denervation score). On the contrary, sNFL was not associated with cognitive deficits nor with respiratory parameters. Notably, we found a negative correlation between sNFL and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
INTERPRETATION: We confirm that ALS is characterized by increased sNFL levels, whose main determinant is the rate of degeneration of both UMNs and LMNs. sNFL is a biomarker of only motor, not of extra-motor, disease. The negative correlation with kidney function might reflect varying renal clearance of the molecule and deserves further investigation before introducing sNFL measurement as routine test in clinical care of ALS patients.","['Verde F', 'Milone I', 'Colombo E', 'Maranzano A', 'Solca F', 'Torre S', 'Doretti A', 'Gentile F', 'Manini A', 'Bonetti R', 'Peverelli S', 'Messina S', 'Maderna L', 'Morelli C', 'Poletti B', 'Ratti A', 'Silani V', 'Ticozzi N']",2023,15,,Front Aging Neurosci,"Verde F, et al.

37009026,Delivery of noninvasive ventilation to people living with motor neuron disease in the UK.,"OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) improves survival and quality of life in motor neuron disease (MND), but many patients fail to receive effective ventilation. This study aimed to map the respiratory clinical care for MND patients at a service and individual healthcare professional (HCP) level to understand where attention may be needed to ensure all patients receive optimal care.
METHODS: Two online surveys of HCPs working with MND patients in the UK were conducted. Survey 1 targeted HCPs providing specialist MND care. Survey 2 targeted HCPs working in respiratory/ventilation services and community teams. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
RESULTS: Responses from 55 HCPs providing specialist MND care who worked at 21 MND care centres and networks and 13 Scotland Health Boards were analysed from Survey 1. Responses from 85 HCPs from respiratory/ventilation services and 73 HCPs from community teams, representing 97 services, were analysed from Survey 2. Significant differences in practice were identified at each stage of the respiratory care pathway as well as evidence of the need for improvement. This included when patients were referred to respiratory services, the time taken waiting to commence NIV, the availability of sufficient NIV equipment and provision of services, particularly out of hours.
CONCLUSION: We have highlighted significant disparity in MND respiratory care practices. Increased awareness of the factors that influence NIV success and the performance of individuals and services is important for optimal practice.","['Musson LS', 'Baxter SK', 'Norman P', ""O'Brien D"", 'Elliott M', 'Bianchi S', 'Kaltsakas G', 'McDermott CJ', 'Stavroulakis T', 'Hobson EV']",2023,9,2,ERJ Open Res,"Musson LS, et al.

Six electronic databases were searched and two quantitative and eight qualitative studies were identified. Five overarching themes were generated through thematic synthesis. The findings suggest that there are factors that may affect different grieving processes. It might be particularly important to target some factors prior and after the death of the person living with MND such as the knowledge about the progression of the disease, changes in relationships, anxiety and depressive symptoms of carers, and planning for death of the care recipient. Factors that may affect all three grieving processes were also identified such as negative experiences of caregiving, experiences of losses, end of life and psychological support, and emotional avoidance coping.","['Trucco AP', 'Backhouse T', 'Mioshi E', 'Kishita N']",2023,,,Death Stud,"Trucco AP, et al.

METHOD: 45 participants (19 diagnosed with motor neuron diseases [MNDs] and 26 poststroke) performed two nonspeech tasks (mouth opening and lip spreading) and one speech task (repetition of a sentence ""Buy Bobby a Puppy"") while being video-recorded in a standardized lab setting. The color video recordings of participants were assessed by an expert clinician-a speech language pathologist-on the severity of three orofacial measures: symmetry, range of motion (ROM), and speed. Clinically interpretable 3D kinematic features, linked to symmetry, ROM, and speed, were automatically extracted from video recordings, using a deep facial landmark detection and tracking algorithm for each of the three tasks. Spearman correlations were used to identify features that were significantly correlated (
RESULTS: Several kinematic features extracted from 3D video recordings were associated with their corresponding perceptual clinical scores, indicating clinical validity of these automatically derived measures. Different patterns of significant features were observed between MND and poststroke groups; these differences were aligned with clinical expectations in both cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that kinematic features extracted automatically from simple clinical tasks can capture characteristics used by clinicians during assessments. These findings support the clinical validity of video-based automatic extraction of kinematic features.","['Jafari D', 'Simmatis L', 'Guarin D', 'Bouvier L', 'Taati B', 'Yunusova Y']",2023,66,8S,J Speech Lang Hear Res,"Jafari D, et al. 3D Video Tracking Technology in the Assessment of Orofacial Impairments in Neurological Disease: Clinical Validation. 3D Video Tracking Technology in the Assessment of Orofacial Impairments in Neurological Disease: Clinical Validation. 2023; 66:3151-3165. doi: 10.1044/2023_JSLHR-22-00321",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36989177/

36918362,Physical activity as an exogenous risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a review of the evidence.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. The only established epidemiological risk factors for ALS are male sex and increasing age. The role of physical activity has been debated as an environmental risk factor. Over the last decade multiple studies have attempted to delineate the architecture of ALS. These have not yet established definite risk factors, often due to low-powered studies, lack of focus on at-risk genotypes and sub-optimal methodology. We have conducted a review of all the studies published between 2009 and December 2021. The free text search terms were [(motor neuron disease) OR (MND) OR (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) OR (ALS)] AND [(Exercise) or (Physical Activity) or (PA) or (sport)]. We identified common themes, for example soccer, head injury and the physiological mechanisms that differ in ALS patients. We have analysed the relevant, available studies (n = 93), highlighting the underlying reasons for any reported discrepancies. Overall, we have found that the more highly powered studies using validated exposure methodologies, linked strenuous, anaerobic physical activity as a risk factor for ALS. Future large-scale studies focusing on specific at-risk genotypes and physical activity should be conducted to confirm this finding. This will strengthen the evidence already surrounding strenuous physical activity as an environmental risk factor for ALS and allow advice to be given to at-risk family members. Increasing our understanding of the genetic-environmental interactions in the pathophysiology of ALS will allow for the possibility of developing preventative therapeutic approaches.","['Chapman L', 'Cooper-Knock J', 'Shaw PJ']",2023,146,5,Brain,"Chapman L, et al.

This exacerbates problems with everyday activities (eating, talking, breathing, etc). Neck collars are often used to support head drop; however, these are typically designed for prehospitalization settings to manage and brace the cervical region of the spine. As a result, it has been recorded that people living with MND often reject these collars for a variety of reasons but most notably because they are too restricting. The current standardized outcome measures (most notably restricting cervical range of motion) used for neck collars are summarized herein along with whether they are suitable for a bespoke neck collar specifically designed for people living with MND.","['Spears SDJ', 'Abdulle YF', 'Korovilas D', 'Torii R', 'Kalaskar DM', 'Sharma N']",2023,12,,Interact J Med Res,"Spears SDJ, et al.

36901711,Inter-Regional Proteomic Profiling of the Human Brain Using an Optimized Protein Extraction Method from Formalin-Fixed Tissue to Identify Signaling Pathways.,"Proteomics offers vast potential for studying the molecular regulation of the human brain. Formalin fixation is a common method for preserving human tissue; however, it presents challenges for proteomic analysis. In this study, we compared the efficiency of two different protein-extraction buffers on three post-mortem, formalin-fixed human brains. Equal amounts of extracted proteins were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS. Protein, peptide sequence, and peptide group identifications; protein abundance; and gene ontology pathways were analyzed. Protein extraction was superior using lysis buffer containing tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium deoxycholate, and Triton X-100 (TrisHCl, SDS, SDC, Triton X-100), which was then used for inter-regional analysis. Pre-frontal, motor, temporal, and occipital cortex tissues were analyzed by label free quantification (LFQ) proteomics, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and PANTHERdb. Inter-regional analysis revealed differential enrichment of proteins. We found similarly activated cellular signaling pathways in different brain regions, suggesting commonalities in the molecular regulation of neuroanatomically-linked brain functions. Overall, we developed an optimized, robust, and efficient method for protein extraction from formalin-fixed human brain tissue for in-depth LFQ proteomics. We also demonstrate herein that this method is suitable for rapid and routine analysis to uncover molecular signaling pathways in the human brain.","['Davidson JM', 'Rayner SL', 'Liu S', 'Cheng F', 'Di Ieva A', 'Chung RS', 'Lee A']",2023,24,5,Int J Mol Sci,"Davidson JM, et al.

36899872,Current State and Future Directions in the Diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons, resulting in progressive weakness of all voluntary muscles and eventual respiratory failure. Non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive and behavioral changes, frequently occur over the course of the disease. Considering its poor prognosis with a median survival time of 2 to 4 years and limited causal treatment options, an early diagnosis of ALS plays an essential role. In the past, diagnosis has primarily been determined by clinical findings supported by electrophysiological and laboratory measurements. To increase diagnostic accuracy, reduce diagnostic delay, optimize stratification in clinical trials and provide quantitative monitoring of disease progression and treatment responsivity, research on disease-specific and feasible fluid biomarkers, such as neurofilaments, has been intensely pursued. Advances in imaging techniques have additionally yielded diagnostic benefits. Growing perception and greater availability of genetic testing facilitate early identification of pathogenic ALS-related gene mutations, predictive testing and access to novel therapeutic agents in clinical trials addressing disease-modified therapies before the advent of the first clinical symptoms. Lately, personalized survival prediction models have been proposed to offer a more detailed disclosure of the prognosis for the patient. In this review, the established procedures and future directions in the diagnostics of ALS are summarized to serve as a practical guideline and to improve the diagnostic pathway of this burdensome disease.","['Vidovic M', 'Müschen LH', 'Brakemeier S', 'Machetanz G', 'Naumann M', 'Castro-Gomez S']",2023,12,5,Cells,"Vidovic M, et al.

36875699,Potential roles of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major organelle involved in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. ER stress results from structural and functional dysfunction of the organelle, along with the accumulation of misfolded proteins and changes in calcium homeostasis, it leads to ER stress response pathway such as unfolded protein response (UPR). Neurons are particularly sensitive to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Thus, the ER stress is involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease and motor neuron disease (MND). Recently, the complex involvement of ER stress pathways has been demonstrated in experimental models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/MND using pharmacological and genetic manipulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive response to ER stress. Here, we aim to provide recent evidence demonstrating that the ER stress pathway is an essential pathological mechanism of ALS. In addition, we also provide therapeutic strategies that can help treat diseases by targeting the ER stress pathway.","['Jeon YM', 'Kwon Y', 'Lee S', 'Kim HJ']",2023,15,,Front Aging Neurosci,"Jeon YM, et al.

36872786,Oculomotor Dysfunction in Motor Neuron Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Though eye movements are relatively spared in motor neuron disease (MND), recent literature suggests patients may exhibit oculomotor dysfunction (OD). Frontal lobe involvement has been postulated based on oculomotor pathway anatomy and clinical overlap of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with frontotemporal dementia. We examined oculomotor characteristics in patients with MND presenting to an ALS Center, hypothesizing that patients with prominent upper motor neuron involvement or pseudobulbar affect (PBA) may demonstrate greater OD.
METHODS: This was a single-center prospective observational study. Patients with diagnosis of MND were examined at bedside. Center for Neurologic Study-Liability Scale (CNS-LS) was administered to screen for pseudobulbar affect. Primary outcome was OD and the secondary outcome was the association between presence of OD in patients with MND experiencing symptoms of PBA or upper motor neuron dysfunction. Wilcoxon rank-sum scores and Fisher's exact tests were used to perform statistical analyses.
RESULTS: 53 patients with MND underwent the clinical ophthalmic evaluation. On bedside examination, 34 patients (64.2%) presented with OD. There were no significant associations between locations of MND at presentation and the presence or type of OD. OD was associated with increased disease severity as measured by reduced FVC (p = 0.02). There was no significant association between OD and CNS-LS (p = 0.2).
DISCUSSION: Though our study did not find a significant association between OD and upper versus lower MND at presentation, OD may be useful as an additional clinical marker for advanced disease.","['Youn CE', 'Lu C', 'Cauchi J', 'MacGowan D', 'Morgenstern R', 'Scelsa S']",2023,10,3,J Neuromuscul Dis,"Youn CE, et al.

Abnormal blink reflex was presented in 64 (90.1%) patients. CSF tests showed elevated protein level in 5 (7.0%) patients. Six (8.5%) patients had MND-related gene mutation. Five (7.0%) patients showed transient responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapy, then deteriorated relentlessly. Fourteen (19.7%) patients died, with an average survival time of around 4 years. Among them, five patients died of respiratory insufficiency.
CONCLUSION: The age of onset, progress of disease course, and prognosis of FOSMN syndrome could be varied significantly. The prerequisites of diagnosis were progressive and asymmetric lower motor neuron dysfunction, with sensory dysfunction which usually showed in face at the onset. Immunosuppressive therapy could be tried in some patients with suspected inflammatory clues. In general, FOSMN syndrome tended to be motor neuron disease with sensory involvement.","['Hu N', 'Zhang L', 'Yang X', 'Fu H', 'Cui L', 'Liu M']",2023,44,6,Neurol Sci,"Hu N, et al.

36861579,Post-Vaccination/Post-COVID Immune-Mediated Demyelination of the Brain and Spinal Cord: A Novel Neuroimaging Finding.,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which not only produces respiratory symptoms but is known to involve almost every system, and its neuroinvasive properties have been well demonstrated throughout the pandemic. Also, to combat the pandemic, there was rapid development and induction of various vaccination drives, following which many adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) have been reported, which include neurological complications as well.
METHOD: We present a series of three cases, post vaccination, with and without a history of COVID illness that showed remarkably similar findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULT: A 38-year-old male presented with complaints of weakness of the bilateral lower limbs with sensory loss and bladder disturbance a day after receiving his first dose of ChadOx1 nCoV-19 (COVISHIELD) vaccine. A 50-year-old male with hypothyroidism characterized by autoimmune thyroiditis and impaired glucose tolerance experienced difficulty in walking 11.5 weeks after being administered with COVID vaccine (COVAXIN). A 38-year-old male presented with subacute onset progressive symmetric quadriparesis 2 months after their first dose of a COVID vaccine. The patient also had sensory ataxia, and his vibration sensation was impaired below C7. All three patients had typical pattern of involvement of the brain and spine on MRI with signal changes in bilateral corticospinal tracts, trigeminal tracts in the brain, and both lateral and posterior columns in the spine.
CONCLUSION: This pattern of brain and spine involvement on MRI is a novel finding and is likely a result of post-vaccination/post-COVID immune-mediated demyelination.","['Mahajan A', 'Nayak MK', 'Gaikwad SB', 'Sharma K', 'Padma Srivastava MV', 'Anand P', 'Oinam R', 'Mishra BM']",2023,71,1,Neurol India,"Mahajan A, et al.

36861178,Multisystem proteinopathies (MSPs) and MSP-like disorders: Clinical-pathological-molecular spectrum.,"OBJECTIVES: Mutations in VCP, HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPA1, and SQSTM1, encoding RNA-binding proteins or proteins in quality-control pathways, cause multisystem proteinopathies (MSP). They share pathological findings of protein aggregation and clinical combinations of inclusion body myopathy (IBM), neurodegeneration [motor neuron disorder (MND)/frontotemporal dementia (FTD)], and Paget disease of bone (PDB). Subsequently, additional genes were linked to similar but not full clinical-pathological spectrum (MSP-like disorders). We aimed to define the phenotypic-genotypic spectrum of MSP and MSP-like disorders at our institution, including long-term follow-up features.
METHODS: We searched the Mayo Clinic database (January 2010-June 2022) to identify patients with mutations in MSP and MSP-like disorders causative genes. Medical records were reviewed.
RESULTS: Thirty-one individuals (27 families) had pathogenic mutations in: VCP (n = 17), SQSTM1 + TIA1 (n = 5), TIA1 (n = 5), MATR3, HNRNPA1, HSPB8, and TFG (n = 1, each). Myopathy occurred in all but 2 VCP-MSP patients with disease onset at age 52 (median). Weakness pattern was limb-girdle in 12/15 VCP-MSP and HSPB8 patient, and distal-predominant in other MSP and MSP-like disorders. Twenty/24 muscle biopsies showed rimmed vacuolar myopathy. MND and FTD occurred in 5 (4 VCP, 1 TFG) and 4 (3 VCP, 1 SQSTM1 + TIA1) patients, respectively. PDB manifested in 4 VCP-MSP. Diastolic dysfunction occurred in 2 VCP-MSP. After 11.5 years (median) from symptom onset, 15 patients ambulated without gait-aids; loss of ambulation (n = 5) and death (n = 3) were recorded only in VCP-MSP.
INTERPRETATION: VCP-MSP was the most common disorder; rimmed vacuolar myopathy was the most frequent manifestation; distal-predominant weakness occurred frequently in non-VCP-MSP; and cardiac involvement was observed only in VCP-MSP.","['Chompoopong P', 'Oskarsson B', 'Madigan NN', 'Mirman I', 'Martinez-Thompson JM', 'Liewluck T', 'Milone M']",2023,10,4,Ann Clin Transl Neurol,"Chompoopong P, et al.

36816411,How do people with MND and caregivers experience a digital mental health intervention? A qualitative study.,"OBJECTIVE: We urgently need to develop and evaluate more psychological interventions to support people with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) and caregivers. We used the person-based approach to develop a digital mental health intervention and conducted two studies to explore people's experiences of using it.
METHODS: In Study 1, we conducted think-aloud interviews with 9 people with MND and 8 caregivers, and used findings to refine the intervention. In Study 2, 18 people with MND and 9 caregivers used the intervention for 6 weeks after which in-depth interviews were conducted. Data from both studies were combined and analysed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: We developed 3 main themes around intervention acceptability, engagement, and usefulness. Participants highlighted the importance of accessibility and realistic presentation of information and support. Tailoring and timing intervention use to suit own needs, preferences, and disease stage was also important. Participants used the strategies presented to develop a positive outlook and regain some control. They also faced some challenges using these strategies in the context of dealing with progressive loss.
CONCLUSION: People with MND and caregivers can find digital mental health interventions useful. Intervention accessibility and flexibility are important for developing acceptable and engaging interventions for MND.","['Pinto C', 'Geraghty AWA', 'Pagnini F', 'Yardley L', 'Dennison L']",2023,14,,Front Psychiatry,"Pinto C, et al.

36812393,Methods for informing people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease of their diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), causes increasing physical impairment and disability. People with ALS/MND face huge physical challenges, and the diagnosis can be a source of great psychological distress for both people with ALS/MND and their carers. In such a context, how news of the diagnosis is broken is important. At present, there are no systematic reviews of methods for informing people with ALS/MND of their diagnosis.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects and effectiveness of different methods for informing people of a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND), including effects on the person's knowledge and understanding of their disease, its treatment, and care; and on coping and adjustment to the effects of ALS/MND, its treatment, and care.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers (February 2022). We contacted individuals or organisations to locate studies. We contacted study authors to obtain additional unpublished data.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of techniques for informing people with ALS/MND of their diagnosis. We planned to include adults (aged 17 years or over) with ALS/MND, according to the El Escorial criteria.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently reviewed the results of the search to identify RCTs, and three review authors identified non-randomised studies to include in the discussion section. We planned that two review authors would independently extract data, and three would assess the risk of bias in any included trials.
MAIN RESULTS: We did not identify any RCTs that met our inclusion criteria.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are no RCTs that evaluate different communication strategies for breaking the bad news for people diagnosed with ALS/MND. Focused research studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of different communication methods.","['Bongioanni P', 'Borasio GD', 'Oliver DJ', 'Romagnoli A', 'Kapitza KP', 'Sidle K', 'Tramonti F']",2023,2,2,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Bongioanni P, et al.

36805758,"Digital peer-to-peer support programme for informal caregivers of people living with motor neuron disease: study protocol for a multi-centre parallel group, single-blinded (outcome assessor) randomised controlled superiority trial.","BACKGROUND: Peer support is effective in improving psychological well-being of family caregivers of people with conditions such as dementia, cancer, and brain injury. However, there are limited data on effective psychological interventions for family caregivers of people living with motor neurone disease. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a virtual peer support programme for improving caregiver psychological wellbeing and caregiving related outcomes.
METHODS: We will conduct a multi-centre parallel group randomised controlled superiority trial. Using a multi-modal recruitment strategy, we will recruit informal caregivers from UK MND clinics, in-patient units, and hospices. We will randomise (1:1, stratified by gender) participants to either a 12-week virtual peer support programme or usual care comprising provision of online information resources publicly available via the MND Association website. Peer support programme elements will be delivered via a secure digital e-platform aTouchAway™ (Aetonix, Canada). Our target sample size is 160 (80 each arm). Our primary outcome is the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessed at 12 weeks (primary endpoint). Secondary outcomes that will also be assessed at 12 weeks include the Zarit Burden Interview, Pearlin Mastery Scale, Personal Gain Scale, Positive Affect Scale, and the Brief COPE. Outcome assessors will be blinded to allocation. Tertiary outcomes include perceived usability (1 item 9-point Likert scale) and acceptability (semi-structured qualitative interviews) of the peer support programme. Intervention fidelity measures will comprise frequency, type (text, audio, video), and duration (audio and video) of peer support contact downloaded from the aTouchAway AWS server. We will use a mixed-effects linear model to test the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear regression. We have ethical approval (21/NW/0269) from the North-West Research Ethics Committee, UK.
DISCUSSION: This single-blinded randomised controlled trial will determine the effect of a virtual peer support programme on caregiver psychological wellbeing and caregiver burden. This study will examine the impact of a virtual peer support intervention on quality-of-life measures in informal caregivers of individuals with MND living in the community.

36740646,Use of hip- versus wrist-based actigraphy for assessing functional decline and disease progression in patients with motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Actigraphy has been proposed as a measure for tracking functional decline and disease progression in patients with Motor Neuron Disease (MND). There is, however, little evidence to show that wrist-based actigraphy measures correlate with functional decline, and no consensus on how best to implement actigraphy. We report on the use of wrist actigraphy to show decreased activity in patients compared to controls, and compared the utility of wrist- and hip-based actigraphy for assessing functional decline in patients with MND.
METHODS: In this multi-cohort, multi-centre, natural history study, wrist- and hip-based actigraphy were assessed in 139 patients with MND (wrist, n = 97; hip, n = 42) and 56 non-neurological control participants (wrist, n = 56). For patients with MND, longitudinal measures were contrasted with clinical outcomes commonly used to define functional decline.
RESULTS: Patients with MND have reduced wrist-based actigraphy scores when compared to controls (median differences: prop. active = - 0.053 [- 0.075, - 0.026], variation axis 1 = - 0.073 [- 0.112, - 0.021]). When comparing wrist- and hip-based measures, hip-based accelerometery had stronger correlations with disease progression (prop. active: τ = 0.20 vs 0.12; variation axis 1: τ = 0.33 vs 0.23), whereas baseline wrist-based accelerometery was better related with future decline in fine-motor function (τ = 0.14-0.23 vs 0.06-0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Actigraphy outcomes measured from the wrist are more variable than from the hip and present differing sensitivity to specific functional outcomes. Outcomes and analysis should be carefully constructed to maximise benefit, should wrist-worn devices be used for at-home monitoring of disease progression in patients with MND.","['Holdom CJ', 'van Unnik JWJ', 'van Eijk RPA', 'van den Berg LH', 'Henderson RD', 'Ngo ST', 'Steyn FJ']",2023,270,5,J Neurol,"Holdom CJ, et al.

36725099,"Systematic, comprehensive, evidence-based approach to identify neuroprotective interventions for motor neuron disease: using systematic reviews to inform expert consensus.","OBJECTIVES: Motor neuron disease (MND) is an incurable progressive neurodegenerative disease with limited treatment options. There is a pressing need for innovation in identifying therapies to take to clinical trial. Here, we detail a systematic and structured evidence-based approach to inform consensus decision making to select the first two drugs for evaluation in Motor Neuron Disease-Systematic Multi-arm Adaptive Randomised Trial (MND-SMART: NCT04302870), an adaptive platform trial. We aim to identify and prioritise candidate drugs which have the best available evidence for efficacy, acceptable safety profiles and are feasible for evaluation within the trial protocol.
METHODS: We conducted a two-stage systematic review to identify potential neuroprotective interventions. First, we reviewed clinical studies in MND, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, identifying drugs described in at least one MND publication or publications in two or more other diseases. We scored and ranked drugs using a metric evaluating safety, efficacy, study size and study quality. In stage two, we reviewed efficacy of drugs in MND animal models, multicellular eukaryotic models and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) studies. An expert panel reviewed candidate drugs over two shortlisting rounds and a final selection round, considering the systematic review findings, late breaking evidence, mechanistic plausibility, safety, tolerability and feasibility of evaluation in MND-SMART.
RESULTS: From the clinical review, we identified 595 interventions. 66 drugs met our drug/disease logic. Of these, 22 drugs with supportive clinical and preclinical evidence were shortlisted at round 1. Seven drugs proceeded to round 2. The panel reached a consensus to evaluate memantine and trazodone as the first two arms of MND-SMART.
DISCUSSION: For future drug selection, we will incorporate automation tools, text-mining and machine learning techniques to the systematic reviews and consider data generated from other domains, including high-throughput phenotypic screening of human iPSCs.","['Wong C', 'Gregory JM', 'Liao J', 'Egan K', 'Vesterinen HM', 'Ahmad Khan A', 'Anwar M', 'Beagan C', 'Brown FS', 'Cafferkey J', 'Cardinali A', 'Chiam JY', 'Chiang C', 'Collins V', 'Dormido J', 'Elliott E', 'Foley P', 'Foo YC', 'Fulton-Humble L', 'Gane AB', 'Glasmacher SA', 'Heffernan Á', 'Jayaprakash K', 'Jayasuriya N', 'Kaddouri A', 'Kiernan J', 'Langlands G', 'Leighton D', 'Liu J', 'Lyon J', 'Mehta AR', 'Meng A', 'Nguyen V', 'Park NH', 'Quigley S', 'Rashid Y', 'Salzinger A', 'Shiell B', 'Singh A', 'Soane T', 'Thompson A', 'Tomala O', 'Waldron FM', 'Selvaraj BT', 'Chataway J', 'Swingler R', 'Connick P', 'Pal S', 'Chandran S', 'Macleod M']",2023,13,2,BMJ Open,"Wong C, et al.

36706102,When months matter; modelling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnostic pathway of Motor Neurone Disease (MND).,"BACKGROUND: A diagnosis of MND takes an average 10-16 months from symptom onset. Early diagnosis is important to access supportive measures to maximise quality of life. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in NHS pathways; the majority of GP appointments now occur online with subsequent delays in secondary care assessment. Given the rapid progression of MND, patients may be disproportionately affected resulting in late stage new presentations. We used Monte Carlo simulation to model the pre-COVID-19 diagnostic pathway and then introduced plausible COVID-19 delays.
METHODS: The diagnostic pathway was modelled using gamma distributions of time taken: 1) from symptom onset to GP presentation, 2) for specialist referral, and 3) for diagnosis reached after neurology appointment. We incorporated branches to simulate delays: when patients did not attend their GP and when the GP consultation did not result in referral. An emergency presentation was triggered when diagnostic pathway time was within 30 days of projected median survival. Total time-to-diagnosis was calculated over 100,000 iterations. The pre-COVID-19 model was estimated using published data and the Improving MND Care Survey 2019. We estimated COVID-19 delays using published statistics.
RESULTS: The pre-COVID model reproduced known features of the MND diagnostic pathway, with a median time to diagnosis of 399 days and predicting 5.2% of MND patients present as undiagnosed emergencies. COVID-19 resulted in diagnostic delays from 558 days when only primary care was 25% delayed, to 915 days when both primary and secondary care were 75%. The model predicted an increase in emergency presentations ranging from 15.4%-44.5%.
INTERPRETATIONS: The model suggests the COVID-19 pandemic will result in later-stage diagnoses and more emergency presentations of undiagnosed MND. Late-stage presentations may require rapid escalation to multidisciplinary care. Proactive recognition of acute and late-stage disease with altered service provision will optimise care for people with MND.","['Burchill E', 'Rawji V', 'Styles K', 'Rooney S', 'Stone P', 'Astin R', 'Sharma N']",2023,18,1,PLoS One,"Burchill E, et al.

36704819,Blood-CNS barrier dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Proposed mechanisms and clinical implications.,"There is strong evidence for blood-brain and blood-spinal cord barrier dysfunction at the early stages of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Since impairment of the blood-central nervous system barrier (BCNSB) occurs during the pre-symptomatic stages of ALS, the mechanisms underlying this pathology are likely also involved in the ALS disease process. In this review, we explore how drivers of ALS disease, particularly mitochondrial dysfunction, astrocyte pathology and neuroinflammation, may contribute to BCNSB impairment. Mitochondria are highly abundant in BCNSB tissue and mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS contributes to motor neuron death. Likewise, astrocytes adopt key physical, transport and metabolic functions at the barrier, many of which are impaired in ALS. Astrocytes also show raised expression of inflammatory markers in ALS and ablating ALS-causing transgenes in astrocytes slows disease progression. In addition, key drivers of neuroinflammation, including TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, matrix metalloproteinase activation and systemic inflammation, affect BCNSB integrity in ALS. Finally, we discuss the translational implications of BCNSB dysfunction in ALS, including the development of biomarkers for disease onset and progression, approaches aimed at restoring BCNSB integrity and ","['Steinruecke M', 'Lonergan RM', 'Selvaraj BT', 'Chandran S', 'Diaz-Castro B', 'Stavrou M']",2023,43,5,J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,"Steinruecke M, et al.

36647114,Statistical analysis plan for the motor neuron disease systematic multi-arm adaptive randomised trial (MND-SMART).,"BACKGROUND: MND-SMART is a platform, multi-arm, multi-stage, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial recruiting people with motor neuron disease. Initially, the treatments memantine and trazodone will each be compared against placebo, but other investigational treatments will be introduced into the trial later. The co-primary outcomes are the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALS-FRS-R) functional outcome, which is assessed longitudinally, and overall survival.
METHODS: Initially in MND-SMART, participants are randomised 1:1:1 via a minimisation algorithm to receive placebo or one of the two investigational treatments with up to 531 to be randomised in total. The comparisons between each research arm and placebo will be conducted in four stages, with the opportunity to cease further randomisations to poorly performing research arms at the end of stages 1 or 2. The final ALS-FRS-R analysis will be at the end of stage 3 and final survival analysis at the end of stage 4. The estimands for the co-primary outcomes are described in detail. The primary analysis of ALS-FRS-R at the end of stages 1 to 3 will involve fitting a normal linear mixed model to the data to calculate a mean difference in rate of ALS-FRS-R change between each research treatment and placebo. The pairwise type 1 error rate will be controlled, because each treatment comparison will generate its own distinct and separate interpretation. This publication is based on a formal statistical analysis plan document that was finalised and signed on 18 May 2022.
DISCUSSION: In developing the statistical analysis plan, we had to carefully consider several issues such as multiple testing, estimand specification, interim analyses, and statistical analysis of the repeated measurements of ALS-FRS-R. This analysis plan attempts to balance multiple factors, including minimisation of bias, maximising power and precision, and deriving clinically interpretable summaries of treatment effects.

RESULTS: Q-Alb did not correlate with age but was independently associated with sex, with male patients having higher levels than female ones; the site of onset was not independently associated with Q-Alb. Q-Alb was not associated with motor phenotype, cognitive/behavioural impairment, disease stage, progression rate, survival, or genetic mutations. Among measures of UMN and LMN dysfunction, Q-Alb only had a weak positive correlation with an electromyography-based index of active limb denervation.
CONCLUSION: Previous work has documented increased Q-Alb in ALS compared to unaffected individuals. This, together with the absence of associations with nearly all ALS phenotypic features in our cohort, suggests dysfunction of the blood-CSF barrier as a shared, phenotype-independent element in ALS pathophysiology. However, correlation with the active denervation index could point to barrier dysfunction as a local driver of LMN degeneration.","['Verde F', 'Ferrari I', 'Maranzano A', 'Ciusani E', 'Torre S', 'Milone I', 'Colombo E', 'Doretti A', 'Peverelli S', 'Ratti A', 'Maderna L', 'Poletti B', 'Messina S', 'Morelli C', 'Silani V', 'Ticozzi N']",2023,44,5,Neurol Sci,"Verde F, et al.

36627836,Protective Effects of Lovastatin in a Population-Based ALS Study and Mouse Model.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to use a novel combined pharmacoepidemiologic and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model approach to identify potential motor neuron protective medications.
METHODS: We constructed a large, population-based case-control study to investigate motor neuron disease (MND) among US Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 to 90 in 2009. We included 1,128 incident MND cases and 56,400 age, sex, race, and ethnicity matched controls. We calculated MND relative risk for >1,000 active ingredients represented in Part D (pharmacy) claims in 2006 to 2007 (>1 year before diagnosis/reference). We then applied a comprehensive screening approach to select medications for testing in SOD1
RESULTS: We observed previously established medical associations for MND and an inverse dose-response association between lovastatin and MND, with 28% reduced risk at 40 mg/day. In SOD1
INTERPRETATION: Lovastatin reduced the risk of ALS in humans, which was confirmed in an ALS mouse model by delayed symptom onset, prolonged survival, and preservation of motor neurons. Although further studies to understand the mechanism are required, lovastatin may represent a potential neuroprotective therapy for patients with ALS. These data demonstrate the utility of a combined pharmacoepidemiologic and mouse model approach.

36601159,A Case Report on a Young Male Taking Methylphenidate With Fasciculations and Dysphagia: Correlation or Causation?,"Concurrent fasciculations and oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) can be presenting signs of motor neuron disease (MND); however, there are other causes for OD (neoplasms, surgery, and gastroesophageal diseases, among others). Fasciculations (anxiety, benign, or iatrogenic) are an uncommon side effect (<1%) of methylphenidate. A 30-year-old male noticed fasciculations in both gastrocnemii, reporting gradual cranial progression, culminating in diffuse fasciculations with facial involvement. One month later, he reported OD for solids and occasional cough for liquids. He denied weakness, fatigue, or weight loss. He has no relevant personal history, apart from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosed a year before and since then medicated with methylphenidate 40 mg id. He had no abnormal findings on neurological examination. Electromyography (EMG) and sinus CT were normal. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy (EGD) showed reflux esophagitis grade C, which could explain OD, and he started esomeprazole 40 mg id. As there were no findings on EMG, an iatrogenic etiology for fasciculations was considered. He suspended methylphenidate for a month and, two months later, reported a substantial improvement in fasciculations and resolution of the OD with the introduction of esomeprazole. Two simultaneous symptoms do not mean they are related. In this specific case, OD was the first symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and fasciculations happened as a side effect of methylphenidate. This must be taken into consideration, as it can represent a confounding factor making the differential diagnosis more difficult. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published articles similar to this case report.","['Paiva A', 'Pascoal A', 'Lourenço C', 'Pires C', 'Lains J']",2022,14,12,Cureus,"Paiva A, et al.

36589292,Telomere length analysis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using large-scale whole genome sequence data.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to progressive weakness of voluntary muscles, with death following from neuromuscular respiratory failure, typically within 3 to 5 years. There is a strong genetic contribution to ALS risk. In 10% or more, a family history of ALS or frontotemporal dementia is obtained, and the Mendelian genes responsible for ALS in such families have now been identified in about 50% of cases. Only about 14% of apparently sporadic ALS is explained by known genetic variation, suggesting that other forms of genetic variation are important. Telomeres maintain DNA integrity during cellular replication, differ between sexes, and shorten naturally with age. Sex and age are risk factors for ALS and we therefore investigated telomere length in ALS.
METHODS: Samples were from Project MinE, an international ALS whole genome sequencing consortium that includes phenotype data. For validation we used donated brain samples from motor cortex from people with ALS and controls. Ancestry and relatedness were evaluated by principal components analysis and relationship matrices of DNA microarray data. Whole genome sequence data were from Illumina HiSeq platforms and aligned using the Isaac pipeline. TelSeq was used to quantify telomere length using whole genome sequence data. We tested the association of telomere length with ALS and ALS survival using Cox regression.
RESULTS: There were 6,580 whole genome sequences, reducing to 6,195 samples (4,315 from people with ALS and 1,880 controls) after quality control, and 159 brain samples (106 ALS, 53 controls). Accounting for age and sex, there was a 20% (95% CI 14%, 25%) increase of telomere length in people with ALS compared to controls (p = 1.1 × 10
DISCUSSION: Although telomeres shorten with age, longer telomeres are a risk factor for ALS and worsen prognosis. Longer telomeres are associated with ALS.","['Al Khleifat A', 'Iacoangeli A', 'Jones AR', 'van Vugt JJFA', 'Moisse M', 'Shatunov A', 'Zwamborn RAJ', 'van der Spek RAA', 'Cooper-Knock J', 'Topp S', 'van Rheenen W', 'Kenna B', 'Van Eijk KR', 'Kenna K', 'Byrne R', 'López V', 'Opie-Martin S', 'Vural A', 'Campos Y', 'Weber M', 'Smith B', 'Fogh I', 'Silani V', 'Morrison KE', 'Dobson R', 'van Es MA', 'McLaughlin RL', ""Vourc'h P"", 'Chio A', 'Corcia P', 'de Carvalho M', 'Gotkine M', 'Panades MP', 'Mora JS', 'Shaw PJ', 'Landers JE', 'Glass JD', 'Shaw CE', 'Basak N', 'Hardiman O', 'Robberecht W', 'Van Damme P', 'van den Berg LH', 'Veldink JH', 'Al-Chalabi A']",2022,16,,Front Cell Neurosci,"Al Khleifat A, et al.

36546684,APOE2 Exacerbates TDP-43 Related Toxicity in the Absence of Alzheimer Pathology.,"OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence supports a link between increased TDP-43 burden and the presence of an APOE4 gene allele in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it is difficult to conclude the direct effect of APOE on TDP-43 pathology due to the presence of mixed AD pathologies. The goal of this study is to address how APOE isoforms impact TDP-43 pathology and related neurodegeneration in the absence of typical AD pathologies.
METHODS: We overexpressed human TDP-43 via viral transduction in humanized APOE2, APOE3, APOE4 mice, and murine Apoe-knockout (Apoe-KO) mice. Behavior tests were performed across ages. Animals were harvested at 11 months of age and TDP-43 overexpression-related neurodegeneration and gliosis were assessed. To further address the human relevance, we analyzed the association of APOE with TDP-43 pathology in 160 postmortem brains from autopsy-confirmed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) in the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank.
RESULTS: We found that TDP-43 overexpression induced motor function deficits, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the motor cortex, especially in APOE2 mice, with much milder or absent effects in APOE3, APOE4, or Apoe-KO mice. In the motor cortex of the ALS and FTLD-MND postmortem human brains, we found that the APOE2 allele was associated with more severe TDP-43-positive dystrophic neurites.
INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest a genotype-specific effect of APOE on TDP-43 proteinopathy and neurodegeneration in the absence of AD pathology, with the strongest association seen with APOE2.

36522775,"ALSFRS-R-SE: an adapted, annotated, and self-explanatory version of the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale.","BACKGROUND: The ALS Functional Rating Scale in its revised version (ALSFRS-R) is a disease-specific severity score that reflects motor impairment and functional deterioration in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It has been widely applied in both clinical practice and ALS research. However, in Germany, several variants of the scale, each differing slightly from the others, have developed over time and are currently in circulation. This lack of uniformity potentially hampers data interpretation and may decrease item validity. Furthermore, shortcomings within the standard ALSFRS-R questions and answer options can limit the quality and conclusiveness of collected data.
METHODS: In a multistage consensus-building process, 18 clinical ALS experts from the German ALS/MND network analyzed the ALSFRS-R in its current form and created an adapted, annotated, and revised scale that closely adheres to the well-established standardized English version.
RESULTS: Ten German-language variants of the ALSFRS-R were collected, three of which contained instructions for self-assessment. All of these variants were compiled and a comprehensive linguistic revision was undertaken. A short introduction was added to the resulting scale, comprising general instructions for use and explanations for each of the five reply options per item. This adapted version of the scale, named ALSFRS-R-SE (with the ""SE"" referring to ""self-explanatory""), was carefully reviewed for language and comprehensibility, in both German and English.
CONCLUSION: An adapted and annotated version of the ALSFRS-R scale was developed through a multistage consensus process. The decision to include brief explanations of specific scale items and reply options was intended to facilitate ALSFRS-R-SE assessments by both healthcare professionals and patients. Further studies are required to investigate the accuracy and utility of the ALSFRS-R-SE in controlled trials and clinical real-world settings.","['Maier A', 'Boentert M', 'Reilich P', 'Witzel S', 'Petri S', 'Großkreutz J', 'Metelmann M', 'Lingor P', 'Cordts I', 'Dorst J', 'Zeller D', 'Günther R', 'Hagenacker T', 'Grehl T', 'Spittel S', 'Schuster J', 'Ludolph A', 'Meyer T', 'MND-NET consensus group']",2022,4,1,Neurol Res Pract,"Maier A, et al.

36515702,Genotype-phenotype characterisation of long survivors with motor neuron disease in Scotland.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the phenotypes and genotypes of a cohort of 'long-surviving' individuals with motor neuron disease (MND) to identify potential targets for prognostication.
METHODS: Patients were recruited via the Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation for MND (CARE-MND) platform, which hosts the Scottish MND Register. Long survival was defined as > 8 years from diagnosis. 11 phenotypic variables were analysed. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed and variants within 49 MND-associated genes examined. Each individual was screened for C9orf72 repeat expansions. Data from ancestry-matched Scottish populations (the Lothian Birth Cohorts) were used as controls.
RESULTS: 58 long survivors were identified. Median survival from diagnosis was 15.5 years. Long survivors were significantly younger at onset and diagnosis than incident patients and had a significantly longer diagnostic delay. 42% had the MND subtype of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). WGS was performed in 46 individuals: 14 (30.4%) had a potentially pathogenic variant. 4 carried the known SOD1 p.(Ile114Thr) variant. Significant variants in FIG4, hnRNPA2B1, SETX, SQSTM1, TAF15, and VAPB were detected. 2 individuals had a variant in the SPAST gene suggesting phenotypic overlap with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). No long survivors had pathogenic C9orf72 repeat expansions.
CONCLUSIONS: Long survivors are characterised by younger age at onset, increased prevalence of PLS and longer diagnostic delay. Genetic analysis in this cohort has improved our understanding of the phenotypes associated with the SOD1 variant p.(Ile114Thr). Our findings confirm that pathogenic expansion of C9orf72 is likely a poor prognostic marker. Genetic screening using targeted MND and/or HSP panels should be considered in those with long survival, or early-onset slowly progressive disease, to improve diagnostic accuracy and aid prognostication.","['Leighton DJ', 'Ansari M', 'Newton J', 'Parry D', 'Cleary E', 'Colville S', 'Stephenson L', 'Larraz J', 'Johnson M', 'Beswick E', 'Wong M', 'Gregory J', 'Carod Artal J', 'Davenport R', 'Duncan C', 'Morrison I', 'Smith C', 'Swingler R', 'Deary IJ', 'Porteous M', 'Aitman TJ', 'Chandran S', 'Gorrie GH', 'Pal S', 'Lothian Birth Cohorts Group', 'and the CARE-MND Consortium']",2023,270,3,J Neurol,"Leighton DJ, et al.

36512061,LATE-NC staging in routine neuropathologic diagnosis: an update.,"An international consensus report in 2019 recommended a classification system for limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC). The suggested neuropathologic staging system and nomenclature have proven useful for autopsy practice and dementia research. However, some issues remain unresolved, such as cases with unusual features that do not fit with current diagnostic categories. The goal of this report is to update the neuropathologic criteria for the diagnosis and staging of LATE-NC, based primarily on published data. We provide practical suggestions about how to integrate available genetic information and comorbid pathologies [e.g., Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and Lewy body disease]. We also describe recent research findings that have enabled more precise guidance on how to differentiate LATE-NC from other subtypes of TDP-43 pathology [e.g., frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)], and how to render diagnoses in unusual situations in which TDP-43 pathology does not follow the staging scheme proposed in 2019. Specific recommendations are also made on when not to apply this diagnostic term based on current knowledge. Neuroanatomical regions of interest in LATE-NC are described in detail and the implications for TDP-43 immunohistochemical results are specified more precisely. We also highlight questions that remain unresolved and areas needing additional study. In summary, the current work lays out a number of recommendations to improve the precision of LATE-NC staging based on published reports and diagnostic experience.","['Nelson PT', 'Lee EB', 'Cykowski MD', 'Alafuzoff I', 'Arfanakis K', 'Attems J', 'Brayne C', 'Corrada MM', 'Dugger BN', 'Flanagan ME', 'Ghetti B', 'Grinberg LT', 'Grossman M', 'Grothe MJ', 'Halliday GM', 'Hasegawa M', 'Hokkanen SRK', 'Hunter S', 'Jellinger K', 'Kawas CH', 'Keene CD', 'Kouri N', 'Kovacs GG', 'Leverenz JB', 'Latimer CS', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Mao Q', 'McAleese KE', 'Merrick R', 'Montine TJ', 'Murray ME', 'Myllykangas L', 'Nag S', 'Neltner JH', 'Newell KL', 'Rissman RA', 'Saito Y', 'Sajjadi SA', 'Schwetye KE', 'Teich AF', 'Thal DR', 'Tomé SO', 'Troncoso JC', 'Wang SJ', 'White CL', 'Wisniewski T', 'Yang HS', 'Schneider JA', 'Dickson DW', 'Neumann M']",2023,145,2,Acta Neuropathol,"Nelson PT, et al.

36509983,Analysis of brain and spinal MRI measures in a common domain to investigate directional neurodegeneration in motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spinal cord is often performed in diagnostic evaluation of suspected motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS). Analysis of MRI-derived tissue damage metrics in a common domain facilitates group-level inferences on pathophysiology. This approach was applied to address competing hypotheses of directionality of neurodegeneration, whether anterograde, cranio-caudal dying-forward from precentral gyrus or retrograde, dying-back.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, MRI was performed on 75 MND patients and 13 healthy controls. Precentral gyral thickness was estimated from volumetric T1-weighted images using FreeSurfer, corticospinal tract fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion tensor imaging using FSL, and cross-sectional cervical cord area between C1-C8 levels using Spinal Cord Toolbox. To analyse these multimodal data within a common domain, individual parameter estimates representing tissue damage at each corticospinal tract level were first converted to z-scores, referenced to healthy control norms. Mixed-effects linear regression models were then fitted to these z-scores, with gradients hypothesised to represent directionality of neurodegeneration.
RESULTS: At group-level, z-scores did not differ significantly between precentral gyral and intracranial corticospinal tract tissue damage estimates (regression coefficient - 0.24, [95% CI - 0.62, 0.14], p = 0.222), but step-changes were evident between intracranial corticospinal tract and C1 (1.14, [95% CI 0.74, 1.53], p < 0.001), and between C5 and C6 cord levels (0.98, [95% CI 0.58, 1.38], p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Analysis of brain and cervical spinal MRI data in a common domain enabled investigation of pathophysiological hypotheses in vivo. A cranio-caudal step-change in MND patients was observed, and requires further investigation in larger cohorts.","['Toh C', 'Keslake A', 'Payne T', 'Onwuegbuzie A', 'Harding J', 'Baster K', 'Hoggard N', 'Shaw PJ', 'Wilkinson ID', 'Jenkins TM']",2023,270,3,J Neurol,"Toh C, et al.

An exploratory meta-analysis identified that patients homozygous for the C-allele at SNP rs12608932, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene UNC13A, had a statistically significant survival benefit when treated with lithium carbonate. We aim to confirm the efficacy of lithium carbonate on the time to death or respiratory insufficiency in patients with ALS homozygous for the C-allele at SNP rs12608932 in UNC13A.
METHODS: A randomized, group-sequential, event-driven, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted in 15 sites across Europe and Australia. Patients will be genotyped for UNC13A; those homozygous for the C-allele at SNP rs12608932 will be eligible. Patients must have a diagnosis of ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria, and a TRICALS risk-profile score between -6.0 and -2.0. An expected number of 1200 patients will be screened in order to enroll a target sample size of 171 patients. Patients will be randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to lithium carbonate or matching placebo, and treated for a maximum duration of 24 months. The primary endpoint is the time to death or respiratory insufficiency, whichever occurs first. Key secondary endpoints include functional decline, respiratory function, quality of life, tolerability, and safety. An interim analysis for futility and efficacy will be conducted after the occurrence of 41 events.
DISCUSSION: Lithium carbonate has been proven to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with ALS. Given the favorable safety profile, the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the burden and risks associated with study participation. This study may provide conclusive evidence about the life-prolonging potential of lithium carbonate in a genetic ALS subgroup.

36470071,The diagnostic experience for people with MND and their caregivers in the U.K.,"OBJECTIVE: How an MND diagnosis is communicated has implications for how individuals adapt to their illness. The consultation process with the neurologist, diagnosis delivery, and adherence to UK guidelines, were explored from the perspectives of people diagnosed with MND and family caregivers.
METHODS: A cross-sectional approach with people with MND and their caregivers in UK. An anonymous online survey, based on the SPIKES protocol for delivering bad news and containing questions focusing on the UK NICE MND guideline, was distributed in 2018-19.
RESULTS: 69 people with MND and 39 caregivers responded. People with MND were more likely than caregivers to rate highly their neurologist's skills and ability and their satisfaction with delivery of the diagnosis. The amount of time spent with the neurologist at diagnosis had an impact on the level of satisfaction and rating of the neurologist's skills and abilities. The SPIKES criteria were generally not met. Many of the NICE MND guideline recommendations were not met, though adherence was greater in MND Centres.
CONCLUSIONS: While there is evidence of satisfaction with the delivery of the diagnosis amongst people with MND and caregivers, there is room for improvement. There is a need for greater awareness of the requirements of people with MND and caregivers. There is also a need to raise awareness of the NICE MND guideline and ensure adequate training, time and funding to ensure communication at this difficult time is acceptable and effective. Where possible it would be preferable for referrals to be made to MND centres.","[""O'Brien MR"", 'McDermott C', 'Aoun S', 'Oliver D', 'Kirton JA']",2023,444,,J Neurol Sci,"O'Brien MR, et al.

36456758,Diagnostic utility of neurofilament markers for MND is limited in restricted disease phenotype and for differentiation from compressive myeloradiculopathies.,"Misdiagnosis is frequent in early motor neuron disease (MND), typically compressive radiculopathy, or in patients with restricted MND phenotype. In this retrospective, single tertiary centre study, we measured levels of neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (p-NfH) chain in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and of p-NfH in serum with commercially available ELISA kits and assessed their respective diagnostic performance as a marker of MND. The entire study population (n = 164) comprised 71 MND patients, 30 patients with compressive myelo- or radiculopathy, and 63 disease controls (DC). Among MND patients, we specified subgroups with only lower motoneuron involvement (MND-LMN, n = 15) and with confounding nerve roots or spinal cord compression (MND-C, n = 18), representing clinical diagnostic pitfalls. MND-LMN displayed significantly lower CSF NfL (p = 0.003) and p-NFH (p = 0.017), but not serum p-NfH (p = 0.347) levels compared to other MND patients (n = 56). The discriminative ability (area under the curve-AUC) of both CSF Nfs towards all MND patients was comparable to each other but significantly higher than that of p-NfH in serum (ps < 0.001). AUC of both CSF Nfs between MND-LMN and DC and also between MND-C and myelo-/radiculopathies were reduced, as compared to AUC between other MND and DC or myelo-/radiculopathies, respectively. Our results suggest that both Nfs in CSF represent a reliable diagnostic marker in a general MND population, fulfilling Awaji criteria. As for diagnostic pitfalls, and also for p-NfH in serum, their discriminative ability and, therefore, clinical utility appears to be limited.","['Baumgartner D', 'Mazanec R', 'Hanzalová J']",2023,270,3,J Neurol,"Baumgartner D, et al.

36448241,Well-being on supportive techniques in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: from neurologists' perspective.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate intercultural neurologists' perception of well-being in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using gastrostomy (PEG), non-invasive, and/or invasive ventilation (NIV/IV) and to analyse the determinants and impact on the management of the above medical interventions (MIs).
METHODS: The study was based on anonymous questionnaires addressing the clinical approach and personal attitude towards the use of PEG, NIV and IV in ALS patients completed by 465 neurologists: 228 from Germany and 237 from Poland.
RESULTS: The German and Polish neurologists estimated the quality of life in ALS patients using PEG and NIV as neutral, whilst low in individuals using IV. A regression model revealed an independent influence of palliative care training (PCT) and age on that attitude in the German group. Higher values of estimated patients' depressiveness on PEG, NIV and IV were found amongst the Polish neurologists. Marital status, experience in ALS and being a parent independently influenced the perception of patients' depressiveness in the German, whilst marital status, age and PCT were factors in the Polish group. Amongst German neurologists, a higher perception of patients' depressiveness in individuals using PEG, NIV and IV was linked to the later timing of the MIs discussion. In the Polish group, it was a lower estimation of QoL in patients using PEG.
CONCLUSION: Neurologists' perception of ALS patients' well-being on MIs reflects their demographic status, professional experience and potentially their cultural background. This perception plays an important role in the timing of MIs discussion, possibly influencing the decision-making process.","['Barć K', 'Lulé D', 'Finsel J', 'Helczyk O', 'Baader S', 'Aho-Özhan H', 'Ludolph AC', 'Kuźma-Kozakiewicz M']",2022,9,12,Ann Clin Transl Neurol,"Barć K, et al.

36443488,Loss of brainstem white matter predicts onset and motor neuron symptoms in C9orf72 expansion carriers: a GENFI study.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The C9orf72 expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and/or motor neuron disease (MND). Corticospinal degeneration has been described in post-mortem neuropathological studies in these patients, especially in those with MND. We used MRI to analyze white matter (WM) volumes in presymptomatic and symptomatic C9orf72 expansion carriers and investigated whether its measure may be helpful in predicting the onset of symptoms.
METHODS: We studied 102 presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers, 52 symptomatic carriers: 42 suffering from FTD and 11 from MND, and 75 non-carriers from the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI). All subjects underwent T1-MRI acquisition. We used FreeSurfer to estimate the volume proportion of WM in the brainstem regions (midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata). We calculated group differences with ANOVA tests and performed linear and non-linear regressions to assess group-by-age interactions.
RESULTS: A reduced WM ratio was found in all brainstem subregions in symptomatic carriers compared to both noncarriers and pre-symptomatic carriers. Within symptomatic carriers, MND patients presented a lower ratio in pons and medulla oblongata compared with FTD patients. No differences were found between presymptomatic carriers and non-carriers. Clinical severity was negatively associated with the WM ratio. C9orf72 carriers presented greater age-related WM loss than non-carriers, with MND patients showing significantly more atrophy in pons and medulla oblongata.
DISCUSSION: We find consistent brainstem WM loss in C9orf72 symptomatic carriers with differences related to the clinical phenotype supporting the use of brainstem measures as neuroimaging biomarkers for disease tracking.","['Pérez-Millan A', 'Borrego-Écija S', 'van Swieten JC', 'Jiskoot L', 'Moreno F', 'Laforce R', 'Graff C', 'Masellis M', 'Tartaglia MC', 'Rowe JB', 'Borroni B', 'Finger E', 'Synofzik M', 'Galimberti D', 'Vandenberghe R', 'de Mendonça A', 'Butler CR', 'Gerhard A', 'Ducharme S', 'Le Ber I', 'Santana I', 'Pasquier F', 'Levin J', 'Otto M', 'Sorbi S', 'Tiraboschi P', 'Seelaar H', 'Langheinrich T', 'Rohrer JD', 'Sala-Llonch R', 'Sánchez-Valle R', 'Genetic FTD Initiative, GENFI']",2023,270,3,J Neurol,"Pérez-Millan A, et al.

36397351,Herbal medicine and acupuncture relieved progressive bulbar palsy for more than 3 years: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) is a type of motor neuron disease (MND). The main symptoms include dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue muscle atrophy and fasciculations. This disease is generally severe and develops rapidly. Due to the lack of effective treatment, many patients with MND in China turn to traditional Chinese medicine treatment for help. We successfully relieved dysphagia and sialorrhea in a patient with PBP for 3 years with herbal medicine and acupuncture.
PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 68-years-old woman with PBP and suffered from severe dysphagia and sialorrhea.
DIAGNOSES: Progressive bulbar palsy.
INTERVENTIONS: Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture.
OUTCOMES: After 4 months of herbal medicine and acupuncture treatment, dysphagia and sialorrhea were relieved considerably. The patient's condition has been stable for more than 3 years and continues to be treated with Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture.
LESSONS: Our case suggests that alternative therapies such as herbal medicine and acupuncture may be effective in alleviating the symptoms of MND/PBP. However, standardized clinical studies are still required to verify the effectiveness and safety.","['Peng S', 'Chang W', 'Tian Y', 'Yang Y', 'Li S', 'Ni J', 'Zhu W']",2022,101,45,Medicine (Baltimore),"Peng S, et al.

36380299,A randomised controlled trial of acceptance and commitment therapy plus usual care compared to usual care alone for improving psychological health in people with motor neuron disease (COMMEND): study protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease that predominantly affects motor neurons from the motor cortex to the spinal cord and causes progressive wasting and weakening of bulbar, limb, abdominal and thoracic muscles. Prognosis is poor and median survival is 2-3 years following symptom onset. Psychological distress is relatively common in people living with MND. However, formal psychotherapy is not routinely part of standard care within MND Care Centres/clinics in the UK, and clear evidence-based guidance on improving the psychological health of people living with MND is lacking. Previous research suggests that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may be particularly suitable for people living with MND and may help improve their psychological health.
AIMS: To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ACT modified for MND plus usual multidisciplinary care (UC) in comparison to UC alone for improving psychological health in people living with MND.
METHODS: The COMMEND trial is a multi-centre, assessor-blind, parallel, two-arm RCT with a 10-month internal pilot phase. 188 individuals aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of definite, laboratory-supported probable, clinically probable, or possible familial or sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and additionally the progressive muscular atrophy and primary lateral sclerosis variants, will be recruited from approximately 14 UK-based MND Care Centres/clinics and via self-referral. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive up to eight 1:1 sessions of ACT plus UC or UC alone by an online randomisation system. Participants will complete outcome measures at baseline and at 6- and 9-months post-randomisation. The primary outcome will be quality of life at six months. Secondary outcomes will include depression, anxiety, psychological flexibility, health-related quality of life, adverse events, ALS functioning, survival at nine months, satisfaction with therapy, resource use and quality-adjusted life years. Primary analyses will be by intention to treat and data will be analysed using multi-level modelling.
DISCUSSION: This trial will provide definitive evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ACT plus UC in comparison to UC alone for improving psychological health in people living with MND.

Most studies assess limited variants or sample sizes. In this international, retrospective observational study, we compare phenotypic and demographic characteristics between people with SOD1-ALS and people with ALS and no recorded SOD1 variant. We investigate which variants are associated with age at symptom onset and time from onset to death or censoring using Cox proportional-hazards regression. The SOD1-ALS dataset reports age of onset for 1122 and disease duration for 883 people; the comparator population includes 10,214 and 9010 people respectively. Eight variants are associated with younger age of onset and distinct survival trajectories; a further eight associated with younger onset only and one with distinct survival only. Here we show that onset and survival are decoupled in SOD1-ALS.

However, the MN differentiation efficiency and viability following cryopreservation require further development for application in large-scale studies and drug screening. Here, we developed a robust protocol to convert hPSCs into MN cryopreservation stocks (hPSCs were converted into >92% motor neural progenitors and >91% MNs). Near-mature MNs were cryopreserved at a high thawing survival rate and 89% MN marker expression on day 32. Moreover, these MNs exhibited classical electrophysiological properties and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation ability within only 4−6 days after thawing. To apply this platform as an MND model, MN stocks were generated from SOD1G85R, SOD1G85G isogenic control, and sporadic ALS hPSC lines. The thawed ALS MNs expressed ALS-specific cytopathies, including SOD1 protein aggregation and TDP-43 redistribution. Thus, a stable and robust protocol was developed to generate ready-to-use cryopreserved MNs without further neuronal maturation processes for application in MND mechanistic studies, NMJ model establishment, and large-scale drug screening.","['Ting HC', 'Su HL', 'Chen MF', 'Harn HJ', 'Lin SZ', 'Chiou TW', 'Chang CY']",2022,23,21,Int J Mol Sci,"Ting HC, et al.

36315040,Changing perspectives on frontotemporal dementia: A review.,"This article examines the evolution in understanding of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) during the last four decades. A central theme is the recognition of heterogeneity. Originally construed as a disorder of behaviour and executive impairment, FTD is now known also to be associated with alterations in language, conceptual knowledge and praxis. An absence of neurological signs is the hallmark of many FTD patients, but there is also an established association with motor neurone disease (MND), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). FTD is commonly defined as an early onset dementia, yet about a quarter of patients present after the age of 65. The underlying pathological protein is tau, TDP-43 or more rarely fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Distinct genetic mutations have been identified in familial FTD. There are predictable relationships between clinical phenotype, pathological substrate and genetic mutation. For example, a circumscribed semantic disorder predicts TDP-43 pathology, and speech or limb apraxia tau pathology. The co-occurrence of MND predicts TDP-43 pathology, and PSP and CBD tau pathology. FUS pathology is associated with very youthful onset, stereotyped behaviours and caudate atrophy. Non-fluent aphasia is linked to progranulin (GRN) mutations and MND and psychosis to repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene. Despite striking worldwide consensus in findings there remain some issues of contention, largely related to the classification of FTD and its sub-variants. Understanding the diverse nature of FTD is crucial for effective diagnosis, management and the development of targeted therapies.",['Snowden JS'],2023,17,2,J Neuropsychol,Snowden JS.

36314539,Profiling non-coding RNA expression in cerebrospinal fluid of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Objective biomarkers for the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) are critical for diagnosis, drug development, clinical trials, and insight into disease pathology. Key candidates for biomarkers present in biofluids include non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts including microRNA, piwi-interacting RNA and transfer RNA. To determine if the central nervous system was the source of the dysregulated ncRNA biomarkers we previously observed in serum, we sought to identify dysregulated ncRNA candidates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which may provide new insight into the disease pathology.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was undertaken on CSF samples from healthy controls (
RESULTS: We found a range of ncRNA that were dysregulated in the RNA-seq screen, but these failed to be validated or detected in some cases using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, our previously identified serum ncRNA biomarker showed no change in CSF or correlation to serum.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the CSF may not be the source of dysregulated ncRNA in the serum and highlights the difficulty in identifying ncRNA in CSF as biomarkers for ALS.KEY MESSAGESIn this current study, we investigated the expression of non-coding RNA transcripts in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients compared to healthy controls.RNA-seq identified dysregulated non-coding RNA transcripts, but these were not validated with RT-qPCR.We conclude that cerebrospinal fluid is not a suitable source of diagnostic biomarkers.","['Joilin G', 'Gray E', 'Thompson AG', 'Talbot K', 'Leigh PN', 'Newbury SF', 'Turner MR', 'Hafezparast M']",2022,54,1,Ann Med,"Joilin G, et al.

36308811,Impact of long-term air pollution exposure on incidence of neurodegenerative diseases: A protocol for a systematic review and exposure-response meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution is a pervasive and ubiquitous hazard, which has been linked to premature morbidity and a growing number of morbidity endpoints. Air pollution may be linked to neurodegeneration, and via this or other pathways, to neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that air pollution may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Motor Neuron Diseases (MND), although this evidence remains inconsistent and very limited for MS and MND. In addition, this evidence base is rapidly emerging and would benefit from a wide and critical synthesis, including a better understanding of heterogeneity.
OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis and specify our methods a priori. The main aim of the planned systematic review is to answer the question of whether long-term exposure (>1 year) to ambient (outdoor) air pollution (exposure, compared to lower exposure) increases the risk of adult (population) incidence of neurodegenerative diseases (outcomes) in epidemiological observational studies (study design). Another aim is to meta-analyze the associations between long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and the risk of the selected outcomes and assess the shape of exposure-response functions. To set the stage for the proposed work, we also overview the existing epidemiological evidence in this protocol, but do not critically evaluate it, as these results will be fully presented in the planned systematic review.
SEARCH AND STUDY ELIGIBILITY: We will search the electronic databases Medline (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), Cochrane Library, Cinahl (via Ebscohost), Global Health (via Ebscohost), PsycINFO (via Ebscohost), Scopus, Web of Science (Core Collection), from inception to October 2022. Eligible studies must contain primary research investigating the link between 1-year + exposure to any outdoor air pollutant, from any source, and dementia, PD, MS, and MND, or dementia subtypes: Alzheimer's Disease, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia. The search strategy and eligibility criteria are pre-determined and described in full in this protocol.
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Articles will be stored and screened using Rayyan QCRI. Title and abstract screening, full text review, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and data preparation for statistical analysis will be conducted independently by two reviewers using pre-defined forms and criteria, described in this protocol. All these steps will also be piloted and the forms and/or methods adapted if issues arise. Meta-analysis and assessment of the shape of the exposure-response functions will be conducted if four independent exposure-outcomes pairs are available, and the remainder of results will be synthesized in the forms of tables and via a narrative summary. Certainty in the body of evidence will be assessed using the OHAT approach. This protocol describes the planned analysis and synthesis a priori and serves to increase transparency and impact of this systematic review and meta-analysis.","['Khreis H', 'Bredell C', 'Wai Fung K', 'Hong L', 'Szybka M', 'Phillips V', 'Abbas A', 'Lim YH', 'Jovanovic Andersen Z', 'Woodcock J', 'Brayne C']",2022,170,,Environ Int,"Khreis H, et al.

36294010,"Effects of Global Warming on Patients with Dementia, Motor Neuron or Parkinson's Diseases: A Comparison among Cortical and Subcortical Disorders.","Exposure to global warming can be dangerous for health and can lead to an increase in the prevalence of neurological diseases worldwide. Such an effect is more evident in populations that are less prepared to cope with enhanced environmental temperatures. In this work, we extend our previous research on the link between climate change and Parkinson's disease (PD) to also include Alzheimer's Disease and other Dementias (AD/D) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Motor Neuron Diseases (ALS/MND). One hundred and eighty-four world countries were clustered into four groups according to their climate indices (warming and annual average temperature). Variations between 1990 and 2016 in the diseases' indices (prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years) and climate indices for the four clusters were analyzed. Unlike our previous work on PD, we did not find any significant correlation between warming and epidemiological indices for AD/D and ALS/MND patients. A significantly lower increment in prevalence in countries with higher temperatures was found for ALS/MND patients. It can be argued that the discordant findings between AD/D or ALS/MND and PD might be related to the different features of the neuronal types involved and the pathophysiology of thermoregulation. The neurons of AD/D and ALS/MND patients are less vulnerable to heat-related degeneration effects than PD patients. PD patients' substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which are constitutively frailer due to their morphology and function, fall down under an overwhelming oxidative stress caused by climate warming.","['Bongioanni P', 'Del Carratore R', 'Dolciotti C', 'Diana A', 'Buizza R']",2022,19,20,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Bongioanni P, et al.

36291638,Impact of the Renin-Angiotensin System on the Pathogeny and Pharmacotherapeutics of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Brain neurodegenerative diseases (BND) are debilitating conditions that are especially characteristic of a certain period of life and considered major threats to human health. Current treatments are limited, meaning that there is a challenge in developing new options that can efficiently tackle the different components and pathophysiological processes of these conditions. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) is an endocrine axis with important peripheral physiological functions such as blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis, as well as water and sodium balance and systemic vascular resistance-functions which are well-documented. However, recent work has highlighted the paracrine and autocrine functions of RAS in different tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). It is known that RAS hyperactivation has pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant effects, thus suggesting that its pharmacological modulation could be used in the management of these conditions. The present paper underlines the involvement of RAS and its components in the pathophysiology of BNDs such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), motor neuron disease (MND), and prion disease (PRD), as well as the identification of drugs and pharmacologically active substances that act upon RAS, which could alleviate their symptomatology or evolution, and thus, contribute to novel therapeutic approaches.","['Bild W', 'Vasincu A', 'Rusu RN', 'Ababei DC', 'Stana AB', 'Stanciu GD', 'Savu B', 'Bild V']",2022,12,10,Biomolecules,"Bild W, et al.

Although the typical clinical phenotype of ALS involves simultaneous upper and lower motor neurons, there is growing evidence that the neurodegeneration during the course of the disease can also involve other motor and non-motor regions. In this review, we analyzed and discussed available data from epidemiological population-based studies on extrapyramidal and non-motor features during the course of ALS.","['Urso D', 'Zoccolella S', 'Gnoni V', 'Logroscino G']",2022,10,10,Biomedicines,"Urso D, et al.

36263379,Synaptic dysfunction in ALS and FTD: anatomical and molecular changes provide insights into mechanisms of disease.,"Synaptic loss is a pathological feature of all neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ALS is a disease of the cortical and spinal motor neurons resulting in fatal paralysis due to denervation of muscles. FTD is a form of dementia that primarily affects brain regions controlling cognition, language and behavior. Once classified as two distinct diseases, ALS and FTD are now considered as part of a common disease spectrum based on overlapping clinical, pathological and genetic evidence. At the cellular level, aggregation of common proteins and overlapping gene susceptibilities are shared in both ALS and FTD. Despite the convergence of these two fields of research, the underlying disease mechanisms remain elusive. However, recent discovers from ALS and FTD patient studies and models of ALS/FTD strongly suggests that synaptic dysfunction is an early event in the disease process and a unifying hallmark of these diseases. This review provides a summary of the reported anatomical and cellular changes that occur in cortical and spinal motor neurons in ALS and FTD tissues and models of disease. We also highlight studies that identify changes in the proteome and transcriptome of ALS and FTD models and provide a conceptual overview of the processes that contribute to synaptic dysfunction in these diseases. Due to space limitations and the vast number of publications in the ALS and FTD fields, many articles have not been discussed in this review. As such, this review focuses on the three most common shared mutations in ALS and FTD, the hexanucleuotide repeat expansion within intron 1 of ","['Gelon PA', 'Dutchak PA', 'Sephton CF']",2022,15,,Front Mol Neurosci,"Gelon PA, et al.

36217158,Serum total TDP-43 levels are decreased in frontotemporal dementia patients with C9orf72 repeat expansion or concomitant motoneuron disease phenotype.,"BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) covers a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders with various clinical and neuropathological subtypes. The two major pathological proteins accumulating in the brains of FTD patients, depending on their genetic background, are TDP-43 and tau. We aimed to evaluate whether total TDP-43 levels measured from the serum associate with the genotype or clinical phenotype of the FTD patients and whether serum TDP-43 provides prognostic or diagnostic value in the FTD spectrum disorders.
METHODS: The study cohort included 254 participants with a clinical diagnosis of FTD (including all major genotypes and clinical phenotypes) and 105 cognitively healthy controls. Serum total TDP-43 levels measured with a single-molecule array (Simoa) were compared within the FTD group according to the genotype, clinical phenotype, and predicted neuropathological subtype of the patients. We also evaluated the associations between the TDP-43 levels and disease severity or survival in FTD.
RESULTS: Total TDP-43 levels in the serum were significantly lower in the FTD group as compared to the healthy control group (275.3 pg/mL vs. 361.8 pg/mL, B = 0.181, 95%CI = 0.014-0.348, p = 0.034). The lowest TDP-43 levels were observed in the subgroup of FTD patients harboring predicted TDP-43 brain pathology (FTD-TDP, 241.4 pg/mL). The low levels in the FTD-TDP group were especially driven by C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers (169.2 pg/mL) and FTD patients with concomitant motoneuron disease (FTD-MND, 113.3 pg/mL), whereas GRN mutation carriers did not show decreased TDP-43 levels (328.6 pg/mL). Serum TDP-43 levels showed no correlation with disease severity nor progression in FTD.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the total levels of TDP-43 in the serum are decreased especially in FTD patients with the C9orf72 repeat expansion or FTD-MND phenotype, both subtypes strongly associated with TDP-43 type B brain pathology. Serum-based measurement of TDP-43 could represent a useful tool in indicating C9orf72 repeat expansion and FTD-MND-related TDP-43 neuropathology for future diagnostics and intervention studies.","['Katisko K', 'Huber N', 'Kokkola T', 'Hartikainen P', 'Krüger J', 'Heikkinen AL', 'Paananen V', 'Leinonen V', 'Korhonen VE', 'Helisalmi S', 'Herukka SK', 'Cantoni V', 'Gadola Y', 'Archetti S', 'Remes AM', 'Haapasalo A', 'Borroni B', 'Solje E']",2022,14,1,Alzheimers Res Ther,"Katisko K, et al.

36189590,Serum Uric Acid Levels in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"BACKGROUND: Excessive oxidative stress may contribute to neurodegeneration by leading to protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Uric acid (UA) is an important endogenous antioxidant that protects against oxidative stress, yet its exact role in neurodegeneration remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the performance of serum UA in neurodegenerative disorders.
METHODS: A total of 839 controls and 840 patients, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), motor neuron disease (MND), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and mixed dementia (MixD) were enrolled. Fasting serum UA levels were measured in all participants and compared between patients and controls. Linear regression models were utilized to explore possible relationships of serum UA with cognition, disease duration, age, and age of onset.
RESULTS: Compared to controls (355.48 ± 85.38 μmol/L), serum UA was significantly lower in AD (291.29 ± 83.49 μmol/L, p < 0.001), PD (286.95 ± 81.78 μmol/L, p < 0.001), PSP (313.32 ± 88.19 μmol/L, p < 0.001), FTD (313.89 ± 71.18 μmol/L, p = 0.001), and DLB (279.23 ± 65.51 μmol/L, p < 0.001), adjusting for confounding factors including age, gender, education, etc. In addition, serum UA was positively correlated with cognitive levels in all patients (Mini-Mental State Examination: r = 0.136, p = 0.001; and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale: r = 0.108, p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Decreased levels of serum UA were correlated with AD, PD, PSP, FTD, and DLB, offering significant potential as a promisingly relevant, less-invasive marker of multiple neurodegenerative disorders.","['Aerqin Q', 'Jia SS', 'Shen XN', 'Li Q', 'Chen KL', 'Ou YN', 'Huang YY', 'Dong Q', 'Chen SF', 'Yu JT']",2022,90,2,J Alzheimers Dis,"Aerqin Q, et al.

36179894,Physical Activity in People With Motor Neuron Disease: Validity of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly as a Measuring Tool.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether the physical activity scale for the elderly (PASE) is a valid tool in measuring physical activity (PA) in people with motor neuron disease (MND) and to identify the demographic and clinical factors that predict PA participation in this population.
DESIGN: A prospective, observational study involving 100 ambulant participants with MND.
SETTING: This study was conducted at a multidisciplinary specialist MND clinic. The clinic is fully funded by the local public health system and patients receiving care here are not expected to pay for their consultation.
PARTICIPANTS: 190 patients with MND who had a physiotherapy appointment at the specialist clinic between July and October 2018 were screened. Of these, 100 participants (mean age 67 years [SD=12], 64% [n=64] men) who were ambulant (with or without assistance) were recruited (N=100).
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PASE questionnaire, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale-Revised (ALSFRS-r), forced vital capacity (FVC).
RESULTS: The results showed that engagement in PA is generally low, with median PASE score of 57. The PASE had fair-moderate correlation with ALSFRS-R total scores (rho=0.607; P<.000) and FVC (rho=0.250; P=.030). Standard multiple regression analyses showed that disease severity (ALSFRS-R total score) was the strongest predictor of PA levels (β= 0.54; 95% confidence interval 0.02,0.06). The most frequently selected physical activities of choice for people with MND were activities around their homes and the biggest barrier to participation is fatigue.
CONCLUSION: Present findings suggest that the PASE can be used to measure PA participation in people with MND. Details about activity of choice and barriers to participation present important considerations in designing exercise programs in this population to maximize compliance and therefore effectiveness.","['Sia T', 'Connors KA', 'Morgan P']",2023,104,1,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,"Sia T, et al.

36162820,The impact of age on genetic testing decisions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative syndrome. In up to 20% of cases, a family history is observed. Although Mendelian disease gene variants are found in apparently sporadic ALS, genetic testing is usually restricted to those with a family history or younger patients with sporadic disease. With the advent of therapies targeting genetic ALS, it is important that everyone treatable is identified. We therefore sought to determine the probability of a clinically actionable ALS genetic test result by age of onset, globally, but using the UK as an exemplar. Blood-derived DNA was sequenced for ALS genes, and the probability of a clinically actionable genetic test result estimated. For a UK subset, age- and sex-specific population incidence rates were used to determine the number of such results missed by restricting testing by age of onset according to UK's National Genomic Test Directory criteria. There were 6274 people with sporadic ALS, 1551 from the UK. The proportion with a clinically actionable genetic test result ranged between 0.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-0.25] in the youngest age group to 0.15 (95% CI 0.13-0.17) in the oldest age group for a full gene panel. For the UK, the equivalent proportions were 0.23 (95% CI 0.13-0.33) in the youngest age group to 0.17 (95% CI 0.13-0.21) in the oldest age group. By limiting testing in those without a family history to people with onset below 40 years, 115 of 117 (98% of all, 95% CI 96%-101%) clinically actionable test results were missed. There is a significant probability of a clinically actionable genetic test result in people with apparently sporadic ALS at all ages. Although some countries limit testing by age, doing so results in a significant number of missed pathogenic test results. Age of onset and family history should not be a barrier to genetic testing in ALS.","['Mehta PR', 'Iacoangeli A', 'Opie-Martin S', 'van Vugt JJFA', 'Al Khleifat A', 'Bredin A', 'Ossher L', 'Andersen PM', 'Hardiman O', 'Mehta AR', 'Fratta P', 'Talbot K', 'Project MinE ALS Sequencing Consortium', 'Al-Chalabi A']",2022,145,12,Brain,"Mehta PR, et al.

36148819,Mild behavioral impairment as a potential marker of predementia risk states in motor neuron diseases.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild behavioral impairment (MBI) has been increasingly regarded as the neurobehavioral axis of predementia risk states, but a specific investigation of its detection as a potential marker of prodromal dementia in motor neuron diseases (MNDs) is still lacking. The aims of our study were therefore to explore MBI in MNDs both at onset and over the disease course, and to evaluate its relationship with baseline and longitudinal cognitive features.
METHODS: Sixty MND patients with cognitive/behavioral, mood, and motor examinations were recruited and followed longitudinally for up to 15 months. Associations between baseline MBI symptoms and clinical features were tested using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Based on longitudinal data, relative deltas of variation for each cognitive measure were generated, and linear regression models were then used to evaluate the role of baseline MBI symptoms in predicting longitudinal rates of cognitive decline.
RESULTS: At disease onset, the most impaired MBI domain was affective/emotional dysregulation, followed by impulse dyscontrol, apathy, and social inappropriateness. Greater MBI symptoms correlated with more severe baseline motor, cognitive/behavioral, and mood disturbances (p values from <0.001 to 0.05). Longitudinally, the greatest decline was observed in the affective/emotional dysregulation domain, followed by impulse dyscontrol, apathy, and social inappropriateness. Greater MBI symptoms at onset were significant predictors of more severe longitudinal cognitive decline in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-specific and ALS-nonspecific functions (p values from <0.001 to 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: MBI represents a valuable clinical marker of incident cognitive decline in MNDs, and its evaluation has good potential for detecting dementia in its preclinical/prodromal phase.","['Ferraro PM', 'Gervino E', 'De Maria E', 'Meo G', 'Ponzano M', 'Pardini M', 'Signori A', 'Schenone A', 'Roccatagliata L', 'Caponnetto C']",2023,30,1,Eur J Neurol,"Ferraro PM, et al.

Little is known about its use at the end of life, and the withdrawal of MV is a challenging topic. A scoping review was conducted to map the existing evidence of ventilation use at the end of life in MND. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework was used, and a total of 31 documents were included in the data extraction. Boarder themes around place, planning, cause and comments on death were identified. Our findings show that the focus of the literature has been on the process of the withdrawal of ventilation, creating the subthemes of timing and reason for withdrawal, along with ethical, emotional, and practical issues, medications used and the time until death. There is a foundation of evidence to guide the process and discuss the ethical and emotional issues of withdrawing ventilation. However, there remains limited evidence from patient and family member perspectives. Importantly, there is almost no evidence exploring dying with ventilation in place, the active or passive decisions around this process, how the interface might impact the dying process, or what families think about this.","['Wilson E', 'Lee JS', 'Wenzel D', 'Faull C']",2022,12,9,Brain Sci,"Wilson E, et al.

36121477,PolyGA targets the ER stress-adaptive response by impairing GRP75 function at the MAM in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD.,"ER stress signaling is linked to the pathophysiological and clinical disease manifestations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we have investigated ER stress-induced adaptive mechanisms in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD, focusing on uncovering early endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms and the crosstalk between pathological and adaptive responses in disease onset and progression. We provide evidence for the early onset of ER stress-mediated adaptive response in C9ORF72 patient-derived motoneurons (MNs), reflected by the elevated increase in GRP75 expression. These transiently increased GRP75 levels enhance ER-mitochondrial association, boosting mitochondrial function and sustaining cellular bioenergetics during the initial stage of disease, thereby counteracting early mitochondrial deficits. In C9orf72 rodent neurons, an abrupt reduction in GRP75 expression coincided with the onset of UPR, mitochondrial dysfunction and the emergence of PolyGA aggregates, which co-localize with GRP75. Similarly, the overexpression of PolyGA in WT cortical neurons or C9ORF72 patient-derived MNs led to the sequestration of GRP75 within PolyGA inclusions, resulting in mitochondrial calcium (Ca","['Pilotto F', 'Schmitz A', 'Maharjan N', 'Diab R', 'Odriozola A', 'Tripathi P', 'Yamoah A', 'Scheidegger O', 'Oestmann A', 'Dennys CN', 'Sinha Ray S', 'Rodrigo R', 'Kolb S', 'Aronica E', 'Di Santo S', 'Widmer HR', 'Charlet-Berguerand N', 'Selvaraj BT', 'Chandran S', 'Meyer K', 'Zuber B', 'Goswami A', 'Weis J', 'Saxena S']",2022,144,5,Acta Neuropathol,"Pilotto F, et al.

35990890,Suppression of the necroptotic cell death pathways improves survival in Smn <sup>2B/-</sup> mice.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a monogenic neuromuscular disease caused by low levels of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. Motor neuron degeneration is the central hallmark of the disease. However, the SMN protein is ubiquitously expressed and depletion of the protein in peripheral tissues results in intrinsic disease manifestations, including muscle defects, independent of neurodegeneration. The approved SMN-restoring therapies have led to remarkable clinical improvements in SMA patients. Yet, the presence of a significant number of non-responders stresses the need for complementary therapeutic strategies targeting processes which do not rely solely on restoring SMN. Dysregulated cell death pathways are candidates for SMN-independent pathomechanisms in SMA. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 have been widely recognized as critical therapeutic targets of necroptosis, an important form of programmed cell death. In addition, Caspase-1 plays a fundamental role in inflammation and cell death.

Biomarkers such as neurofilament light chain (NfL) may be helpful.
OBJECTIVE: To study plasma NfL levels in people with FTD syndromes and determine if plasma NfL can distinguish between FTD syndromes and phFTD.
METHODS: Plasma NfL levels were estimated using both Simoa® Quanterix HD-X™ and SR-X™ machines grouped via final diagnosis after investigation and review.
RESULTS: Fifty participants were studied: bvFTD = 20, semantic variant FTD (svFTD) = 11, non-fluent variant FTD (nfvFTD) = 9, FTD with motor neuron disease (MND) = 4, phFTD = 2, slow progressors = 3, FTD mimic = 1, mean age 67.2 (SD 8.4) years. NfL levels were significantly higher in the FTD group compared to phenocopy group (p = 0.003). Median NfL (IQR) pg/mL was comparable in the FTD syndromes: bvFTD 41.10 (50.72), svFTD 44.38 (16.61), and nfvFTD 42.61 (22.93), highest in FTD with MND 79.67 (45.32) and lowest in both phFTD 13.99 (0.79) and slow progressors 17.97 (3.62).
CONCLUSION: Plasma NfL appears to differentiate FTD syndromes and mimics. However, a lower NfL may predict a slower, but not necessarily absence of neurodegeneration, and therefore appears limited in distinguishing slow progressors from FTD phenocopies. Larger numbers of patients from all clinical groups are required to strengthen diagnostic utility.","['Ooi S', 'Patel SK', 'Eratne D', 'Kyndt C', 'Reidy N', 'Lewis C', 'Lee SCM', 'Darby D', 'Brodtmann A']",2022,89,4,J Alzheimers Dis,"Ooi S, et al.

35976476,A systematic review on the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and neurocognitive disorders in professional and varsity athletes.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review (SR) was to gather all available epidemiological evidence on former participation in any type of sport, at a professional and varsity level, as a potential risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and neurocognitive disorders (NCDs).
DESIGN: Systematic searches were performed on PubMed, the Cochrane databases, and the ISI Web of Knowledge databases. Included studies were assessed using the NOS checklist.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: All epidemiological studies reporting data on the possible association between a clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND), dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson's disease (PD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at any stage and with any clinical pattern and the former participation in any types of sport at a varsity and professional level were included.
RESULTS: Data from the 17 included studies showed a higher frequency of NDs and NCDs in former soccer and American football players. Updating the previous SR confirmed a higher frequency of ALS/MND in former soccer players. Data reported a significantly higher risk of dementia/AD in former soccer players, and of MCI in former American football players. Results also showed a significantly higher risk of PD in former soccer and American football players, and a significantly higher risk of CTE in former boxers and American football players. This SR confirmed a higher risk of NDs and NCDs in former professional/varsity athletes. However, the pathological mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear, and further high-quality studies should be performed to clarify whether the association could be sport specific.","['Bellomo G', 'Piscopo P', 'Corbo M', 'Pupillo E', 'Stipa G', 'Beghi E', 'Vanacore N', 'Lacorte E']",2022,43,12,Neurol Sci,"Bellomo G, et al.

35963713,Targeting phosphoglycerate kinase 1 with terazosin improves motor neuron phenotypes in multiple models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with heterogeneous aetiology and a complex genetic background. Effective therapies are therefore likely to act on convergent pathways such as dysregulated energy metabolism, linked to multiple neurodegenerative diseases including ALS.
METHODS: Activity of the glycolysis enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) was increased genetically or pharmacologically using terazosin in zebrafish, mouse and ESC-derived motor neuron models of ALS. Multiple disease phenotypes were assessed to determine the therapeutic potential of this approach, including axon growth and motor behaviour, survival and cell death following oxidative stress.
FINDINGS: We have found that targeting a single bioenergetic protein, PGK1, modulates motor neuron vulnerability in vivo. In zebrafish models of ALS, overexpression of PGK1 rescued motor axon phenotypes and improved motor behaviour. Treatment with terazosin, an FDA-approved compound with a known non-canonical action of increasing PGK1 activity, also improved these phenotypes. Terazosin treatment extended survival, improved motor phenotypes and increased motor neuron number in Thy1-hTDP-43 mice. In ESC-derived motor neurons expressing TDP-43
INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrate that terazosin protects motor neurons via multiple pathways, including upregulating glycolysis and rescuing stress granule formation. Repurposing terazosin therefore has the potential to increase the limited therapeutic options across all forms of ALS, irrespective of disease cause.

35955418,Deep Molecular Characterization of Milder Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patients Carrying the c.859G>C Variant in SMN2.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disorder caused by biallelic loss or pathogenic variants in the SMN1 gene. Copy number and modifier intragenic variants in SMN2, an almost identical paralog gene of SMN1, are known to influence the amount of complete SMN proteins. Therefore, SMN2 is considered the main phenotypic modifier of SMA, although genotype−phenotype correlation is not absolute. We present eleven unrelated SMA patients with milder phenotypes carrying the c.859G>C-positive modifier variant in SMN2. All were studied by a specific NGS method to allow a deep characterization of the entire SMN region. Analysis of two homozygous cases for the variant allowed us to identify a specific haplotype, Smn2-859C.1, in association with c.859G>C. Two other cases with the c.859G>C variant in their two SMN2 copies showed a second haplotype, Smn2-859C.2, in cis with Smn2-859C.1, assembling a more complex allele. We also identified a previously unreported variant in intron 2a exclusively linked to the Smn2-859C.1 haplotype (c.154-1141G>A), further suggesting that this region has been ancestrally conserved. The deep molecular characterization of SMN2 in our cohort highlights the importance of testing c.859G>C, as well as accurately assessing the SMN2 region in SMA patients to gain insight into the complex genotype−phenotype correlations and improve prognostic outcomes.","['Blasco-Pérez L', 'Costa-Roger M', 'Leno-Colorado J', 'Bernal S', 'Alias L', 'Codina-Solà M', 'Martínez-Cruz D', 'Castiglioni C', 'Bertini E', 'Travaglini L', 'Millán JM', 'Aller E', 'Sotoca J', 'Juntas R', 'Hoei-Hansen CE', 'Moreno-Escribano A', 'Guillén-Navarro E', 'Costa-Comellas L', 'Munell F', 'Boronat S', 'Rojas-García R', 'Povedano M', 'Cuscó I', 'Tizzano EF']",2022,23,15,Int J Mol Sci,"Blasco-Pérez L, et al.

35945397,A systematic review of digital technology to evaluate motor function and disease progression in motor neuron disease.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common subtype of motor neuron disease (MND). The current gold-standard measure of progression is the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALS-FRS(R)), a clinician-administered questionnaire providing a composite score on physical functioning. Technology offers a potential alternative for assessing motor progression in both a clinical and research capacity that is more sensitive to detecting smaller changes in function. We reviewed studies evaluating the utility and suitability of these devices to evaluate motor function and disease progression in people with MND (pwMND). We systematically searched Google Scholar, PubMed and EMBASE applying no language or date restrictions. We extracted information on devices used and additional assessments undertaken. Twenty studies, involving 1275 (median 28 and ranging 6-584) pwMND, were included. Sensor type included accelerometers (n = 9), activity monitors (n = 4), smartphone apps (n = 4), gait (n = 3), kinetic sensors (n = 3), electrical impedance myography (n = 1) and dynamometers (n = 2). Seventeen (85%) of studies used the ALS-FRS(R) to evaluate concurrent validity. Participant feedback on device utility was generally positive, where evaluated in 25% of studies. All studies showed initial feasibility, warranting larger longitudinal studies to compare device sensitivity and validity beyond ALS-FRS(R). Risk of bias in the included studies was high, with a large amount of information to determine study quality unclear. Measurement of motor pathology and progression using technology is an emerging, and promising, area of MND research. Further well-powered longitudinal validation studies are needed.","['Beswick E', 'Fawcett T', 'Hassan Z', 'Forbes D', 'Dakin R', 'Newton J', 'Abrahams S', 'Carson A', 'Chandran S', 'Perry D', 'Pal S']",2022,269,12,J Neurol,"Beswick E, et al.

35934980,The incidence and prevalence of motor neurone disease in South Australia.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project estimated the MND all-age global prevalence is 4.5 (95% confidence interval (CI)=4.1-5.0) per 100,000 persons and the all-age incidence of 0.78 (95% CI = 0.71-0.86) per 100,000 person-years. Whether the prevalence and incidence of MND within South Australia using registry data is in keeping with these global estimates has not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and annual incidence rates (IRs) of MND in South Australia between 2017 and 2019.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study calculating the point prevalence of MND on 31 December 2017, 2018 and 2019 utilizing data from the Australasian Motor Neurone Disease Registry (AMNDR). The annual IRs between 2017 and 2019 were calculated using population data reported in the 2016 Australian census and age-standardized rates utilized the world population from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects.
RESULTS: A total of 256 MND patients were identified, of whom 114 were alive on 31 December 2019. Based on the 2016 population of 1,676,653 persons, the estimated prevalence was 6.79 per 100,000 persons. The crude IR for the all-age South Australian population was 3.34 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 2.85-3.88). The estimated annual IRs based on those ≥20 yo were 4.98 (3.84-6.35), 3.68 (2.71-4.88), and 4.21 (3.17-5.49) per 100,000 person-years for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The crude prevalence and incidence of MND in South Australia were considerably higher than global estimates. This may reflect higher rates of the disease or higher rates of case ascertainment compared to the GBD project.","['Luker J', 'Woodman R', 'Schultz D']",2023,24,3-4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Luker J, et al.

35921225,Distinct disease trajectories in frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia: A longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The heterogeneity of cognitive and behavioural disturbances in frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), and clinical differences between FTD-MND and FTD subtypes, have been illustrated cross-sectionally. This study aimed to examine the FTD-MND disease trajectory by comparing clinical features of FTD-MND and the behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) longitudinally.
METHODS: Neuropsychological and disease severity assessments were conducted in a cohort of FTD-MND (baseline, n = 42; follow-up, n = 18) and bvFTD (baseline, n = 116; follow-up, n = 111) using a longitudinal, case-control design. Age-, sex-, and education-matched controls (n = 52) were recruited. Predictors of clinical progression were analyzed. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was undertaken to investigate the progression of brain atrophy.
RESULTS: At baseline, FTD-MND was characterized by semantic and general cognition deficits, whereas bvFTD had greater behavioural disturbances. General cognition and language deteriorated in FTD-MND when followed longitudinally. Language deficits at baseline predicted cognitive deterioration and disease progression and correlated with progressive atrophy of language regions. Further deterioration in behaviour was evident in bvFTD over time. The rate of disease progression (i.e., general cognition, semantic association, and disease severity) was significantly faster in FTD-MND than in bvFTD.
CONCLUSIONS: FTD-MND and bvFTD appear to have distinct disease trajectories, with more rapid progression in FTD-MND. Language impairments should be closely monitored in FTD-MND as potential predictors of cognitive deterioration and disease progression.","['Long Z', 'Irish M', 'Hodges JR', 'Piguet O', 'Burrell JR']",2022,29,11,Eur J Neurol,"Long Z, et al.

Health literacy relates to the skills people have to access, understand, and use health information and is influenced by motivation to engage with healthcare. We aimed to better understand how people affected by MND engage in healthcare by examining longitudinal interview data using the construct of health literacy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 persons living with MND and 15 carers recruited from a specialist MND clinic using maximum variation sampling. Transcripts were deductively coded using a framework of health literacy behaviours. The analysis used a matrix-based approach for thematic analysis of longitudinal data. People living with MND and carers sought nuanced information dependent on their priorities and attitudes. Information uptake was influenced by perceived relevancy and changed over time. Time allowed opportunity to reflect on and understand the significance of information provided. The findings indicate that persons living with MND and carers benefit when information and consultations are adapted to meet their communication needs. The results highlight the potential benefits of gaining an early understanding of and accommodating the communication needs, personal preferences, and emotional readiness for information for persons living with MND and their carers.","['Paynter C', 'Mathers S', 'Gregory H', 'Vogel AP', 'Cruice M']",2022,10,8,Healthcare (Basel),"Paynter C, et al.

35887307,Investigating the Role of GABA in Neural Development and Disease Using Mice Lacking GAD67 or VGAT Genes.,"Normal development and function of the central nervous system involves a balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Activity of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons is modulated by inhibitory signalling of the GABAergic and glycinergic systems. Mechanisms that regulate formation, maturation, refinement, and maintenance of inhibitory synapses are established in early life. Deviations from ideal excitatory and inhibitory balance, such as down-regulated inhibition, are linked with many neurological diseases, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders. In the mammalian forebrain, GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, binding to GABA receptors, opening chloride channels and hyperpolarizing the cell. We review the involvement of down-regulated inhibitory signalling in neurological disorders, possible mechanisms for disease progression, and targets for therapeutic intervention.

35860953,The impact of communication on healthcare involvement for people living with motor neurone disease and their carers: A longitudinal qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Communication and cognitive impairments are known barriers to shared decision-making. Most people diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) will develop a motor speech impairment over the disease course. Some will develop cognitive, linguistic or behavioural disturbance. Despite this, the impact of communication and cognitive impairment on personal healthcare decision-making in MND is not well known.
AIMS: This exploratory, longitudinal study aimed to capture the perspectives of people living with MND (plwMND) and family members on managing their healthcare with, or in anticipation of, a communication impairment.
METHODS & PROCEDURES: Semi-structured interviews and functional assessments were conducted with plwMND and family members over one to three time points between December 2017 and January 2020. Participants were recruited from a specialist MND clinic using a maximum variation sampling approach. Interview transcripts were analysed using trajectory data analysis: a matrix-based approach for thematic analysis of longitudinal data. The study was underpinned by interpretive descriptive methodology.
OUTCOMES & RESULTS: A total of 19 plwMND with a range of MND phenotypes and 15 family members were recruited. Disease progression and participant withdrawal resulted in attrition, however 12 plwMND and seven family members participated at all three time points. Consistent cognitive screening was not feasible, which limited the opportunity to explore the impact of cognitive change. An overarching theme 'Communicating takes effort' was identified and illustrates the efforts required to compensate for, or circumnavigate, impairments to maintain involvement in healthcare. Assistance from family and accommodation from healthcare professionals (HCPs) was needed for ongoing engagement. Where plwMND were dependent on alternative communication devices, this assistance was essential and primarily carried out by family members. Despite these efforts, the quality, quantity and accuracy of communication were sometimes compromised. Participants equated good communication with receiving good healthcare, and some expressed anxiety in the anticipation of being unable to express their needs to healthcare workers.
CONCLUSION & IMPLICATIONS: Communication impairment has a direct impact on healthcare involvement. This study demonstrates the effort required by plwMND and their carers to maintain or maximize ongoing involvement. This effort may not always be visible to HCPs. This information may prompt clinicians to consider the best ways to conduct clinical consultations to accommodate patients' abilities. Compromised communication experiences can be moderated by accommodations and support from HCPs and appropriate adjustments in the health system. Asking patients about their communication preferences and needs, allowing extra time and conducting multidisciplinary sessions are examples of such support.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject? Communication and cognitive impairments are known contributors to negative health outcomes and barriers to shared decision-making generally. The existing literature in decision-making in MND does not address the specific impact of these impairments on personal healthcare involvement for plwMND and their carers. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? This paper reports the findings of a research project that interviewed 19 plwMND and 15 carers on one to three occasions over a 26-month period to obtain their perspectives of the impact of communication on healthcare involvement. Whilst a priori the intention was to look at both communicative and cognitive decline, only the former was achieved. The effort and often 'invisible' activity undertaken to manage or maintain involvement in healthcare is identified. Communication impairment requires support and accommodation, otherwise healthcare involvement can be compromised. Results show participants may associate effective communication with good healthcare. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of the work? Clinicians may wish to use these insights from plwMND and their carers to guide adjustments to their professional practice to maximize healthcare involvement for their patients. Tailored education for different healthcare groups is needed to improve understanding of MND-related communication impairments and supportive strategies so that involvement in healthcare is not compromised.","['Paynter C', 'Mathers S', 'Gregory H', 'Vogel AP', 'Cruice M']",2022,57,6,Int J Lang Commun Disord,"Paynter C, et al.

35855239,Ethnical Disparities in Response to Edaravone in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the weakness of voluntary muscles due to the loss of motor neurons. Symptoms ultimately culminate in the form of respiratory failure due to the involvement of the diaphragm. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for this disease. Hence, supportive therapy is the only available option in most terminal cases. However, Riluzole and Edaravone (EDA) are the only two known drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating this condition. In 2017, EDA was approved for the treatment of ALS. It is hypothesized that Riluzole and EDA work via a mechanism involving antioxidants, which nullifies the oxidative stress believed to be involved in ALS. However, most studies in several countries have found a wide range of disparities in the efficacy of this drug. In this review, we aim to summarize the differences in results from epidemiological studies across 10 different countries and hypothesize the potential causes of these differences.","['Jayasinghe M', 'Jena R', 'Singhal M', 'Jain S', 'Karnakoti S', 'Silva MS', 'Kayani AMA']",2022,14,6,Cureus,"Jayasinghe M, et al.

METHODS: We performed an international multi-centre survey study in three MND clinics in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The survey was co-developed by investigators and patients with MND, and sent to patients by e-mail or postal-mail. The main topics included: patients' attitude towards remote care, participating in decentralized clinical trials, and preferences for and concerns with digital technology use.
RESULTS: In total, 332 patients with MND participated. A majority of patients indicated they would be happy to self-monitor their health from home (69%), be remotely monitored by a multidisciplinary care team (75%), and would be willing to participate in clinical trials from home (65%). Patients considered respiratory function and muscle strength most valuable for home-monitoring. The majority of patients considered the use of at least three devices/apps (75%) once a week (61%) to be acceptable for home-monitoring. Fifteen percent of patients indicated they would not wish to perform home-measurements; reporting concerns about the burden and distress of home-monitoring, privacy and data security.
CONCLUSION: Most patients with MND exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of digital technology in both care and clinical trial settings. A subgroup of patients reported concerns with home-monitoring, which should be addressed in order to improve widespread adoption of remote digital technology in clinical MND care.","['Helleman J', 'Johnson B', 'Holdom C', 'Hobson E', 'Murray D', 'Steyn FJ', 'Ngo ST', 'Henders A', 'Lokeshappa MB', 'Visser-Meily JMA', 'van den Berg LH', 'Hardiman O', 'Beelen A', 'McDermott C', 'van Eijk RPA']",2022,269,11,J Neurol,"Helleman J, et al.

Questions were mostly asked by the adult children of patients, and the most frequent question period was ""after hospital discharge."" The commonly mentioned topics related to gastrostomy and G-tube complications. Patients with ALS and their families have a high requirement for gastrostomy care and enteral feeding information. These findings indicate that there is a need to support decision-making for gastrostomy in hospitals and to provide information about G-tube care and enteral nutrition after leaving the hospital. This information and coaching/support for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and their families currently appears to be obtained mainly through online patient communities. Both hospital and home care nurses could play a greater role in providing this information.","['Chu HS', 'Tak YR']",2022,45,4,Gastroenterol Nurs,Chu HS and Tak YR.

35832068,Parkinsonian Syndromes in Motor Neuron Disease: A Clinical Study.,"BACKGROUND: Parkinsonian syndromes may rarely occur in motor neuron disease (MND). However, previous studies are heterogeneous and mostly case reports or small case series. Therefore, we aimed to identify and characterize patients with concurrent parkinsonian syndromes extracted from a cohort of 1,042 consecutive cases diagnosed with MND at a tertiary Italian Center.
METHODS: Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) was made according to current criteria. Clinical characterization included: upper and lower motor neuron disease features, typical and atypical parkinsonian features, oculomotor disorders, cognitive testing, MRI features, and, when available molecular neuroimaging. Genetic testing was carried out for major MND and PD-associated genes.
RESULTS: Parkinsonian syndromes were diagnosed in 18/1042 (1.7%) of MND patients (7 PD, 6 PSP, 3 CBS, 2 other parkinsonisms). Based on phenotype, patients could be categorized into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-parkinsonism and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)-parkinsonism clusters. Across the whole database, parkinsonism was significantly more common in PLS than in other MND phenotypes (12.1 vs. 1.1%, 
CONCLUSION: Specific patterns in MND-parkinsonism were observed, with PLS patients often showing atypical parkinsonian syndromes and ALS patients more frequently showing typical PD. Systematic clinical, genetic, and neuropathologic characterization may provide a better understanding of these phenotypes.","['Pasquini J', 'Trogu F', 'Morelli C', 'Poletti B', 'Girotti F', 'Peverelli S', 'Brusati A', 'Ratti A', 'Ciammola A', 'Silani V', 'Ticozzi N']",2022,14,,Front Aging Neurosci,"Pasquini J, et al.

35817481,Motor neuron disease mimics in practice: a case series.,"In the majority of cases of motor neuron disease (MND), diagnosis is clinical and unambiguous. However, given the gravity of the diagnosis, it is crucial that treatable mimics are differentiated accurately. We present three cases referred to our clinic with possible MND with unusual features that led to an alternative diagnosis. (1) A middle-aged man with swallowing, then speech problems and foot drop. Tongue movements were slow and electromyography (EMG) showed fibrillations/positive sharp waves. Following investigation, a tonsillar tumour involving the tongue root was identified, and the foot drop improved, suggesting unrelated common peroneal nerve palsy (related to weight loss) or lumbar radiculopathy. (2) An elderly man presenting with progressive unilateral leg weakness and localised fasciculations on EMG. Following investigation, a high-grade brain glioma was diagnosed. (3) An elderly woman presenting with progressive quadriparesis over 18 months with fibrillations and chronic denervation on EMG. Symmetrical weakness and short duration response to immunotherapy led to further serological investigation and a diagnosis of anti-GD1a motor neuropathy. She was treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab and is now in remission.","['Aitchison C', 'Romanowski C', 'Barker A', 'Jenkins T']",2022,15,7,BMJ Case Rep,"Aitchison C, et al.

35798516,"Motor Neuron Disease Systematic Multi-Arm Adaptive Randomised Trial (MND-SMART): a multi-arm, multi-stage, adaptive, platform, phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of repurposed drugs in motor neuron disease.","INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disease. Despite decades of research and clinical trials there remains no cure and only one globally approved drug, riluzole, which prolongs survival by 2-3 months. Recent improved mechanistic understanding of MND heralds a new translational era with many potential targets being identified that are ripe for clinical trials. Motor Neuron Disease Systematic Multi-Arm Adaptive Randomised Trial (MND-SMART) aims to evaluate the efficacy of drugs efficiently and definitively in a multi-arm, multi-stage, adaptive trial. The first two drugs selected for evaluation in MND-SMART are trazodone and memantine.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Initially, up to 531 participants (177/arm) will be randomised 1:1:1 to oral liquid trazodone, memantine and placebo. The coprimary outcome measures are the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) and survival. Comparisons will be conducted in four stages. The decision to continue randomising to arms after each stage will be made by the Trial Steering Committee who receive recommendations from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. The primary analysis of ALSFRS-R will be conducted when 150 participants/arm, excluding long survivors, have completed 18 months of treatment; if positive the survival effect will be inferentially analysed when 113 deaths have been observed in the placebo group. The trial design ensures that other promising drugs can be added for evaluation in planned trial adaptations. Using this novel trial design reduces time, cost and number of participants required to definitively (phase III) evaluate drugs and reduces exposure of participants to potentially ineffective treatments.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: MND-SMART was approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee on 2 October 2019. (REC reference: 19/WS/0123) Results of the study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and a summary provided to participants.

35768081,Identifying key signs of motor neurone disease in primary care: a nested case-control study using the QResearch database.,"OBJECTIVE: To confirm the symptoms and signs for motor neuron disease (MND) in the Red Flag tool; to quantify the extent to which the key symptoms and signs are associated with MND; and to identify additional factors which may be helpful within the primary care setting in recognition of possible MND and triggering timely referral to neurology specialists.
DESIGN: A nested case-control study.
SETTING: 1292 UK general practices contributing to the QResearch primary care database, linked to hospital and mortality data.
PARTICIPANTS: Baseline cohort included 16.8 million individuals aged 18 years and over without a diagnosis of MND at study entry and with more than 3 years of digitalised information available. The nested case-control data set comprised of 6437 cases of MND diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2019, matched by year of birth, gender, general practice and calendar year to 62 003 controls.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinically recognised symptoms and signs of MND prior to diagnosis and symptoms and factors which are relevant in primary care setting.
RESULTS: This study identified 17 signs and symptoms that were independently associated with MND diagnosis in a multivariable analysis. Of these, seven were new to the Red Flag tool: ataxia, dysphasia, weight loss, wheeze, hoarseness of voice, urinary incontinence and constipation. Among those from the Red Flag tool, dysarthria had the strongest association with subsequent MND (adjusted OR (aOR): 43.2 (95% CI 36.0 to 52.0)) followed by muscle fasciculations (aOR: 40.2 (95% CI 25.6 to 63.1)) and muscle wasting (aOR: 31.0 (95% CI 19.5 to 49.4)). Additionally, the associations between MND diagnosis and family history, dropped foot, focal weakness and sialorrhoea remained robust after controlling for confounders. Patients who reported symptoms indicative of damage to the lower brainstem and its connections were diagnosed sooner than those who presented with respiratory or cognitive signs.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study that has identified, confirmed and quantified the association of key symptoms and signs with MND diagnosis. In addition to known factors, the study has identified the following new factors to be independently associated with MND prior to diagnosis: ataxia, dysphasia, wheeze and hoarseness of voice. These findings may be used to improve risk stratification and earlier detection of MND in primary care.","['Mei XW', 'Burchardt J', 'Ranger TA', 'McDermott CJ', 'Radunovic A', 'Coupland C', 'Hippisley-Cox J']",2022,12,6,BMJ Open,"Mei XW, et al.

The cohort included five patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia, four with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), three with familial ALS, and one with primary lateral sclerosis. A genetic mutation was reported in nine of the thirteen motor neuron disease (MND) patients. Fatty liver disease was detected in 10 of 13 (77%) MND patients via magnetic resonance spectroscopy, with an average dome intrahepatic triacylglycerol content of 17% (range 2-63%, reference ≤5.5%). Liver ultrasound demonstrated evidence of fatty liver disease in 6 of the 13 (46%) patients, and serum liver function testing revealed significantly elevated alanine aminotransferase levels in MND patients compared to age-matched controls.

35739092,Probing TDP-43 condensation using an in silico designed aptamer.,"Aptamers are artificial oligonucleotides binding to specific molecular targets. They have a promising role in therapeutics and diagnostics but are often difficult to design. Here, we exploited the catRAPID algorithm to generate aptamers targeting TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), whose aggregation is associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. On the pathway to forming insoluble inclusions, TDP-43 adopts a heterogeneous population of assemblies, many smaller than the diffraction-limit of light. We demonstrated that our aptamers bind TDP-43 and used the tightest interactor, Apt-1, as a probe to visualize TDP-43 condensates with super-resolution microscopy. At a resolution of 10 nanometers, we tracked TDP-43 oligomers undetectable by standard approaches. In cells, Apt-1 interacts with both diffuse and condensed forms of TDP-43, indicating that Apt-1 can be exploited to follow TDP-43 phase transition. The de novo generation of aptamers and their use for microscopy opens a new page to study protein condensation.","['Zacco E', 'Kantelberg O', 'Milanetti E', 'Armaos A', 'Panei FP', 'Gregory J', 'Jeacock K', 'Clarke DJ', 'Chandran S', 'Ruocco G', 'Gustincich S', 'Horrocks MH', 'Pastore A', 'Tartaglia GG']",2022,13,1,Nat Commun,"Zacco E, et al.

35717886,In vivo hypothalamic regional volumetry across the frontotemporal dementia spectrum.,"BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a spectrum of diseases characterised by language, behavioural and motor symptoms. Among the different subcortical regions implicated in the FTD symptomatology, the hypothalamus regulates various bodily functions, including eating behaviours which are commonly present across the FTD spectrum. The pattern of specific hypothalamic involvement across the clinical, pathological, and genetic forms of FTD has yet to be fully investigated, and its possible associations with abnormal eating behaviours have yet to be fully explored.
METHODS: Using an automated segmentation tool for volumetric T1-weighted MR images, we measured hypothalamic regional volumes in a cohort of 439 patients with FTD (197 behavioural variant FTD [bvFTD]; 7 FTD with associated motor neurone disease [FTD-MND]; 99 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia [svPPA]; 117 non-fluent variant PPA [nfvPPA]; 19 PPA not otherwise specified [PPA-NOS]) and 118 age-matched controls. We compared volumes across the clinical, genetic (29 MAPT, 32 C9orf72, 23 GRN), and pathological diagnoses (61 tauopathy, 40 TDP-43opathy, 4 FUSopathy). We correlated the volumes with presence of abnormal eating behaviours assessed with the revised version of the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory (CBI-R).
RESULTS: On average, FTD patients showed 14% smaller hypothalamic volumes than controls. The groups with the smallest hypothalamic regions were FTD-MND (20%), MAPT (25%) and FUS (33%), with differences mainly localised in the anterior and posterior regions. The inferior tuberal region was only significantly smaller in tauopathies (MAPT and Pick's disease) and in TDP-43 type C compared to controls and was the only regions that did not correlate with eating symptoms. PPA-NOS and nfvPPA were the groups with the least frequent eating behaviours and the least hypothalamic involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal hypothalamic volumes are present in all the FTD forms, but different hypothalamic regions might play a different role in the development of abnormal eating behavioural and metabolic symptoms. These findings might therefore help in the identification of different underlying pathological mechanisms, suggesting the potential use of hypothalamic imaging biomarkers and the research of potential therapeutic targets within the hypothalamic neuropeptides.","['Shapiro NL', 'Todd EG', 'Billot B', 'Cash DM', 'Iglesias JE', 'Warren JD', 'Rohrer JD', 'Bocchetta M']",2022,35,,Neuroimage Clin,"Shapiro NL, et al.

35711735,Machine Learning Analysis Reveals Biomarkers for the Detection of Neurological Diseases.,"It is critical to identify biomarkers for neurological diseases (NLDs) to accelerate drug discovery for effective treatment of patients of diseases that currently lack such treatments. In this work, we retrieved genotyping and clinical data from 1,223 UK Biobank participants to identify genetic and clinical biomarkers for NLDs, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), motor neuron disease (MND), and myasthenia gravis (MG). Using a machine learning modeling approach with Monte Carlo randomization, we identified a panel of informative diagnostic biomarkers for predicting AD, PD, MND, and MG, including classical liver disease markers such as alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. A multinomial model trained on accessible clinical markers could correctly predict an NLD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88.3%. We also explored genetic biomarkers. In a genome-wide association study of AD, PD, MND, and MG patients, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated in several craniofacial disorders such as apnoea and branchiootic syndrome. We found evidence for shared genetic risk loci among NLDs, including SNPs in cancer-related genes and SNPs known to be associated with non-brain cancers such as Wilms tumor, leukemia, and colon cancer. This indicates overlapping genetic characterizations among NLDs which challenges current clinical definitions of the neurological disorders. Taken together, this work demonstrates the value of data-driven approaches to identify novel biomarkers in the absence of any known or promising biomarkers.","['Lam S', 'Arif M', 'Song X', 'Uhlén M', 'Mardinoglu A']",2022,15,,Front Mol Neurosci,"Lam S, et al.

AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adaptation (the number of needed sessions) to home-based NIV compared to an outpatient one in ALS in terms of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) improvement. NIV acceptance (mean use of ≥5 h NIV per night for three consecutive nights during the adaptation trial), adherence (night-time NIV usage for ≥150 h/month), quality of life (QoL), and caregiver burden were secondary outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 66 ALS patients with indications for NIV were involved in this randomized controlled trial (RCT): 34 underwent NIV initiation at home (home adaptation, HA) and 32 at multiple outpatient visits (outpatient adaptation, OA). Respiratory function tests were performed at baseline (the time of starting the NIV, T0) together with blood gas analysis, which was repeated at the end of adaptation (T1) and 2 (T2) and 6 (T3) months after T1. NIV adherence was measured at T2 and T3. Overnight cardiorespiratory polygraphy, Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS), and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) were performed at T0, T2, and T3.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight participants completed the study. No differences were found between groups in PaCO2 at T1 (
CONCLUSIONS: In ALS, adaptation to NIV in the patient's home is as effective as that performed in an outpatient setting regarding PaCO2, acceptance, and adherence, which emphasizes the need for further studies to understand the role of the environment concerning NIV adherence.","['Volpato E', 'Vitacca M', 'Ptacinsky L', 'Lax A', ""D'Ascenzo S"", 'Bertella E', 'Paneroni M', 'Grilli S', 'Banfi P']",2022,11,11,J Clin Med,"Volpato E, et al.

We explored client experiences of genetic counseling and diagnostic testing to inform the care of future families. Semi-structured interviews with individuals with ALS/MND/FTD or their relatives were conducted. The study was designed to include a wide variety of participants with varying disease status and abilities. Genetic counseling and diagnostic testing experiences were explored using interpretive description methodology. Bioecological theory was used as the framework for the reflexive thematic analysis. Eighteen individuals with ALS/MND/FTD or their relatives from 13 Australian families participated. Three themes were identified: sharing knowledge, (un)supportive care, and 'circumstance is everything'. Consistent with bioecological theory, one's genetic counseling experience was informed by individual circumstances, time, and proximal factors. These informed the level of information and support required in the genetic counseling process. Although some client circumstances cannot be changed, efforts could be made to enhance genetic counseling experiences by improving interactions between the client and their care team. Some clients may benefit from further discussions regarding the familial implications of genetic testing, and greater support with family communication.

Over the past three decades momentous methodological advances took place, including the emergence of high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) platforms, multi-voxel techniques, whole-brain protocols, novel head-coil designs, and a multitude of open-source imaging suites. Technological advances in MRS are complemented by important conceptual developments in MND, such as the recognition of the importance of extra-motor brain regions, multi-timepoint longitudinal study designs, assessment of asymptomatic mutation carriers, description of genotype-associated signatures, and the gradual characterisation of non-ALS MND phenotypes. We have conducted a systematic review of published MRS studies in MND to identify important emerging research trends, key lessons from pioneering studies, and stereotyped shortcomings. We also sought to highlight notable gaps in the current literature so that research priorities for future studies can be outlined. While MRS remains relatively underutilised in MND compared to other structural, diffusivity and functional imaging modalities, our review suggests that MRS can not only advance our academic understanding of MND biology, but has a multitude of practical benefits for clinical and pharmaceutical trial applications.","['Christidi F', 'Karavasilis E', 'Argyropoulos GD', 'Velonakis G', 'Zouvelou V', 'Murad A', 'Evdokimidis I', 'Rentzos M', 'Seimenis I', 'Bede P']",2022,21,3,J Integr Neurosci,"Christidi F, et al.

35594156,Mild motor impairment as prodromal state in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a new diagnostic entity.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, when viewed as a biological entity rather than a clinical syndrome, probably evolves along a continuum, with the initial clinically silent phase eventually evolving into clinically manifest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since motor neuron degeneration is incremental and cumulative over time, it stands to reason that the clinical syndrome of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is probably preceded by a prodromal state characterized by minor motor abnormalities that are initially insufficient to permit a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This prodromal period, however, is usually missed, given the invariably long delays between symptom onset and diagnostic evaluation. The Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS Study, a cohort study of pre-symptomatic gene mutation carriers, offers a unique opportunity to observe what is typically unseen. Here we describe the clinical characterization of 20 pre-symptomatic mutation carriers (in SOD1, FUS and C9orf72) whose phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease has been prospectively studied. In so doing, we observed a prodromal phase of mild motor impairment in 11 of 20 phenoconverters. Among the n = 12 SOD1 A4V mutation carriers, phenoconversion was characterized by abrupt onset of weakness, with a short (1-3.5 months) prodromal period observable in a small minority (n = 3); the observable prodrome invariably involved the lower motor neuron axis. By contrast, in all n = 3 SOD1 I113T mutation carriers, diffuse lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron signs evolved insidiously during a prodromal period that extended over a period of many years; prodromal manifestations eventually coalesced into a clinical syndrome that is recognizable as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Similarly, in all n = 3 C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation carriers, focal or multifocal manifestations of disease evolved gradually over a prodromal period of 1-2 years. Clinically manifest ALS also emerged following a prodromal period of mild motor impairment, lasting >4 years and ∼9 months, respectively, in n = 2 with other gene mutations (SOD1 L106V and FUS c.521del6). On the basis of this empirical evidence, we conclude that mild motor impairment is an observable state that precedes clinically manifest disease in three of the most common genetic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SOD1, FUS, C9orf72), and perhaps in all genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; we also propose that this might be true of non-genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As a diagnostic label, mild motor impairment provides the language to describe the indeterminate (and sometimes intermediate) transition between the unaffected state and clinically manifest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

35593746,Treatment for sialorrhea (excessive saliva) in people with motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that may cause dysphagia, as well as limb weakness, dysarthria, emotional lability, and respiratory failure. Since normal salivary production is 0.5 L to 1.5 L daily, loss of salivary clearance due to dysphagia leads to salivary pooling and sialorrhea, often resulting in distress and inconvenience to people with MND. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of treatments for sialorrhea in MND, including medications, radiotherapy and surgery.
SEARCH METHODS: On 27 August 2021, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. We checked the bibliographies of the identified randomized trials and contacted trial authors as needed. We contacted known experts in the field to identify further published and unpublished papers.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, including cross-over trials, on any intervention for sialorrhea and related symptoms, compared with each other, placebo or no intervention, in people with ALS/MND.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified four RCTs involving 110 participants with MND who were described as having intractable sialorrhea or bulbar dysfunction. A well-designed study of botulinum toxin B compared to placebo injected into the parotid and submandibular glands of 20 participants showed that botulinum toxin B may produce participant-reported improvement in sialorrhea, but the confidence interval (CI) was also consistent with no effect. Six of nine participants in the botulinum group and two of nine participants in the placebo group reported improvement (risk ratio (RR) 3.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 11.08; 1 RCT; 18 participants; low-certainty evidence). An objective measure indicated that botulinum toxin B probably reduced saliva production (in mL/5 min) at eight weeks compared to placebo (MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.07; 18 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Botulinum toxin B may have little to no effect on quality of life, measured on the Schedule for Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life direct weighting scale (SEIQoL-DW; 0-100, higher values indicate better quality of life) (MD -2.50, 95% CI -17.34 to 12.34; 1 RCT; 17 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of adverse events may be similar with botulinum toxin B and placebo (20 participants; low-certainty evidence). Trialists did not consider any serious events to be related to treatment. A randomized pilot study of botulinum toxin A or radiotherapy in 20 participants, which was at high risk of bias, provided very low-certainty evidence on the primary outcome of the Drool Rating Scale (DRS; range 8 to 39 points, higher scores indicate worse drooling) at 12 weeks (effect size -4.8, 95% CI -10.59 to 0.92; P = 0.09; 1 RCT; 16 participants). Quality of life was not measured. Evidence for adverse events, measured immediately after treatment (RR 7.00, 95% CI 1.04 to 46.95; 20 participants), and after four weeks (when two people in each group had viscous saliva) was also very uncertain. A phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 20 mg dextromethorphan hydrobromide and 10 mg quinidine sulfate (DMQ) found that DMQ may produce a participant-reported improvement in sialorrhea, indicated by a slight improvement (decrease) in mean scores for the primary outcome, the Center for Neurologic Study Bulbar Function Scale (CNS-BFS). Mean total CNS-BFS (range 21 (no symptoms) to 112 (maximum symptoms)) was 53.45 (standard error (SE) 1.07) for the DMQ treatment period and 59.31 (SE 1.10) for the placebo period (mean difference) MD -5.85, 95% CI -8.77 to -2.93) with a slight decrease in the CNS-BFS sialorrhea subscale score (range 7 (no symptoms) to 35 (maximum symptoms)) compared to placebo (MD -1.52, 95% CI -2.52 to -0.52) (1 RCT; 60 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The trial did not report an objective measure of saliva production or measure quality of life. The study was at an unclear risk of bias. Adverse events were similar to other trials of DMQ, and may occur at a similar rate as placebo (moderate-certainty evidence, 60 participants), with the most common side effects being constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and dizziness. Nausea and diarrhea on DMQ treatment resulted in one withdrawal. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of scopolamine (hyoscine), administered using a skin patch, involved 10 randomized participants, of whom eight provided efficacy data. The participants were unrepresentative of clinic cohorts under routine clinical care as they had feeding tubes and tracheostomy ventilation, and the study was at high risk of bias. The trial provided very low-certainty evidence on sialorrhea in the short term (7 days' treatment, measured on the Amyotrophic Lateral Scelerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) saliva item (P = 0.572)), and the amount of saliva production in the short term, as indicated by the weight of a cotton roll (P = 0.674), or daily oral suction volume (P = 0.69). Quality of life was not measured. Adverse events evidence was also very uncertain. One person treated with scopolamine had a dry mouth and one died of aspiration pneumonia considered unrelated to treatment.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some low-certainty or moderate-certainty evidence for the use of botulinum toxin B injections to salivary glands and moderate-certainty evidence for the use of oral dextromethorphan with quinidine (DMQ) for the treatment of sialorrhea in MND. Evidence on radiotherapy versus botulinum toxin A injections, and scopolamine patches is too uncertain for any conclusions to be drawn. Further research is required on treatments for sialorrhea. Data are needed on the problem of sialorrhea in MND and its measurement, both by participant self-report measures and objective tests. These will allow the development of better RCTs.","['James E', 'Ellis C', 'Brassington R', 'Sathasivam S', 'Young CA']",2022,5,5,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"James E, et al.

35528743,The Global Burden of Motor Neuron Disease: An Analysis of the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study.,"Up-to-date, accurate information on the disease burden of motor neuron disease (MND) is the cornerstone for evidence-based resource allocation and healthcare planning. We aimed to estimate the burden of MND globally from 1990 to 2019, as part of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factor (GBD) study. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis, pseudobulbar palsy, spinal muscular atrophy and hereditary spastic paraplegia- were included for analysis as MNDs. We measured age-standardized incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 204 countries and territories worldwide from 1990 to 2019 using spatial Bayesian analyses. The effects of age, sex, and the sociodemographic index (measures of income per capita, education, and fertility) on incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years due to MNDs were explored. According to 2019 GBD estimates, there were ~268,673 [95% uncertainty interval (UI), 213,893-310,663] prevalent cases and 63,700 (95% UI, 57,295-71,343) incident cases of MND worldwide. In 2019, MND caused 1,034,606 (95% UI, 979,910-1,085,401) DALYs and 39,081 (95% UI, 36,566-41,129) deaths worldwide. The age-standardized rates of prevalence, incidence, death, and DALYs for MNDs in 2019 were 3.37 (95% UI, 2.9-3.87) per 100,000 people, 0.79 (95% UI, 0.72-0.88) per 100,000 people, 0.48 (95% UI, 0.45-0.51) per 100,000 people, and 12.66 (95% UI, 11.98-13.29) per 100,000 people, respectively. The global prevalence and deaths due to MND in 2019 were increased (1.91% [95% UI, 0.61-3.42] and 12.39% [95% UI, 5.81-19.27], respectively) compared to 1990, without significant change in incidence. More than half of the prevalence and deaths due to MND occurred in three high-income regions (North America, Western Europe, and Australasia). In most cases, the prevalence, incidence, and DALYs of MNDs were high in regions with high sociodemographic index; however, in high-income East Asia, these were relatively low compared to similar sociodemographic index groups elsewhere. The burden of MND increased between 1990 and 2019. Its expected increase in the future highlights the importance of global and national healthcare planning using more objective evidence. Geographical heterogeneity in the MND burden might suggest the influences of sociodemographic status and genetic background in various regions.","['Park J', 'Kim JE', 'Song TJ']",2022,13,,Front Neurol,"Park J, et al.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide an outline of the challenges encountered during the last 12 months of life and the role of the specialised multidisciplinary team in managing the challenges that may arise.
DISCUSSION: While MND remains rare overall, it is likely that most general practitioners (GPs) will encounter at least one patient with MND during their career. An understanding of the complexity of this group of diseases, including management in the terminal phase, is important given the GP is a valuable member of the multidisciplinary team.","['Brennan FP', 'Gardiner MD', 'Narasimhan M']",2022,51,5,Aust J Gen Pract,"Brennan FP, et al.

METHODS: People with MND and healthcare staff were constructively involved in co-designing the intervention program in four phases adapted from the MRC framework: 1. A detailed need assessment phase where 30 participants shared their perceptions of psychosocial needs 2. Developing the intervention module (synthesis of narrative review, identified needs); 3. Feasibility testing of the intervention program among seven participants; 4. Feedback from participants on the feasibility (acceptance, practicality adaptation). The study adopted an exploratory research design.
RESULTS: Intervention program of nine sessions, addressing psychosocial challenges through the different stages of progression of the illness and ways to handle the challenges, specific to the low resource settings, was developed and was found to be feasible. People with MND and families who participated in the feasibility study shared the perceived benefit through feedback interviews.
CONCLUSION: MND has changing needs and challenges. Intervention programme was found to be feasible to be implemented among larger group to establish efficacy.","['Thomas PT', 'Warrier MG', 'Arun S', 'Bhuvaneshwari B', 'Vengalil S', 'Nashi S', 'Preethish-Kumar V', 'Polavarapu K', 'Rajaram P', 'Nalini A']",2023,19,2,Chronic Illn,"Thomas PT, et al.

35468848,Impaired signaling for neuromuscular synaptic maintenance is a feature of Motor Neuron Disease.,"A central event in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease (MND) is the loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), yet the mechanisms that lead to this event in MND remain to be fully elucidated. Maintenance of the NMJ relies upon neural agrin (n-agrin) which, when released from the nerve terminal, activates the postsynaptic Muscle Specific Kinase (MuSK) signaling complex to stabilize clusters of acetylcholine receptors. Here, we report that muscle from MND patients has an increased proportion of slow fibers and muscle fibers with smaller diameter. Muscle cells cultured from MND biopsies failed to form large clusters of acetylcholine receptors in response to either non-MND human motor axons or n-agrin. Furthermore, levels of expression of MuSK, and MuSK-complex components: LRP4, Caveolin-3, and Dok7 differed between muscle cells cultured from MND patients compared to those from non-MND controls. To our knowledge, this is the first time a fault in the n-agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling pathway has been identified in muscle from MND patients. Our results highlight the n-agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target to prolong muscle function in MND.","['Ding Q', 'Kesavan K', 'Lee KM', 'Wimberger E', 'Robertson T', 'Gill M', 'Power D', 'Chang J', 'Fard AT', 'Mar JC', 'Henderson RD', 'Heggie S', 'McCombe PA', 'Jeffree RL', 'Colditz MJ', 'Hilliard MA', 'Ng DCH', 'Steyn FJ', 'Phillips WD', 'Wolvetang EJ', 'Ngo ST', 'Noakes PG']",2022,10,1,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Ding Q, et al.

35456351,Survival in Korean Patients with Frontotemporal Dementia Syndrome: Association with Behavioral Features and Parkinsonism.,"We investigated the survival time of each clinical syndrome of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and the impacts of behavioral and motor features on survival of FTD. A total of 216 patients with FTD [82 behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), 78 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), 43 non-fluent/agrammatic variant PPA (nfvPPA), 13 FTD-motor neuron disease (MND)] were enrolled from 16 centers across Korea. Behaviors and parkinsonism were assessed using the Frontal Behavioral Inventory and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model was applied for analysis of the effect of behavioral and motor symptoms on survival, after controlling vascular risk factors and cancer. An overall median survival of FTD was 12.1 years. The survival time from onset was shortest for FTD-MND and longest for svPPA. The median survival time of patients with bvFTD was unavailable but likely comparable to that of patients with nfvPPA. In the bvFTD group, negative behavioral symptoms and akinetic rigidity were significantly associated with survival. In the nfvPPA group, the presence of dysarthria had a negative impact on survival. These findings provide useful information to clinicians planning for care.","['Jung NY', 'Park KH', 'Seo SW', 'Kim HJ', 'Roh JH', 'Lee JH', 'Park KW', 'Kwon JC', 'Jeong JH', 'Yoon SJ', 'Kim BC', 'Park YH', 'Kim S', 'Jang JW', 'Youn YC', 'Yang DW', 'Choi SH', 'Na DL', 'Kim EJ']",2022,11,8,J Clin Med,"Jung NY, et al.

35431812,Breached Barriers: A Scoping Review of Blood-Central Nervous System Barrier Pathology in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have implicated changes in the blood-central nervous system barriers (BCNSB) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The objective of this scoping review is to synthesize the current evidence for BCNSB structure and functional abnormalities in ALS studies and propose how BCNSB pathology may impact therapeutic development.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science, from inception to November 2021 and limited to entries in English language. Simplified search strategy included the terms ALS/motor neuron disease and [BCNSB or blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB)]. Henceforth, BCNSB is used as a term that is inclusive of the BBB and BSCB. Four independent reviewers conducted a title and abstract screening, hand-searched the reference lists of review papers, and performed a full text review of eligible studies. Included studies were original peer-reviewed full text publications, evaluating the structure and function of the BCNSB in preclinical models of ALS, clinical ALS, or postmortem human ALS tissue. There was no restriction on study design. The four reviewers independently extracted the data.
RESULTS: The search retrieved 2,221 non-duplicated articles and 48 original studies were included in the synthesis. There was evidence that the integrity of the BCNSB is disrupted throughout the course of the disease in rodent models, beginning prior to symptom onset and detectable neurodegeneration. Increased permeability, pharmacoresistance with upregulated efflux transporters, and morphological changes in the supporting cells of the BCNSB, including pericytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells were observed in animal models. BCNSB abnormalities were also demonstrated in postmortem studies of ALS patients. Therapeutic interventions targeting BCNSB dysfunction were associated with improved motor neuron survival in animal models of ALS.
CONCLUSION: BCNSB structural and functional abnormalities are likely implicated in ALS pathophysiology and may occur upstream to neurodegeneration. Promising therapeutic strategies targeting BCNSB dysfunction have been tested in animals and can be translated into ALS clinical trials.","['Mirian A', 'Moszczynski A', 'Soleimani S', 'Aubert I', 'Zinman L', 'Abrahao A']",2022,16,,Front Cell Neurosci,"Mirian A, et al.

35430894,Extreme Sawtooth-Sign in Motor Neuron Disease (MND) suggests Laryngeal Resistance to Forced Expiratory Airflow.,"OBJECTIVE: The impact of laryngeal dysfunction on airflow has not been well characterized in motor neuron disease (MND). This study aimed to detect and characterize extreme airflow oscillations informally observed during volitional cough and forced vital capacity (FVC) tasks in individuals with MND who demonstrated neurolaryngeal impairments including reduced speed and extent of vocal fold abduction compared to healthy controls during volitional cough expulsion. The extreme airflow oscillations in the MND group, when viewed as a flow-volume loop, appeared similar to the ""sawtooth-sign."" If the airflow oscillations are periodic in a range similar to phonation, they may reflect reduced laryngeal patency.
METHODS: Volitional cough and FVC airflow data (3 trials each) from 12 participants with MND with bulbar/laryngeal involvement (3 F; ages 45-76) and 12 healthy controls (6 F; ages 41-68) were analyzed for periodicity. Percent and absolute durations of periodicity of the flow oscillations were calculated by an algorithm applied to the airflow signals. In addition, the frequency, magnitude, and kurtosis of the periodic airflow oscillations were described and compared between groups.
RESULTS: In both volitional cough and FVC trials, the percent of airflow periodicity during forced expiration was significantly higher (
CONCLUSIONS: The significantly larger-magnitude, lower-kurtosis, and more prominent presence of sawtooth-like airflow periodicity within a frequency range similar to phonation observed in individuals with MND with neurolaryngeal impairments suggests glottic airflow resistance during forced expiration.","['Britton D', 'Kain A', 'Chen YW', 'Wiedrick J', 'Benditt JO', 'Merati AL', 'Graville D']",2023,132,3,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"Britton D, et al.

METHODS: Seventy-two patients with clinical manifestations of motor neuron disease (MND) were analysed. According to whether they had concomitant rheumatic immune disease or rheumatic immune antibody abnormalities, they were divided into an MND group (33 patients) and an immune-related MND syndrome group (39 patients). Another 10 healthy adults were selected as the control group. All individuals were examined by CCM.
RESULTS: For Langerhans cell(LC) density, the area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC)curve was 0.8, the best cut-off was 67.7 cells/mm2, the sensitivity was 79.5%, and the specificity was 72.7%. For inferior whorl length (IWL), the area under the ROC curve was 0.674, the best cut-off was 17.41 mm/mm
CONCLUSION: The LC density and IWL are ideal for distinguishing MND from immune-related MND syndrome.

35394668,Hirayama disease: Nosological classification and neuroimaging clues for diagnosis.,"Hirayama disease (HD) is a rare, benign, and nonprogressive motor neuron disease (MND) affecting the upper limbs. It usually presents with weakness and amyotrophy in a single upper extremity with an insidious onset between adolescence and the third decade of life. Since its description in 1959, HD has been known under several names and eponyms in Europe and in Asian countries probably due to its heterogeneous clinical features. Thus, the unclear nosological classification makes challenging the differential diagnosis between HD and other neuromuscular conditions, such as MNDs. However, apart from the nosological difficulties and the lack of evidence-based guideline for diagnosis, the neuroimaging is the mainstay for the diagnosis of HD. Indeed, the specific findings on cervical flexion MRI usually lead to a prompt diagnosis. Here, we reviewed the nosological classifications of HD and its neuroimaging features. Also, we report a case of a 18-year-old boy who presented to our Clinic complaining of muscle weakness of the left distal upper limb without other neurological signs. The cervical MRI, in the neutral position, revealed a high T2 signal intensity in the C5-C7 cervical myelomeres as well as the loss of cervical lordosis, whereas, during neck flexion, it showed the anterior displacement of the posterior dura ad the post-gadolinium T1-weighted imaging enhancement of the posterior epidural plexus. These findings are typical for HD allowing the diagnosis as well as the differential diagnosis from other neuromuscular diseases.","['Iacono S', 'Di Stefano V', 'Gagliardo A', 'Cannella R', 'Virzì V', 'Pagano S', 'Lupica A', 'Romano M', 'Brighina F']",2022,32,4,J Neuroimaging,"Iacono S, et al.

35362219,Burden and benefit-A mixed methods study of informal Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis caregivers in Ireland and the Netherlands.,"OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a systemic and terminal disorder of the central nervous system which causes paralysis of limbs, respiratory and bulbar muscles, impacting on physical, communication, cognitive and behavioural functioning. Informal caregivers play a key role in the care of people with ALS. This study aimed to explore experiences of burden along with any beneficial aspects of caregiving in ALS. An understanding of both burden and benefit is important to support the informal caregiver and the person with ALS.
METHODS/DESIGN: This exploratory mixed methods study characterizes two groups of informal caregivers in Ireland (n = 76) and the Netherlands (n = 58). In a semi-structured interview, quantitative data were collected in the form of standardized measures assessing psychological distress, quality of life and burden. Qualitative data were collected from an open ended question, in which caregivers identified positive aspects in their caregiving experience. These data types were purposefully mixed in the analysis and interpretation stages, to provide a greater depth of evidence through diverse research lenses.
RESULTS: The caregiver cohorts were predominantly female (69%) and spouse/partners (84%) of the person with ALS. Greater levels of self-assessed burden were found among the caregivers in the Netherlands (p < 0.05), and higher levels of quality of life among the cohort from Ireland (p < 0.05). Themes generated through qualitative analysis identified caregiver satisfaction, ability to meet the patient's needs and the (re) evaluation of meaning and existential aspects of life as positive aspects of caregiving. Existential factors were identified frequently by the caregivers in Ireland, and personal satisfaction and meeting their care recipient's needs by caregivers in the Netherlands. Three percent of all respondents reported there was nothing positive about caregiving.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we suggest that both burden and the presence of positive factors should be evaluated and monitored. The possibility of concurrent positive and challenging experiences should be considered in the design and delivery of supportive interventions for informal caregivers.","['Kennedy P', 'Conroy É', 'Heverin M', 'Leroi I', 'Beelen A', 'van den Berg L', 'Hardiman O', 'Galvin M']",2022,37,5,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,"Kennedy P, et al.

35355246,Sports and trauma as risk factors for Motor Neurone Disease: New Zealand case-control study.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess whether sports, physical trauma and emotional trauma are associated with motor neurone disease (MND) in a New Zealand case-control study (2013-2016).
METHODS: In total, 321 MND cases and 605 population controls were interviewed collecting information on lifetime histories of playing sports, physical trauma (head injury with concussion, spine injury) and emotional trauma (14 categories). ORs were estimated using logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, smoking status, alcohol consumption and mutually adjusting for all other exposures.
RESULTS: Head injury with concussion ≥3 years before diagnosis was associated with MND (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09), with strongest associations for two (OR 4.01, 95% CI: 1.82-8.86), and three or more (OR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.00-5.45) head injuries. Spine injury was not associated with MND (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.48-1.36). Compared to never playing sports, engaging in sports throughout childhood and adulthood increased MND risk (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.01-3.25), as was more than 12 years playing football/soccer (OR 2.35, 95% CI: 1.19-4.65). Reporting emotionally traumatic events in more than three categories was associated with MND (OR 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17-3.03), with physical childhood abuse the only specific emotional trauma associated with MND (OR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.14-2.90), particularly for those reporting longer abuse duration (OR
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the evidence that repeated head injury with concussion, playing sports in general, and playing football (soccer) in particular, are associated with an increased risk of MND. Emotional trauma, that is physical abuse in childhood, may also play a role.","['Chen GX', 'Douwes J', 'van den Berg LH', 'Glass B', 'McLean D', ""'t Mannetje AM""]",2022,145,6,Acta Neurol Scand,"Chen GX, et al.

35330435,A Clinical Decision Support System for the Prediction of Quality of Life in ALS.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Motor Neuron Disease (MND), is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease. As ALS is currently incurable, the aim of the treatment is mainly to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life (QoL). We designed a prototype Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) to alert clinicians when a person with ALS is experiencing low QoL in order to inform and personalise the support they receive. Explainability is important for the success of a CDSS and its acceptance by healthcare professionals. The aim of this work isto announce our prototype (C-ALS), supported by a first short evaluation of its explainability. Given the lack of similar studies and systems, this work is a valid proof-of-concept that will lead to future work. We developed a CDSS that was evaluated by members of the team of healthcare professionals that provide care to people with ALS in the ALS/MND Multidisciplinary Clinic in Dublin, Ireland. We conducted a user study where participants were asked to review the CDSS and complete a short survey with a focus on explainability. Healthcare professionals demonstrated some uncertainty in understanding the system's output. Based on their feedback, we altered the explanation provided in the updated version of our CDSS.

35318275,Occupational exposures to pesticides and other chemicals: a New Zealand motor neuron disease case-control study.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess associations between occupational exposures to pesticides and other chemicals and motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: A population-based case-control study that included 319 MND cases (64% male/36% female) recruited through the New Zealand MND Association complemented with hospital discharge data, and 604 controls identified from the Electoral Roll. For each job held, a questionnaire collected information on 11 exposure categories (dust, fibres, tobacco smoke, fumes, gas, fumigants, oils/solvents, acids/alkalis, pesticides, other chemicals and animals/animal products). ORs were estimated using logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activities, head/spine injury and other occupational exposures.
RESULTS: Two exposure categories were associated with increased MND risks: pesticides (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.48) and fumigants (OR 3.98, 95% CI 1.81 to 8.76), with risks increasing with longer exposure duration (p<0.01). Associations were also observed for: methyl bromide (OR 5.28, 95% CI 1.63 to 17.15), organochlorine insecticides (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 9.07), organophosphate insecticides (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.40 to 6.94), pyrethroid insecticides (OR 6.38, 95% CI 1.13 to 35.96), inorganic (copper) fungicides (OR 4.66, 95% CI 1.53 to 14.19), petrol/diesel fuel (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.93) and unspecified solvents (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.99). In women, exposure to textile fibres (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.13 to 5.50), disinfectants (OR 9.66, 95% CI 1.29 to 72.44) and cleaning products (OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.64 to 7.59) were also associated with MND; this was not observed in men (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.48; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.84; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.56, respectively).

Separate lines of evidence suggest that synapses and astrocytes play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying ALS. Given that astrocytes make specialised contacts with some synapses, called tripartite synapses, we hypothesise that tripartite synapses could act as the fulcrum of disease in ALS. To test this hypothesis, we have performed an extensive microscopy-based investigation of synapses and tripartite synapses in the spinal cord of ALS model mice and post-mortem human tissue from ALS cases.

35287783,Interventions targeting psychological well-being for motor neuron disease carers: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review considers interventions designed to improve the psychological well-being (PWB) of carers of people with motor neuron disease (MND) using quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods studies, and aimed to (1) summarize current research, (2) assess the quality of evidence, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.
METHOD: Mixed-methods systematic review (MMSR) was conducted based on Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods reviews and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
RESULTS: Thirteen papers met the inclusion criteria, including 12 studies (six mixed-methods, four quantitative, and two qualitative). Four studies described randomized controlled trials, seven detailed uncontrolled longitudinal studies with a single treatment group and a pre-post design, and one was an observational survey. Critical appraisal of the studies revealed a wide range of weaknesses in the quantitative and/or qualitative methodologies. Due to the heterogeneity of interventions, outcomes, and measurements, a narrative and convergent approach to data synthesis was employed. While a minority of studies demonstrated some benefits to hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of PWB, the interpretability of these data was limited by methodological problems.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This MMSR highlighted a paucity of quality research regarding interventions for the PWB of MND carers. Although some benefits to PWB were demonstrated, most studies suffered from substantial methodological problems, rendering the overall evidence base low. High-quality and carefully designed studies are a priority to enable effective development and testing of much-needed interventions targeting the PWB for MND carers.","['Cafarella P', 'Effing T', 'Chur-Hansen A']",2022,,,Palliat Support Care,"Cafarella P, et al.

35281498,Dopamine Transporter Imaging for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration With Motor Neuron Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a clinical syndrome with pathological heterogeneity, including Pick's disease and trans-activating response region (TAR) DNA-binding protein with a molecular mass of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP). A previous study reported abnormal findings on dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging in 30% of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in FTLD. However, the previous study did not consider the pathological heterogeneity of FTD regarding the pathomechanism leading to abnormal DAT findings. Recently, abnormal DAT findings were reported in two patients with FTLD with motor neuron disease (MND), of which FTLD-TDP type B was the most common pathological presentation. This study investigated the DAT findings of patients with a final diagnosis of FTLD-MND to determine the frequency of occurrence of DAT abnormalities in FTLD-MND.
METHODS: Twenty patients with FTLD who underwent DAT single photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) were screened, and six patients with a final diagnosis of FTLD-MND were ultimately included. The patients' DAT-SPECT findings were analyzed visually and quantitatively. Neuronal loss and astrogliosis in brain regions (substantia nigra, caudate, and putamen) that could possibly affect DAT findings were evaluated in the three pathologically confirmed cases.
RESULT: All six patients with FTLD-MND showed abnormal visual DAT-SPECT findings. In addition, in a quantitative assessment, the specific binding ratio in the striatum calculated by the Southampton method was below the lower limit of the 95% prediction interval of the healthy controls by age in all the present cases. Interestingly, three of the six patients showed abnormal findings on DAT-SPECT more than half a year before the onset of MND. Neuronal loss and astrogliosis in brain regions that may affect DAT findings were observed in three pathologically confirmed cases.
CONCLUSION: Dopamine transporter single photon emission computed tomography revealed abnormal findings in patients with FTLD-MND, which may manifest even before the onset of MND symptoms. We believe that the possibility of future development of MND should be considered if DAT-SPECT shows abnormal findings in FTLD.","['Kobayashi R', 'Kawakatsu S', 'Ohba M', 'Morioka D', 'Kanoto M', 'Otani K']",2022,16,,Front Neurosci,"Kobayashi R, et al.

35268254,Affection of Respiratory Muscles in ALS and SMA.,"Respiratory dysfunction is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in motor neuron disease (MND). However, classical volitional measures of respiratory function in these patients are impeded by, e.g., bulbar paralysis or progressive disability. Diaphragm ultrasound imaging might be a valuable tool for assessing respiratory impairment, albeit different ultrasound measures have not been systematically investigated in adult MND patients and, in particular, have not yet been comparatively applied in adult patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We hypothesized that in contrast to ALS patients, adult SMA patients show a relative sparing of diaphragm function. We retrospectively analyzed diaphragm ultrasound imaging data of 40 patients with ALS and 23 patients with SMA in comparison to a multitude of established parameters of respiratory function. Indeed, ALS patients showed more severe diaphragm dysfunction than adult SMA patients, however, diaphragm dysfunction was also common in adult SMA patients. Notably, dynamic measures of diaphragm function rather than thickness measures were impaired in ALS compared to SMA. Thus, diaphragm ultrasound imaging might be a useful tool to evaluate respiratory dysfunction in adult MND patients. Future larger and prospective studies are needed to validate our initial findings.","['Hermann W', 'Langner S', 'Freigang M', 'Fischer S', 'Storch A', 'Günther R', 'Hermann A']",2022,11,5,J Clin Med,"Hermann W, et al.

35260199,A neurodegenerative disease landscape of rare mutations in Colombia due to founder effects.,"BACKGROUND: The Colombian population, as well as those in other Latin American regions, arose from a recent tri-continental admixture among Native Americans, Spanish invaders, and enslaved Africans, all of whom passed through a population bottleneck due to widespread infectious diseases that left small isolated local settlements. As a result, the current population reflects multiple founder effects derived from diverse ancestries.
METHODS: We characterized the role of admixture and founder effects on the origination of the mutational landscape that led to neurodegenerative disorders under these historical circumstances. Genomes from 900 Colombian individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [n = 376], frontotemporal lobar degeneration-motor neuron disease continuum (FTLD-MND) [n = 197], early-onset dementia not otherwise specified (EOD) [n = 73], and healthy participants [n = 254] were analyzed. We examined their global and local ancestry proportions and screened this cohort for deleterious variants in disease-causing and risk-conferring genes.
RESULTS: We identified 21 pathogenic variants in AD-FTLD related genes, and PSEN1 harbored the majority (11 pathogenic variants). Variants were identified from all three continental ancestries. TREM2 heterozygous and homozygous variants were the most common among AD risk genes (102 carriers), a point of interest because the disease risk conferred by these variants differed according to ancestry. Several gene variants that have a known association with MND in European populations had FTLD phenotypes on a Native American haplotype. Consistent with founder effects, identity by descent among carriers of the same variant was frequent.
CONCLUSIONS: Colombian demography with multiple mini-bottlenecks probably enhanced the detection of founder events and left a proportionally higher frequency of rare variants derived from the ancestral populations. These findings demonstrate the role of genomically defined ancestry in phenotypic disease expression, a phenotypic range of different rare mutations in the same gene, and further emphasize the importance of inclusiveness in genetic studies.","['Acosta-Uribe J', 'Aguillón D', 'Cochran JN', 'Giraldo M', 'Madrigal L', 'Killingsworth BW', 'Singhal R', 'Labib S', 'Alzate D', 'Velilla L', 'Moreno S', 'García GP', 'Saldarriaga A', 'Piedrahita F', 'Hincapié L', 'López HE', 'Perumal N', 'Morelo L', 'Vallejo D', 'Solano JM', 'Reiman EM', 'Surace EI', 'Itzcovich T', 'Allegri R', 'Sánchez-Valle R', 'Villegas-Lanau A', 'White CL', 'Matallana D', 'Myers RM', 'Browning SR', 'Lopera F', 'Kosik KS']",2022,14,1,Genome Med,"Acosta-Uribe J, et al.

35250791,Multidimensional Clinical Assessment in Frontotemporal Dementia and Its Spectrum in Latin America and the Caribbean: A Narrative Review and a Glance at Future Challenges.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the third most common form of dementia across all age groups and is a leading cause of early-onset dementia. The Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) includes a spectrum of diseases that are classified according to their clinical presentation and patterns of neurodegeneration. There are two main types of FTD: behavioral FTD variant (bvFTD), characterized by a deterioration in social function, behavior, and personality; and primary progressive aphasias (PPA), characterized by a deficit in language skills. There are other types of FTD-related disorders that present motor impairment and/or parkinsonism, including FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The FTD and its associated disorders present great clinical heterogeneity. The diagnosis of FTD is based on the identification through clinical assessments of a specific clinical phenotype of impairments in different domains, complemented by an evaluation through instruments, i.e., tests and questionnaires, validated for the population under study, thus, achieving timely detection and treatment. While the prevalence of dementia in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is increasing rapidly, there is still a lack of standardized instruments and consensus for FTD diagnosis. In this context, it is important to review the published tests and questionnaires adapted and/or validated in LAC for the assessment of cognition, behavior, functionality, and gait in FTD and its spectrum. Therefore, our paper has three main goals. First, to present a narrative review of the main tests and questionnaires published in LAC for the assessment of FTD and its spectrum in six dimensions: (i) Cognitive screening; (ii) Neuropsychological assessment divided by cognitive domain; (iii) Gait assessment; (iv) Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms; (v) Functional assessment; and (vi) Global Rating Scale. Second, to propose a multidimensional clinical assessment of FTD in LAC identifying the main gaps. Lastly, it is proposed to create a LAC consortium that will discuss strategies to address the current challenges in the field.","['Henríquez F', 'Cabello V', 'Baez S', 'de Souza LC', 'Lillo P', 'Martínez-Pernía D', 'Olavarría L', 'Torralva T', 'Slachevsky A']",2021,12,,Front Neurol,"Henríquez F, et al.

However, many sporadic cases of ALS and other debilitating neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are believed to be caused by environmental factors, subject to considerable debate and requiring intensive research. A common pathology associated with MND development involves progressive mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in motor neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to apoptosis. Consequent degeneration of skeletal and respiratory muscle cells can lead to death from respiratory failure. A significant number of MND cases present with cancers and liver and lung pathology.

35235032,Use of Pharyngeal High-Resolution Manometry to Evaluate Dysphagia in Adults with Motor Neurone Disease: A Scoping Review.,"There has been a recent shift towards proactive dysphagia intervention in motor neurone disease (MND) to maintain physiological reserve. Pharyngeal high-resolution manometry (PHRM) can quantify swallowing pathophysiology to inform and evaluate proactive dysphagia intervention. This study aims to explore the current use of PHRM as a dysphagia evaluation in adults with MND. A scoping review based on the Joanna Briggs Framework was completed. Four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science core) were searched (inception to March 2021) by two independent researchers. Data were analysed according to (i) PHRM protocol and analysis methods and the feasibility of same, (ii) swallow biomechanics data and (iii) dysphagia intervention effects as measured by PHRM. Six studies with 78 people with MND (PwMND) were included. There was considerable variation in PHRM protocol and analysis methods. Five studies reported a 100% completion rate and three studies reported no adverse events. Swallow biomechanics data were reported across all studies. The effects of sensory stimulation, increased bolus consistency, effortful swallow and cricopharyngeal myotomy were evaluated using PHRM with 20 PwMND across four studies with varying effects. Literature on the use of PHRM in PwMND is limited. Variability in PHRM methods restricts comparison of metrics. PHRM appears to be a feasible tool for PwMND. PHRM can provide novel swallow physiology data in PwMND and quantify discrete effects of compensatory and surgical dysphagia interventions not detectable by videofluoroscopy or FEES. Further research on the effects of proactive dysphagia intervention as measured by PHRM is required.","['Diver EM', 'Regan J']",2022,37,6,Dysphagia,Diver EM and Regan J.

Through this retrospective study, we describe the spectrum of neuromuscular diseases evaluated through a paediatric to adult neuromuscular transition program in a tertiary academic centre in Canada, and also the speciality supports needed for these patients. 126 patients were transitioned during the study period. The most common clinical diagnosis was muscle disease (44.4%), followed by neuropathy (27.8%), neuromuscular junction disorders (15.9%) and motor neuron disease (MND) (10.3%). The majority of cases were inherited neuromuscular disorders (66.6%); 58.3% had a genetically confirmed diagnosis. Cardiac and respiratory abnormalities were encountered in 8.7% and 27.7% and transitioning was required for 39.8% and 35.7% respectively. Scoliosis was seen in 30.2% of patients; 9.5% underwent spine surgery. Patients with MND had maximum requirements for self-care (46.2% of MND) and a mobility device for ambulation was required in 69.2% of MND. We observed a wide range of systemic issues requiring the services of endocrinology, gastroenterology, speech and language pathology and psychiatry.

35194965,Muscle cells of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients secrete neurotoxic vesicles.,"BACKGROUND: The cause of the motor neuron (MN) death that drives terminal pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains unknown, and it is thought that the cellular environment of the MN may play a key role in MN survival. Several lines of evidence implicate vesicles in ALS, including that extracellular vesicles may carry toxic elements from astrocytes towards MNs, and that pathological proteins have been identified in circulating extracellular vesicles of sporadic ALS patients. Because MN degeneration at the neuromuscular junction is a feature of ALS, and muscle is a vesicle-secretory tissue, we hypothesized that muscle vesicles may be involved in ALS pathology.
METHODS: Sporadic ALS patients were confirmed to be ALS according to El Escorial criteria and were genotyped to test for classic gene mutations associated with ALS, and physical function was assessed using the ALSFRS-R score. Muscle biopsies of either mildly affected deltoids of ALS patients (n = 27) or deltoids of aged-matched healthy subjects (n = 30) were used for extraction of muscle stem cells, to perform immunohistology, or for electron microscopy. Muscle stem cells were characterized by immunostaining, RT-qPCR, and transcriptomic analysis. Secreted muscle vesicles were characterized by proteomic analysis, Western blot, NanoSight, and electron microscopy. The effects of muscle vesicles isolated from the culture medium of ALS and healthy myotubes were tested on healthy human-derived iPSC MNs and on healthy human myotubes, with untreated cells used as controls.
RESULTS: An accumulation of multivesicular bodies was observed in muscle biopsies of sporadic ALS patients by immunostaining and electron microscopy. Study of muscle biopsies and biopsy-derived denervation-naïve differentiated muscle stem cells (myotubes) revealed a consistent disease signature in ALS myotubes, including intracellular accumulation of exosome-like vesicles and disruption of RNA-processing. Compared with vesicles from healthy control myotubes, when administered to healthy MNs the vesicles of ALS myotubes induced shortened, less branched neurites, cell death, and disrupted localization of RNA and RNA-processing proteins. The RNA-processing protein FUS and a majority of its binding partners were present in ALS muscle vesicles, and toxicity was dependent on the expression level of FUS in recipient cells. Toxicity to recipient MNs was abolished by anti-CD63 immuno-blocking of vesicle uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: ALS muscle vesicles are shown to be toxic to MNs, which establishes the skeletal muscle as a potential source of vesicle-mediated toxicity in ALS.","['Le Gall L', 'Duddy WJ', 'Martinat C', 'Mariot V', 'Connolly O', 'Milla V', 'Anakor E', 'Ouandaogo ZG', 'Millecamps S', 'Lainé J', 'Vijayakumar UG', 'Knoblach S', 'Raoul C', 'Lucas O', 'Loeffler JP', 'Bede P', 'Behin A', 'Blasco H', 'Bruneteau G', 'Del Mar Amador M', 'Devos D', 'Henriques A', 'Hesters A', 'Lacomblez L', 'Laforet P', 'Langlet T', 'Leblanc P', 'Le Forestier N', 'Maisonobe T', 'Meininger V', 'Robelin L', 'Salachas F', 'Stojkovic T', 'Querin G', 'Dumonceaux J', 'Butler Browne G', 'González De Aguilar JL', 'Duguez S', 'Pradat PF']",2022,13,2,J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle,"Le Gall L, et al.

35190461,Developing an intrasalivary gland botox service for patients receiving long-term non-invasive ventilation at home: a single-centre experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Sialorrhoea is a debilitating symptom in neurological disease and there is a growing literature for the use of intrasalivary gland Botulinum Toxin (botox) injections in its management. However, provision of intrasalivary gland botox remains inconsistent and sialorrhoea is often poorly controlled in motor neuron disease (MND).Sialorrhoea in association with bulbar dysfunction can cause intolerance of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and respiratory infection, so its treatment is critical within a home ventilation service (HVS).This treatment can also be used to enable tracheostomy cuff deflation to facilitate weaning from ventilation. We report on the outcomes of intrasalivary gland botox in our HVS.
METHODS: In 2015, we set up an intrasalivary gland botox service for patients under our HVS. Under ultrasound guidance, we injected submandibular gland(SMG), parotid gland (PG) or both.
RESULTS: 109 intrasalivary gland botox procedures were performed in 72 patients. Diagnostic groups included MND 32Cerebral Palsy 8 and Weaning 14. Glands injected were, SMG (6%), PG (47%) and both (47%). The majority (84%) received the Dysport preparation with mean dose 273 units. 94% were ultrasound guided. 81% of injections resulted in a positive treatment effect, with 47% patients requesting repeat injections. Complications were angioedema (0.9%) and worsening dysphagia (3.7% following SMG injection). Mean survival following treatment was 40 months with 53% patients still alive.
CONCLUSIONS: Intrasalivary gland botox appears effective across a range of neurological conditions requiring long-term NIV with few complications. Dysphagia may be an important complication of SMG injection. A randomised controlled trial may help establish the evidence base.","['Harbottle J', 'Carlin H', 'Payne-Doris T', 'Tedd HMI', 'de Soyza A', 'Messer B']",2022,9,1,BMJ Open Respir Res,"Harbottle J, et al.

Patients 1 and 2 were a 43-year-old man with a spinal-onset of ALS and a 37-year-old woman with a bulbar-onset of ALS, who died due to respiratory complications five and two years after disease onset, respectively. Patient 3 is a 52-year-old woman, with a two-year history of a probable primary lateral sclerosis, and a frontotemporal dysfunction. Imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and nerve conduction and small fiber tests were normal in all. Genetic testing for ALS was negative in the two patients tested.

35129626,Home-monitoring of vital capacity in people with a motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Home-monitoring of spirometry has the potential to improve care for patients with a motor neuron disease (MND) by enabling early detection of respiratory dysfunction and reducing travel burden. Our aim was to evaluate the validity and feasibility of home-monitoring vital capacity (VC) in patients with MND.
METHODS: We included 33 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy or primary lateral sclerosis who completed a 12-week home-monitoring protocol, consisting of 4-weekly unsupervised home assessments of VC and a functional rating scale. At baseline, during a home visit, patients/caregivers were trained in performing a VC test, and the investigator performed a supervised VC test, which was repeated at final follow-up during a second home visit. Validity of the unsupervised VC tests was evaluated by the differences between supervised and unsupervised VC tests, and through Bland-Altman 95% limits-of-agreement. Feasibility was assessed by means of a survey of user-experiences.
RESULTS: The 95% limits-of-agreement were [- 14.3; 11.7] %predicted VC, and 88% of unsupervised VC tests fell within 10%predicted of supervised VC. 88% of patients experienced VC testing as easy and not burdensome, however, 15% patients did not think their VC test was performed as well as in the clinic. 94% of patients would like home-monitoring of VC in MND care.
DISCUSSION: Unsupervised VC testing at home, with prior face-to-face training, is a valid and time-efficient method for the remote monitoring of respiratory function, and well-accepted by patients with MND and their caregivers.","['Helleman J', 'Bakers JNE', 'Pirard E', 'van den Berg LH', 'Visser-Meily JMA', 'Beelen A']",2022,269,7,J Neurol,"Helleman J, et al.

Concurrent ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is also a well-known phenomenon. Examples of other primary disorders mimicking ALS or ALS-FTD have been reported in the literature and recognition of these entities is important to ensure proper clinical management. We present here an unusual case of an 86-year-old male patient, clinically diagnosed with ALS and severe cognitive impairment thought to be due to FTD. Postmortem neuropathological examination of his brain and spinal cord did not reveal the typical findings of ALS or FTD. Rather, it revealed multiple non-ALS pathologies including argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), cerebrovascular disease, and Alzheimer's type pathology.

35062955,Qualitative measures that assess functional disability and quality of life in ALS.,"BACKGROUND: Selection of appropriate trial endpoints and outcome measures is particularly important in rare disease and rapidly progressing disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) where the challenges to conducting clinical trials, are substantial: patient and disease heterogeneity, limited understanding of exact disease pathophysiology, and lack of robust and available biomarkers. To address these challenges in ALS, the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised version (ALSFRS-R) was developed and has become a key primary endpoint in ALS clinical trials to assess functional disability and disease progression, often replacing survival as a primary outcome. However, increased understanding of the ALS disease journey and improvements in assistive technology for ALS patients have exposed issues with the ALSFRS-R, including non-linearity, multidimensionality and floor and ceiling effects that could challenge its continued utility as a primary outcome measure in ALS clinical trials. Recently, other qualitative scale measures of functioning disability have been developed to help address these issues. With this in mind, we conducted a literature search aimed at identifying both established and promising new measures for potential use in clinical trials.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, and the reference sections of key studies to identify papers that discussed qualitative measures of functional status for potential use in ALS studies. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov to identify functional status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures that have been used in ALS interventional studies.
RESULTS: In addition to the ALSFRS-R, we identified several newer qualitative scales including ALSFRS-EX, ALS-MITOS, CNS-BFS, DALS-15, MND-DS, and ROADS. Strengths and limitations of each measure were identified and discussed, along with their potential to act as a primary or secondary outcome to assess patient functional status in ALS clinical trials.
CONCLUSION: This paper serves as a reference guide for researchers deciding which qualitative measures to use as endpoints in their ALS clinical trials to assess functional status. This paper also discusses the importance of including ALS HRQoL and ALS cognitive screens in future clinical trials to assess the value of a new ALS therapy more comprehensively.","['Hartmaier SL', 'Rhodes T', 'Cook SF', 'Schlusser C', 'Chen C', 'Han S', 'Zach N', 'Murthy V', 'Davé S']",2022,20,1,Health Qual Life Outcomes,"Hartmaier SL, et al.

35042540,Functional characterisation of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis risk locus GPX3/TNIP1.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex, late-onset, neurodegenerative disease with a genetic contribution to disease liability. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ten risk loci to date, including the TNIP1/GPX3 locus on chromosome five. Given association analysis data alone cannot determine the most plausible risk gene for this locus, we undertook a comprehensive suite of in silico, in vivo and in vitro studies to address this.
METHODS: The Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) pipeline and five tools (conditional and joint analysis (GCTA-COJO), Stratified Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (S-LDSC), Polygenic Priority Scoring (PoPS), Summary-based Mendelian Randomisation (SMR-HEIDI) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) analyses) were used to perform bioinformatic integration of GWAS data (N
RESULTS: SMR analyses implicated both TNIP1 and GPX3 (p < 1.15 × 10
CONCLUSIONS: These results support GPX3 as a lead ALS risk gene in this locus, with more data needed to confirm/reject a role for TNIP1. This has implications for understanding disease mechanisms (GPX3 acts in the same pathway as SOD1, a well-established ALS-associated gene) and identifying new therapeutic approaches. Few previous examples of in-depth investigations of risk loci in ALS exist and a similar approach could be applied to investigate future expected GWAS findings.","['Restuadi R', 'Steyn FJ', 'Kabashi E', 'Ngo ST', 'Cheng FF', 'Nabais MF', 'Thompson MJ', 'Qi T', 'Wu Y', 'Henders AK', 'Wallace L', 'Bye CR', 'Turner BJ', 'Ziser L', 'Mathers S', 'McCombe PA', 'Needham M', 'Schultz D', 'Kiernan MC', 'van Rheenen W', 'van den Berg LH', 'Veldink JH', 'Ophoff R', 'Gusev A', 'Zaitlen N', 'McRae AF', 'Henderson RD', 'Wray NR', 'Giacomotto J', 'Garton FC']",2022,14,1,Genome Med,"Restuadi R, et al.

35042241,Astrocytes display cell autonomous and diverse early reactive states in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rapidly progressive and fatal disease. Although astrocytes are increasingly recognized contributors to the underlying pathogenesis, the cellular autonomy and uniformity of astrocyte reactive transformation in different genetic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remain unresolved. Here we systematically examine these issues by using highly enriched and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes from patients with VCP and SOD1 mutations. We show that VCP mutant astrocytes undergo cell-autonomous reactive transformation characterized by increased expression of complement component 3 (C3) in addition to several characteristic gene expression changes. We then demonstrate that isochronic SOD1 mutant astrocytes also undergo a cell-autonomous reactive transformation, but that this is molecularly distinct from VCP mutant astrocytes. This is shown through transcriptome-wide analyses, identifying divergent gene expression profiles and activation of different key transcription factors in SOD1 and VCP mutant human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes. Finally, we show functional differences in the basal cytokine secretome between VCP and SOD1 mutant human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes. Our data therefore reveal that reactive transformation can occur cell autonomously in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis astrocytes and with a striking degree of early molecular and functional heterogeneity when comparing different disease-causing mutations. These insights may be important when considering astrocyte reactivity as a putative therapeutic target in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","['Taha DM', 'Clarke BE', 'Hall CE', 'Tyzack GE', 'Ziff OJ', 'Greensmith L', 'Kalmar B', 'Ahmed M', 'Alam A', 'Thelin EP', 'Garcia NM', 'Helmy A', 'Sibley CR', 'Patani R']",2022,145,2,Brain,"Taha DM, et al.

35006266,Safety and Effectiveness of Long-term Intravenous Administration of Edaravone for Treatment of Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"IMPORTANCE: Intravenous edaravone is approved as a disease-modifying drug for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but evidence for efficacy is limited to short-term beneficial effects shown in the MCI186-ALS19 study in a subpopulation in which efficacy was expected.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of intravenous edaravone therapy for patients with ALS in a real-world clinical setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, propensity score-matched cohort study conducted between June 2017 and March 2020 at 12 academic ALS referral centers associated with the German Motor Neuron Disease Network. Of 1440 patients screened, 738 were included in propensity score matching. Final analyses included 324 patients with ALS comprising 194 patients who started intravenous edaravone treatment (141 received ≥4 consecutive treatment cycles; 130 matched) and 130 propensity score-matched patients with ALS receiving standard therapy. All patients had probable or definite ALS according to the El Escorial criteria, with disease onset between December 2012 and April 2019. Subgroups were defined by applying the MCI186-ALS19 study inclusion criteria to evaluate whether patients would have been considered eligible (EFAS) or ineligible (non-EFAS).
EXPOSURES: Intravenous edaravone plus riluzole vs riluzole only.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient characteristics and systematic safety assessment for patients who received at least 1 dose of intravenous edaravone. Effectiveness assessment of edaravone was conducted among patients who received at least 4 treatment cycles compared with propensity score-matched patients with ALS who received only standard therapy. Primary outcome was disease progression measured by decrease in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score. Secondary outcomes were survival probability, time to ventilation, and change in disease progression before vs during treatment. To account for the matched design, patients receiving edaravone and their corresponding matched controls were regarded as related samples in disease progression analyses; stratification for propensity score quintiles was used for survival probability and time to ventilation analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 194 patients started intravenous edaravone treatment; 125 (64%) were male, and the median age was 57.5 years (IQR, 50.7-63.8 years). Potential adverse effects were observed in 30 cases (16%), most notably infections at infusion sites and allergic reactions. Disease progression among 116 patients treated for a median of 13.9 months (IQR, 8.9-13.9 months) with edaravone did not differ from 116 patients treated for a median of 11.2 months (IQR, 6.4-20.0 months) with standard therapy (ALSFRS-R points/month, -0.91 [95% CI, -0.69 to -1.07] vs -0.85 [95% CI, -0.66 to -0.99]; P = .37). No significant differences were observed in the secondary end points of survival probability, time to ventilation, and change in disease progression. Similarly, outcomes between patients treated with edaravone and matched patients did not differ within the EFAS and non-EFAS subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study using propensity score matching found that, although long-term intravenous edaravone therapy for patients with ALS was feasible and mainly well tolerated, it was not associated with any disease-modifying benefit. Intravenous edaravone may not provide a clinically relevant additional benefit compared with standard therapy alone.","['Witzel S', 'Maier A', 'Steinbach R', 'Grosskreutz J', 'Koch JC', 'Sarikidi A', 'Petri S', 'Günther R', 'Wolf J', 'Hermann A', 'Prudlo J', 'Cordts I', 'Lingor P', 'Löscher WN', 'Kohl Z', 'Hagenacker T', 'Ruckes C', 'Koch B', 'Spittel S', 'Günther K', 'Michels S', 'Dorst J', 'Meyer T', 'Ludolph AC', 'German Motor Neuron Disease Network (MND-NET)']",2022,79,2,JAMA Neurol,"Witzel S, et al.

34988617,MRI of the intraspinal nerve roots in patients with chronic inflammatory neuropathies: abnormalities correlate with clinical phenotypes.,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) are caused by inflammatory changes of peripheral nerves. It is unknown if the intra-spinal roots are also affected. This MRI study systematically visualized intra-spinal nerve roots, i.e., the ventral and dorsal roots, in patients with CIDP, MMN and motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in 40 patients with CIDP, 27 with MMN and 34 with MND. All patients underwent an MRI scan of the cervical intra-spinal roots. We systematically measured intra-spinal nerve root sizes bilaterally in the transversal plane at C5, C6 and C7 level. We calculated mean nerve root sizes and compared them between study groups and between different clinical phenotypes using a univariate general linear model.
RESULTS: Patients with MMN and CIDP with a motor phenotype had thicker ventral roots compared to patients with CIDP with a sensorimotor phenotype (p = 0.012), while patients with CIDP with a sensory phenotype had thicker dorsal roots compared to patients with a sensorimotor phenotype (p = 0.001) and with MND (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: We here show changes in the morphology of intra-spinal nerve roots in patients with chronic inflammatory neuropathies, compatible with their clinical phenotype.","['van Rosmalen MHJ', 'Froeling M', 'Mandija S', 'Hendrikse J', 'van der Pol WL', 'Stephan Goedee H']",2022,269,6,J Neurol,"van Rosmalen MHJ, et al.

34965490,Genetic architecture of motor neuron diseases.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are rare and frequently fatal neurological disorders in which motor neurons within the brainstem and spinal cord regions slowly die. MNDs are primarily caused by genetic mutations, and > 100 different mutant genes in humans have been discovered thus far. Given the fact that many more MND-related genes have yet to be discovered, the growing body of genetic evidence has offered new insights into the diverse cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of MNDs. This search may aid in the selection of potential candidate genes for future investigation and, eventually, may open the door to novel interventions to slow down disease progression. In this review paper, we have summarized detailed existing research findings of different MNDs, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), spinal bulbar muscle atrophy (SBMA) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in relation to their complex genetic architecture.","['Chaudhary R', 'Agarwal V', 'Rehman M', 'Kaushik AS', 'Mishra V']",2022,434,,J Neurol Sci,"Chaudhary R, et al.

34940878,Motor neuron disease risk and magnetic field exposures.,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have investigated magnetic field exposure and the risks of motor neuron disease (MND). Meta-analyses have found positive associations but a causal relationship has not been established.
AIMS: To investigate the risks of MND and occupational exposure to magnetic fields in a large UK cohort.
METHODS: Mortality of 37 986 employees of the former Central Electricity Generating Board of England and Wales was investigated for the period 1987-2018. Employees were first employed in the period 1942-82 and were still in employment on the 1 November, 1987. Detailed calculations enabled estimates to be made of magnetic field exposures. Observed deaths were compared with expected numbers based on mortality rates for the general population of England and Wales and Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios (relative risks) for categories of lifetime, lagged (distant) and lugged (recent) magnetic field exposure.
RESULTS: Mortality from MND in the total cohort was similar to national rates (observed 69, expected 71.3, SMR 97, 95% CI 76-122). There were no statistically significant trends of risks increasing with lifetime, recent or distant magnetic field exposure, although positive associations were observed for some categories of recent exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: The study did not find that the cohort had elevated risks of MND as a consequence of occupational lifetime exposure to magnetic fields, although a possible role for recent exposures could usefully be investigated in other datasets.","['Sorahan T', 'Nichols L']",2022,72,3,Occup Med (Lond),Sorahan T and Nichols L.

34939123,Simultaneous Isolation of High-Quality RNA and DNA From Postmortem Human Central Nervous System Tissues for Omics Studies.,"Multi-omics approaches are increasingly being adopted to understand the complex networks underlying disease. The coisolation of high-quality nucleotides from affected tissues is paramount for the parallel analysis of transcriptomic, genomic, and epigenomic data sets. Although nucleotides extracted from postmortem central nervous system (CNS) tissue are widely used in the study of neurodegenerative disease, assessment of methods for the simultaneous isolation of DNA and RNA is limited. Herein, we describe a strategy for the isolation of high-quality DNA and RNA from postmortem human tissue from 7 CNS regions. Motor cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, occipital cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord tissues were obtained from 22 individuals diagnosed with motor neuron disease (MND) and 13 neurologically normal controls (n = 245 tissues). We demonstrated that the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA kit consistently isolated DNA and RNA of high yield and quality from all 6 brain regions. Importantly, phenol-chloroform-based extraction was required to isolate high-yield RNA from spinal cord. RNA sequencing using RNA extracted from 6 CNS regions (n = 60) generated high-quality transcriptomes. Hierarchical clustering of data from motor cortex, using an MND susceptibility gene panel and marker genes of disease-associated microglia, demonstrated that MND-specific gene expression signatures could be detected in the transcriptome data.","['Grima N', 'Henden L', 'Watson O', 'Blair IP', 'Williams KL']",2022,81,2,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Grima N, et al.

34921446,Risk factors to mortality and causes of death in frontotemporal dementia: An Australian perspective.,"OBJECTIVES: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common cause of dementia in younger people. There is less information known about risk factors to mortality such as the type of symptom onset and cause of death in this group.
METHOD: This was a retrospective file review of inpatients with FTD admitted to a tertiary neuropsychiatry unit located in Australia from 1992 to 2014. Mortality information including linkage of names and causes of death were obtained from the Australian Institute Health and Welfare National Death Index.
RESULTS: One hundred inpatients were diagnosed with FTD, including behavioural-variant, language-variant FTDs and FTD-motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). Mean age was 52.8 years (SD = 10, range 31-76 years). Sixty-seven of them had died at linkage. Median survival of the sample was 10.5 years and FTD-MND had the shortest survival, 3.5 years. Increasing age of onset and FTD-MND were found to be significant predictors of association for mortality. Compared to the general population, having a FTD had an 8× increased risk of death. Females had double the standardised mortality ratio compared to males.
DISCUSSION: This study provides important prognostic information for people diagnosed with FTD living in Australia. It highlights the importance of obtaining a definitive diagnosis as early as possible for future planning. More investigation into the relationship of symptom onset type and sex differences in FTD is required.","['Loi SM', 'Tsoukra P', 'Chen Z', 'Wibawa P', 'Eratne D', 'Kelso W', 'Walterfang M', 'Velakoulis D']",2021,37,2,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,"Loi SM, et al.

34920148,Prevalence of Sialorrhea Among Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative motor neuron disease (MND), and sialorrhea is a known symptom in patients with ALS, which may cause a social embarrassment and discomfort. However, people do not pay attention to sialorrhea up to now. This study is aimed at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of the pooled prevalence of sialorrhea in ALS patients all around the world and raising awareness of salivation.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases to obtain the comprehensive literatures which reported the prevalence of sialorrhea. We used AHRQ and NOS to evaluate the literature quality. Subgroup analyses were performed based on screening instruments and severity of sialorrhea. At the meantime, sensitivity analyses was also conducted to identify the source of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A total of 17 eligible studies which included 21 groups of data reported prevalence of sialorrhea. The pooled prevalence of sialorrhea among ALS patients was 30.8% (95% CI: 20.0%-44.2%). For studies using ALSFRS-R, direct questioning, postal survey, and ALSSoL average and ALSFRS-R, the pooled prevalence of sialorrhea was 22.7%, 25.8%, 29.8% and 52.0% respectively. According to the severity of sialorrhea, the prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe sialorrhea were 25.1%, 11.2%, and 10.5%, respectively. And none of the studies alone had a significant effect on the overall prevalence of sialorrhea after we eliminated each study separately in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Sialorrhea is a relatively common symptom in ALS patients with a comparatively high prevalence. In our study, we found that the prevalence of sialorrhea in ALS patients is relatively higher than the results based on direct questioning or postal survey. Therefore, we deduced that sialorrhea should be evaluated by more complex professional assessment scales to improve the quality of life and improve early prognosis of disease.","['Wang Y', 'Yang X', 'Han Q', 'Liu M', 'Zhou C']",2022,63,4,J Pain Symptom Manage,"Wang Y, et al.

34918006,Protein network analysis to prioritize key genes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease, progressive nature characterizes by loss of both upper and lower motor neuron functions. One of the major challenge is to understand the mechanism of ALS multifactorial nature. We aimed to explore some key genes related to ALS through bioinformatics methods for its therapeutic intervention. Here, we applied a systems biology approach involving experimentally validated 148 ALS-associated proteins and construct ALS protein-protein interaction network (ALS-PPIN). The network was further statistically analysed and identified bottleneck-hubs. The network is also subjected to identify modules which could have similar functions. The interaction between the modules and bottleneck-hubs provides the functional regulatory role of the ALS mechanism. The ALS-PPIN demonstrated a hierarchical scale-free nature.

34901853,Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a systematic review and perspective.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease. Despite decades of clinical trials, effective disease-modifying drugs remain scarce. To understand the challenges of trial design and delivery, we performed a systematic review of Phase II, Phase II/III and Phase III amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinical drug trials on trial registries and PubMed between 2008 and 2019. We identified 125 trials, investigating 76 drugs and recruiting more than 15 000 people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. About 90% of trials used traditional fixed designs. The limitations in understanding of disease biology, outcome measures, resources and barriers to trial participation in a rapidly progressive, disabling and heterogenous disease hindered timely and definitive evaluation of drugs in two-arm trials. Innovative trial designs, especially adaptive platform trials may offer significant efficiency gains to this end. We propose a flexible and scalable multi-arm, multi-stage trial platform where opportunities to participate in a clinical trial can become the default for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","['Wong C', 'Stavrou M', 'Elliott E', 'Gregory JM', 'Leigh N', 'Pinto AA', 'Williams TL', 'Chataway J', 'Swingler R', 'Parmar MKB', 'Stallard N', 'Weir CJ', 'Parker RA', 'Chaouch A', 'Hamdalla H', 'Ealing J', 'Gorrie G', 'Morrison I', 'Duncan C', 'Connelly P', 'Carod-Artal FJ', 'Davenport R', 'Reitboeck PG', 'Radunovic A', 'Srinivasan V', 'Preston J', 'Mehta AR', 'Leighton D', 'Glasmacher S', 'Beswick E', 'Williamson J', 'Stenson A', 'Weaver C', 'Newton J', 'Lyle D', 'Dakin R', 'Macleod M', 'Pal S', 'Chandran S']",2021,3,4,Brain Commun,"Wong C, et al.

34882833,"Normal aging, motor neurone disease, and Alzheimer's disease are characterized by cortical changes in inflammatory cytokines.","The role of increased brain inflammation in the development of neurodegenerative diseases is unclear. Here, we have compared cytokine changes in normal aging, motor neurone disease (MND), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). After an initial analysis, six candidate cytokines, interleukin (IL)- 4, 5, 6, 10, macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1α, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, showing greatest changes were assayed in postmortem frozen human superior frontal gyri (n = 12) of AD patients, aging and young adult controls along with the precentral gyrus (n = 12) of MND patients. Healthy aging was associated with decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 and FGF-2 levels. AD prefrontal cortex was associated with increased levels of IL-4, IL-5, and FGF-2, with the largest increase seen for FGF-2. Notwithstanding differences in the specific frontal lobe gyrus sampled, MND patients' primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) was associated with increased levels of IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and FGF-2 compared to the aging prefrontal cortex (superior frontal gyrus). Immunocytochemistry showed that FGF-2 is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in normal aging prefrontal cortex, AD prefrontal cortex, and MND motor cortex. We report that healthy aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases have different cortical inflammatory signatures that are characterized by increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and call into question the view that increased inflammation underlies the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.","['Tennakoon A', 'Katharesan V', 'Musgrave IF', 'Koblar SA', 'Faull RLM', 'Curtis MA', 'Johnson IP']",2022,100,2,J Neurosci Res,"Tennakoon A, et al.

34875472,Phenotypic categorisation of individual subjects with motor neuron disease based on radiological disease burden patterns: A machine-learning approach.,"Motor neuron disease is an umbrella term encompassing a multitude of clinically heterogeneous phenotypes. The early and accurate categorisation of patients is hugely important, as MND phenotypes are associated with markedly different prognoses, progression rates, care needs and benefit from divergent management strategies. The categorisation of patients shortly after symptom onset is challenging, and often lengthy clinical monitoring is needed to assign patients to the appropriate phenotypic subgroup. In this study, a multi-class machine-learning strategy was implemented to classify 300 patients based on their radiological profile into diagnostic labels along the UMN-LMN spectrum. A comprehensive panel of cortical thickness measures, subcortical grey matter variables, and white matter integrity metrics were evaluated in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Additional exploratory analyses were also carried out using discriminant function analyses (DFA). Excellent classification accuracy was achieved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the testing cohort (93.7%) using the MLP model, but poor diagnostic accuracy was detected for primary lateral sclerosis (43.8%) and poliomyelitis survivors (60%). Feature importance analyses highlighted the relevance of white matter diffusivity metrics and the evaluation of cerebellar indices, cingulate measures and thalamic radiation variables to discriminate MND phenotypes. Our data suggest that radiological data from single patients may be meaningfully interpreted if large training data sets are available and the provision of diagnostic probability outcomes may be clinically useful in patients with short symptom duration. The computational interpretation of multimodal radiology datasets herald viable diagnostic, prognostic and clinical trial applications.","['Bede P', 'Murad A', 'Lope J', 'Li Hi Shing S', 'Finegan E', 'Chipika RH', 'Hardiman O', 'Chang KM']",2022,432,,J Neurol Sci,"Bede P, et al.

We conducted a cross-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 29,612 patients with ALS and 122,656 controls, which identified 15 risk loci. When combined with 8,953 individuals with whole-genome sequencing (6,538 patients, 2,415 controls) and a large cortex-derived expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) dataset (MetaBrain), analyses revealed locus-specific genetic architectures in which we prioritized genes either through rare variants, short tandem repeats or regulatory effects. ALS-associated risk loci were shared with multiple traits within the neurodegenerative spectrum but with distinct enrichment patterns across brain regions and cell types. Of the environmental and lifestyle risk factors obtained from the literature, Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal role for high cholesterol levels. The combination of all ALS-associated signals reveals a role for perturbations in vesicle-mediated transport and autophagy and provides evidence for cell-autonomous disease initiation in glutamatergic neurons.","['van Rheenen W', 'van der Spek RAA', 'Bakker MK', 'van Vugt JJFA', 'Hop PJ', 'Zwamborn RAJ', 'de Klein N', 'Westra HJ', 'Bakker OB', 'Deelen P', 'Shireby G', 'Hannon E', 'Moisse M', 'Baird D', 'Restuadi R', 'Dolzhenko E', 'Dekker AM', 'Gawor K', 'Westeneng HJ', 'Tazelaar GHP', 'van Eijk KR', 'Kooyman M', 'Byrne RP', 'Doherty M', 'Heverin M', 'Al Khleifat A', 'Iacoangeli A', 'Shatunov A', 'Ticozzi N', 'Cooper-Knock J', 'Smith BN', 'Gromicho M', 'Chandran S', 'Pal S', 'Morrison KE', 'Shaw PJ', 'Hardy J', 'Orrell RW', 'Sendtner M', 'Meyer T', 'Başak N', 'van der Kooi AJ', 'Ratti A', 'Fogh I', 'Gellera C', 'Lauria G', 'Corti S', 'Cereda C', 'Sproviero D', ""D'Alfonso S"", 'Sorarù G', 'Siciliano G', 'Filosto M', 'Padovani A', 'Chiò A', 'Calvo A', 'Moglia C', 'Brunetti M', 'Canosa A', 'Grassano M', 'Beghi E', 'Pupillo E', 'Logroscino G', 'Nefussy B', 'Osmanovic A', 'Nordin A', 'Lerner Y', 'Zabari M', 'Gotkine M', 'Baloh RH', 'Bell S', ""Vourc'h P"", 'Corcia P', 'Couratier P', 'Millecamps S', 'Meininger V', 'Salachas F', 'Mora Pardina JS', 'Assialioui A', 'Rojas-García R', 'Dion PA', 'Ross JP', 'Ludolph AC', 'Weishaupt JH', 'Brenner D', 'Freischmidt A', 'Bensimon G', 'Brice A', 'Durr A', 'Payan CAM', 'Saker-Delye S', 'Wood NW', 'Topp S', 'Rademakers R', 'Tittmann L', 'Lieb W', 'Franke A', 'Ripke S', 'Braun A', 'Kraft J', 'Whiteman DC', 'Olsen CM', 'Uitterlinden AG', 'Hofman A', 'Rietschel M', 'Cichon S', 'Nöthen MM', 'Amouyel P', 'SLALOM Consortium', 'PARALS Consortium', 'SLAGEN Consortium', 'SLAP Consortium', 'Traynor BJ', 'Singleton AB', 'Mitne Neto M', 'Cauchi RJ', 'Ophoff RA', 'Wiedau-Pazos M', 'Lomen-Hoerth C', 'van Deerlin VM', 'Grosskreutz J', 'Roediger A', 'Gaur N', 'Jörk A', 'Barthel T', 'Theele E', 'Ilse B', 'Stubendorff B', 'Witte OW', 'Steinbach R', 'Hübner CA', 'Graff C', 'Brylev L', 'Fominykh V', 'Demeshonok V', 'Ataulina A', 'Rogelj B', 'Koritnik B', 'Zidar J', 'Ravnik-Glavač M', 'Glavač D', 'Stević Z', 'Drory V', 'Povedano M', 'Blair IP', 'Kiernan MC', 'Benyamin B', 'Henderson RD', 'Furlong S', 'Mathers S', 'McCombe PA', 'Needham M', 'Ngo ST', 'Nicholson GA', 'Pamphlett R', 'Rowe DB', 'Steyn FJ', 'Williams KL', 'Mather KA', 'Sachdev PS', 'Henders AK', 'Wallace L', 'de Carvalho M', 'Pinto S', 'Petri S', 'Weber M', 'Rouleau GA', 'Silani V', 'Curtis CJ', 'Breen G', 'Glass JD', 'Brown RH', 'Landers JE', 'Shaw CE', 'Andersen PM', 'Groen EJN', 'van Es MA', 'Pasterkamp RJ', 'Fan D', 'Garton FC', 'McRae AF', 'Davey Smith G', 'Gaunt TR', 'Eberle MA', 'Mill J', 'McLaughlin RL', 'Hardiman O', 'Kenna KP', 'Wray NR', 'Tsai E', 'Runz H', 'Franke L', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Van Damme P', 'van den Berg LH', 'Veldink JH']",2021,53,12,Nat Genet,"van Rheenen W, et al.

34823271,Concurrent tau pathologies in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology.,"AIMS: Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) can have pathologic accumulation of multiple proteins, including tau and TDP-43. This study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of concurrent tau pathology in FTLD with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP).
METHODS: The study included 146 autopsy-confirmed cases of FTLD-TDP and 55 cases of FTLD-TDP with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). Sections from the basal forebrain were screened for tau pathology with phosphorylated-tau immunohistochemistry. For cases with tau pathology on the screening section, additional brain sections were studied to establish a diagnosis. Genetic analysis of C9orf72, GRN and MAPT was performed on select cases.
RESULTS: We found 72 cases (36%) with primary age-related tauopathy (PART), 85 (42%) with ageing-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), 45 (22%) with argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) and 2 cases (1%) with corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Patients with ARTAG or AGD were significantly older than those without these comorbidities. One of the patients with FTLD-TDP and CBD had C9orf72 mutation and relatively mild tau pathology, consistent with incidental CBD.
CONCLUSION: The coexistence of TDP-43 and tau pathologies was relatively common, particularly PART and ARTAG. Although rare, patients with FTLD can have multiple neurodegenerative proteinopathies. The absence of TDP-43-positive astrocytic plaques may suggest that CBD and FTLD-TDP were independent disease processes in the two patients with both tau and TDP-43 pathologies. It remains to be determined if mixed cases represent a unique disease process or two concurrent disease processes in an individual.","['Koga S', 'Zhou X', 'Murakami A', 'Fernandez De Castro C', 'Baker MC', 'Rademakers R', 'Dickson DW']",2022,48,2,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Koga S, et al.

34816988,Associations of motor neuron disease research productivity and socioeconomic factors in Southeast Asia: a bibliometric analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Scientific productivity on motor neuron disease (MND) research has been hypothesized to be low in Southeast Asia (SEA).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the scientific productivity of SEA countries on MND and the associations between research metric indices and various country-specific socioeconomic parameters.
METHODS: We searched electronic databases for relevant articles from SEA on MND from the earliest indexed record to June 30, 2020. We obtained the following research productivity indices: bibliometric (number of publications in journals with impact factor (IF) and Scopus citations) and altmetric indices (PlumX metrics). We also collected data from published literature and reliable sources on the following socioeconomic variables: population, gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, %GDP allocated for research and development (R&D) and the number of neurologists per country.
RESULTS: We included 196 articles that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis studies comprised the majority of the articles (n = 112; 57.1%). The top three countries in terms of the numbers of publications in journals with IF and in PlumX metrics were Singapore (n = 129), Malaysia (n = 26), and Thailand (n = 18). GDP per capita, %GDP for R&D and number of neurologists per one million population had strong positive correlations with the bibliometric and altmetric indices.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that although the scientific productivity of MND research in SEA has been low, it is continuously growing. This also emphasizes the imperative to improve economic indices and the number of neurologists in SEA to enhance scientific output on MND.","['Turalde CWR', 'Espiritu AI', 'Jamora RDG']",2021,79,11,Arq Neuropsiquiatr,"Turalde CWR, et al.

34774034,Exploring the enablers and barriers to social prescribing for people living with long-term neurological conditions: a focus group investigation.,"BACKGROUND: People living with Long Term Neurological Conditions (LTNCs) value peer support and social activities. Psychological support and wellbeing enables them to manage their condition. Social prescribing is a formal process of referring patients to a link worker to co-design a plan to improve their health and wellbeing. Intervention involves supporting participation in activities based within the individual's local community. This study aimed to explore the barriers and enablers to accessing social prescribing for people living with LTNCs (plwLTNCs).
METHODS: A total of four focus groups were carried out with 17 participants, including different neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Fragile X Syndrome, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Two participants were family carers and supported people living with epilepsy and motor neurone disease. Findings were analysed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Five themes were identified: (1) Lack of knowledge; (2) Service provision difficulties; (3) Benefits of social prescribing activities; (4) Physical barriers and (5) Psychological barriers. There was a lack of knowledge about social prescribing and what it actually was. Participants anticipated service provision difficulties relating to funding, link workers need for knowledge of LTNC's and for activities to be varied and individualised. The potential benefits of social prescribing activities were recognised across the groups especially its potential to tackle loneliness and to offer plwLTNC's purpose. Participants highlighted a number of physical barriers such as transport and accessibility; and psychological barriers such as anxiety and stigma.
CONCLUSION: Social prescribing aims to address the health inequalities of those living with long-term conditions, however currently it is likely to exclude plwLTNCs. Recommendations for practice and future research are made.","['Simpson S', 'Furlong M', 'Giebel C']",2021,21,1,BMC Health Serv Res,"Simpson S, et al.

34764380,Neurofilaments can differentiate ALS subgroups and ALS from common diagnostic mimics.,"Delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis are frequent in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of motor neuron disease (MND). Neurofilament light chain (NFL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH) are elevated in ALS patients. We retrospectively quantified cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NFL, CSF pNFH and plasma NFL in stored samples that were collected at the diagnostic work-up of ALS patients (n = 234), ALS mimics (n = 44) and controls (n = 9). We assessed the diagnostic performance, prognostication value and relationship to the site of onset and genotype. CSF NFL, CSF pNFH and plasma NFL levels were significantly increased in ALS patients compared to patients with neuropathies & myelopathies, patients with myopathies and controls. Furthermore, CSF pNFH and plasma NFL levels were significantly higher in ALS patients than in patients with other MNDs. Bulbar onset ALS patients had significantly higher plasma NFL levels than spinal onset ALS patients. ALS patients with C9orf72HRE mutations had significantly higher plasma NFL levels than patients with SOD1 mutations. Survival was negatively correlated with all three biomarkers. Receiver operating characteristics showed the highest area under the curve for CSF pNFH for differentiating ALS from ALS mimics and for plasma NFL for estimating ALS short and long survival. All three biomarkers have diagnostic value in differentiating ALS from clinically relevant ALS mimics. Plasma NFL levels can be used to differentiate between clinical and genetic ALS subgroups.","['Behzadi A', 'Pujol-Calderón F', 'Tjust AE', 'Wuolikainen A', 'Höglund K', 'Forsberg K', 'Portelius E', 'Blennow K', 'Zetterberg H', 'Andersen PM']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Behzadi A, et al.

34748676,Epidemiology and survival trends of motor neurone disease in Northern Ireland from 2015 to 2019.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study evaluates the incidence, prevalence and survival trends of motor neurone disease (MND) in Northern Ireland from 2015 to 2019.
METHODS: A capture-recapture analysis was performed using five independent data sources. Incidence and prevalence rates were standardized to the European Standard Population. Survival outcomes were analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Amongst 254 total cases of MND, capture-recapture analysis estimated three missing cases (case ascertainment 98.8%). Age standardized incidence of captured cases was 3.12 per 100,000 (2.73, 3.50) and standardized prevalence ranged from 9.45 to 6.49 per 100,000 from 2015 to 2019. Standardized incidence and prevalence rates in 2006 were 1.4 and 3.3 per 100,000 respectively. Of identified cases, 133 (52.4%) were male; 94.5% had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; median age of onset was 67 years; median time to diagnosis was 12 months (95% confidence interval 11.2, 12.8); survival from diagnosis was 12 months (95% confidence interval 10.6, 15.4); 25 (9.8%) reported a family history of MND or frontotemporal dementia; and a known MND-associated genetic mutation was identified in 7.9% of total cases, of which the most common was C9orf72 (5.7% of all patients). Factors associated with improved survival were younger age at onset, longer time to diagnosis, attendance at regional MND clinic, and initial neurology presentation as outpatient (all p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence of MND in Northern Ireland has increased over the last 10 years, in line with increasing rates reported from other European countries. Improved survival was associated with younger age at onset, longer time to diagnosis, attendance at a regional MND clinic and outpatient presentation to a Neurology Department.","['McCluskey G', 'Duddy W', 'Haffey S', 'Morrison K', 'Donaghy C', 'Duguez S']",2022,29,3,Eur J Neurol,"McCluskey G, et al.

34693290,Unilateral vocal cord adductor weakness: an atypical manifestation of motor neurone disease.,"BACKGROUND: Bulbar involvement is a recognised feature of motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS), both as a presenting complaint and as a consequence of advancing disease. Hoarseness and dysphonia have been associated with vocal cord abductor weakness. This is usually bilateral and has also been reported as the presenting clinical feature in a handful of patients with superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene mutations. Presentation with an isolated, unilateral vocal cord adductor weakness, however, is atypical and rare.
CASE: In this report, we detail the case of a 38-year-old woman with dysphonia and a family history of an SOD1 mutation. Neurological features remained confined to the territory of the left vagus nerve for the next 12 months, before a more rapid rate of disease dissemination and progression.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of recognition of vocal cord palsy as an early manifestation of MND/ALS and the critical need for monitoring to recognise potential disease progression.","['Yogakanthi S', 'Wools C', 'Mathers S']",2021,3,2,BMJ Neurol Open,"Yogakanthi S, et al.

34677606,Preventing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases.,"Significant progress has been made in understanding the pre-symptomatic phase of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. While much is still unknown, advances in other neurodegenerative diseases offer valuable insights. Indeed, it is increasingly clear that the well-recognized clinical syndromes of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and frontotemporal dementia are also each preceded by a pre-symptomatic or prodromal period of varying duration, during which the underlying disease process unfolds, with associated compensatory changes and loss of inherent system redundancy. Key insights from these diseases highlight opportunities for discovery in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The development of biomarkers reflecting amyloid and tau has led to a shift in defining Alzheimer's disease based on inferred underlying histopathology. Parkinson's disease is unique among neurodegenerative diseases in the number and diversity of non-genetic biomarkers of pre-symptomatic disease, most notably REM sleep behaviour disorder. Huntington's disease benefits from an ability to predict the likely timing of clinically manifest disease based on age and CAG-repeat length alongside reliable neuroimaging markers of atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy clinical trials have highlighted the transformational value of early therapeutic intervention, and studies in frontotemporal dementia illustrate the differential role of biomarkers based on genotype. Similar advances in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would transform our understanding of key events in pathogenesis, thereby dramatically accelerating progress towards disease prevention. Deciphering the biology of pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis relies on a clear conceptual framework for defining the earliest stages of disease. Clinically manifest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may emerge abruptly, especially among those who harbour genetic mutations associated with rapidly progressive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the disease may also evolve more gradually, revealing a prodromal period of mild motor impairment preceding phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Similarly, cognitive and behavioural impairment, when present, may emerge gradually, evolving through a prodromal period of mild cognitive impairment or mild behavioural impairment before progression to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Biomarkers are critically important to studying pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and essential to efforts to intervene therapeutically before clinically manifest disease emerges. The use of non-genetic biomarkers, however, presents challenges related to counselling, informed consent, communication of results and limited protections afforded by existing legislation. Experiences from pre-symptomatic genetic testing and counselling, and the legal protections against discrimination based on genetic data, may serve as a guide. Building on what we have learned-more broadly from other pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases and specifically from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis gene mutation carriers-we present a road map to early intervention, and perhaps even disease prevention, for all forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","['Benatar M', 'Wuu J', 'McHutchison C', 'Postuma RB', 'Boeve BF', 'Petersen R', 'Ross CA', 'Rosen H', 'Arias JJ', 'Fradette S', 'McDermott MP', 'Shefner J', 'Stanislaw C', 'Abrahams S', 'Cosentino S', 'Andersen PM', 'Finkel RS', 'Granit V', 'Grignon AL', 'Rohrer JD', 'McMillan CT', 'Grossman M', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Turner MR', 'First International Pre-Symptomatic ALS Workshop']",2022,145,1,Brain,"Benatar M, et al.

The purpose of this exploratory cross-sectional, multicenter study was to investigate how the YSP results in identifying aspiration risk in patients with MND in comparison with aspiration observed during a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS). Method Participants referred for VFSS as part of clinical management were recruited from four specialized MND clinics. All participants were administered the YSP immediately prior to the VFSS by a speech-language pathologist, with results recorded as pass or fail.

34641829,"Pain, disease severity and associations with individual quality of life in patients with motor neuron diseases.","BACKGROUND: Up to 85% of people with motor neuron disease (MND) report pain, but whether pain has negative impact on quality of life is unclear. The aim was to study associations between pain, disease severity and individual quality of life (IQOL) in patients with MND.
METHODS: In this cross sectional study, 61 patients were recruited from four multidisciplinary teams in Sweden, whereof 55 responded to the pain measure (The Brief Pain Inventory - Short form) and were included in the main analyses. Disease severity was measured with the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised Version, and individual quality of life was measured with a study-specific version of the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life - Direct Weighting.
RESULTS: Forty-one (74%) of the participants who answered BPI-SF (n = 55) reported pain. Thirty-nine (71%) of those reported pain during the past 24 h. The severity of pain was on average moderate, with eight participants (14%) reporting severe pain (PSI ≥ 7). Satisfaction with IQOL for the entire sample was good (scale 1-7, where 1 equals poor quality of life): median 5, interquartile range (IQR) 2.75 and there was no difference in satisfaction with IQOL between those reporting pain/not reporting pain (median 5, IQR 2/median 5, IQR 3.5, Mann-Whitney U = 249, p = 0.452). There was neither any correlation between pain severity and satisfaction with IQOL, nor between disease severity and satisfaction with IQOL.
CONCLUSIONS: The results add to the hypothesis that associations between non-motor symptoms such as pain prevalence and pain severity and IQOL in MND are weak. Pain prevalence was high and the results pointed to that some participants experienced high pain severity, which indicate that pain assessments and pain treatments tailored to the specific needs of the MND population should be developed and scientifically evaluated.","['Åkerblom Y', 'Zetterberg L', 'Larsson BJ', 'Nyholm D', 'Nygren I', 'Åsenlöf P']",2021,20,1,BMC Palliat Care,"Åkerblom Y, et al.

34609007,Diaphragmatic ultrasound: Prospects as a tool to assess respiratory muscle involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Ultrasonography (USG) of the diaphragm is a promising alternative to pulmonary function tests (PFT) for assessing respiratory function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND).
METHODS: We studied 33 patients fulfilling Awaji criteria (definite = 14; probable = 12; possible = 7) and 33 age and gender-matched controls. Diaphragm thickness was measured using USG at the end of expiration (DTex) and end of inspiration (DTin). The thickness ratio (TR) was calculated as DTin/DTex. The mean age at onset and duration were 49.73 ± 12.7 years and 13.57 ± 9.7 months, respectively. Men = 25 (75.8%); Limb onset ALS/MND = 24 patients (72.7%); bulbar onset = 9 (27.3%).
RESULTS: Compared to controls, ALS/MND patients had reduced mean DTex (2.22 ± 0.29 mm vs. 2.02 ± 0.32 mm, p = .012) and DTin (4.0 ± 0.71 mm vs. 3.41 ± 0.38 mm, p < .001). PFTs done in 31 patients showed restrictive abnormality in 80.6%. Significant positive correlation was seen between percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) and DTin (p = .009) and TR (p = .037) but not with DTex (p = .852). No significant correlation was seen between diaphragmatic thickness and other PFT parameters or ALSFRS scores.
CONCLUSION: The diaphragmatic thickness showed a significant decrease in ALS/MND as compared to controls. End-inspiratory diaphragmatic thickness and TR correlated well with %FVC. Thus, diaphragmatic USG could be a potential alternative to PFTs in assessing respiratory function in ALS/MND patients having the advantage of less patient participation and ease of performing in late stages of ALS/MND.","['Rajula RR', 'Saini J', 'Unnikrishnan G', 'Vengalil S', 'Nashi S', 'Bardhan M', 'Huddar A', 'Chawla T', 'Sindhu DM', 'Ganaraja VH', 'Polavarapu K', 'Preethish-Kumar V', 'Kandavel T', 'Sathyaprabha TN', 'Nalini A']",2022,50,1,J Clin Ultrasound,"Rajula RR, et al.

34603008,Motor Neuron Diseases and Neuroprotective Peptides: A Closer Look to Neurons.,"Motor neurons (MNs) are specialized neurons responsible for muscle contraction that specifically degenerate in motor neuron diseases (MNDs), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Distinct classes of MNs degenerate at different rates in disease, with a particular class named fast-fatigable MNs (FF-MNs) degenerating first. The etiology behind the selective vulnerability of FF-MNs is still largely under investigation. Among the different strategies to target MNs, the administration of protective neuropeptides is one of the potential therapeutic interventions. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide with beneficial effects in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and more recently SBMA. Another neuropeptide that has a neurotrophic effect on MNs is insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), also known as somatomedin C. These two peptides are implicated in the activation of neuroprotective pathways exploitable in the amelioration of pathological outcomes related to MNDs.","['Zuccaro E', 'Piol D', 'Basso M', 'Pennuto M']",2021,13,,Front Aging Neurosci,"Zuccaro E, et al.

34573888,Oxidative Stress as a Therapeutic Target in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Opportunities and Limitations.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND) and Lou Gehrig's disease, is characterized by a loss of the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord and the upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. Due to the complex and multifactorial nature of the various risk factors and mechanisms that are related to motor neuronal degeneration, the pathological mechanisms of ALS are not fully understood. Oxidative stress is one of the known causes of ALS pathogenesis. This has been observed in patients as well as in cellular and animal models, and is known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and the loss of motor neurons. Numerous therapeutic agents have been developed to inhibit oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. In this review, we describe the role of oxidative stress in ALS pathogenesis, and discuss several anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative agents as potential therapeutics for ALS. Although oxidative stress and antioxidant fields are meaningful approaches to delay disease progression and prolong the survival in ALS, it is necessary to investigate various animal models or humans with different subtypes of sporadic and familial ALS.","['Park HR', 'Yang EJ']",2021,11,9,Diagnostics (Basel),Park HR and Yang EJ.

34544819,Structural MRI Signatures in Genetic Presentations of the Frontotemporal Dementia/Motor Neuron Disease Spectrum.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To assess cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar gray matter (GM) atrophy using MRI in patients with disorders of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum with known genetic mutations.
METHODS: Sixty-six patients carrying FTLD-related mutations were enrolled, including 44 with pure motor neuron disease (MND) and 22 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Sixty-one patients with sporadic FTLD (sFTLD) matched for age, sex, and disease severity with genetic FTLD (gFTLD) were also included, as well as 52 healthy controls. A whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed. GM volumes of subcortical and cerebellar structures were obtained.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, GM atrophy on VBM was greater and more diffuse in genetic FTD, followed by sporadic FTD and genetic MND cases, whereas patients with sporadic MND (sMND) showed focal motor cortical atrophy. Patients carrying

34502339,Role of EphA4 in Mediating Motor Neuron Death in MND.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) comprises a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases with no effective cure. As progressive motor neuron cell death is one of pathological characteristics of MND, molecules which protect these cells are attractive therapeutic targets. Accumulating evidence indicates that EphA4 activation is involved in MND pathogenesis, and inhibition of EphA4 improves functional outcomes. However, the underlying mechanism of EphA4's function in MND is unclear. In this review, we first present results to demonstrate that EphA4 signalling acts directly on motor neurons to cause cell death. We then review the three most likely mechanisms underlying this effect.","['Zhao J', 'Stevens CH', 'Boyd AW', 'Ooi L', 'Bartlett PF']",2021,22,17,Int J Mol Sci,"Zhao J, et al.

34485910,"Traumatised, angry, abandoned but some empowered: a national survey of experiences of family caregivers bereaved by motor neurone disease.","BACKGROUND: There are few illnesses as disruptive as motor neurone disease, a fatal neurodegenerative condition, where diagnosis introduces a clinical narrative of inevitable decline through progressive immobilisation into death. Recent evidence suggests that bereaved motor neurone disease family caregivers are more likely to be at moderate or high risk of complicated grief.
METHODS: Qualitative data from an anonymous national survey of bereaved motor neurone disease caregivers (
RESULTS: Ten themes informed the narratives of illness and loss. All three groups shared similar experiences but differed in their capacity to address them. The low-risk group seemed to recognise the uncertainty of life and that meaning needed to be created by them. For the moderate-risk group, while motor neurone disease was a major disruption, they could with support, regroup and plan in different ways. The high-risk group did not have many resources, external or internal. They felt let down when professionals did not have answers and could not see or did not know how to change their ways of responding to this unwanted situation.
CONCLUSION: The differences in these three profiles and their narratives of loss should alert health and community service providers to identify and address the caregivers' support needs early and throughout the caregiving journey. Motor Neurone Disease Associations are involved throughout the illness journey and need to invest in a continuum of care incorporating end-of-life care and bereavement support. Community grief literacy and enhancement of social networks are keys to improved support from families and friends that can enable the focus to be on feelings of empowerment rather than abandonment.","['Aoun SM', 'Noonan K', 'Thomas G', 'Rumbold B']",2021,15,,Palliat Care Soc Pract,"Aoun SM, et al.

34485677,When it is not primary progressive aphasia: A scoping review of spoken language impairment in other neurodegenerative dementias.,"BACKGROUND: Progressive difficulties with spoken language occur across the spectrum of degenerative dementia. When not a primary presenting and dominant symptom, language difficulties may be overlooked in favor of more prominent cognitive, behavior, or motor deficits. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the extent and nature of the research evidence describing (1) the spoken language impairments found in non-language led dementias, (2) their impact on everyday living, and (3) the reported language interventions.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, OVID-EMBASE, PsycINFO, and SpeechBITE using terms related to spoken language for the following dementia types: Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), cortico-basal syndrome (CBS), behavior variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and motor neuron disease associated with FTD (MND+FTD). Risk of bias was assessed with the QualSyst tool.
RESULTS: Seventy-three eligible studies were included. A wide range of spoken language impairments were reported, involving both linguistic (e.g., syntactic processing) and other cognitive (e.g., sustained attention) underlying mechanisms. Although the severity of these deficits was scarcely reported, in some cases they manifested as non-fluent, dynamic, and global aphasias. No papers in the review described either the impact of these language impairments on everyday living or language therapies to treat them.
DISCUSSION: There is a need to understand better the level of disability produced by language impairment in people living with non-language-led dementias. Our findings suggest three calls for action: (1) research studies should assess the clinical relevance of any spoken language deficits examined, (2) both linguistic and cognitive underlying mechanisms should be fully described (to inform the design of effective language and behavioral interventions), and (3) trials of language therapy should be conducted in those groups of individuals where significant language impairment is proved.","['Suárez-González A', 'Cassani A', 'Gopalan R', 'Stott J', 'Savage S']",2021,7,1,Alzheimers Dement (N Y),"Suárez-González A, et al.

This review focuses on insights from structural, metabolic, and functional neuroimaging studies that have advanced our understanding of extra-motor disease burden in these phenotypes. The imaging literature is limited in the majority of these conditions and frontotemporal involvement has been primarily evaluated by neuropsychology and post mortem studies. Existing imaging studies reveal that frontotemporal degeneration can be readily detected in ALS and PLS, varying degree of frontotemporal pathology may be captured in PMA, SBMA, and HSP, SMA exhibits cerebral involvement without regional predilection, and there is limited evidence for cerebral changes in PPS.

34476545,Sex-dependent effects of amyloid precursor-like protein 2 in the SOD1-G37R transgenic mouse model of MND.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive destruction of motor neurons, muscle paralysis and death. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is highly expressed in the central nervous system and has been shown to modulate disease outcomes in MND. APP is part of a gene family that includes the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) and 2 (APLP2) genes. In the present study, we investigated the role of APLP2 in MND through the examination of human spinal cord tissue and by crossing APLP2 knockout mice with the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1-G37R) transgenic mouse model of MND. We found the expression of APLP2 is elevated in the spinal cord from human cases of MND and that this feature of the human disease is reproduced in SOD1-G37R mice at the End-stage of their MND-like phenotype progression. APLP2 deletion in SOD1-G37R mice significantly delayed disease progression and increased the survival of female SOD1-G37R mice. Molecular and biochemical analysis showed female SOD1-G37R:APLP2-/- mice displayed improved innervation of the neuromuscular junction, ameliorated atrophy of muscle fibres with increased APP protein expression levels in the gastrocnemius muscle. These results indicate a sex-dependent role for APLP2 in mutant SOD1-mediated MND and further support the APP family as a potential target for further investigation into the cause and regulation of MND.","['Truong PH', 'Crouch PJ', 'Hilton JBW', 'McLean CA', 'Cappai R', 'Ciccotosto GD']",2021,78,19-20,Cell Mol Life Sci,"Truong PH, et al.

34475430,Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) is protective against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-related mutant Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) in in vitro models.,"Mutations in Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) are present in familial and sporadic cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FUS is localised in the nucleus where it has important functions in DNA repair. However, in ALS/FTD, mutant FUS mislocalises from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it forms inclusions, a key pathological hallmark of neurodegeneration. Mutant FUS also inhibits protein import into the nucleus, resulting in defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Fragmentation of the neuronal Golgi apparatus, induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inhibition of ER-Golgi trafficking are also associated with mutant FUS misfolding in ALS. Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) is an ER chaperone previously shown to be protective against misfolding associated with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) in cellular and zebrafish models. However, a protective role against mutant FUS in ALS has not been previously described. In this study, we demonstrate that PDI is protective against mutant FUS. In neuronal cell line and primary cultures, PDI restores defects in nuclear import, prevents the formation of mutant FUS inclusions, inhibits Golgi fragmentation, ER stress, ER-Golgi transport defects, and apoptosis. These findings imply that PDI is a new therapeutic target in FUS-associated ALS.","['Parakh S', 'Perri ER', 'Vidal M', 'Sultana J', 'Shadfar S', 'Mehta P', 'Konopka A', 'Thomas CJ', 'Spencer DM', 'Atkin JD']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Parakh S, et al.

METHODS: Six ALS centers performed TST and conventional TMS in upper limbs in 98 ALS patients during their first visit to the center. Clinical evaluation of patients included the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and upper motor neuron (UMN) score.
RESULTS: TST amplitude ratio was decreased in 62% of patients whereas conventional TMS amplitude ratio was decreased in 25% of patients and central motor conduction time was increased in 16% of patients. TST amplitude ratio was correlated with ALSFRS-R and UMN score. TST amplitude ratio results were not different between the centers.
CONCLUSIONS: TST is a TMS technique applicable in daily clinical practice in ALS centers for the detection of UMN dysfunction, more sensitive than conventional TMS and related to the clinical condition of the patients.
SIGNIFICANCE: This multicenter study shows that TST can be a routine clinical tool to evaluate UMN dysfunction at the diagnostic assessment of ALS patients.","['Grapperon AM', 'Verschueren A', 'Jouve E', 'Morizot-Koutlidis R', 'Lenglet T', 'Pradat PF', 'Salachas F', 'Bernard E', 'Delstanche S', 'Maertens de Noordhout A', 'Guy N', 'Danel V', 'Delval A', 'Delmont E', 'Rolland AS', 'Pulse Study Group', 'Jomir L', 'Devos D', 'Wang F', 'Attarian S']",2021,132,10,Clin Neurophysiol,"Grapperon AM, et al.

Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during face-to-face interviews with informal caregivers from centres in the Netherlands, England, and Ireland. Standardised measures assessed burden, quality of life, and psychological distress; furthermore, an open-ended question was asked about difficult aspects of caregiving. Most caregivers were female, spouse/partners, and lived with the person with ALS for whom they provided care. Significant differences between national cohorts were identified for burden, quality of life, and anxiety. Among the difficulties described were the practical issues associated with the caregiver role and emotional factors such as witnessing a patient's health decline, relationship change, and their own distress. The mixed-methods approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the burden and difficulties experienced. It is important to generate an evidence base to support the psychosocial wellbeing and brain health of informal caregivers.","['Conroy É', 'Kennedy P', 'Heverin M', 'Leroi I', 'Mayberry E', 'Beelen A', 'Stavroulakis T', 'van den Berg LH', 'McDermott CJ', 'Hardiman O', 'Galvin M']",2021,11,8,Brain Sci,"Conroy É, et al.

Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are part of disease manifestation. We aim to report the prevalence and severity of NMS in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) in Lebanon. .
METHODS: Fifty-eight patients diagnosed with MND at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were interviewed using the NMS Scale. The prevalence of these symptoms was assessed and correlated with disease progression.
RESULTS: All our patients had at least 2 NMS with an average total score of 15.8. Symptoms reported in more than half of the patients were fatigue, depression, dysphagia, lack of motivation, pain, change in weight, anxiety, constipation, and lack of pleasure. A significant correlation was found between the total NMS score and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale score (P = 0.002) and between the NMS score corresponding to mental health and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale score (P = 0.012). Patients with bulbar symptoms had a significantly higher NMS score corresponding to gastrointestinal symptoms (P < 0.0001). It is important to note that NMS such as dysphagia could be related to motor neuron involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: NMS are commonly reported in patients with MND and seem to positively correlate with disease progression.

DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with people with MND and caregivers.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from across the UK and took part in interviews conducted either face to face, by telephone or email to accommodate for varying levels of disability.
PARTICIPANTS: 25 people with MND and 10 caregivers took part. Participants were purposively sampled based on their MND diagnosis, symptoms and time since diagnosis.
DATA ANALYSIS: Data were analysed using inductive reflexive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Eight broad themes were generated (20 subthemes). Participants described the emotional distress of losing physical function and having a threatened future because of poor prognosis. Keeping up with constant changes in symptoms and feeling unsupported by the healthcare system added to emotional distress. Finding hope and positivity, exerting some control, being kinder to oneself and experiencing support from others were helpful strategies for emotional well-being.
CONCLUSION: The study provides a broad understanding of what impacts emotional distress and well-being and discusses implications for psychological interventions for people with MND and caregivers.

34378224,Gold Coast diagnostic criteria: Implications for ALS diagnosis and clinical trial enrollment.,"Diagnostic criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are complex, incorporating multiple levels of certainty from possible through to definite, and are thereby prone to error. Specifically, interrater variability was previously established to be poor, thereby limiting utility as diagnostic enrollment criteria for clinical trials. In addition, the different levels of diagnostic certainty do not necessarily reflect disease progression, adding confusion to the diagnostic algorithm. Realizing these inherent limitations, the World Federation of Neurology, the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology, the International Alliance of ALS/MND Associations, the ALS Association (United States), and the Motor Neuron Disease Association convened a consensus meeting (Gold Coast, Australia, 2019) to consider the development of simpler criteria that better reflect clinical practice, and that could merge diagnostic categories into a single entity. The diagnostic accuracy of the novel Gold Coast criteria was subsequently interrogated through a large cross-sectional study, which established an increased sensitivity for ALS diagnosis when compared with previous criteria. Diagnostic accuracy was maintained irrespective of disease duration, functional status, or site of disease onset. Importantly, the Gold Coast criteria differentiated atypical phenotypes, such as primary lateral sclerosis, from the more typical ALS phenotype. It is proposed that the Gold Coast criteria should be incorporated into routine practice and clinical trial settings.","['Vucic S', 'Ferguson TA', 'Cummings C', 'Hotchkin MT', 'Genge A', 'Glanzman R', 'Roet KCD', 'Cudkowicz M', 'Kiernan MC']",2021,64,5,Muscle Nerve,"Vucic S, et al.

This study compared A-SICI and T-SICI for sensitivity and clinical usefulness as biomarkers for ALS.
METHODS: In all, 104 consecutive patients referred with suspicion of ALS were prospectively included and were subsequently divided into 62 patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and 42 patient controls (ALS mimics) by clinical follow-up. T-SICI and A-SICI recorded in the first dorsal interosseus muscle (index test) were compared with recordings from 53 age-matched healthy controls. The reference standard was the Awaji criteria. Clinical scorings, conventional nerve conduction studies and electromyography were also performed on the patients.
RESULTS: Motor neuron disease patients had significantly reduced T-SICI and A-SICI compared with the healthy and patient control groups, which were similar. Sensitivity and specificity for discriminating MND patients from patient controls were high (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves 0.762 and 0.810 for T-SICI and A-SICI respectively at 1-3.5 ms). Paradoxically, T-SICI was most reduced in MND patients with the fewest upper motor neuron (UMN) signs (Spearman ρ = 0.565, p = 4.3 × 10
CONCLUSIONS: Amplitude-based measure of cortical inhibition and T-SICI are both sensitive measures for the detection of cortical involvement in MND patients and may help early diagnosis of ALS, with T-SICI most abnormal before UMN signs have developed. The gradation in T-SICI from pathological facilitation in patients with minimal UMN signs to inhibition in those with the most UMN signs may be due to progressive degeneration of the subset of UMNs experiencing facilitation.","['Tankisi H', 'Nielsen CS', 'Howells J', 'Cengiz B', 'Samusyte G', 'Koltzenburg M', 'Blicher JU', 'Møller AT', 'Pugdahl K', 'Fuglsang-Frederiksen A', 'de Carvalho M', 'Bostock H']",2021,28,9,Eur J Neurol,"Tankisi H, et al.

He was treated for an exacerbation of asthma with poor response to pharmacological therapy. Investigation of dysphonia via laryngoscopy identified a bilateral vocal cord palsy. Subsequently, the patient developed an episode of life-threatening stridor and hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring an emergency tracheostomy. Neurology input identified evidence of widespread muscle fasciculations on clinical examination. MRI of the brain and cervical spine were unremarkable. Electromyogram testing identified changes of acute denervation in several limbs consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease (MND). Bilateral vocal cord palsy has been rarely reported in the literature as the heralding symptom resulting in the diagnosis of MND. In patients with a subacute onset of dysphonia, dyspnoea and stridor, MND should be a differential diagnosis.","['Gordon B', 'Joyce E', 'Counihan TJ']",2021,14,7,BMJ Case Rep,"Gordon B, et al.

Individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND-ALS) have an increased risk of falls and fractures. Currently, the standard of care does not involve a routine assessment of bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition in these patients. We aimed to assess BMD, bone mineral parameters and body composition in men with MND and compared them with healthy controls.
METHODS: Consecutive males between 50 and 80 years of age diagnosed as MND-ALS by revised El Escorial criteria and able to walk unassisted attending Neurology outpatient clinic were recruited into the study. Age, gender and body mass index (BMI) matched healthy controls were recruited from the local community. BMD and body composition were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Bone mineral parameters and bone turnover markers (BTMs) were also assessed in them.
RESULTS: A total of 30 subjects with MND-ALS and 33 controls were recruited. The mean age (years) was 59.2 in cases and 61.2 in controls. The mean BMD (g/cm
CONCLUSION: Although BMD was not significantly different between subjects with MND-ALS and healthy controls, BTMs were significantly higher in the MND group indicating a high bone turnover state. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity were also more in MND-ALS group than controls. Routine assessment for bone health parameters and body composition indices may be included in management of the patients with MND.","['Sooragonda BG', 'Agarwal S', 'Benjamin RN', 'Prabhakar AT', 'Sivadasan A', 'Kapoor N', 'Cherian KE', 'Jebasingh FK', 'Aaron S', 'Thomas N', 'Mathew V', 'Asha HS', 'Paul TV']",2021,24,2,Ann Indian Acad Neurol,"Sooragonda BG, et al.

34193885,Lipidomics study of plasma from patients suggest that ALS and PLS are part of a continuum of motor neuron disorders.,"Motor neuron disorders (MND) include a group of pathologies that affect upper and/or lower motor neurons. Among them, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by progressive muscle weakness, with fatal outcomes only in a few years after diagnosis. On the other hand, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a more benign form of MND that only affects upper motor neurons, results in life-long progressive motor dysfunction. Although the outcomes are quite different, ALS and PLS present with similar symptoms at disease onset, to the degree that both disorders could be considered part of a continuum. These similarities and the lack of reliable biomarkers often result in delays in accurate diagnosis and/or treatment. In the nervous system, lipids exert a wide variety of functions, including roles in cell structure, synaptic transmission, and multiple metabolic processes. Thus, the study of the absolute and relative concentrations of a subset of lipids in human pathology can shed light into these cellular processes and unravel alterations in one or more pathways. In here, we report the lipid composition of longitudinal plasma samples from ALS and PLS patients initially, and after 2 years following enrollment in a clinical study. Our analysis revealed common aspects of these pathologies suggesting that, from the lipidomics point of view, PLS and ALS behave as part of a continuum of motor neuron disorders.","['Area-Gomez E', 'Larrea D', 'Yun T', 'Xu Y', 'Hupf J', 'Zandkarimi F', 'Chan RB', 'Mitsumoto H']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Area-Gomez E, et al.

34120226,A systematic review of non-motor symptom evaluation in clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a multi-system disorder, presenting with common and impactful non-motor symptoms, such as neuropsychiatric symtpoms, cognitive and behavioural changes, pain, disordered sleep, fatigue and problematic saliva.
AIM/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to systematically review 25 years of ALS clinical trials data to identify if non-motor features were evaluated, in addition to the traditional measures of motor functioning and survival, and where evaluated to describe the instruments used to assess. We hypothesised that assessment of non-motor symptoms has been largely neglected in trial design and not evaluated with ALS-suitable instruments.
METHODS: We reviewed clinical trials of investigative medicinal products in ALS, since the licensing of riluzole in 1994. Trial registry databases including WHO International Trials Registry, European Clinical Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and PubMed were systematically searched for Phase II, III or IV trials registered, completed or published between 01/01/1994 and 16/09/2020. No language restrictions were applied.
RESULTS: 237 clinical trials, including over 29,222 participants, were investigated for their use of non-motor outcome measures. These trials evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms (75, 32%), cognitive impairment (16, 6.8%), behavioural change (34, 14%), pain (55, 23%), sleep disturbances (12, 5%) and fatigue (18, 8%). Problematic saliva was assessed as part of composite ALS-FRS(R) scores in 184 trials (78%) but with no focus on this as an isolated symptom. 31 (13%) trials including 3585 participants did not include any assessment of non-motor symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-motor symptoms such as neuropsychiatric, cognitive and behavioural changes, pain, disordered sleep, fatigue, and problematic saliva have not been consistently evaluated in trials for people with ALS. Where evaluated, non-symptoms were primarily assessed using instruments and impairment thresholds that are not adapted for people with ALS. Future trials should include non-motor symptom assessments to evaluate the additional potential therapeutic benefit of candidate drugs.

It is biologically different from other types of cell death such as apoptosis. While the involvement of ferroptosis in cancer, patient and animal model have been intensely studied, ferroptosis in human motor neuron model is still clearly unknown. Here we carefully assessed ferroptosis using human iPS cell-derived motor neuron (hiMNs). We found that almost all hiMNs died by the treatment of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitors. Importantly, the cell death was rescued by one antioxidant, vitamin E acetate, iron chelators and lipid peroxidase inhibitors with high dynamic ranges. Finally, these data clearly indicated that ferroptosis constitutively occurs in hiMNs, suggesting the possibility that it might play a biologically and pathologically important roles in motor neuron death such as motor neuron disease (MND)/Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).","['Matsuo T', 'Adachi-Tominari K', 'Sano O', 'Kamei T', 'Nogami M', 'Ogi K', 'Okano H', 'Yano M']",2021,566,,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"Matsuo T, et al.

34104885,Why and how the work of Motor Neurone Disease Associations matters before and during bereavement: a consumer perspective.,"BACKGROUND: Studies on the experiences of consumers with Motor Neurone Disease Associations at end of life and bereavement are lacking, and their role and capability within the broader sectors of health and disability are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the experiences and views of bereaved motor neurone disease caregivers with Motor Neurone Disease Associations about service gaps and needed improvements before and during bereavement and to propose a model of care that fits with consumer preferences and where Motor Neurone Disease Associations are effective enablers of care.
METHODS: A national bereavement survey was facilitated in 2019 by all Motor Neurone Disease Associations in Australia. A total of 363 respondents completed the section on support provided by Motor Neurone Disease Associations. A mixed-method design was used.
RESULTS: Respondents were generally positive about support received before bereavement (73-76%), except for emotional support (55%). Positive experiences related to the following: information, equipment advice/provision, advocacy/linking to services, showing empathy/understanding, personal contact and peer social support. Negative experiences included lack of continuity in case management and contact, perceived lack of competence or training, lack of emotional support and a lack of access to motor neurone disease services in rural areas. Suggested improvements were as follows: more contact and compassion at end of life and postdeath; better preparation for end of life; option of discussing euthanasia; providing referrals and links for counseling; access to caregiver support groups and peer interaction; provision of a genuine continuum of care rather than postdeath abandonment; guidance regarding postdeath practicalities; and more access to bereavement support in rural areas.
CONCLUSION: This study provides consumer perspectives on driving new or improved initiatives by Motor Neurone Disease Associations and the need for a national standardised approach to training and service delivery, based on research evidence. A public health approach to motor neurone disease end-of-life care, of international applicability, is proposed to address the needs and preferences of motor neurone disease consumers, while supporting the capability of Motor Neurone Disease Associations within a multidisciplinary workforce to deliver that care.","['Aoun SM', 'Cafarella PA', 'Hogden A', 'Thomas G', 'Jiang L', 'Edis R']",2021,15,,Palliat Care Soc Pract,"Aoun SM, et al.

This scoping review aimed to map patients' and relatives' experiences of genetic testing and counseling for familial ALS and FTD and the factors influencing their decision to proceed with testing or counseling. Informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, 5 databases were systematically searched. Thirty studies from 39 references were included. A descriptive numerical summary analysis and narrative synthesis was conducted. Mostly positive diagnostic testing experiences were reported, but issues arose due to progressive disease and discordant results. Predictive testing impacted at-risk relatives, regardless of the result received, and psychosocial sequelae ranged from relief to guilt, worry or contemplating suicide. Four reproductive testing experiences were reported. Personal, familial and practical factors, and the lived experience of disease, informed decision-making. Greater uncertainty and complexity may be faced in familial ALS/FTD than in other late-onset neurodegenerative diseases due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity, and testing limitations. Genetic counseling models of care should consider this difference to ensure that individuals with, or at risk of, ALS/FTD are effectively managed. Implications for research and practice are discussed.","['Crook A', 'Jacobs C', 'Newton-John T', 'Richardson E', 'McEwen A']",2021,35,4,Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,"Crook A, et al.

34036680,Prevalence of multimorbidity and its impact on survival in people with motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of multimorbidity in people with motor neuron disease (MND) and to identify whether specific patterns of multimorbidity impact survival beyond age alone.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Scottish national MND register from 1 January 2015 to 29 October 2019. People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy, or progressive bulbar palsy were included. We fitted latent class regression models incorporating comorbidities (class indicators), age, sex, and bulbar onset (covariates), and survival (distal outcome) with multimorbidity as a hypothesised latent variable. We also investigated the association between the Charlson Comorbidity Index and survival in Cox regression and compared its discrimination and calibration to age alone.
RESULTS: A total of 937 people with MND were identified (median age = 67 years, 60.2% male); 64.8% (n = 515) had two or more comorbidities. We identified a subpopulation with high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, but when accounting for the relationship between age and individual comorbidities, there was no difference in survival. Both Charlson Comorbidity Index (hazard ratio [HR] per unit increase = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.15, p < 0.0001) and age (HR per year increase = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03-1.05, p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with survival, but discrimination was higher for age compared to Charlson Comorbidity Index (C-index = 0.63 vs. 0.59).
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity is common in MND, necessitating holistic interdisciplinary management, but age is the dominant predictor of prognosis in people with MND. Excluding people with MND and multimorbidity from trial participation may do little to homogenise the cohort in terms of survival potential and could harm generalisability.","['Glasmacher SA', 'Kearns PKA', 'Larraz J', 'Stirland L', 'Mehta AR', 'Newton J', 'Weir CJ', 'Chandran S', 'Pal S', 'CARE-MND Consortium']",2021,28,8,Eur J Neurol,"Glasmacher SA, et al.

The aim of this qualitative meta-synthesis was to review and synthesise the available evidence to inform clinical practice and identify research gaps.
METHODS: Meta-ethnographic synthesis of qualitative studies was conducted with systematic searching of eight databases from inception to March 2021. Qualitative studies reporting personal experiences of GTs in adults with NDDs were identified. New theories were developed during translation of concepts from each study and combined as a ""line-of-argument"" synthesis. Patient and public involvement was incorporated as two of the authors are living with an NDD and a GT.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of 2863 unique records identified, only nine fulfilled the review criteria. All studies recruited participants with motor neurone disease (MND); no other NDDs were represented. Two main themes emerged: decision making and living with GT. Decision making was the predominant theme and data regarding living with GT were sparse. There is limited research on the lived experience of a GT in adults with NDDs. The lived experience of GT in MND is complex and individualised. Future research is indicated to inform clinical practice.Implications for rehabilitationEvidence related to the lived experiences of gastrostomy tube (GT) in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) is lacking especially in relation to the time after GT insertion.Decision making in relation to GT is a complex and individualised psychological process for some people, while others perceive no decisional conflict.Support from healthcare professionals is crucial during the decision-making time and should not cease after GT insertion.Support from healthcare professionals can help resolve any clinical complications and also incorporate GT into everyday routines.Healthcare professionals should be aware that their views on the benefits and problems related to GT may differ to those of individuals with a NDD.","['Lisiecka D', 'Kearns A', 'Bourke F', 'Lawson I', 'Muir C']",2022,44,18,Disabil Rehabil,"Lisiecka D, et al.

33963046,Genetic testing in motor neuron disease and frontotemporal dementia: a 5-year multicentre evaluation.,"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comprise a neurodegenerative disease spectrum. Genetic testing and counselling is complex in MND/FTD owing to incomplete penetrance, variable phenotype and variants of uncertain significance. Affected patients and unaffected relatives are commonly referred to clinical genetics to consider genetic testing. However, no consensus exists regarding how such genetic testing should best be undertaken and on which patients.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to ascertain UK clinical genetics testing practice in MND/FTD referrals, with the aim of helping inform guideline development.
METHODS: MND/FTD clinical genetics referrals comprising both affected patients and unaffected relatives between 2012 and 2016 were identified and a standardised proforma used to collate data from clinical records.
RESULTS: 301 referrals (70 affected, 231 unaffected) were reviewed across 10 genetics centres. Previously identified familial variants were known in 107 cases and 58% subsequently underwent testing (8 of 8 diagnostic and 54 of 99 predictive). The median number of genetic counselling appointments was 2 for diagnostic and 4 for predictive testing. Importantly, application of current UK Genomic Test Directory eligibility criteria would not have resulted in detection of all pathogenic variants observed in this cohort.
CONCLUSION: We propose pragmatic MND/FTD genetic testing guidelines based on appropriate genetic counselling.","['Cairns LM', 'Rankin J', 'Hamad A', 'Cooper N', 'Merrifield K', 'Jain V', 'Rosser E', 'Rogers M', 'Buston S', 'Stopford C', 'Jones G', 'Lefroy H', 'Németh AH', 'Holden S', 'Douglas AGL']",2022,59,6,J Med Genet,"Cairns LM, et al.

33934438,"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus shows specific changes in nerve architecture in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy and motor neuron disease.","BACKGROUND: The immunological pathophysiologies of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) differ considerably, but neither has been elucidated completely. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging, T2 mapping, and fat fraction analysis may indicate in vivo pathophysiological changes in nerve architecture. Our study aimed to systematically study nerve architecture of the brachial plexus in patients with CIDP, MMN, motor neuron disease (MND) and healthy controls using these quantitative MRI techniques.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with CIDP (n = 47), MMN (n = 29), MND (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 10). All patients underwent MRI of the brachial plexus and we obtained diffusion parameters, T2 relaxation times and fat fraction using an automated processing pipeline. We compared these parameters between groups using a univariate general linear model.
RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy was lower in patients with CIDP compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001), patients with MND (p = 0.010) and MMN (p < 0.001). Radial diffusivity was higher in patients with CIDP compared to healthy controls (p = 0.015) and patients with MND (p = 0.001) and MMN (p < 0.001). T2 relaxation time was elevated in patients with CIDP compared to patients with MND (p = 0.023). Fat fraction was lower in patients with CIDP and MMN compared to patients with MND (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our results show that quantitative MRI parameters differ between CIDP, MMN and MND, which may reflect differences in underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.","['van Rosmalen MHJ', 'Goedee HS', 'Derks R', 'Asselman FL', 'Verhamme C', 'de Luca A', 'Hendrikse J', 'van der Pol WL', 'Froeling M']",2021,28,8,Eur J Neurol,"van Rosmalen MHJ, et al.

Regardless of the substantial scientific knowledge accrued more than a century ago, truly effective therapeutic strategies remain distant. Various conventional drugs are being used but are having several adverse effects.
OBJECTIVE/AIM: The current study aims to thoroughly review plant-derived compounds with welldefined ALS activities and their structure-activity relationships. Moreover, the review also focuses on complex genetics, clinical trials, and the use of natural products that might decrypt the future and novel therapeutics in ALS.
METHODS: The collection of data for the compilation of this review work was searched in PubMed Scopus, Google Scholar, and Science Direct.
RESULTS: Results showed that phytochemicals like-Ginkgolides, Protopanaxatriol, Genistein, epigallocatechingallate, resveratrol, cassoside, and others possess Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) activity by various mechanisms Conclusion: These plant-derived compounds may be considered as supplements for conventional (ALS).

33902047,The Prevalence and Management of Saliva Problems in Motor Neuron Disease: A 4-Year Analysis of the Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register.,"INTRODUCTION: Saliva problems are common and distressing for people with motor neuron disease (pwMND). Despite clinical guidelines for assessment and treatment, management of saliva problems has received little research attention.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the prevalence of saliva problems in pwMND, their association with clinical factors, and their management practice using a highly curated population-based register for motor neuron disease (MND) with 99% case ascertainment.
METHODS: We conducted an analysis of pwMND diagnosed between January 2015 and October 2019 using the Scottish MND Register (CARE-MND [Clinical, Audit, Research, and Evaluation of MND]). The association between clinical factors and saliva problems was investigated using univariate and multivariable logistic regression; results are reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals. A survey of health-care professionals involved in the care of pwMND was performed to contextualize the findings.
RESULTS: 939 pwMND were included. Prevalence of saliva problems was 31.3% (294). Bulbar onset (OR 9.46 [4.7, 19.2]; p < 0.001) but not age, sex, time to diagnosis, or MND subtype were independently associated with the presence of saliva problems in multivariable regression, and 52.7% (155) of those with saliva problems received pharmacological management. The most commonly used medications were hyoscine, amitriptyline, carbocisteine, glycopyrrolate, and atropine. Evidence base (8, 72.7%) and local guidelines (10, 90.9%) were cited as the most important factors influencing treatment decision by survey respondents (n = 11).
CONCLUSION: Saliva problems are common and associated with bulbar onset MND. A substantial proportion of pwMND with saliva problems did not receive recommended treatments. Future research is required to determine the relative efficacy of individual pharmacological treatments.","['Pearson I', 'Glasmacher SA', 'Newton J', 'Beswick E', 'Mehta AR', 'Davenport R', 'Chandran S', 'Pal S', 'CARE-MND consortium']",2020,20,4,Neurodegener Dis,"Pearson I, et al.

33842068,"Facial Onset Sensory and Motor Neuronopathy: New Cases, Cognitive Changes, and Pathophysiology.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To improve our clinical understanding of facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN).
RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 29 new cases and 71 literature cases, resulting in a cohort of 100 patients with FOSMN. During follow-up, cognitive and behavioral changes became apparent in 8 patients, suggesting that changes within the spectrum of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are a part of the natural history of FOSMN. Another new finding was chorea, seen in 6 cases. Despite reports of autoantibodies, there is no consistent evidence to suggest an autoimmune pathogenesis. Four of 6 autopsies had TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP) 43 pathology. Seven cases had genetic mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
SUMMARY: FOSMN is a rare disease with a highly characteristic onset and pattern of disease progression involving initial sensory disturbances, followed by bulbar weakness with a cranial to caudal spread of pathology. Although not conclusive, the balance of evidence suggests that FOSMN is most likely to be a TDP-43 proteinopathy within the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-FTD spectrum.","['de Boer EMJ', 'Barritt AW', 'Elamin M', 'Anderson SJ', 'Broad R', 'Nisbet A', 'Goedee HS', 'Vázquez Costa JF', 'Prudlo J', 'Vedeler CA', 'Fernandez JP', 'Panades MP', 'Albertí Aguilo MA', 'Bella ED', 'Lauria G', 'Pinto WBVR', 'de Souza PVS', 'Oliveira ASB', 'Toro C', 'van Iersel J', 'Parson M', 'Harschnitz O', 'van den Berg LH', 'Veldink JH', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Leigh PN', 'van Es MA']",2021,11,2,Neurol Clin Pract,"de Boer EMJ, et al.

33793036,Coexisting Lewy body disease and clinical parkinsonism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with a range of clinical phenotypes and shows progressive degeneration of upper and/or lower motor neurons, and phosphorylated 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (pTDP-43) inclusions in motor and non-motor pathways. Parkinsonian features have been reported in up to 30% of ALS patients, and Lewy bodies, normally associated with Lewy body disease (LBD), have been reported in a small number of ALS cases, with unknown clinical relevance. This study investigates the prevalence of clinically relevant LBD in a prospectively studied ALS cohort to determine whether concomitant pathology contributes to the clinical heterogeneity.
METHODS: All ALS cases held by the New South Wales Brain Bank (n = 97) were screened for coexisting LBD consistent with clinical disease (Braak ≥ stage IV). Relevant clinical and genetic associations were determined.
RESULTS: Six cases had coexisting LBD Braak ≥ stage IV pathology. The age at symptom onset (69 ± 7 years) and disease duration (4 ± 3 years) in ALS cases with coexisting LBD did not differ from ALS cases. Three patients had lower limb onset and two patients had bulbar onset. Two patients developed the clinical features of Parkinson's disease, with one receiving a dual diagnosis. All cases had no known relevant family history or genetic abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of clinically relevant LBD pathology in ALS is higher than in the general population, and has implications for clinical and neuropathological diagnoses and the identification of biomarkers.","['Forrest SL', 'Kim JH', 'De Sousa C', 'Cheong R', 'Crockford DR', 'Sheedy D', 'Stevens J', 'McCrossin T', 'Tan RH', 'McCann H', 'Shepherd CE', 'Rowe DB', 'Kiernan MC', 'Halliday GM', 'Kril JJ']",2021,28,7,Eur J Neurol,"Forrest SL, et al.

33757953,Prospective observational cohort study of factors influencing trial participation in people with motor neuron disease (FIT-participation-MND): a protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. The Motor Neuron Disease Systematic Multi-Arm Randomised Adaptive Trial (MND-SMART) is a multisite UK trial seeking to address the paucity in effective disease-modifying drugs for people with MND (pwMND). Historically, neurological trials have been plagued by suboptimal recruitment and high rates of attrition. Failure to recruit and/or retain participants can cause insufficiently representative samples, terminated trials or invalid conclusions. This study investigates patient-specific factors affecting recruitment and retention of pwMND to MND-SMART. Improved understanding of these factors may improve trial protocol design, optimise recruitment and retention.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PwMND on the Scottish MND Register, Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND), will be invited to participate in a prospective observational cohort study that investigates factors affecting trial participation and attrition. We hypothesise that patient-specific factors will significantly affect trial recruitment and retention. Participants will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms, the ALS-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Form and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention-Health-Related Quality of Life for quality of life and a novel study-specific questionnaire on Attitudes towards Clinical Trial Participation (ACT-Q). Clinical data on phenotype, cognition (Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen) and physical functioning (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised) will also be collated. Caregivers will complete the Brief Dimensional Apathy Scale. After 12 months, a data request to MND-SMART will evaluate recruitment and retention. Descriptive statistics will summarise and compare assessments and participants reaching impairment thresholds. Variable groupings: attitudes, quality of life, cognition, behaviour, physical functioning, neuropsychiatric and phenotype. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression will explore association with participation/withdrawal in MND-SMART; presented as ORs and 95% CIs.

33737526,Estimation of the prevalence and incidence of motor neuron diseases in two Spanish regions: Catalonia and Valencia.,"According to the degree of upper and lower motor neuron degeneration, motor neuron diseases (MND) can be categorized into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) or progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). Although several studies have addressed the prevalence and incidence of ALS, there is a high heterogeneity in their results. Besides this, neither concept has been previously studied in PLS or PMA. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of MND, (distinguishing ALS, PLS and PMA), in the Spanish regions of Catalonia and Valencia in the period 2011-2019. Two population-based Spanish cohorts were used, one from Catalonia and the other from Valencia. Given that the samples that comprised both cohorts were not random, i.e., leading to a selection bias, we used a two-part model in which both the individual and contextual observed and unobserved confounding variables are controlled for, along with the spatial and temporal dependence. The prevalence of MND was estimated to be between 3.990 and 6.334 per 100,000 inhabitants (ALS between 3.248 and 5.120; PMA between 0.065 and 0.634; and PLS between 0.046 and 1.896), and the incidence between 1.682 and 2.165 per 100,000 person-years for MND (ALS between 1.351 and 1.754; PMA between 0.225 and 0.628; and PLS between 0.409-0.544). Results were similar in the two regions and did not differ from those previously reported for ALS, suggesting that the proposed method is robust and that neither region presents differential risk or protective factors.","['Barceló MA', 'Povedano M', 'Vázquez-Costa JF', 'Franquet Á', 'Solans M', 'Saez M']",2021,11,1,Sci Rep,"Barceló MA, et al.

33735900,Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Patients with Motor Neurone Disease: One Size Does Not Fit all.,"INTRODUCTION: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) is normally attributed to hypoventilation due to muscle weakness. However, we have observed different patterns of SDB among MND patients referred for non-invasive ventilation, which do not appear to be explained by respiratory muscle weakness alone.
AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of SDB in MND.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of sleep studies (using polysomnography [PSG]), pulmonary function tests, and arterial blood gases in MND patients referred to a tertiary sleep medicine service for clinical review. Sleep apnoeas were characterised as obstructive or central, and to further characterise the nature of SDB, hypopnoeas were classified as obstructive versus central.
RESULTS: Among 13 MND patients who had a diagnostic PSG, the mean ± SD age was 68.9 ± 9.8 years, BMI 23.0 ± 4.3 kg/m2, forced vital capacity 55.7 ± 20.9% predicted, and partial pressure of CO2 (arterial blood) 52.7 ± 12.1 mm Hg. A total of 38% of patients (5/13) showed evidence of sleep hypoventilation. The total apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) was (median [interquartile range]) 44.4(36.2-56.4)/h, with 92% (12/13) showing an AHI >10/h, predominantly due to obstructive events, although 8% (1/13) also showed frequent central apnoea/hypopnoeas.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MND exhibit a wide variety of SDB. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is surprising considering the normal BMI in most patients. A dystonic tongue and increased upper-airway collapsibility might predispose these patients to OSA. The wide variety of SDB demonstrated might have implications for ventilator settings and patients' outcomes.","['Aiyappan V', 'Catcheside P', 'Antic N', 'Keighley-James G', 'Mercer J', 'McEvoy RD']",2020,20,4,Neurodegener Dis,"Aiyappan V, et al.

33709181,Emergent creativity in frontotemporal dementia.,"Numerous papers report on connections between creative work and dementing illness, particularly in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which may combine with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). However, the emergence of FTD(-MND) patients' de novo artistic activities is rarely reported and underappreciated. Therefore, the present review summarizes relevant case studies' outcomes, capturing creativity's multifaceted nature. Here, we systematically searched for case reports by paying particular attention to the chronological development of individual patients' clinical symptoms, signs, and life events. We synoptically compared the various art domains to the pattern of brain atrophy, the clinical and pathological FTD subtypes. 22 FTD(-MND) patients were identified with creativity occurring either at the same time (41%) or starting after the disease onset (59%); the median lag between the first manifestation of disease and the beginning of creativity was two years. In another five patients, novel artistic activity was developed by a median of 8 years before the start of dementia symptoms. Artistic activity usually evolved over time with a peak in performance, followed by a decline that was further hampered by physical impairment during disease progression. Early on, the themes and objects depicted were often concrete and realistic, but they could become more abstract or symbolic at later stages. Emergent artistic processes may occur early on in the disease process. They appear to be a communication of inner life and may also reflect an attempt of compensation or ""self-healing"". The relative preservation of primary neocortical areas such as the visual, auditory, or motor cortex may enable the development of artistic activity in the face of degeneration of association cortical areas and subcortical, deeper central nervous system structures. It is crucial to understand the differential loss of function and an individual's creative abilities to implement caregiver-guided, personalized therapeutic strategies such as art therapy.","['Geser F', 'Jellinger KA', 'Fellner L', 'Wenning GK', 'Yilmazer-Hanke D', 'Haybaeck J']",2021,128,3,J Neural Transm (Vienna),"Geser F, et al.

MAMs are hubs for signalling pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis and survival, metabolism, and sensitivity to apoptosis. MAMs are therefore involved in vital cellular functions, but they are dysregulated in several human diseases. Whilst MAM dysfunction is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, its role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is poorly understood. However, in ALS both ER and mitochondrial dysfunction are well documented pathophysiological events. Moreover, alterations to lipid metabolism in neurons regulate processes linked to neurodegenerative diseases, and a link between dysfunction of lipid metabolism and ALS has also been proposed. In this review we discuss the structural and functional relevance of MAMs in ALS and how targeting MAM could be therapeutically beneficial in this disorder.","['Parakh S', 'Atkin JD']",2021,112,,Semin Cell Dev Biol,Parakh S and Atkin JD.

33609157,Heterogeneity of behavioural and language deficits in FTD-MND.,"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively examine the clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease (FTD-MND) compared to FTD subtypes. To clarify the heterogeneity of behavioural and language deficits in FTD-MND using a data-driven approach.
METHODS: Patients with FTD-MND (n = 31), behavioural variant FTD (n = 119), non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (n = 47), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (n = 42), and controls (n = 127) underwent comprehensive clinical, cognitive and behavioural assessments. Two-step cluster analysis examined patterns of behavioural and language impairment. Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used to investigate differences across the subgroups that emerged from cluster analysis.
RESULTS: More than half of FTD-MND patients initially presented with variable combinations of deficits (e.g., mixed behaviour/cognitive, mixed behaviour/cognitive/motor deficits), with 74% of them meeting criteria for FTD-MND within 24 months with a median of 12 months. The frequency and severity of behavioural and language abnormalities in FTD-MND lie between that seen in the three FTD phenotypes. Cluster analysis identified three patterns of behavioural and language impairment in FTD-MND. The three FTD-MND subgroups demonstrated different profiles of white matter tract disruption, but did not differ in age at onset, disease duration or patterns of cortical atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: While highly heterogeneous, in terms of behavioural and language deficits, and disease severity, the presentation of FTD-MND may be distinct to that of FTD. Distinct white matter degeneration patterns may underpin heterogeneous clinical profiles in FTD-MND. FTD presenting with mixed behavioural-language disturbances should be monitored closely for at least 12-24 months for the emergence of MND symptoms/signs.","['Long Z', 'Irish M', 'Foxe D', 'Hodges JR', 'Piguet O', 'Burrell JR']",2021,268,8,J Neurol,"Long Z, et al.

33609080,Diagnostic and prognostic value of CSF neurofilaments in a cohort of patients with motor neuron disease: A cross-sectional study.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rare group of disorders characterized by degeneration of motor neurons (MNs). The most common form of MND, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is an incurable disease with a variable rate of progression. The search of robust biomarkers able to discriminate among different ALS forms is paramount to properly stratify patients, and to identify those who could most likely benefit from experimental therapies. Phosphorylated-neurofilament heavy chain (p-NfH) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are neuron-specific components of the cytoskeleton and may represent reliable markers of neuronal injury in neurological disorders. In this study, we described our cohort of ALS patients in order to investigate whether and how cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-NfH and NfL levels may reflect progression rate, MN involvement and the extent of neurodegeneration. CSF p-NfH and NfL were significantly increased in ALS compared with healthy and disease controls, including patients with other forms of MND, and were higher in patients with more aggressive disease course, reflecting progression rate. We also evaluated neurofilament diagnostic accuracy in our centre, identifying with high sensitivity and 100% specificity cut-off values of 0.652 ng/mL for CSF p-NfH (P < .0001) and of 1261 pg/mL for NfL (P < .0001) in discriminating ALS from healthy controls. CSF neurofilaments were significantly correlated with ALS progression rate. Overall, CSF neurofilaments appear to reflect the burden of neurodegeneration in MND and represent reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in ALS.","['Gagliardi D', 'Faravelli I', 'Meneri M', 'Saccomanno D', 'Govoni A', 'Magri F', 'Ricci G', 'Siciliano G', 'Pietro Comi G', 'Corti S']",2021,25,8,J Cell Mol Med,"Gagliardi D, et al.

33604874,Emerging role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a deadly motor neuron disease (MND) and the most frequent MND in adults. ALS is recognized by degenerative alterations in both upper and lower motor neurons. This disorder is classified to familial and sporadic classes. Disease-causing mutations in SOD1, C9ORF72, FUS, and TARDBP have been recognized in familial ALS cases. However, in spite of conduction of several genetic association studies, heritable genetic risk elements in sporadic have not been identified completely. Several miRNAs have been dysregulated in the serum samples or brain tissues of ALS patients. Moreover, a number of miRNAs have been suggested as putative biomarkers for sporadic ALS. In the current manuscript, we review of miRNAs in the development of ALS.","['Akbari Dilmaghani N', 'Hussen BM', 'Nateghinia S', 'Taheri M', 'Ghafouri-Fard S']",2021,36,5,Metab Brain Dis,"Akbari Dilmaghani N, et al.

33564527,Motor Neuron Disease in a Patient With Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy: Too Much Bad Luck.,"Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) share some clinical findings. Hence, motor neuron disease (MND) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of CSM. This unique case demonstrates the coexistence of both conditions in the same patient. The author reports the case of a 74-year-old male who initially underwent posterior cervical decompression and instrumented fusion for cervical myelopathy. He demonstrated postoperative improvement followed subsequently by unexplained neurological deterioration. A repeat MRI showed adequate decompression of the cervical cord and persistence of T2 hyperintense signal in the spinal cord. Based on the presence of signs and symptoms of lower motor neuron disease, electromyography (EMG) was performed demonstrating findings of MND. The presence of MND in a patient with CSM is unique and can be difficult to diagnose based on overlapping symptoms. This case highlights the importance of EMG and the vigilance that spine surgeons need to display to identify ALS or other MND, despite the presence of ongoing cervical myelopathy. In cases where patients show discordant symptoms, further studies should be performed.","['Robles LA', 'Chakravarthy V']",2021,13,1,Cureus,Robles LA and Chakravarthy V.

33555628,Coping in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuron disease: Systematic review.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To systematically review previous studies on the variables associated with coping strategies in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuron disease (ALS/MND), such as demographics, clinical features and patient-reported outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Coping strategies are important factors for adjustment and quality of life (QOL) in patients with long-term conditions, and this topic in people with ALS/MND has not yet been the subject of a systematic review.
DESIGN: A systematic review was performed based on the PRISMA checklist.
METHODS: Electronic databases, including CINAHL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, were systemically searched from their inception to December 2019 for articles meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) written in English, (2) published in peer-reviewed journals, (3) included subjects with ALS/MND and (4) used quantitative measurements of coping strategies in people with ALS/MND.
RESULTS: Twenty-one articles were included. Significant relationships between participants' demographics (age and sex) and any coping strategy aspect were shown in six studies. Eight studies found significant relationships between clinical characteristics (disease duration and physical functional status) and coping strategies, and ten studies reported coping strategies that were associated with patients' QOL and mental health outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Younger people used relatively more problem-focused, emotion-focused and social support coping strategies, and women used relatively more social support coping strategies. Problem-focused coping was generally related to better QOL and mental health, and emotion-focused coping was generally related to less depression.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As the pattern of coping strategies is related to demographic and clinical characteristics, this study could be used to inform the provision of patient-centred nursing in clinical care. Coping patterns are related to mental health and QOL; thus, in clinical care, it is recommended that people with ALS be encouraged to develop skills that enable them to cope more effectively and that their coping strategies be assessed.","['Oh J', 'An J', 'Park K']",2021,30,13-14,J Clin Nurs,"Oh J, et al.

33425067,The Benefit of Non-invasive Ventilation in Motor Neuron Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to respiratory muscle weakness with dyspnoea, morning headaches, orthopnoea, poor concentration, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue and daytime somnolence. Respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in those with MND.
METHODS: Although guidelines suggest the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in MND, there lacks clear guidance as to when is the optimal time to initiate NIV and which markers of respiratory muscle decline are the best predictors of prognosis. There have been a number of studies that have found a significant survival advantage to the use of NIV in MND. Similarly, in quality-of-life questionnaires, those treated with NIV tend to perform better and maintain a better quality of life for longer. Furthermore, studies also suggest that improved compliance and greater tolerance of NIV confer a survival advantage.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) has traditionally been the main pulmonary function test to determine the respiratory function in those with MND; however, FVC may not be entirely reflective of early respiratory muscle dysfunction. Evidence suggests that sniff nasal inspiratory pressure and maximum mouth inspiratory pressure may be better indicators of early respiratory muscle decline. These measures have been shown to be easier to perform later in the disease, in patients with bulbar onset disease, and may indeed be better prognostic indicators.
CONCLUSION: Despite ongoing research, there remains a paucity of randomised controlled data in this area. This review aims to summarise the evidence to date on these topics.","['Walsh LJ', 'Murphy DM']",2020,14,,Open Respir Med J,Walsh LJ and Murphy DM.

33415684,In vivo Validation of Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) to Investigate Aggregate Formation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a form of motor neuron disease (MND) that is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons within the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor cortex. Although ALS clinically manifests as a heterogeneous disease, with varying disease onset and survival, a unifying feature is the presence of ubiquitinated cytoplasmic protein inclusion aggregates containing TDP-43. However, the precise mechanisms linking protein inclusions and aggregation to neuronal loss are currently poorly understood. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) takes advantage of the association of fluorophore fragments (non-fluorescent on their own) that are attached to an aggregation-prone protein of interest. Interaction of the proteins of interest allows for the fluorescent reporter protein to fold into its native state and emit a fluorescent signal. Here, we combined the power of BiFC with the advantages of the zebrafish system to validate, optimize, and visualize the formation of ALS-linked aggregates in real time in a vertebrate model. We further provide in vivo validation of the selectivity of this technique and demonstrate reduced spontaneous self-assembly of the non-fluorescent fragments in vivo by introducing a fluorophore mutation. Additionally, we report preliminary findings on the dynamic aggregation of the ALS-linked hallmark proteins Fus and TDP-43 in their corresponding nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments using BiFC. Overall, our data demonstrates the suitability of this BiFC approach to study and characterize ALS-linked aggregate formation in vivo. Importantly, the same principle can be applied in the context of other neurodegenerative diseases and has therefore critical implications to advance our understanding of pathologies that underlie aberrant protein aggregation.","['Don EK', 'Maschirow A', 'Radford RAW', 'Scherer NM', 'Vidal-Itriago A', 'Hogan A', 'Maurel C', 'Formella I', 'Stoddart JJ', 'Hall TE', 'Lee A', 'Shi B', 'Cole NJ', 'Laird AS', 'Badrock AP', 'Chung RS', 'Morsch M']",2021,58,5,Mol Neurobiol,"Don EK, et al.

33398403,Mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits in C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor neurons cause dysfunctional axonal homeostasis.,"Axonal dysfunction is a common phenotype in neurodegenerative disorders, including in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where the key pathological cell-type, the motor neuron (MN), has an axon extending up to a metre long. The maintenance of axonal function is a highly energy-demanding process, raising the question of whether MN cellular energetics is perturbed in ALS, and whether its recovery promotes axonal rescue. To address this, we undertook cellular and molecular interrogation of multiple patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell lines and patient autopsy samples harbouring the most common ALS causing mutation, C9orf72. Using paired mutant and isogenic expansion-corrected controls, we show that C9orf72 MNs have shorter axons, impaired fast axonal transport of mitochondrial cargo, and altered mitochondrial bioenergetic function. RNAseq revealed reduced gene expression of mitochondrially encoded electron transport chain transcripts, with neuropathological analysis of C9orf72-ALS post-mortem tissue importantly confirming selective dysregulation of the mitochondrially encoded transcripts in ventral horn spinal MNs, but not in corresponding dorsal horn sensory neurons, with findings reflected at the protein level. Mitochondrial DNA copy number was unaltered, both in vitro and in human post-mortem tissue. Genetic manipulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in C9orf72 MNs corrected the bioenergetic deficit and also rescued the axonal length and transport phenotypes. Collectively, our data show that loss of mitochondrial function is a key mediator of axonal dysfunction in C9orf72-ALS, and that boosting MN bioenergetics is sufficient to restore axonal homeostasis, opening new potential therapeutic strategies for ALS that target mitochondrial function.","['Mehta AR', 'Gregory JM', 'Dando O', 'Carter RN', 'Burr K', 'Nanda J', 'Story D', 'McDade K', 'Smith C', 'Morton NM', 'Mahad DJ', 'Hardingham GE', 'Chandran S', 'Selvaraj BT']",2021,141,2,Acta Neuropathol,"Mehta AR, et al.

33387861,Longitudinal clinical and neuroanatomical correlates of memory impairment in motor neuron disease.,"Memory impairment in motor neuron disease (MND) is still an underrecognized feature and has traditionally been attributed to executive dysfunction. Here, we investigate the rate of memory impairment in a longitudinal cohort of MND patients, its relationship to other cognitive functions and the underlying neuroanatomical correlates. 142 patients with MND and 99 healthy controls (HC) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and structural MRI at 3T up to four times over a period of 18 months. Linear-mixed effects models were fitted to identify changes at baseline and over time in episodic memory function (learning, immediate and delayed recall, recognition), composed cognitive scores (memory, verbal fluency, executive function), and memory-related structural brain regions (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus). Associations between episodic memory performance and volumetric or cortical thickness changes of these regions were computed using Pearson's r. Learning, immediate and delayed recall, as well as recognition performance were significantly reduced in MND when compared to controls at baseline. Performances in these subtests improved over time although MND showed less improvement than controls. This relationship did not change when only ""classical"" ALS patients were considered. Patients with MND showed thinning of the right parahippocampal gyrus (PhG) in comparison to controls that was progressing over time. Bilateral hippocampal atrophy was observed in MND patients with memory impairment after splitting the group according to their overall episodic memory performance, with the right hippocampus shrinking over time. In MND patients, the bilateral hippocampal atrophy was associated with impairment in learning, recall, and recognition at baseline. In contrast, left PhG thinning was associated with a poorer learning performance. These results show that episodic memory impairment in MND is a frequent cognitive dysfunction. Since deficits are not clearly declining with disease course, an early involvement of this cognitive domain in the disease seems probable. The memory performance-dependent atrophy of the hippocampus and PhG provide evidence for a widespread involvement of these non-motor cortical areas in disease pathology.","['Machts J', 'Keute M', 'Kaufmann J', 'Schreiber S', 'Kasper E', 'Petri S', 'Prudlo J', 'Vielhaber S', 'Schoenfeld MA']",2021,29,,Neuroimage Clin,"Machts J, et al.

33385753,"Measuring coping in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using the Coping Index-ALS: A patient derived, Rasch compliant scale.","OBJECTIVE: The progressively disabling and terminal nature of ALS/MND imposes major coping demands on patients. We wished to improve the psychometric properties of our previously published MND-Coping Scale, so that parametric analyses were valid, and to make it simpler for patients to complete and clinicians to score.
METHODS: After a new qualitative analysis of 26 patients with ALS/MND, the draft Coping Index-ALS (CI-ALS) was administered to 465 additional patients, alongside COPE-60, General Perceived Self Efficacy scale, and WHOQOL-BREF. Validity of the CI-ALS was assessed using the Rasch model. External validity was checked against comparator measures.
RESULTS: Thirteen centres contributed 465 patients, mean age 64.9 years (SD 10.8), mean disease duration 28.4 months (SD 37.5). The CI-ALS-Self and CI-ALS-Others both satisfied Rasch model expectations and showed invariance across age, gender, marital status and type of onset. Expected correlations were observed with comparator scales. A nomogram is available to convert the raw scores to interval level measures suitable for parametric analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Coping abilities in ALS/MND can now be measured using a simple 21 item self-report measure, offering two subscales with a focus of 'coping by self ' and 'coping with others'. This allows clinicians to identify individuals with poor coping and facilitates research on interventions that may improve coping skills.","['Young CA', 'McDermott CJ', 'Williams TL', 'Ealing J', 'Majeed T', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Dick DJ', 'Talbot K', 'Harrower T', 'Pinto A', 'Hanemann CO', 'Burke G', 'Roberts R', 'Mills RJ', 'Tennant A', 'TONiC study group']",2021,421,,J Neurol Sci,"Young CA, et al.

33358125,The cutaneous silent period in motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cutaneous silent period (CSP) by measuring its onset latency, duration and amount signal suppression in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) grouped according to the intensity of upper motor neuron involvement (UMN), and to test the effect of contralateral hand contraction.
METHODS: Painful stimulation was applied at the V finger, and contraction recorded from the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle (baseline condition). Afterwards, CSP was studied during strong contralateral ADM contraction (test condition). 10-15 consecutive traces were recorded for each condition, signals were rectified, averaged, and analyzed offline.
RESULTS: 46 patients were investigated, 15 with progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), 16 with typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 15 with primary lateral sclerosis/predominant UMN-ALS (PLS+UMN-ALS), and 28 controls. In the baseline condition, all MND groups showed delayed onset latencies (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the CSP duration. Suppression was lower in the PLS + UMN-ALS group (p = 0.004). In the control group, contralateral contraction did not change CSP, but onset latency shortened significantly in the PMA group.
CONCLUSIONS: CSP onset latency is delayed in all investigated groups of MND, including in PMA, indicating subclinical UMN involvement. Changes in CSP can indicate UMN lesion in MND.
SIGNIFICANCE: CSP should be explored to identify UMN involvement in MND.","['Castro J', 'Swash M', 'de Carvalho M']",2021,132,2,Clin Neurophysiol,"Castro J, et al.

33350040,Voice banking for people living with motor neurone disease: Views and expectations.,"BACKGROUND: More than 80% of people living with MND (plwMND) develop difficulties with their speech, affecting communication, self-identity and quality of life. Most plwMND eventually use an augmentative and alternative communication device (AAC) to communicate. Some AAC devices provide a synthesized voice for speech, however these voices are often viewed as impersonal and a factor in AAC acceptance. Voice banking creates an approximation of the person's own voice that can be used in AAC and is argued to go some way to preserve a person's identity when natural voice is lost, but there has been little supporting research.
AIMS: To understand what plwMND consider when deciding whether or not to bank their voice, what their expectations are, and the expectations of significant communication partners.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with plwMND who had either decided to bank their voice or had decided not to. Thematic analysis was used to provide a qualitative analysis of the data.
PROCEDURES: Participants were an opportunistic sample of plwMND within England recruited via an open advert distributed by the MND Association (MNDA).
OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Twelve plwMND were interviewed with nine significant others. Nine participants had decided to bank their voice and three decided not to. The data suggest 'preserving identity' is the overarching motivation in decision making for voice banking. Participants who decided to voice bank considered it would help to maintain their identity and preserve their social and work networks. Participants deciding not to bank their voice highlighted it could not replace their natural voice or preserve their identity. However, few in either group showed an awareness of how a voice bank is used in AAC, and how communication using AAC is significantly different to natural speech.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This research is the first study of its kind to examine the considerations for decision making around voice banking for plwMND. Preserving identity is central to decision making when considering whether or not to voice bank. However, the reality of using AAC and voice banking for communication is poorly understood. Professionals have a role to provide plwMND with more information about voice banking in the wider context of using AAC for communication. It may be that the process of voice banking itself is seen as a positive act for plwMND, independent of how it is used later. Further research with associated professionals and stakeholders is indicated. What this paper adds What is already known on this subject Voice banking creates an approximation of the person.s own voice that can be used in AAC, and is argued to go some way to preserve a person's identity when natural voice is lost. There is significant and growing interest in voice banking from the MND community, but there has been little supporting research. What this study adds This research is the first study of its kind to examine decision making surrounding voice banking. It shows how preserving identity is critically important in how people deal with a diagnosis of MND. For those choosing to voice bank, it is seen as an effective way of preserving their identity, a way of 'fighting back' and giving a positive psychological benefit. Those deciding against voice banking do not believe it could maintain their identity and cannot bring back the natural voice they once had. Clinical implications of this study The reality of using AAC and voice banking for communication may be poorly understood. It would be helpful for professionals to provide information about voice banking as part of a wider discussion about the range of options for communication as the condition progresses. It is important that this includes the opportunity to listen to a voice bank to support understanding of how it is used in a communication device, and how different it sounds to natural speech.","['Cave R', 'Bloch S']",2021,56,1,Int J Lang Commun Disord,Cave R and Bloch S.

33295820,How people living with motor neurone disease and their carers experience healthcare decision making: a qualitative exploration.,"PURPOSE: Healthcare decision making in motor neurone disease (MND) focuses on symptom management and quality of life. Decision making may be affected by personal approach to receiving information, decision making style, and disease symptoms. This study explored decision making from the perspectives of people living with motor neurone disease (plwMND). The issues impacting engagement and involvement in healthcare decisions were investigated.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 plwMND and 15 carers. Interview data was inductively analysed to identify and describe patterns and themes.
RESULTS: Data analysis identified six overarching themes: Dimensions of decision making; Window of opportunity for choice; Intrinsic influences on decision making; Extrinsic influences impacting decision making; Planning in uncertainty; and, Communication is core. Many participants did not identify a process of ""decision-making"" except if considering early gastrostomy placement. Information provision requires a balance between ensuring patients are informed but not overwhelmed. Communication impairment impacts involvement. Healthcare professionals' communication style influences engagement in decision making.
CONCLUSION: PlwMND perceive a lack of clinical decisions to make because disease symptoms and clinical phenotypes dictate necessary interventions. PlwMND describe communication impairment as a barrier to involvement in decision making and extra support is required to ensure they maintain engagement.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPeople living with MND (plwMND) perceive they have few clinical decisions to make and viewed this process as ""accepting a recommendation"", rather than ""making a decision"" although early gastrostomy placement is the exception with considerable deliberation evident.Specialist multidisciplinary clinic advice is especially helpful for plwMND without dysphagia (swallowing problems) when considering early gastrostomy placement.Communication impairment may be a barrier to involvement in healthcare decisions and extra support to remain engaged is required.Some plwMND choose not to involve others in their decisions, and patients/families with medical or scientific backgrounds are more likely to collaborate with each other outside the context of clinic appointments.","['Paynter C', 'Mathers S', 'Gregory H', 'Vogel AP', 'Cruice M']",2022,44,13,Disabil Rehabil,"Paynter C, et al.

33273047,Suitability and acceptability of the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool (CSNAT) for the assessment of carers of people with MND: a qualitative study.,"OBJECTIVES: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive, life-limiting illness. Caregiving impacts greatly on family carers with few supportive interventions for carers. We report Stages 1 and 2 of a study to: (1) explore experiences of MND caregiving and use carer-identified support needs to determine suitability and acceptability of the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool (CSNAT), (2) adapt the CSNAT as necessary for comprehensive assessment and support of MND carers, prior to (Stage 3) feasibility testing.
DESIGN: Qualitative: focus groups, interviews and carer workshops.
SETTING: Three UK MND specialist centres serving a wide range of areas.
PARTICIPANTS: Stage 1: 33 carers, 11 from each site: 19 current carers, 14 bereaved. Stage 2: 19 carer advisors: 10 bereaved, 9 current carers. Majority were spouses/partners ranging in age from under 45 years to over 75 years. Duration of caring: 4 months to 12.5 years.
RESULTS: Carers described challenges of a disease that was terminal from the outset, of 'chasing' progressive deterioration, trying to balance normality and patient independence against growing dependence, and intensive involvement in caregiving. Carers had extensive support needs which could be mapped to existing CSNAT domains: both 'enabling' domains which identify carers' needs as co-workers as well as carers' 'direct' needs as clients in relation to their own health and well-being. Only one aspect of their caregiving experience went beyond existing domains: a new domain on support needs with relationship changes was identified to tailor the CSNAT better to MND carers.
CONCLUSIONS: Carers of people with MND found the adapted CSNAT to be an appropriate and relevant tool for assessment of their support needs. The revised version has potential for assessment of carers in other longer-term caring contexts. A further paper will report the Stage 3 study on feasibility of using the adapted CSNAT in routine practice.","['Ewing G', 'Croke S', 'Rowland C', 'Grande G']",2020,10,12,BMJ Open,"Ewing G, et al.

33226867,Flexibility to manage and enhance quality of life among people with motor neurone disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify influential factors for quality of life (QoL) among individuals with motor neurone disease (MND) and explore how regulatory flexibility and psychological flexibility may contribute towards maintaining and improving QoL.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 individuals with MND. Thematic analysis, using both inductive and deductive analyses, was employed to examine subjective QoL in view of previous understanding of QoL.
RESULTS: Four factors were important for the QoL of participants: perceived illness prognosis, sense of self, concerns for significant others, and life to enjoy. These factors reflected psychological stress caused by MND, the participant's value system, and their beliefs about life. In optimising QoL, both regulatory flexibility and psychological flexibility were essential to maintain and enhance QoL. Often, regulatory flexibility was perceived among those employing a mindful approach, and psychological flexibility was found to involve savouring positive experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: People with MND reported that seeking ways to both maintain and enhance their QoL is crucial, and that this may be accomplished by increasing flexibility through mindfulness and savouring. (171/200 words)Implications for rehabilitationPeople with motor neurone disease (MND) seek to maintain quality of life (QoL) following changes caused by the condition, whilst attempting to enhance QoL by maximising their positive experiences.Regulatory flexibility is essential to maintain QoL and it was closely associated with mindful approach so that MND is not perceived as an inevitable threat to QoL.Psychological flexibility was found to enhance QoL and it involves savouring positive experiences, while abandoning fault-finding of the current situation.Positive inter-personal interactions can encourage people with MND to engage with mindfulness and savouring for favourable outcomes in terms of QoL; current support services should orient towards both mindfulness and savouring.","['Ando H', 'Cousins R', 'Young CA']",2022,44,12,Disabil Rehabil,"Ando H, et al.

33225955,Individual quality of life in spousal ALS patient-caregiver dyads.,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life is a basic goal of health and social care. The majority of people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are cared for at home by family caregivers. It is important to recognize the factors that contribute to quality of life for individuals to better understand the lived experiences in a condition for which there is currently no curative treatment.
AIM: To explore individual quality of life of people with ALS and their informal caregivers over time.
METHODS: Over three semi-structured home interviews, 28 patient-caregiver dyads provided information on a range of demographic and clinical features, psychological distress, caregiver burden, and individual quality of life. Quality of life data were analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods with integration at the analysis and interpretation phases.
RESULTS: Individual Quality of Life was high for patients and caregivers across the interviews series, and higher among patients than their care partners at each time point. Family, hobbies and social activities were the main self-defined contributors to quality of life. The importance of health declined relative to other areas over time. Friends and finances became less important for patients, but were assigned greater importance by caregivers across the illness trajectory. Psychological distress was higher among caregivers. Caregiver burden consistently increased.
CONCLUSION: The findings from this study point to the importance of exploring and monitoring quality of life at an individual level. Self-defined contributory factors are relevant to the individual within his/her context. As an integrated outcome measure individual quality of life should be assessed and monitored as part of routine clinical care during the clinical encounter. This can facilitate conversations between health care providers, patients and families, and inform interventions and contribute to decision support mechanisms. The ascertainment of self-defined life quality, especially in progressive neurodegenerative conditions, mean health care professionals are in a better position to provide person-centred care.","['Galvin M', 'Gavin T', 'Mays I', 'Heverin M', 'Hardiman O']",2020,18,1,Health Qual Life Outcomes,"Galvin M, et al.

33223039,Is the ALS a motor neuron disease or a hematopoietic stem cell disease?,"INTRODUCTION: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is also known as motor neuron disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a fatal neurodegenerative disease the cause of which is not clear. The effective therapy is absent. ALS is diagnosed through clinical examination and neurophysiologic tests. Clinically, the symptoms manifest when about 80% of motor neurons are dead.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hematopoietic stem cells are isolated through administration of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor from three groups: group 1 of 62 ALS cases, group 2 of 54 ALS-free healthy donors and group 3 of 6 ALS-free ALS-family members. The expression of HLA-DR, CD38, CD117, CD13, CD33, CD56, Thy-1, CD45, СD10, CD71 was assessed in 86 samples of HSCs in ALS group, 61 samples of HSCs in healthy group and 6 samples from ALS-free ALS-family members by the multiparameter flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The obtained immunophenotypic profiles of HSCs membrane antigens of the ALS group significantly differ from the ALS-free group, while the immunophenotypic profiles of HSCs membrane antigens of the ALS-family members group are close to the ALS group.
DISCUSSION: We suppose that the ALS onset as the disease of HSCs and manifests in the genome and proteome of the HSCs. Such immunophenotypic profiling might permit identification of ALS-specific immune insufficiency and become a tool for early diagnostics of the ALS before clinical manifestation of the disease. New options of the updated therapy of ALS might be developed or corrected considering this new evidence.
CONCLUSION: Further research with larger samples and deeper examination is required.","['Bryukhovetskiy AS', 'Grivtsova LY', 'Sharma HS']",2020,258,,Prog Brain Res,"Bryukhovetskiy AS, et al.

33222896,Strategy for screening cognitive impairment in Chinese patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: It is an economical strategy to design a screening method to decide which patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) should enter into the stage for further comprehensive neuropsychological investigation.
METHODS: 59 patients (including 8 with frank dementia) were recruited. They underwent the extensive neuropsychological evaluation and short screening batteries, namely the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Peking Union Medical College Hospital version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-P) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Results of the extensive neuropsychological evaluation were set as the gold standard to diagnose cognitive impairment, and the effectiveness of screening tests were measured against them.
RESULTS: By comparing the sensitivity and specificity, we found that the combination of FAB plus both or either of the other 2 short batteries provided a satisfactorily high sensitivity, but none of these screening batteries was significantly associated with quantitative behavioral measurements among non-demented subjects, the Frontal Behavioral Inventory-ALS version (FBI-ALS).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the FBI-ALS, the FAB, and the MMSE or the MoCA-P or both could effectively screen comorbid dementia, cognitive and behavioral impairment in ALS but this implicates a limited specificity. And the FAB needed to be validated in large Chinese sample.","['Shen D', 'Cui B', 'Liu M', 'Gao J', 'Liu C', 'Li X', 'Cui L']",2020,81,,J Clin Neurosci,"Shen D, et al.

These diseases can manifest with a clinical continuum from infantile ascending hereditary spastic paraplegia (IAHSP) to juvenile-onset forms with or without lower motor neuron involvement, the juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS) and the juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS). We report 11 patients from seven unrelated Turkish and Yemeni families with clinical signs of IAHSP or JPLS. We performed haplotype analysis or next-generation panel sequencing followed by Sanger Sequencing to unravel the genetic disease cause. We described their clinical phenotype and analyzed the pathogenicity of the detected variants with bioinformatics tools. We further reviewed all previously reported cases with ALS2-related MND. We identified five novel homozygous pathogenic variants in ALS2 at various positions: c.275_276delAT (p.Tyr92CysfsTer11), c.1044C>G (p.Tyr348Ter), c.1718C>A (p.Ala573Glu), c.3161T>C (p.Leu1054Pro), and c.1471+1G>A (NM_020919.3, NP_065970.2). In our cohort, disease onset was in infancy or early childhood with rapid onset of motor neuron signs. Muscle weakness, spasticity, severe dysarthria, dysphagia, and facial weakness were common features in the first decade of life. Frameshift and nonsense mutations clustered in the N-terminal Alsin domains are most prevalent. We enriched the mutational spectrum of ALS2-related disorders with five novel pathogenic variants. Our study indicates a high detection rate of ALS2 mutations in patients with a clinically well-characterized early onset MND. Intrafamilial and even interfamilial diversity in patients with identical pathogenic variants suggest yet unknown modifiers for phenotypic expression.","['Sprute R', 'Jergas H', 'Ölmez A', 'Alawbathani S', 'Karasoy H', 'Dafsari HS', 'Becker K', 'Daimagüler HS', 'Nürnberg P', 'Muntoni F', 'Topaloglu H', 'Uyanik G', 'Cirak S']",2021,185,2,Am J Med Genet A,"Sprute R, et al.

33074186,Beyond the Traditional Clinical Trials for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and The Future Impact of Gene Therapy.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and incurable motor neuron (MN) disorder affecting both upper and lower MNs. Despite impressive advances in the understanding of the disease's pathological mechanism, classical pharmacological clinical trials failed to provide an efficient cure for ALS over the past twenty years. Two different gene therapy approaches were recently approved for the monogenic disease Spinal muscular atrophy, characterized by degeneration of lower MNs. This milestone suggests that gene therapy-based therapeutic solutions could be effective for the treatment of ALS. This review summarizes the possible reasons for the failure of traditional clinical trials for ALS. It provides then a focus on the advent of gene therapy approaches for hereditary forms of ALS. Specifically, it describes clinical use of antisense oligonucleotides in three familial forms of ALS, caused by mutations in SOD1, C9orf72 and FUS genes, respectively.. Clinical and pre-clinical studies based on AAV-mediated gene therapy approaches for both familial and sporadic ALS cases are presented as well.

33072739,Comparative Transcriptional Profiling of Motor Neuron Disorder-Associated Genes in Various Human Cell Culture Models.,"Disease modeling requires appropriate cellular models that best mimic the underlying pathophysiology. Human origin and an adequate expression of the disease protein are pre-requisites that support information from a model to be meaningful. In this study we investigated expression profiles of (i) PBMCs and (ii) fibroblasts as patient derived cells as well as (iii) lymphoblasts and (iv) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as immortalized sources, and (v) iPSC-derived cortical neurons to assess their aptitude to model motor neuron diseases (MNDs) including hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We generated all five different cell types from two healthy donors and performed RNA sequencing to display expression patterns in MND-related genes. For the ten most common HSP genotypes we validated gene expression by qPCR. To verify the results on protein level, proteome analysis of fibroblasts, iPSCs and cortical neurons was performed. Depending on the specific MND gene we found largely different expression patterns. Out of 168 MND-related genes, 50 had their highest expression in iPSC-derived cortical neurons, 41 were most strongly expressed in fibroblasts, 26 in lymphoblasts, 22 in iPSCs, and 14 in PBMCs. Pathophysiologically related MNDs like HSPs associated with axonal transport deficits shared highest expression in cortical neurons. 15 MND-related genes were not detectable in any of the analyzed cell types. This may reflect the critical dependency of motor neurons on support of other cell types like oligodendrocytes which express myelin proteins like L1CAM (SPG1), PLP1 (SPG2) and MAG (SPG75) which are lacking in neurons but cause MNDs if mutated. This study provides comprehensive information on expression of genes associated with a large spectrum of MNDs. Expression profiles can be used to inform on appropriate cell models for genotype specific motor neuron research.","['Hauser S', 'Schuster S', 'Heuten E', 'Höflinger P', 'Admard J', 'Schelling Y', 'Velic A', 'Macek B', 'Ossowski S', 'Schöls L']",2020,8,,Front Cell Dev Biol,"Hauser S, et al.

33059698,Neurofilaments in motor neuron disorders: towards promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are etiologically and biologically heterogeneous diseases. The pathobiology of motor neuron degeneration is still largely unknown, and no effective therapy is available. Heterogeneity and lack of specific disease biomarkers have been appointed as leading reasons for past clinical trial failure, and biomarker discovery is pivotal in today's MND research agenda.In the last decade, neurofilaments (NFs) have emerged as promising biomarkers for the clinical assessment of neurodegeneration. NFs are scaffolding proteins with predominant structural functions contributing to the axonal cytoskeleton of myelinated axons. NFs are released in CSF and peripheral blood as a consequence of axonal degeneration, irrespective of the primary causal event. Due to the current availability of highly-sensitive automated technologies capable of precisely quantify proteins in biofluids in the femtomolar range, it is now possible to reliably measure NFs not only in CSF but also in blood.In this review, we will discuss how NFs are impacting research and clinical management in ALS and other MNDs. Besides contributing to the diagnosis at early stages by differentiating between MNDs with different clinical evolution and severity, NFs may provide a useful tool for the early enrolment of patients in clinical trials. Due to their stability across the disease, NFs convey prognostic information and, on a larger scale, help to stratify patients in homogenous groups. Shortcomings of NFs assessment in biofluids will also be discussed according to the available literature in the attempt to predict the most appropriate use of the biomarker in the MND clinic.","['Zucchi E', 'Bonetto V', 'Sorarù G', 'Martinelli I', 'Parchi P', 'Liguori R', 'Mandrioli J']",2020,15,1,Mol Neurodegener,"Zucchi E, et al.

33026136,Does a lack of social support and perceived stigma influence the relationship between motor neurone disease-related stress and psychological distress?,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms through which social support and felt stigma influence the relationship between motor neurone disease (MND)-related stress and psychological distress for people with MND. Although a lack of social support has been identified as a significant predictor of psychological distress for individuals with MND, the mechanisms through which this relationship exists have not been assessed, nor have the predictive nature of stigma. Furthermore, the theoretical model specifying the effects of enacted stigma on self-stigma has not been tested in individuals with MND.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional design utilizing an online survey method was used. It was hypothesized that social support would moderate the relationship between MND-related stress (operationalized as enacted stigma or physical functioning) and psychological distress (operationalized as depression, anxiety, and stress). Furthermore, felt stigma would significantly mediate the relationship between MND-related stress (enacted stigma) and psychological distress.
METHODS: Individuals with a diagnosis of MND were recruited internationally through social media and through various organizations and support services. Seventy-seven participants completed the online survey.
RESULTS: Significant correlations were identified between social support, felt, and enacted stigma and psychological distress. Moderation analysis was not significant. However, the mediation analyses identified felt stigma as a significant mediator of the relationship between enacted stigma and psychological distress. A direct relationship between enacted stigma and stress (but not depression and anxiety) was also evident.
CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive approach to tackling stigma is important in ameliorating psychological distress for people with MND. Limitations of the current study are discussed, along with implications for clinical practice.","['Leigh N', 'Simpson J', 'Eccles FJR']",2021,26,2,Br J Health Psychol,"Leigh N, et al.

32910255,A systematic review of neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments used in clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience cognitive dysfunction, whilst depression and anxiety are reported in up to 44% and 33%, respectively. These symptoms impact on quality of life, and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Historically, outcomes in clinical trials have focused on the effect of candidate drugs on physical functioning.
METHODS: We reviewed the past 25 years of clinical trials of investigative medicinal products in people with ALS, since the licensing of riluzole, and extracted data on frequency and type of assessment for neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment. Trial registry databases, including WHO International Trials Registry, European Clinical Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and PubMed, were systematically searched for Phase II, III or IV trials registered, completed or published between 01/01/1994 and 31/10/2019. No language restrictions were applied. Outcome measures, exclusion criteria and assessment tool used were extracted.
RESULTS: 216 trials, investigating 26,326 people with ALS, were reviewed. 35% assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 22% assessed cognition, as Exclusion Criteria or Outcome Measures. 3% (n = 6) of trials assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms as a Secondary Outcome Measure, and 4% (n = 8) assessed cognition as Outcome Measures; only one trial included assessments for both cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms as Outcome Measures. Three ALS-specific assessments were used in six trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Trials for people with ALS have neglected the importance of neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment. Evaluation of these extra-motor features is essential to understanding the impact of candidate drugs on all symptoms of ALS.

32907630,Impaired NHEJ repair in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is associated with TDP-43 mutations.,"BACKGROUND: Pathological forms of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are present in motor neurons of almost all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, and mutations in TDP-43 are also present in ALS. Loss and gain of TDP-43 functions are implicated in pathogenesis, but the mechanisms are unclear. While the RNA functions of TDP-43 have been widely investigated, its DNA binding roles remain unclear. However, recent studies have implicated a role for TDP-43 in the DNA damage response.
METHODS: We used NSC-34 motor neuron-like cells and primary cortical neurons expressing wildtype TDP-43 or TDP-43 ALS associated mutants (A315T, Q331K), in which DNA damage was induced by etoposide or H
RESULTS: We demonstrate that wildtype TDP-43 is recruited to sites of DNA damage where it participates in classical NHEJ DNA repair. However, ALS-associated TDP-43 mutants lose this activity, which induces DNA damage. Furthermore, DNA damage is present in mice displaying TDP-43 pathology, implying an active role in neurodegeneration. Additionally, DNA damage triggers features typical of TDP-43 pathology; cytoplasmic mis-localisation and stress granule formation. Similarly, inhibition of NHEJ induces TDP-43 mis-localisation to the cytoplasm.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that TDP-43 functions in DNA repair, but loss of this function triggers DNA damage and is associated with key pathological features of ALS.","['Konopka A', 'Whelan DR', 'Jamali MS', 'Perri E', 'Shahheydari H', 'Toth RP', 'Parakh S', 'Robinson T', 'Cheong A', 'Mehta P', 'Vidal M', 'Ragagnin AMG', 'Khizhnyak I', 'Jagaraj CJ', 'Galper J', 'Grima N', 'Deva A', 'Shadfar S', 'Nicholson GA', 'Yang S', 'Cutts SM', 'Horejsi Z', 'Bell TDM', 'Walker AK', 'Blair IP', 'Atkin JD']",2020,15,1,Mol Neurodegener,"Konopka A, et al.

32894207,Co-expression of C9orf72 related dipeptide-repeats over 1000 repeat units reveals age- and combination-specific phenotypic profiles in Drosophila.,"A large intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion (GGGGCC) within the C9orf72 (C9orf72-SMCR8 Complex Subunit) locus is the most prevalent genetic cause of both Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Motor Neuron Disease (MND). In patients this expansion is typically hundreds to thousands of repeat units in length. Repeat associated non-AUG translation of the expansion leads to the formation of toxic, pathological Dipeptide-Repeat Proteins (DPRs). To date there remains a lack of in vivo models expressing C9orf72 related DPRs with a repeat length of more than a few hundred repeats. As such our understanding of how physiologically relevant repeat length DPRs effect the nervous system in an ageing in vivo system remains limited. In this study we generated Drosophila models expressing DPRs over 1000 repeat units in length, a known pathological length in humans. Using these models, we demonstrate each DPR exhibits a unique, age-dependent, phenotypic and pathological profile. Furthermore, we show co-expression of specific DPR combinations leads to distinct, age-dependent, phenotypes not observed through expression of single DPRs. We propose these models represent a unique, in vivo, tool for dissecting the molecular mechanisms implicated in disease pathology, opening up new avenues in the study of both MND and FTD.","['West RJH', 'Sharpe JL', 'Voelzmann A', 'Munro AL', 'Hahn I', 'Baines RA', 'Pickering-Brown S']",2020,8,1,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"West RJH, et al.

The glymphatic system, which has recently been recognised as a major clearance pathway for the brain, has received considerable attention in several neurological conditions, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Its significance in ALS has, however, been little addressed. This perspective article therefore aims to assess the possibility of CSF contribution in ALS by considering various lines of evidence, including the abnormal composition of ALS-CSF, its toxicity and the evidence for impaired CSF dynamics in ALS patients. We also describe a potential role for CSF circulation in determining disease spread as well as the importance of CSF dynamics in ALS neurotherapeutics. We propose that a CSF model could potentially offer additional avenues to explore currently unexplained features of ALS, ultimately leading to new treatment options for people with ALS.","['Ng Kee Kwong KC', 'Mehta AR', 'Nedergaard M', 'Chandran S']",2020,8,1,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Ng Kee Kwong KC, et al.

Review of Available Diagnostic Tools and New Perspectives.,"Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is highly prevalent (up to 80%) in patients with motor neuron disease (MND), influencing the prognosis of the disease. The clinical assessment of dysphagia is complex. There are assessment scales and screening questionnaires, but they have not been tested in patients with MND. In a sample of 46 patients with MND, the sensitivity and specificity of the EAT-10 and SwalQoL questionnaires, as well as the ALS-SS and FOIS scales, were tested and compared to the gold standard technique (videofluoroscopy, VFS). The patients were stratified using the DOSSc variable according to the video fluoroscopic examination with (n = 37) or without (n = 8) signs of dysphagia, and the results were compared with the scores obtained in the dysphagia questionnaires. None of the studied questionnaires was more sensitive than the others, but one stood out for its high specificity (= 1): the SwalQoL revised FS. The symptom frequency section of the SwalQoL questionnaire with some modifications, (SwalQoL revised FS) may be a useful tool in the clinical assessment of dysphagia because it's capable to detect the patients that really don't have dysphagia. The ALS-SS showed the greatest validity as a severity scale of dysphagia among the sample studied. A specific questionnaire for screening for dysphagia in MND needs to be developed. Until that time, the proposal is to use a combination of the existing questionnaires for other pathologies (EAT-10 and SwalQoL) and the specific scale for MND, the ALS-SS, to make an accurately clinical assessment of OD in MND patients before to perform a videofluoroscopy.","['Romero-Gangonells E', 'Virgili-Casas MN', 'Dominguez-Rubio R', 'Povedano M', 'Pérez-Saborit N', 'Calvo-Malvar N', 'Barceló MA']",2021,36,4,Dysphagia,"Romero-Gangonells E, et al.

32790644,Truncated stathmin-2 is a marker of TDP-43 pathology in frontotemporal dementia.,"No treatment for frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the second most common type of early-onset dementia, is available, but therapeutics are being investigated to target the 2 main proteins associated with FTD pathological subtypes: TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) and tau (FTLD-tau). Testing potential therapies in clinical trials is hampered by our inability to distinguish between patients with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. Therefore, we evaluated truncated stathmin-2 (STMN2) as a proxy of TDP-43 pathology, given the reports that TDP-43 dysfunction causes truncated STMN2 accumulation. Truncated STMN2 accumulated in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons depleted of TDP-43, but not in those with pathogenic TARDBP mutations in the absence of TDP-43 aggregation or loss of nuclear protein. In RNA-Seq analyses of human brain samples from the NYGC ALS cohort, truncated STMN2 RNA was confined to tissues and disease subtypes marked by TDP-43 inclusions. Last, we validated that truncated STMN2 RNA was elevated in the frontal cortex of a cohort of patients with FTLD-TDP but not in controls or patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, a type of FTLD-tau. Further, in patients with FTLD-TDP, we observed significant associations of truncated STMN2 RNA with phosphorylated TDP-43 levels and an earlier age of disease onset. Overall, our data uncovered truncated STMN2 as a marker for TDP-43 dysfunction in FTD.","['Prudencio M', 'Humphrey J', 'Pickles S', 'Brown AL', 'Hill SE', 'Kachergus JM', 'Shi J', 'Heckman MG', 'Spiegel MR', 'Cook C', 'Song Y', 'Yue M', 'Daughrity LM', 'Carlomagno Y', 'Jansen-West K', 'de Castro CF', 'DeTure M', 'Koga S', 'Wang YC', 'Sivakumar P', 'Bodo C', 'Candalija A', 'Talbot K', 'Selvaraj BT', 'Burr K', 'Chandran S', 'Newcombe J', 'Lashley T', 'Hubbard I', 'Catalano D', 'Kim D', 'Propp N', 'Fennessey S', 'NYGC ALS Consortium', 'Fagegaltier D', 'Phatnani H', 'Secrier M', 'Fisher EM', 'Oskarsson B', 'van Blitterswijk M', 'Rademakers R', 'Graff-Radford NR', 'Boeve BF', 'Knopman DS', 'Petersen RC', 'Josephs KA', 'Thompson EA', 'Raj T', 'Ward M', 'Dickson DW', 'Gendron TF', 'Fratta P', 'Petrucelli L']",2020,130,11,J Clin Invest,"Prudencio M, et al.

32788311,Prevalence and factors associated with advanced care directives in a motor neuron disease multidisciplinary clinic in Australia.,"OBJECTIVES: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disorder leading to functional decline and death. Multidisciplinary MND clinics provide an integrated approach to management and facilitate discussion on advanced care directives (ACDs). The study objectives are to analyse (1) the prevalence of ACD in our MND clinic, (2) the relationship between ACD and patient demographics and (3) the relationship between ACD decision-making and variables such as NIV, PEG, hospital admissions and location of death.
METHODS: Using clinic records, all patients who attended the MND clinic in Liverpool Hospital between November 2014 and November 2019 were analysed. Data include MND subtypes, symptom onset to time of diagnosis, time of diagnosis to death, location and reason of death. ACD prevalence, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) requirements were analysed.
RESULTS: There were 78 patients; M:F=1:1. 44 (56%) patients were limb onset, 28 (36%) bulbar onset, 4 primary lateral sclerosis and 2 flail limb syndrome presentations. 27% patients completed ACDs, while 32% patients declined ACDs. Patients born in Australia or in a majority English-speaking country were more likely to complete ACDs compared to those born in a non-English-speaking country. There was no significant correlation between ACD completion and age, gender, MND subtype, symptom duration, NIV, PEG feeding, location of death.
CONCLUSION: One-quarter of patients completed ACDs. ACDs did not correlate with patient age, gender, MND subtype and symptom duration or decision-making regarding NIV, PEG feeding or location of death. Further studies are needed to address factors influencing patients' decisions regarding ACDs.","['Phua CS', 'Ng A', 'Brooks C', 'Harrington Z', 'Vedam H', 'Huynh T', 'Seccombe D', 'Aouad P', 'Cordato D']",2021,97,1151,Postgrad Med J,"Phua CS, et al.

32746800,Serial MRI studies over 12 months using manual and atlas-based region of interest in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons. There is a need for an imaging biomarker to track disease progression. Previously, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown loss of grey and white matter in the brain of patients with ALS compared to controls. We performed serial diffusion tractography imaging (DTI) study of patients with ALS looking for changes over time.
METHODS: On all subjects (n = 15), we performed three MRI studies at 6 month intervals. DTI changes were assessed with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and region of interest (ROI) studies. Cortic-spinal tract (CST) was selected for our ROI at the upper level; the posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC), and a lower level in the pons.
RESULTS: There was no significant change in DTI measures over 12 months of observation. Better correlation of manual and atlas-based ROI methods was found in the posterior limb of the internal capsule than the pons.
CONCLUSION: While previous DTI studies showed significant differences between ALS subjects and controls, within individual subjects there is little evidence of progression over 12 months. This suggests that DTI is not a suitable biomarker to assess disease progression in ALS.","['Alruwaili AR', 'Pannek K', 'Henderson RD', 'Gray M', 'Kurniawan ND', 'McCombe PA']",2020,20,1,BMC Med Imaging,"Alruwaili AR, et al.

32744050,Exploring the use of educational materials for increasing participation in a stretching program: a quality improvement project in people with motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Decreased range of motion is a common secondary complication of motor neuron disease (MND) that can contribute to functional decline and decreased participation in daily activities.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop and assess the effectiveness of educational brochures and videos aimed at improving knowledge regarding the importance of a regular stretching program.
DESIGN: This was a quality improvement (QI) project.
SETTING: Participants were seen in an outpatient multidisciplinary neuromuscular clinic.
POPULATION: Individuals with motor neuron disease were invited to participate in this QI study.
METHODS: Individuals were asked to complete surveys asking questions regarding current stretching program, pain levels, and knowledge of benefits of stretching before and after receiving the stretching brochures or videos.
RESULTS: A total of 53 participants completed the pre-intervention survey, 28 in the brochure group and 25 in the video group. Of those, 86% and 88% completed the post-intervention survey in the brochure and video groups, respectively. The video group increased stretching frequency significantly more than the brochure group (2.04 and 0.62 days/week respectively, P=0.004). Significantly more participants in the video group reported usage of stretches from the educational materials on a regular basis (54% for brochure group and 86% for video group, P=0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Educational brochures and videos are two different strategies to improve knowledge of benefits of stretching for individuals with MND. Both groups increased frequency of stretching. Videos may be better able to improve frequency of stretching when compared to brochures.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The brochures and videos developed for this study can be used by clinicians treating individuals with MND. By improving knowledge regarding the benefits of stretching, individuals with MND may choose to prioritize stretching as a part of their routine. This in turn may help to prevent or address potential joint or muscle length issues or assist patients to incorporate preventative measures into their treatment plans.","['Burke K', 'DE Marchi F', 'Swartz Ellrodt A', 'Doyle M', 'Koul M', 'Comeau O', 'Adelson E', 'Walter R', 'Kusy M', 'Amaya F', 'Anderson C', 'Honda J', 'Chan J', 'Berry J', 'Paganoni S']",2021,57,1,Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,"Burke K, et al.

32714947,Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Blonde D'Aquitaine Calves Is Not Associated With FVT1 Gene Mutation.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease (MND) in humans and diverse animal species: canid, felid, and bovid. To date, bovine SMA has been reported in Brown Swiss, Holstein, Friesian, and Red Danish breed; it has been associated with a genetic mutation of the FVT1 gene, also known as 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR). The aim of the present case series was to describe clinical presentation, pathological findings, and genetic analysis of five Blond d'Aquitaine calves diagnosed with SMA and to determine whether the mutation was associated with the disease. Five Blonde d'Aquitaine calves (three females and two males) from the same cow-calf operation farm were presented between June 2018 and February 2019 because unable to stand or walk unassisted since birth. Neurological examination aroused suspicion of a diffuse lesion affecting the peripheral nervous system in all calves. Findings from electromyographic investigations and muscle and nerve biopsies were consistent with a non-regenerative, chronic, active axonal neuropathy and marked neurogenic muscular atrophy and assumed to be associated with a neurodegenerative process. Histopathological examination of tissue samples from two animals revealed neuronal loss and several degenerated, shrunken, and hypereosinophilic neurons at the level of the ventral horn of the cervico-thoracic and the lumbo-sacral intumescence, diffuse loss of myelinated axons at the level of the ventral funiculi of all segments of the spinal cord, and moderate diffuse astrocytic reaction. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of SMA. No mutation of the FVT1 gene was found on genetic analysis. Further study into the causative gene mutation of SMA in Blonde D'Aquitaine calves is under way. Identification of a novel genetic mutation could improve our understanding of the disease in human medicine.","['Cagnotti G', 'Cantile C', 'Chessa S', 'Sacchi P', ""D'Angelo A"", 'Bellino C']",2020,7,,Front Vet Sci,"Cagnotti G, et al.

32709706,Requested withdrawal of gastrostomy feeding in motor neurone disease.,"NICE (National Institute for Health & Care Excellence) guidance recommends that healthcare professionals with expertise in palliative care should be an integral part of the multidisciplinary team in managing patients with motor neuron disease (MND). Those in the poorest prognostic group may benefit from early referral to help manage rapidly progressive symptoms, psychological distress and offer additional support with complex decision-making and early robust advance care planning. Patients frequently develop dysphagia and gastrostomy feeding can be used to prolong survival and improve quality of life. As the disease progresses patients may request withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment such as gastrostomy feeding; however, a literature search found no evidence or guidance on how best to facilitate this. We present the case of a patient with MND admitted to the hospice inpatient unit requesting withdrawal of gastrostomy feeding, outline the challenges and need for further consensus guidelines to inform practice.","['Wakefield D', 'Hanson SR']",2023,13,e1,BMJ Support Palliat Care,Wakefield D and Hanson SR.

32671738,Autophagy and Motor Neuron Diseases.,"Motor neuron diseases (MND) are a group of fatal progressive neurodegenerative diseases, which selectively affect the motor system in the anterior horn of spinal cord, brainstem, cortex and pyramidal tract. Motor neurons could be divided into two groups, which are upper groups in the motor cortex and lower groups in the brain stem and spinal cord. Loss of lower motor neurons leads to muscle weakness, wasting and cramps. Loss of upper motor neurons leads to brisk reflexes and functional limits. There are several types of motor neuron disease: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Now, the studies of autophagy in MND focus on the type of ALS, so this chapter will summarize the alteration of autophagy in motor neurons, and how that knowledge contributes to our understanding of the pathogenesis of ALS.","['Zhang X', 'Yang K', 'Le W']",2020,1207,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Zhang X, et al.

Neuropathological studies provide an opportunity to investigate these issues; however, there have been very few published descriptions of postmortem findings in clinically defined PLS, using modern techniques. Here, we report the neuropathological features of seven cases of PLS with age at onset ranging from 47 to 73 years and disease duration from 3.5 to 35 years. All cases showed chronic degeneration of the primary motor cortex and/or the corticospinal tracts with preservation of lower motor neurons (LMN). All five cases, in which motor cortex was available, had TDP-43 immunoreactive (TDP-ir) cortical pathology. In all seven cases, TDP-ir inclusions were also present in LMN; however, these were always rare, averaging less than one inclusion per tissue section. The finding of TDP-ir pathology in all our cases suggests that PLS and ALS are closely related conditions. Importantly however, the extremely minor involvement of LMN, even after very long disease duration in some cases, suggests that PLS is a distinct form of MND in which LMN are spared or protected.","['Mackenzie IRA', 'Briemberg H']",2020,21,sup1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,Mackenzie IRA and Briemberg H.

Neuroinflammation being a pathogenic feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we evaluated the pharmacodynamics and safety of ld-IL-2 in ALS subjects.
METHODS: We performed a single centre, parallel three-arm, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Eligibility criteria included age < 75 years, disease duration < 5 years, riluzole treatment > 3 months, and a slow vital capacity ≥ 70% of normal. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to aldesleukin 2 MIU, 1 MIU, or placebo once daily for 5 days every 4 weeks for 3 cycles. Primary outcome was change from baseline in Treg percentage of CD4
FINDINGS: All randomised patients (12 per group), recruited from October 2015 to December 2015, were alive at the end of follow-up and included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. No drug-related serious adverse event was observed. Non-serious adverse events occurred more frequently with the 1 and 2 MIU IL-2 doses compared to placebo, including injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms. Primary outcome analysis showed a significant increase (p < 0·0001) in %Tregs in the 2 MIU and 1 MIU arms (mean [SD]: 2 MIU: +6·2% [2·2]; 1 MIU: +3·9% [1·2]) as compared to placebo (mean [SD]: -0·49% [1·3]). Effect sizes (ES) were large in treated groups: 2 MIU ES=3·7 (IC95%: 2·3-4·9) and 1 MIU ES=3·5 (IC95%: 2·1-4·6). Secondary outcomes showed a significant increase in %Tregs following repeated cycles (p < 0·0001) as compared to placebo, and a dose-dependent decrease in plasma CCL2 (p = 0·0049). There were no significant differences amongst the three groups on plasma NFL levels.
INTERPRETATION: Ld-IL-2 is well tolerated and immunologically effective in subjects with ALS. These results warrant further investigation into their eventual therapeutic impact on slowing ALS disease progression.

32643435,Progression and survival of patients with motor neuron disease relative to their fecal microbiota.,"Gut microbiota studies have been well-investigated for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, however, fewer studies have comprehensively examined the gut microbiome in Motor Neuron Disease (MND), with none examining its impact on disease prognosis. Here, we investigate MND prognosis and the fecal microbiota, using 16S rRNA case-control data from 100 individuals with extensive medical histories and metabolic measurements. We contrast the composition and diversity of fecal microbiome signatures from 49 MND and 51 healthy controls by combining current gold-standard 16S microbiome pipelines. Using stringent quality control thresholds, we conducted qualitative assessment approaches including; direct comparison of taxa, PICRUSt2 predicted metagenomics, Shannon and Chao1-index and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. We show that the fecal microbiome of patients with MND is not significantly different from that of healthy controls that were matched by age, sex, and BMI, however there are distinct differences in Beta-diversity in some patients with MND. Weight, BMI, and metabolic and clinical features of disease in patients with MND were not related to the composition of their fecal microbiome, however, we observe a greater risk for earlier death in patients with MND with increased richness and diversity of the microbiome, and in those with greater Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. This was independent of anthropometric, metabolic, or clinical features of disease, and warrants support for further gut microbiota studies in MND. Given the disease heterogeneity in MND, and complexity of the gut microbiota, large studies are necessary to determine the detailed role of the gut microbiota and MND prognosis.","['Ngo ST', 'Restuadi R', 'McCrae AF', 'Van Eijk RP', 'Garton F', 'Henderson RD', 'Wray NR', 'McCombe PA', 'Steyn FJ']",2020,21,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Ngo ST, et al.

32638110,Disease progression but not physical state per se determines mental wellbeing in ALS.,"BACKGROUND: Studies provide inconclusive results on the question whether loss of mental wellbeing is actually associated with decline in physical function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of mental wellbeing in ALS.
METHODS: In total, n = 330 ALS patients were interviewed on parameters of mental wellbeing to evaluate the patients' capacity of psychosocial adaptation. These parameters were global and subjective quality of life (QoL), and depressiveness. A subsample of n = 82 ALS patients were interviewed again within approximately a year (mean 14.34 ± 5.53 months).
RESULTS: Both global and subjective QoL were stable, whereas depressiveness increased within the course of 1 year after diagnosis. Physical function decline was associated with mental wellbeing. Progression of physical disabilities and symptom duration were significant predictors of wellbeing in the sense that fast progression and short time since symptom onset (both indicating short time to adapt) were associated with low wellbeing.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for subsamples in ALS with regard to mental wellbeing, which are mainly determined by clinical parameters. Those subjects being reported in the literature to present with high mental wellbeing are often long survivors. High progression rate and low physical function when attending the clinic for the first time should be red flags and need special attention in clinical counseling.","['Vázquez Medrano CR', 'Aho-Özhan HEA', 'Weiland U', 'Uttner I', 'Ludolph AC', 'Lulé D']",2020,267,12,J Neurol,"Vázquez Medrano CR, et al.

32624067,Psychometric properties of the Korean version of the positive aspects of caregiving scale for family caregivers of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Many caregivers report finding positive meanings in their caregiving roles and activities. The positive aspects of caregiving (PAC) scale was designed to measure positive appraisals of caregiving. This study assessed the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the PAC for family caregivers of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHOD: The instrument's content and semantic equivalence were established using translation and back translation of the PAC. A convenience sample of 127 family caregivers of patients with ALS in Korea was recruited. Content, construct, and convergent validity of the Korean PAC were evaluated. Cronbach's α was used to assess reliability. This study used secondary data; the primary study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of H Hospital, from where data were collected. The consent forms did not mention the future use of data. Therefore, we have applied for approval regarding this study's protocol and exemption from informed consent.
RESULTS: The Cronbach's α was 0.92, and internal consistency was acceptable. Exploratory factor analysis supported the construct validity with a two-factor solution explaining 74.73% of the total variance. Regarding convergent validity, the Korean PAC score negatively correlated with caregiver burden and depression and positively with self-rated health status. We were unable to evaluate the suitability of the suggested structural dimensionality through confirmatory factor analysis. Furthermore, as we used secondary data, we could not assess retest reliability for the evaluation of the scale's stability.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The Korean PAC was found to be an applicable instrument with satisfactory reliability and validity and suitable for further use as a measure for positive appraisals of caregiving for family caregivers of people with ALS. It may be effective for measuring caregivers' psychological resources.","['Chu HS', 'Tak YR']",2020,18,6,Palliat Support Care,Chu HS and Tak YR.

32620242,Autophagy in motor neuron diseases.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a wide group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the degeneration of a specific neuronal type located in the central nervous system, the motor neuron (MN). There are two main types of MNs, spinal and cortical MNs and depending on the type of MND, one or both types are affected. Cortical MNs innervate spinal MNs and these control a variety of cellular targets, being skeletal muscle their main one which is also affected in MNDs. A correct functionality of autophagy is necessary for the survival of all cellular types and it is particularly crucial for neurons, given their postmitotic and highly specialized nature. Numerous studies have identified alterations of autophagy activity in multiple MNDs. The scientific community has been particularly prolific in reporting the role that autophagy plays in the most common adult MND, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, although many studies have started to identify physiological and pathological functions of this catabolic system in other MNDs, such as spinal muscular atrophy and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. The degradation of selective cargo by autophagy and how this process is altered upon the presence of MND-causing mutations is currently also a matter of intense investigation, particularly regarding the selective autophagic clearance of mitochondria. Thorough reviews on this field have been recently published. This chapter will cover the current knowledge on the functionality of autophagy and lysosomal homeostasis in the main MNDs and other autophagy-related topics in the MND field that have risen special interest in the research community.",['Rodríguez-Muela N'],2020,172,,Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,Rodríguez-Muela N.

32610599,A Systematic Review of Genotype-Phenotype Correlation across Cohorts Having Causal Mutations of Different Genes in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by progressive deterioration of upper and lower motor neurons that eventually culminates in severe muscle atrophy, respiratory failure and death. There is a concerning lack of understanding regarding the mechanisms that lead to the onset of ALS and as a result there are no reliable biomarkers that aid in the early detection of the disease nor is there an effective treatment. This review first considers the clinical phenotypes associated with ALS, and discusses the broad categorisation of ALS and ALS-mimic diseases into upper and lower motor neuron diseases, before focusing on the genetic aetiology of ALS and considering the potential relationship of mutations of different genes to variations in phenotype. For this purpose, a systematic review is conducted collating data from 107 original published clinical studies on monogenic forms of the disease, surveying the age and site of onset, disease duration and motor neuron involvement. The collected data highlight the complexity of the disease's genotype-phenotype relationship, and thus the need for a nuanced approach to the development of clinical assays and therapeutics.","['Connolly O', 'Le Gall L', 'McCluskey G', 'Donaghy CG', 'Duddy WJ', 'Duguez S']",2020,10,3,J Pers Med,"Connolly O, et al.

32606518,Palliative Care Needs and Care Giver Burden in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Cross Sectional Study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Palliative care is an important area of intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study is to understand the relationship between Palliative Care Needs and Caregiver Burden among persons diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was adopted to explore the research problem. A prospective sample of 120 participants (60 Patient Caregiver dyads) of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) and Parkinson's disease (PD) were recruited for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria from a quaternary referral care centre for neurology in south India. Patients seeking care were recruited for the study consecutively. Palliative care outcome scale and Zarit Burden Interview scale were administered to understand the relationship.
RESULTS: It was found that Palliative care outcomes score was positively correlated with caregiver burden (r = 0.597), showing that there is a bi-directional relationship between palliative care needs and caregiver burden.
CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the differences in illness characteristics, the study found that palliative care needs are high among chronic neurological conditions which requires a noncategorical psychosocial approach in ensuring care.","['Lithin Z', 'Thomas PT', 'Warrier GM', 'Bhaskar A', 'Nashi S', 'Vengalil S', 'Polavarapu K', 'Kumar P', 'Yadav R', 'Alladi S', 'Atchayaram N', 'Pal PK']",2020,23,3,Ann Indian Acad Neurol,"Lithin Z, et al.

32594542,Review: Microglia in motor neuron disease.,"Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition, which is characterized by the selective loss of the upper and lower motor neurons. At the sites of motor neuron injury, accumulation of activated microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, is commonly observed in both human post mortem studies and animal models of MND. Microglial activation has been found to correlate with many clinical features and importantly, the speed of disease progression in humans. Both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory microglial responses have been shown to influence disease progression in humans and models of MND. As such, microglia could both contribute to and protect against inflammatory mechanisms of pathogenesis in MND. While murine models have characterized the microglial response to MND, these studies have painted a complex and often contradictory picture, indicating a need for further characterization in humans. This review examines the potential role microglia play in MND in human and animal studies. Both the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses will be addressed, throughout the course of disease, followed by the potential of microglia as a target in the development of disease-modifying treatments for MND.","['Ashford BA', 'Boche D', 'Cooper-Knock J', 'Heath PR', 'Simpson JE', 'Highley JR']",2021,47,2,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Ashford BA, et al.

32577867,Using patient-reported symptoms of dyspnea for screening reduced respiratory function in patients with motor neuron diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Poor monitoring of respiratory function may lead to late initiation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with motor neuron diseases (MND). Monitoring could be improved by remotely assessing hypoventilation symptoms between clinic visits. We aimed to determine which patient-reported hypoventilation symptoms are best for screening reduced respiratory function in patients with MND, and compared them to the respiratory domain of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R).
METHODS: This prospective multi-center study included 100 patients with MND, who were able to perform a supine vital capacity test. Reduced respiratory function was defined as a predicted supine vital capacity ≤ 80%. We developed a 14-item hypoventilation symptom questionnaire (HYSQ) based on guidelines, expert opinion and think-aloud interviews with patients. Symptoms of the HYSQ were related to dyspnea, sleep quality, sleepiness/fatigue and pneumonia. The diagnostic performances of these symptoms and the ALSFRS-R respiratory domain were determined from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and accuracy.
RESULTS: Dyspnea-related symptoms (dyspnea while eating/talking, while lying flat and during light activity) were combined into the MND Dyspnea Scale (MND-DS). ROC curves showed that the MND-DS had the best diagnostic performance, with the highest AUC = 0.72, sensitivity = 75% and accuracy = 71%. Sleep-quality symptoms, sleepiness/fatigue-related symptoms and the ALSFRS-R respiratory domain showed weak diagnostic performance.
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of the MND-DS was better than the respiratory domain of the ALSFRS-R for screening reduced respiratory function in patients with MND, and is, therefore, the preferred method for (remotely) monitoring respiratory function.","['Helleman J', 'Kruitwagen-van Reenen ET', 'Bakers J', 'Kruithof WJ', 'van Groenestijn AC', 'Jaspers Focks RJH', 'de Grund A', 'van den Berg LH', 'Visser-Meily JMA', 'Beelen A']",2020,267,11,J Neurol,"Helleman J, et al.

If identified, biomarkers could improve patient outcomes by enabling early intervention and assist in the determination of treatment efficacy. We hypothesized that neural-enriched extracellular vesicles could provide microRNA (miRNA) fingerprints with unequivocal signatures of neurodegeneration. Using blood plasma from ALS/MND patients and controls, we extracted neural-enriched extracellular vesicle fractions and conducted next-generation sequencing and qPCR of miRNA components of the transcriptome. We here report eight miRNA sequences which significantly distinguish ALS/MND patients from controls in a replicated experiment using a second cohort of patients and controls. miRNA sequences from patient blood samples using neural-enriched extracellular vesicles may yield unique insights into mechanisms of neurodegeneration and assist in early diagnosis of ALS/MND.","['Banack SA', 'Dunlop RA', 'Cox PA']",2020,10,6,Open Biol,"Banack SA, et al.

32554322,"""Switchboard"" malfunction in motor neuron diseases: Selective pathology of thalamic nuclei in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis.","The thalamus is a key cerebral hub relaying a multitude of corticoefferent and corticoafferent connections and mediating distinct extrapyramidal, sensory, cognitive and behavioural functions. While the thalamus consists of dozens of anatomically well-defined nuclei with distinctive physiological roles, existing imaging studies in motor neuron diseases typically evaluate the thalamus as a single structure. Based on the unique cortical signatures observed in ALS and PLS, we hypothesised that similarly focal thalamic involvement may be observed if the nuclei are individually evaluated. A prospective imaging study was undertaken with 100 patients with ALS, 33 patients with PLS and 117 healthy controls to characterise the integrity of thalamic nuclei. ALS patients were further stratified for the presence of GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72. The thalamus was segmented into individual nuclei to examine their volumetric profile. Additionally, thalamic shape deformations were evaluated by vertex analyses and focal density alterations were examined by region-of-interest morphometry. Our data indicate that C9orf72 negative ALS patients and PLS patients exhibit ventral lateral and ventral anterior involvement, consistent with the 'motor' thalamus. Degeneration of the sensory nuclei was also detected in C9orf72 negative ALS and PLS. Both ALS groups and the PLS cohort showed focal changes in the mediodorsal-paratenial-reuniens nuclei, which mediate memory and executive functions. PLS patients exhibited distinctive thalamic changes with marked pulvinar and lateral geniculate atrophy compared to both controls and C9orf72 negative ALS. The considerable ventral lateral and ventral anterior pathology detected in both ALS and PLS support the emerging literature of extrapyramidal dysfunction in MND. The involvement of sensory nuclei is consistent with sporadic reports of sensory impairment in MND. The unique thalamic signature of PLS is in line with the distinctive clinical features of the phenotype. Our data confirm phenotype-specific patterns of thalamus involvement in motor neuron diseases with the preferential involvement of nuclei mediating motor and cognitive functions. Given the selective involvement of thalamic nuclei in ALS and PLS, future biomarker and natural history studies in MND should evaluate individual thalamic regions instead overall thalamic changes.","['Chipika RH', 'Finegan E', 'Li Hi Shing S', 'McKenna MC', 'Christidi F', 'Chang KM', 'Doherty MA', 'Hengeveld JC', 'Vajda A', 'Pender N', 'Hutchinson S', 'Donaghy C', 'McLaughlin RL', 'Hardiman O', 'Bede P']",2020,27,,Neuroimage Clin,"Chipika RH, et al.

RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials met the selection criteria, but only one provided data useful for the analysis. It compared autologous bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells, combined with riluzole, to riluzole only, in 64 people with ALS. The ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised score slightly improved 6 months after the intervention, though the change was not clinically meaningful. Respiratory function, overall survival and the risk of total adverse events or serious adverse events were not different in the two groups.

32529183,Advances in nanotechnology-based strategies for the treatments of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, which results in loss of muscle control and eventual paralysis [1]. Currently, there are as yet unresolved challenges regarding efficient drug delivery into the central nervous system (CNS). These challenges can be attributed to multiple factors including the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), as well as the inherent characteristics of the drugs themselves (e.g. low solubility, insufficient bioavailability/bio-stability, 'off-target' effects) etc. As a result, conventional drug delivery systems may not facilitate adequate dosage of the required drugs for functional recovery in ALS patients. Nanotechnology-based strategies, however, employ engineered nanostructures that show great potential in delivering single or combined therapeutic agents to overcome the biological barriers, enhance interaction with targeted sites, improve drug bioavailability/bio-stability and achieve real-time tracking while minimizing the systemic side-effects. This review provides a concise discussion of recent advances in nanotechnology-based strategies in relation to combating specific pathophysiology relevant to ALS disease progression and investigates the future scope of using nanotechnology to develop innovative treatments for ALS patients.","['Wang GY', 'Rayner SL', 'Chung R', 'Shi BY', 'Liang XJ']",2020,6,,Mater Today Bio,"Wang GY, et al.

32483867,Supporting access to activities to enhance well-being and reduce social isolation in people living with motor neurone disease.,"PURPOSE: People living with Motor Neurone Disease (plwMND) have emphasised the importance of psychological support and well-being in helping them manage their condition. Social prescribing is a formal process of referring patients with largely socioeconomic and psychosocial issues to a link worker to co-design a plan to improve their health and well-being. Intervention involves supporting engagement in meaningful activities based within the individual's local community. This pilot project aimed to explore the application of social prescribing with plwMND.
METHODS: A cohort of plwMND were supported by an occupational therapist and link worker to identify and access community-based activities. Qualitative interviews were completed post-intervention with the plwMND and the link workers. Findings were analysed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: A total of nine plwMND took part in this pilot service, and five plwMND and four link workers were interviewed. PlwMND valued participation and wanted to engage in community-based activities. Those with mild symptomatology were able to access activities and reported a positive impact on their well-being. Those with more complex needs, particularly reduced mobility, experienced significant barriers to participation. Barriers included transport, equipment provision, lack of company to support participation and lack of confidence using mobility aids in a community environment. Link workers valued joint working with an occupational therapist.
CONCLUSION: Social prescribing aims to address the health inequalities of those living with long-term conditions, although currently it likely excludes plwMND. Future work needs to quantitatively evaluate the effects of the service on the well-being of plwMND.","['Simpson S', 'Smith S', 'Furlong M', 'Ireland J', 'Giebel C']",2020,28,6,Health Soc Care Community,"Simpson S, et al.

32445072,The Cysteine (Cys) Residues Cys-6 and Cys-111 in Mutant Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1) A4V Are Required for Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons. Between 12 and 20% of inherited cases and approximately 1-2% of all cases are caused by mutations in the gene encoding dismutase 1 (SOD1). Mutant SOD1 A4V (alanine to valine) induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is increasingly implicated as a pathway to motor neuron degeneration and death in ALS. However, it remains unclear how ER stress is induced by mutant SOD1 A4V. Previous studies have established that it is induced early in pathophysiology and it precedes the formation of mutant SOD1 inclusions. SOD1 contains four cysteine residues, two of which form an intra-subunit disulphide bond involving Cys-57 and Cys-146. The remaining two cysteines, Cys-6 and Cys-111, remain unpaired and have been implicated in mutant SOD1 aggregation. In this study, we examined the relationship between the SOD1 A4V cysteine residues and aggregation, ER stress induction and toxicity. We report here that mutation of Cys-6 and Cys-111 in mutant SOD1 A4V, but not Cys-57 or Cys-146, ameliorates ER stress, inclusion formation and apoptosis in neuronal cell lines. These results imply that protein misfolding, induced by Cys-6 and Cys-111, is required for these pathological events in neuronal cells.","['Perri ER', 'Parakh S', 'Vidal M', 'Mehta P', 'Ma Y', 'Walker AK', 'Atkin JD']",2020,70,9,J Mol Neurosci,"Perri ER, et al.

32397312,Burden of Rare Variants in ALS and Axonal Hereditary Neuropathy Genes Influence Survival in ALS: Insights from a Next Generation Sequencing Study of an Italian ALS Cohort.,"Although the genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is incompletely understood, recent findings suggest a complex model of inheritance in ALS, which is consistent with a multistep pathogenetic process. Therefore, the aim of our work is to further explore the architecture of ALS using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis, enriched in motor neuron diseases (MND)-associated genes which are also implicated in axonal hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN), in order to investigate if disease expression, including the progression rate, could be influenced by the combination of multiple rare gene variants. We analyzed 29 genes in an Italian cohort of 83 patients with both familial and sporadic ALS. Overall, we detected 43 rare variants in 17 different genes and found that 43.4% of the ALS patients harbored a variant in at least one of the investigated genes. Of note, 27.9% of the variants were identified in other MND- and HMN-associated genes. Moreover, multiple gene variants were identified in 17% of the patients. The burden of rare variants is associated with reduced survival and with the time to reach King stage 4, i.e., the time to reach the need for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) positioning or non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) initiation, independently of known negative prognostic factors. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of ALS supporting the hypothesis that rare variant burden could play a role in the multistep model of disease and could exert a negative prognostic effect. Moreover, we further extend the genetic landscape of ALS to other MND-associated genes traditionally implicated in degenerative diseases of peripheral axons, such as HMN and CMT2.","['Scarlino S', 'Domi T', 'Pozzi L', 'Romano A', 'Pipitone GB', 'Falzone YM', 'Mosca L', 'Penco S', 'Lunetta C', 'Sansone V', 'Tremolizzo L', 'Fazio R', 'Agosta F', 'Filippi M', 'Carrera P', 'Riva N', 'Quattrini A']",2020,21,9,Int J Mol Sci,"Scarlino S, et al.

32372911,Circulating MicroRNAs as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Motor Neuron Disease.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a kind of neurodegenerative disease that selectively invades spinal cord anterior horn cells, brainstem motor neurons, cortical pyramidal cells and the pyramidal tract. The main clinical features are the symptoms and signs of impaired upper and lower motor neurons, manifested as muscle weakness, atrophy and pyramidal tract signs. Histopathology has shown the disappearance of pyramidal cells in the motor cortex, loss of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and brainstem, and degeneration of the corticospinal tract. Due to the lack of effective treatment methods, the prognosis is generally poor, so it is of great significance to confirm the diagnosis early by various means. However, the current diagnosis of MND mainly relies on the combination of clinical manifestations and neurophysiological examinations, lacking effective means of early diagnosis. Circulating microRNA (CmiRNA) is a kind of stable miRNA molecule in serum, plasma and other body fluids, which has the characteristics of distinct differential expression, sensitive detection and convenient sample collection. As a possible new biomarker of MND, CmiRNA can not only reveal the pathophysiological process of MND, but also monitor disease progression and response to drug therapy. With the development of miRNA detection technology, more and more CmiRNAs as biomarkers with potential diagnostic value have been investigated. In this review, we explored the possibility of circulating samples as different sources of biomarkers for the diagnosis of MND, analyzing the progress of CmiRNA detection techniques, and presenting potential diagnostic MND biomarkers that have been reported.","['Wang L', 'Zhang L']",2020,14,,Front Neurosci,Wang L and Zhang L.

32344665,Altered Mitochondrial Dynamics in Motor Neuron Disease: An Emerging Perspective.,"Mitochondria plays privotal role in diverse pathways that regulate cellular function and survival, and have emerged as a prime focus in aging and age-associated motor neuron diseases (MNDs), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Accumulating evidence suggests that many amyloidogenic proteins, including MND-associated RNA/DNA-binding proteins fused in sarcoma (FUS) and TAR DNA binding protein (TDP)-43, are strongly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Animal model and patient studies have highlighted changes in mitochondrial structure, plasticity, replication/copy number, mitochondrial DNA instability, and altered membrane potential in several subsets of MNDs, and these observations are consistent with the evidence of increased excitotoxicity, induction of reactive oxygen species, and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Studies in MND rodent models also indicate that mitochondrial abnormalities begin prior to the clinical and pathological onset of the disease, suggesting a causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction. Our recent studies, which demonstrated the involvement of specific defects in DNA break-ligation mediated by DNA ligase 3 (LIG3) in FUS-associated ALS, raised a key question of its potential implication in mitochondrial DNA transactions because LIG3 is essential for both mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. This question, as well as how wild-type and mutant MND-associated factors affect mitochondria, remain to be elucidated. These new investigation avenues into the mechanistic role of mitochondrial dysfunction in MNDs are critical to identify therapeutic targets to alleviate mitochondrial toxicity and its consequences. In this article, we critically review recent advances in our understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in diverse subgroups of MNDs and discuss challenges and future directions.","['Kodavati M', 'Wang H', 'Hegde ML']",2020,9,4,Cells,"Kodavati M, et al.

32342825,Exploring Molecular Approaches in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Drug Targets from Clinical and Pre-Clinical Findings.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease (MND) characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons (corticospinal tract) in the motor cortex, basal ganglia, brain stem, and spinal cord. The patient experiences the sign and symptoms between 55 to 75 years of age, which include impaired motor movement, difficulty in speaking and swallowing, grip loss, muscle atrophy, spasticity, and sometimes associated with memory and cognitive impairments. Median survival is 3 to 5 years after diagnosis and 5 to 10% of the patients live for more than 10 years. The limited intervention of pharmacologically active compounds, that are used clinically, is majorly associated with the narrow therapeutic index. Pre-clinically established experimental models, where neurotoxin methyl mercury mimics the ALS like behavioural and neurochemical alterations in rodents associated with neuronal mitochondrial dysfunctions and downregulation of adenyl cyclase mediated cAMP/CREB, is the main pathological hallmark for the progression of ALS in central as well in the peripheral nervous system. Despite the considerable investigation into neuroprotection, it still constrains treatment choices to strong care and organization of ALS complications. Therefore, this current review specially targeted the investigation of clinical and pre-clinical features available for ALS to understand the pathogenic mechanisms and to explore the pharmacological interventions associated with the up-regulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase/cAMP/ CREB and activation of mitochondrial-ETC coenzyme-Q10 as a future drug target in the amelioration of ALS mediated motor neuronal dysfunctions.","['Alam M', 'Yadav RK', 'Minj E', 'Tiwari A', 'Mehan S']",2021,14,3,Curr Mol Pharmacol,"Alam M, et al.

32336595,Interrogating interneurone function using threshold tracking of the H reflex in healthy subjects and patients with motor neurone disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The excitability of the lower motoneurone pool is traditionally tested using the H reflex and a constant-stimulus paradigm, which measures changes in the amplitude of the reflex response. This technique has limitations because reflex responses of different size must involve the recruitment or inhibition of different motoneurones. The threshold-tracking technique ensures that the changes in excitability occur for an identical population of motoneurones. We aimed to assess this technique and then apply it in patients with motor neurone disease (MND).
METHODS: The threshold-tracking approach was assessed in 17 healthy subjects and 11 patients with MND. The soleus H reflex was conditioned by deep peroneal nerve stimulation producing reciprocal Ia and so-called D1 and D2 inhibitions, which are believed to reflect presynaptic inhibition of soleus Ia afferents.
RESULTS: Threshold tracking was quicker than the constant-stimulus technique and reliable, properties that may be advantageous for clinical studies. D1 inhibition was significantly reduced in patients with MND.
CONCLUSIONS: Threshold tracking is useful and may be preferable under some conditions for studying the excitability of the motoneurone pool. The decreased D1 inhibition in the patients suggests that presynaptic inhibition may be reduced in MND.
SIGNIFICANCE: Reduced presynaptic inhibition could be evidence of an interneuronopathy in MND. It is possible that the hyperreflexia is a spinal pre-motoneuronal disorder, and not definitive evidence of corticospinal involvement in MND.","['Howells J', 'Sangari S', 'Matamala JM', 'Kiernan MC', 'Marchand-Pauvert V', 'Burke D']",2020,131,8,Clin Neurophysiol,"Howells J, et al.

32329901,Characteristics of People with Dementia vs Other Conditions on Admission to Inpatient Palliative Care.,"OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to (1) describe the clinical characteristics and symptoms of people diagnosed with dementia at the time of admission to inpatient palliative care; and (2) compare the nature and severity of these palliative care-related problems to patients with other chronic diseases.
DESIGN: Descriptive study using assessment data on point of care outcomes (January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018).
SETTING: A total of 129 inpatient palliative care services participating in the Australian Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 29,971 patients with a primary diagnosis of dementia (n = 1,872), lung cancer (n = 19,499), cardiovascular disease (CVD, n = 5,079), stroke (n = 2,659), or motor neuron disease (MND, n = 862).
MEASUREMENTS: This study reported the data collected at the time of admission to inpatient palliative care services including patients' self-rated levels of distress from seven common physical symptoms, clinician-rated symptom severity, functional dependency, and performance status. Other data analyzed included number of admissions, length of inpatient stay, and palliative care phases.
RESULTS: At the time of admission to inpatient palliative care services, relative to patients with lung cancer, CVD, and MND, people with dementia presented with lower levels of distress from most symptoms (odds ratios [ORs] range from .15 to .80; P < .05 for all) but higher levels of functional impairment (ORs range from 3.02 to 8.62; P < .001 for all), and they needed more assistance with basic activities of daily living (ORs range from 3.83 to 12.24; P < .001 for all). The trends were mostly the opposite direction when compared with stroke patients. Patients with dementia tended to receive inpatient palliative care later than those with lung cancer and MND.
CONCLUSION: The unique pattern of palliative care problems experienced by people with dementia, as well as the skills of the relevant health services, need to be considered when deciding on the best location of care for each individual. Access to appropriately trained palliative care clinicians is important for people with high levels of physical or psychological concerns, irrespective of the care setting or diagnosis.

The early detection of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in MND is critical. Such symptoms are only reported when we explicitly ask, evaluate, document, and assess. In the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) MND guideline (2016), formal cognitive and behavioral assessment is incorporated in MND management and is fundamental to providing appropriate care to pwMND. Cognition is explicitly stated in 14 separate recommendations in the guidelines. The NICE guidelines therefore constitute pre-defined standards which we audited. This audit highlights that health professionals increasingly recognize the significance of cognitive screening in MND and follow more structured approaches in implementing this compared to previous years.","['Stavrou M', 'Newton J', 'Stott G', 'Colville S', 'Chandran S', 'Abrahams S', 'Pal S', 'Davenport R']",2020,21,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Stavrou M, et al.

32299642,Giving and receiving a diagnosis of a progressive neurological condition: A scoping review of doctors' and patients' perspectives.,"OBJECTIVE: Delivering a life changing diagnosis can be a distressing experience for patients and a challenging task for professionals. Diagnosis delivery can be especially difficult for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as motor neurone disease (MND), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). This review aims to scope the literature on doctors' and patients' perspectives on diagnosis delivery for these conditions in order to enhance our understanding in this area and identify potential research gaps.
METHODS: A scoping review methodology was used, and data were summarised using content analysis.
RESULTS: 47 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies showed that although patients were generally satisfied with diagnosis delivery, a considerable proportion was still dissatisfied with aspects of the consultation, especially the information and time provided and the doctor's approach. Only six studies addressed doctors' perspectives, which focused more on doctors' practice.
CONCLUSION: There was a significant research gap in professionals' perspectives. The review also found that although basic standards of good practice were being met, a significant proportion of patients were dissatisfied with diagnosis communication.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Professionals delivering such diagnoses need to assess and respond to patients' information needs, provide time for questions and maintain an empathic attitude.","['Anestis E', 'Eccles F', 'Fletcher I', 'French M', 'Simpson J']",2020,103,9,Patient Educ Couns,"Anestis E, et al.

32171639,Changes in motor unit bioelectrical activity recorded at two different sites in a muscle.,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to compare the properties of bioelectrical signals of motor units recorded at different sites in the muscles of controls, patients with myopathy and patients with motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: Five controls, 10 patients with myopathy and 11 patients with MND were included. Electrophysiologic tests were performed in the biceps brachii (BB) muscle from two recording sites. Site 1 was near the belly of the muscle and Site 2 was 5cm distal from Site 1, near the tendon. Multi-motor unit potential (MUP) analysis, jitter analysis, and peak number count were calculated from the signals recorded using a concentric needle electrode (CN).
RESULTS: At Site 2, duration was longer, number of phases was higher and amplitudes were smaller in MUPs compared with those recorded at Site 1. This significant difference between recording site and patient groups was related to neurogenic muscles. Jitter analysis showed no significant difference except an intergroup difference between the patient groups and controls. The peak number calculated using the CN was greater when recorded from Site 1 in concordance with MUP analysis.
CONCLUSION: Duration of MUP was longer and amplitude was smaller when the recording electrode was placed distally along the muscle near the tendon in neurogenic muscles, probably related to increased temporal dispersion. However, changing the position of the needle did not provide further information in distinguishing myogenic muscles.","['Dede HÖ', 'Sirin NG', 'Kocasoy-Orhan E', 'Idrisoglu HA', 'Baslo MB']",2020,50,2,Neurophysiol Clin,"Dede HÖ, et al.

32140672,High-dose pharmaceutical grade biotin (MD1003) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Oligodendrocytes (OGs) provide metabolic support to motor neurons (MNs) and are implicated in the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). MD1003, or high-dose Pharmaceutical grade Biotin (hdPB), may improve disability in progressive multiple sclerosis patients via augmentation of OG or MN energy levels. Here, we assessed the safety and efficacy of MD1003 in ALS patients.
METHODS: This single centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients aged 25-80 years with probable or definite ALS. Patients were assigned (2:1), using a computer-generated randomisation list, to receive oral MD1003 (300 mg/day) or placebo treatment for 24 weeks. The primary outcome, safety, was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study, registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03114215, has been completed.
FINDINGS: Between June and December 2016, 30 patients were enrolled (MD1003, 
INTERPRETATION: MD1003 treatment was safe and well tolerated. It was not possible to establish MD1003 efficacy in this relatively small study. Given the favourable safety profile of MD1003 and an imbalance between treatment groups favouring placebo, additional, larger studies in ALS are warranted.

32139772,Ebselen as template for stabilization of A4V mutant dimer for motor neuron disease therapy.,"Mutations to the gene encoding superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) were the first genetic elements discovered that cause motor neuron disease (MND). These mutations result in compromised SOD1 dimer stability, with one of the severest and most common mutations Ala4Val (A4V) displaying a propensity to monomerise and aggregate leading to neuronal death. We show that the clinically used ebselen and related analogues promote thermal stability of A4V SOD1 when binding to Cys111 only. We have developed a A4V SOD1 differential scanning fluorescence-based assay on a C6S mutation background that is effective in assessing suitability of compounds. Crystallographic data show that the selenium atom of these compounds binds covalently to A4V SOD1 at Cys111 at the dimer interface, resulting in stabilisation. This together with chemical amenability for hit expansion of ebselen and its on-target SOD1 pharmacological chaperone activity holds remarkable promise for structure-based therapeutics for MND using ebselen as a template.","['Chantadul V', 'Wright GSA', 'Amporndanai K', 'Shahid M', 'Antonyuk SV', 'Washbourn G', 'Rogers M', 'Roberts N', 'Pye M', ""O'Neill PM"", 'Hasnain SS']",2020,3,1,Commun Biol,"Chantadul V, et al.

AIM: The objective was to explore the lived experience of spouses of persons diagnosed with MND.
METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study with three-point interviews was conducted with spouse caregivers of two persons diagnosed with MND who were receiving treatment from a national tertiary referral care center for neurological disorders. All the patients were diagnosed as definite MND according to the modified El Escorial criteria. With the spouses, in-depth interviews were conducted at their home, lasting on an average of 1 hour using a semi-structured interview guide (prompts). Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to derive themes from the interviews.

Currently, the evaluation of compounds in phase II and phase III clinical trials in PD are set up in isolation, a process that is lengthy, costly and lacks efficiency. This review will introduce the concept of a multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) trial platform which allows for the assessment of several potential therapies at once, transitioning seamlessly from a phase II safety and efficacy study to a phase III trial by means of an interim analysis. At the interim checkpoint, ineffective arms are dropped and replaced by new treatment arms, thereby allowing for the continuous evaluation of interventions. MAMS trial platforms already exist for prostate, renal and oropharyngeal cancer and are currently being developed for progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) and motor neuron disease (MND) within the UK. As a MAMS trial will evaluate many potential treatments it is of critical importance that a widely endorsed core protocol is developed which will investigate outcomes and objectives meaningful to patients. This review will discuss the challenges of drug selection, trial design, stratification and outcome measures and will share strategies implemented in the planned MAMS trials for MND and PMS that may be of interest to the PD field.","['Zeissler ML', 'Li V', 'Parmar MKB', 'Carroll CB']",2020,10,2,J Parkinsons Dis,"Zeissler ML, et al.

32102824,Gastrostomy uptake in motor neurone disease: a mixed-methods study of patients' decision making.,"OBJECTIVES: Gastrostomy decision making is a complicated, multifaceted process for people with motor neuron disease (MND). This study explored demographic and disease-related factors that may impact on gastrostomy uptake; and reasons why people with MND accepted or declined gastrostomy, with a focus on how perceptions of swallowing and nutrition may influence decision making.
DESIGN: Prospective, cross sectional, mixed methods.
SETTING: An Australian multidisciplinary, specialty MND Service.
PARTICIPANTS: 33 patients were recommended gastrostomy by the treating medical specialist. 16 of 33 were invited to participate in the prospective decision making study; of whom 10 provided informed consent.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic and disease-related factors contributing to uptake are described. A stepped approach was applied to gain a comprehensive understanding of why people with MND accept or decline gastrostomy. Instruments included standardised assessments, nutrition survey and semistructured interview. Data were collected at three separate appointments, spanning a 3-week period.
RESULTS: Gastrostomy uptake was 73% following medical specialist recommendation. Participants took days, weeks or months to consider their preferences, with lengthy hospital waiting times for the procedure. Gender, site of onset and rate of disease progression were observed to contribute to uptake. Age and symptom duration did not. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data suggests that patient perceptions of swallowing and nutrition contribute to gastrostomy acceptance; however, the decision making process is heterogeneous and these factors may not be the sole or primary reasons for acceptance. Other reported factors included: reducing carer burden, improving quality of life, increasing independence, continuing participation in social outings and gaining control.
CONCLUSIONS: Future research may give greater insight into how healthcare organisations can better facilitate gastrostomy decision making, to meet the needs of people living with MND. Larger, prospective, multisite studies may build on these findings to better inform clinical guidelines and minimise the impacts of delayed gastrostomy insertion.","['Labra J', 'Hogden A', 'Power E', 'James N', 'Flood VM']",2020,10,2,BMJ Open,"Labra J, et al.

32088378,Olig2 positive cells derived from hair follicle neural crest stem cells in rats.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a kind of common clinical nervous system disease with typical characteristic of progressive motor neurons degeneration or death. Motor neuron derived from stem cells or motor neuron progenitor cells will be a good choice to be used for treatment of the disease. In this study, we used the combination of 5 small molecular including CHIR99021 (CHIR), SB431542 (SB), DMH1 (DMH), retinoic acid (RA) and Purmorphamine (Pur) to induce hair follicles neural crest stem cells (hfNCSCs) to motor neurons progenitors (MNPs). Valproic acid (VPA) was used to make MNPs proliferation. RA and Pur were used to try to induce MNPs toward motor neurons (MNs) and CpdE was tried for MNs maturation. Nestin, β-tubulin Ш (Tuj1), microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2), Olig2, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)and TUBB3 were examined at protein and mRNA levels by immunofluoresence cytochemistry, western blot and real time PCR at 6, 16 and 22 days. Our data showed cells changed into bipolar or multipolar shape forming the cell clusters like scattered rosettes. Nestin expression decreased significantly at 22 days. Compared to 6 days, percentage of Olig2 + MNPs was higher, (88.53 ± 6.67)%, and Olig2 expression at protein and gene level was lower at 22 days. Percentage of MAP2 positive cells increased to (90.62 ± 2.31) % and ChAT positive cells increased to (83.29 ± 6.62) % at 22 days. But no expression of ChAT was examined by western blot and real time PCR.

32077471,l-Serine Reduces Spinal Cord Pathology in a Vervet Model of Preclinical ALS/MND.,"The early neuropathological features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) are protein aggregates in motor neurons and microglial activation. Similar pathology characterizes Guamanian ALS/Parkinsonism dementia complex, which may be triggered by the cyanotoxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA). We report here the occurrence of ALS/MND-type pathological changes in vervets (Chlorocebus sabaeus; n = 8) fed oral doses of a dry powder of BMAA HCl salt (210 mg/kg/day) for 140 days. Spinal cords and brains from toxin-exposed vervets were compared to controls fed rice flour (210 mg/kg/day) and to vervets coadministered equal amounts of BMAA and l-serine (210 mg/kg/day). Immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis were used to examine markers of ALS/MND and glial activation. UHPLC-MS/MS was used to confirm BMAA exposures in dosed vervets. Motor neuron degeneration was demonstrated in BMAA-dosed vervets by TDP-43+ proteinopathy in anterior horn cells, by reactive astrogliosis, by activated microglia, and by damage to myelinated axons in the lateral corticospinal tracts. Vervets dosed with BMAA + l-serine displayed reduced neuropathological changes. This study demonstrates that chronic dietary exposure to BMAA causes ALS/MND-type pathological changes in the vervet and coadministration of l-serine reduces the amount of reactive gliosis and the number of protein inclusions in motor neurons.","['Davis DA', 'Cox PA', 'Banack SA', 'Lecusay PD', 'Garamszegi SP', 'Hagan MJ', 'Powell JT', 'Metcalf JS', 'Palmour RM', 'Beierschmitt A', 'Bradley WG', 'Mash DC']",2020,79,4,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Davis DA, et al. l-Serine Reduces Spinal Cord Pathology in a Vervet Model of Preclinical ALS/MND. l-Serine Reduces Spinal Cord Pathology in a Vervet Model of Preclinical ALS/MND. 2020; 79:393-406. doi: 10.1093/jnen/nlaa002",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32077471/

32022482,A juvenile ALS-like phenotype dramatically improved after high-dose riboflavin treatment.,"Riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD) was recently characterized as a cause of genetic recessive childhood-onset motor neuron disease (MND) with hearing loss, formerly described as Brown-Vialetto-Van-Lear syndrome. We describe a 18-year-old woman with probable RTD mimicking juvenile Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) who presented with an inaugural respiratory failure and moderate distal four limbs weakness. Only one heterozygous SLC52A3 mutation was detected, but presence of a sub-clinical auditory neuropathy and dramatic improvement under high dose riboflavin argued for a RTD. As RTD probably has a larger phenotypic spectrum than expected, a high dose riboflavin trial should be discussed in young-onset MND.","['Carreau C', 'Lenglet T', 'Mosnier I', 'Lahlou G', 'Fargeot G', 'Weiss N', 'Demeret S', 'Salachas F', 'Veauville-Merllié A', 'Acquaviva C', 'Nadjar Y']",2020,7,2,Ann Clin Transl Neurol,"Carreau C, et al.

31995205,Speech and Language Presentations of FTLD-TDP Type B Neuropathology.,"Four right-handed patients who presented with an isolated impairment of speech or language had transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) type B pathology. Comportment and pyramidal motor function were preserved at presentation. Three of the cases developed axial rigidity and oculomotor findings late in their course with no additional pyramidal or lower motor neuron impairments. However, in all 4 cases, postmortem examination disclosed some degree of upper and lower motor neuron disease (MND) pathology in motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Although TDP-43 type B pathology is commonly associated with MND and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, it is less recognized as a pathologic correlate of primary progressive aphasia and/or apraxia of speech as the presenting syndrome. These cases, taken together, contribute to the growing heterogeneity in clinical presentations associated with TDP pathology. Additionally, 2 cases demonstrated left anterior temporal lobe atrophy but without word comprehension impairments, shedding light on the relevance of the left temporal tip for single-word comprehension.","['Lee DJ', 'Bigio EH', 'Rogalski EJ', 'Mesulam MM']",2020,79,3,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Lee DJ, et al.

31956088,Prognostic factors of key outcomes for motor neuron disease in a multiracial Asian population.,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of prognostic factors related to the survival of Motor Neuron Diseases (MND) remains scarce in Southeast Asia.
PURPOSE: To determine potential prognostic factors for survival, need for feeding and ventilation support in MND patients in a multi-racial Asian population.
METHODS: One hundred and four MND patients from the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) between January 2004 and December 2017 were reviewed. All relevant clinical data, demographic information were collected. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression model were performed to identify potential prognostic factors for crucial outcomes (survival, need for feeding support and ventilation support).
RESULTS: Mean age of onset was 59.54 ± 10.91 years, Mean age of onset in Malays was significantly younger than that of other ethnic groups (Malay: 54.18 ± 12.95 years; Non-Malay: 60.39 ± 10.38 years, p = 0.035). Fifty six of the male and 33of the female were diagnosed with ALS (90.3% vs. 78.6% p = 0.048). Mean overall survival duration from symptom onset was significantly longer in female than male patients (female: 39.2 ± 29.04 months; male: 29.4 ± 24.06 months, P = 0.03). In the multivariable Cox regression model, bulbar onset (aHR = 5.28, p = 0.035) correlated with poor survival outcome while longer duration from onset to second symptom (aHR = 0.96, P = 0.037) indicated better survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Bulbar onset was a significant risk predictor for survival. Slower disease progression correlated with better outcomes. Age of onset may differ among ethnic groups. Male patients are more likely to develop Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and have shorter survival duration.","['Deng X', 'Hao Y', 'Xiao B', 'Tan EK', 'Lo YL']",2020,72,,J Clin Neurosci,"Deng X, et al.

31945675,Toward a marker of upper motor neuron impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A fully automatic investigation of the magnetic susceptibility in the precentral cortex.,"PURPOSE: Diagnostic work-up in motor neuron disease (MND) needs a quantitative biomarker of upper motor neuron (UMN) impairment. We investigated the susceptibility properties of the precentral cortex in a cohort of patients affected by Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to obtain a useful biomarker of UMN impairment in a fully automatic paradigm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected imaging and clinical data of 42 ALS patients who had undergone brain 3 T MRI including tridimensional T1-weighted and spoiled gradient-echo multi-echo T2-weighted images. We further acquired images from 23 healthy control (HC) volunteers. The precentral cortex was automatically segmented and the cortical thickness calculated. Histogram metrics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) derived from the quantitative susceptibility map (QSM) were extracted from the automatically segmented precentral cortex. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify the variables predicting the disease status (ALS vs HC), the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and the UMN score.
RESULTS: A decreased cortical thickness (B = 9.40; Wald's test = 7.43; p = 0.006) and increased susceptibility skewness (B = -3.08; Wald's test = 4.36; p = 0.037) independently predicted ALS in a logistic regression model (χ

31932031,Pre-symptomatic diagnosis in ALS.,"Pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains partially understood even though it is accepted worldwide that motor neuron death results from a pluri-factorial process with a variable role of genetic factors. Although not distinguishable from a clinical point of view, familial forms of ALS (fALS, 10% of cases) and sporadic forms (sALS, 90% of cases) can be described. Since the identification of superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1) mutations, more than 30 genes have been linked to fALS. Among these genes, five (C9ORF72, SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, TBK1) seem predominant with mutation frequencies of 40%, 20%, 5%, <5%, <5% in fALS and 6%, 3%, and <1% for the last three in sALS, respectively. The situation that classically leads to request genetic screening is the presence of a familial history of motor neuron disorders (MND) or fronto-temporal lobar dementia (FTLD). However, this dichotomy between fALS and sALS based on familial history can lead to mistakes since illegitimacy, ignorance of MND, FTD or psychiatric disorders within the family due to a familial censorship or lack of familial relationship, or a recessive autosomal inheritance could wrongly lead to failing to recognize a familial form. The significant development of genetic research and easier access to genetic tests in fALS increase the number of situations for which gene mutations are identified. The consequence is an increase in genetic requests from relatives of ALS patients who are eager to know their own genetic status and their own individual risk to develop ALS. Pre-symptomatic testing is thus becoming a daily issue in ALS Centers. This led us to propose a framework for such pre-symptomatic genetic testing for people at risk for developing ALS.","['Corcia P', 'Lumbroso S', 'Cazeneuve C', 'Mouzat K', 'Camu W', ""Vourc'h P"", 'on Behalf the FILSLAN network']",2020,176,3,Rev Neurol (Paris),"Corcia P, et al.

31899971,Dysarthria and other-initiated repair in everyday conversation.,"Dysarthria is commonly understood as a motor speech disorder characterized by symptoms that are framed as physiologically or acoustically measurable. The effects of dysarthria on social interaction through conversation have been reported but, in comparison with physical measures, remain relatively unexplored. Other-initiated repair sequences are particularly common in dysarthria-in-interaction, drawing attention to the actions of both participants in managing (un)intelligibility, rather than the behavior(s) of the person with dysarthric speech in isolation. These sequences merit detailed and ongoing investigation as they enable us to understand how dysarthria impacts on conversation and, critically, how participants attempt to manage difficulties when they arise. This study explores the organization of other-initiated repair sequences in a dyad where one participant has severe dysarthria arising from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also known as MND. Two hours of recordings were collected on four dates over a 12-month period with the data presented here from recording two. The evidence shows that the participants were able to resolve their troubles, but it required extensive work to both identify the trouble sources and to unravel the problems to reach a satisfactory understanding. The interactions presented in this paper reveal an important limitation of other initiation of repair. Physical restrictions were seen to play an important part in the dysarthric speaker's ability to position his talk in sequential context and successfully accomplish self-repair; particularly, third-turn repair. The present study has offered a depiction of layered conversational problems that other-initiation of repair may not completely resolve or, in some cases, multiply.","['Bloch S', 'Barnes S']",2020,34,10-11,Clin Linguist Phon,Bloch S and Barnes S.

31884351,Technical success rate and safety of radiologically inserted gastrostomy versus percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in motor neuron disease patients undergoing: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) have gained increasing popularity among clinicians and motor neuron disease (MND) patients for maintaining adequate nutritional intake. However, there is no consistent evidence of the efficacy and safety of the two techniques in MND patients. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the technical success rates, complication rates and 30-day mortality of MND patients receiving PEG and RIG.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus from inception to September 12, 2019 for comparative studies on the efficacy and safety of PEG and RIG in MND patients. The primary outcome was technical success rate and the secondary outcomes were complication rates and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: Seven studies (n = 603) were included. Pooled technical success rates were 90.15% in patients receiving PEG and 96.76% in patients undergoing RIG. There was a statistically significant difference in the technical success rate between RIG and PEG, strongly favoring RIG [(OR = 3.96, 95% CI (1.31to 12.02); P = .02]. Pooled major complication rates were 2.19% in patients receiving PEG and 0.07% in patients undergoing RIG, with no statistical difference (P = .08). Pooled procedure-related 30-day mortality rates were 5.31% in patients receiving PEG and 6.00% in patients undergoing RIG, with no statistically significant difference (P = .75). No publication bias was noted.
CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis demonstrated that, compared to PEG, RIG has a higher technical success rate and has a comparable mortality outcome and safety profile.","['Yuan TW', 'He Y', 'Wang SB', 'Kong P', 'Cao J']",2020,410,,J Neurol Sci,"Yuan TW, et al.

31871139,Relationship between neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive and behavioural change in MND.,"OBJECTIVE: In this population-based study, we aimed to determine whether neuropsychiatric history, medication or family history of neuropsychiatric disorders predicted cognitive and/or behavioural impairment in motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: People with MND (pwMND) on the Scottish Clinical, Audit, Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND) register, diagnosed from January 2015 to January 2018, with cognitive and/or behavioural data measured using the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen were included. Data were extracted on patient neuropsychiatric, medication and family history of neuropsychiatric disorders. We identified patients with cognitive impairment (motor neuron disease with cognitive impairment (MNDci)), behavioural impairment (motor neuron disease with behavioural impairment (MNDbi), both (motor neuron disease with cognitive and behavioural impairment (MNDcbi)) or motor neuron disease-frontotemporal dementia (MND-FTD).
RESULTS: Data were available for 305 pwMND (mean age at diagnosis=62.26 years, SD=11.40), of which 60 (19.7%) had a neuropsychiatric disorder. A family history of neuropsychiatric disorders was present in 36/231 (15.58%) of patients. Patient premorbid mood disorders were associated with increased apathy (OR=2.78, 95% CI 1.083 to 7.169). A family history of any neuropsychiatric disorder was associated with poorer visuospatial scores, MNDbi (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09 to 8.99) and MND-FTD (OR=5.08, 95% CI 1.26 to 20.40). A family history of mood disorders was associated with poorer overall cognition (exp(b)=0.725, p=0.026), language, verbal fluency and visuospatial scores, and MND-FTD (OR=7.57, 95% CI 1.55 to 46.87). A family history of neurotic disorders was associated with poorer language (exp(b)=0.362, p<0.001), visuospatial scores (exp(b)=0.625, p<0.009) and MND-FTD (OR=13.75, 95% CI 1.71 to 110.86).
CONCLUSION: Neuropsychiatric disorders in patients and their families are associated with cognitive and behavioural changes post-MND diagnosis, with many occurring independently of MND-FTD and C9orf72 status. These findings support an overlap between MND, frontotemporal dementia and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly mood disorders.","['McHutchison CA', 'Leighton DJ', 'McIntosh A', 'Cleary E', 'Warner J', 'Porteous M', 'Chandran S', 'Pal S', 'Abrahams S']",2020,91,3,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"McHutchison CA, et al.

31859009,SQSTM1/p62 variants in 486 patients with familial ALS from Germany and Sweden.,"Several studies reported amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutations in TBK1, OPTN, VCP, UBQLN2, and SQSTM1 genes encoding proteins involved in autophagy. SQSTM1 was originally identified by a candidate gene approach because it encodes p62, a multifunctional protein involved in protein degradation both through proteasomal regulation and autophagy. Both p62 and optineurin (encoded by OPTN) are direct interaction partners and substrates of TBK1, and these 3 proteins form the core of a genetic and functional network that may connect autophagy with ALS. Considering the molecular and conceptual relevance of the TBK1/OPTN/SQSTM1 ""triangle,"" we here performed a targeted screen for SQSTM1 variants in 486 patients with familial ALS from Germany and Sweden by analyzing whole-exome sequencing data. We report 9 novel and 5 previously reported rare variants in SQSTM1 and discuss the current evidence for SQSTM1 as a primary disease gene for ALS. We conclude that the evidence for causality remains vague for SQSTM1 and is weaker than for the other autophagy genes, for example, TBK1 and OPTN.","['Yilmaz R', 'Müller K', 'Brenner D', 'Volk AE', 'Borck G', 'Hermann A', 'Meitinger T', 'Strom TM', 'Danzer KM', 'Ludolph AC', 'Andersen PM', 'Weishaupt JH', 'German ALS Network MND-NET']",2020,87,,Neurobiol Aging,"Yilmaz R, et al.

31857308,Developing a web-based patient decision aid for gastrostomy in motor neuron disease: a study protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a progressive, incurable disease, characterised by degeneration of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord. Due to the multisystem effects of the disease, patients are faced with many complex, time-sensitive decisions, one of which is the decision on gastrostomy feeding. There are currently no published decision aids (DAs) to support patients making this decision in the UK. This study will develop and pilot a patient DA to provide evidence-based information on gastrostomy placement and feeding that is relevant to people with MND; communicate the risks and benefits associated with each option; check understanding and clarify personal values and preferences, enabling patients to make a decision congruent with their values and appropriate for them.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-phase process, observing the International Patient Decision Aid Standards, will be used to develop the DA, over 24 months starting January 2019. Phase 1 will use literature reviews and stakeholder interviews and surveys to identify essential content for the DA, and explore the best way to present this. In the second phase, a prototype DA will be developed and revised using stakeholder feedback in an iterative process. Stakeholders will include individuals with MND, their carers and the healthcare professionals working with them.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study has been granted by West of Scotland Research Ethics Service, reference 19/WS/0078. Study findings will be disseminated through academic and non-academic publications, conference presentations, stakeholder websites and social media. A feasibility study will follow to explore the acceptability and practicality of the DA for patients, carers and HCPs in practice and to assess whether the DA shows promise of being beneficial for the intended population.","['Maunsell R', 'Bloomfield S', 'Erridge C', 'Foster C', 'Hardcastle M', 'Hogden A', 'Kidd A', 'Lisiecka D', 'McDermott CJ', 'Morrison K', 'Recio-Saucedo A', 'Rickenbach L', 'White S', 'Williams P', 'Wheelwright SJ']",2019,9,12,BMJ Open,"Maunsell R, et al.

31853962,Cell-based therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a fatal disease associated with rapidly progressive disability, for which no definitive treatment exists. Current treatment approaches largely focus on relieving symptoms to improve the quality of life of those affected. The therapeutic potential of cell-based therapies in ALS/MND has not been fully evaluated, given the paucity of high-quality clinical trials. Based on data from preclinical studies, cell-based therapy is a promising treatment for ALS/MND. This review was first published in 2015 when the first clinical trials of cell-based therapies were still in progress. We undertook this update to incorporate evidence now available from randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of cell-based therapy for people with ALS/MND, compared with placebo or no treatment.
SEARCH METHODS: On 31 July 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched two clinical trials registries for ongoing or unpublished studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs that assigned people with ALS/MND to receive cell-based therapy versus a placebo or no additional treatment. Co-interventions were allowed, provided that they were given to each group equally.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
MAIN RESULTS: Two RCTs involving 112 participants were eligible for inclusion in this review. One study compared autologous bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) plus riluzole versus control (riluzole only), while the other study compared combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of autologous mesenchymal stem cells secreting neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF) to placebo. The latter study was reported as an abstract and provided no numerical data. Both studies were funded by biotechnology companies. The only study that contributed to the outcome data in the review involved 64 participants, comparing BM-MSC plus riluzole versus control (riluzole only). It reported outcomes after four to six months. It had a low risk of selection bias, detection bias and reporting bias, but a high risk of performance bias and attrition bias. The certainty of evidence was low for all major efficacy outcomes, with imprecision as the main downgrading factor, because the range of plausible estimates, as shown by the 95% confidence intervals (CIs), encompassed a range that would likely result in different clinical decisions. Functional impairment, expressed as the mean change in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score from baseline to six months after cell injection was slightly reduced (better) in the BM-MSC group compared to the control group (mean difference (MD) 3.38, 95% CI 1.22 to 5.54; 1 RCT, 56 participants; low-certainty evidence). ALSFRS-R has a range from 48 (normal) to 0 (maximally impaired); a change of 4 or more points is considered clinically important. The trial did not report outcomes at 12 months. There was no clear difference between the BM-MSC and the no treatment group in change in respiratory function (per cent predicted forced vital capacity; FVC%; MD -0.53, 95% CI -5.37 to 4.31; 1 RCT, 56 participants; low-certainty evidence); overall survival at six months (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 64 participants; low-certainty evidence); risk of total adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19; 1 RCT, 64 participants; low-certainty evidence) or serious adverse events (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.72; 1 RCT, 64 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study did not measure muscle strength.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is a lack of high-certainty evidence to guide practice on the use of cell-based therapy to treat ALS/MND. Uncertainties remain as to whether this mode of therapy is capable of restoring muscle function, slowing disease progression, and improving survival in people with ALS/MND. Although one RCT provided low-certainty evidence that BM-MSC may slightly reduce functional impairment measured on the ALSFRS-R after four to six months, this was a small phase II trial that cannot be used to establish efficacy. We need large, prospective RCTs with long-term follow-up to establish the efficacy and safety of cellular therapy and to determine patient-, disease- and cell treatment-related factors that may influence the outcome of cell-based therapy. The major goals of future research are to determine the appropriate cell source, phenotype, dose and method of delivery, as these will be key elements in designing an optimal cell-based therapy programme for people with ALS/MND. Future research should also explore novel treatment strategies, including combinations of cellular therapy and standard or novel neuroprotective agents, to find the best possible approach to prevent or reverse the neurological deficit in ALS/MND, and to prolong survival in this debilitating and fatal condition.","['Abdul Wahid SF', 'Law ZK', 'Ismail NA', 'Lai NM']",2019,12,12,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Abdul Wahid SF, et al.

31849093,Effect of High-Caloric Nutrition on Survival in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Weight loss has been identified as a negative prognostic factor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but there is no evidence regarding whether a high-caloric diet increases survival. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the efficacy of a high-caloric fatty diet (HCFD) for increasing survival.
METHODS: A 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blinded trial (LIPCAL-ALS study) was conducted between February 2015 and September 2018. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months after randomization. The study was performed at 12 sites of the clinical and scientific network of German motor neuron disease centers (ALS/MND-NET). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either HCFD (405kcal/day, 100% fat) or placebo in addition to riluzole (100mg/day). The primary endpoint was survival time, defined as time to death or time to study cutoff date.
RESULTS: Two hundred one patients (80 female, 121 male, age = 62.4 ± 10.8 years) were included. The confirmatory analysis of the primary outcome survival showed a survival probability of 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27-0.51) in the placebo group and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.25-0.49) in the HCFD group, both after 28 months (point in time of the last event). The hazard ratio was 0.97, 1-sided 97.5% CI = -∞ to 1.44, p = 0.44.
INTERPRETATION: The results provide no evidence for a life-prolonging effect of HCFD for the whole amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population. However, post hoc analysis revealed a significant survival benefit for the subgroup of fast-progressing patients.

31848577,Lipid metabolic pathways converge in motor neuron degenerative diseases.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) encompass an extensive and heterogeneous group of upper and/or lower motor neuron degenerative disorders, in which the particular clinical outcomes stem from the specific neuronal component involved in each condition. While mutations in a large number of molecules associated with lipid metabolism are known to be implicated in MNDs, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the key functional pathways involved, and their inter-relationships. This review highlights evidence that defines defects within two specific lipid (cholesterol/oxysterol and phosphatidylethanolamine) biosynthetic cascades as being centrally involved in MND, particularly hereditary spastic paraplegia. We also identify how other MND-associated molecules may impact these cascades, in particular through impaired organellar interfacing, to propose 'subcellular lipidome imbalance' as a likely common pathomolecular theme in MND. Further exploration of this mechanism has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and management strategies for modulation of disease progression in hereditary spastic paraplegias and other MNDs.","['Rickman OJ', 'Baple EL', 'Crosby AH']",2020,143,4,Brain,"Rickman OJ, et al.

31841614,Mutant C9orf72 human iPSC-derived astrocytes cause non-cell autonomous motor neuron pathophysiology.,"Mutations in C9orf72 are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Accumulating evidence implicates astrocytes as important non-cell autonomous contributors to ALS pathogenesis, although the potential deleterious effects of astrocytes on the function of motor neurons remains to be determined in a completely humanized model of C9orf72-mediated ALS. Here, we use a human iPSC-based model to study the cell autonomous and non-autonomous consequences of mutant C9orf72 expression by astrocytes. We show that mutant astrocytes both recapitulate key aspects of C9orf72-related ALS pathology and, upon co-culture, cause motor neurons to undergo a progressive loss of action potential output due to decreases in the magnitude of voltage-activated Na","['Zhao C', 'Devlin AC', 'Chouhan AK', 'Selvaraj BT', 'Stavrou M', 'Burr K', 'Brivio V', 'He X', 'Mehta AR', 'Story D', 'Shaw CE', 'Dando O', 'Hardingham GE', 'Miles GB', 'Chandran S']",2020,68,5,Glia,"Zhao C, et al.

31795059,Widespread subcortical grey matter degeneration in primary lateral sclerosis: a multimodal imaging study with genetic profiling.,"BACKGROUND: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a low incidence motor neuron disease which carries a markedly better prognosis than amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite sporadic reports of extra-motor symptoms, PLS is widely regarded as a pure upper motor neuron disorder. The post mortem literature of PLS is strikingly sparse and very little is known of subcortical grey matter pathology in this condition.
METHODS: A prospective imaging study was undertaken with 33 PLS patients, 117 healthy controls and 100 ALS patients to specifically assess the integrity of subcortical grey matter structures and determine whether PLS and ALS have divergent thalamic, hippocampal and basal ganglia signatures. Volumetric, morphometric, segmentation and vertex-wise analyses were carried out in the three study groups to evaluate the integrity of thalamus, hippocampus, caudate, amygdala, pallidum, putamen and accumbens nucleus in each hemisphere. The hippocampus was further parcellated to characterise the involvement of specific subfields.
RESULTS: Considerable thalamic, caudate, and hippocampal atrophy was detected in PLS based on both volumetric and vertex analyses. Significant volume reductions were also detected in the accumbens nuclei. Hippocampal atrophy in PLS was dominated by dentate gyrus, hippocampal tail and CA4 subfield volume reductions. The morphometric comparison of ALS and PLS cohorts revealed preferential medial bi-thalamic pathology in PLS compared to the predominant putaminal degeneration detected in ALS. Another distinguishing feature between ALS and PLS was the preferential atrophy of the amygdala in ALS.
CONCLUSIONS: PLS is associated with considerable subcortical grey matter degeneration and due to the extensive extra-motor involvement, it should no longer be regarded a pure upper motor neuron disorder. Given its unique pathological features and a clinical course which differs considerably from ALS, dedicated research studies and disease-specific therapeutic strategies are urgently required in PLS.","['Finegan E', 'Li Hi Shing S', 'Chipika RH', 'Doherty MA', 'Hengeveld JC', 'Vajda A', 'Donaghy C', 'Pender N', 'McLaughlin RL', 'Hardiman O', 'Bede P']",2019,24,,Neuroimage Clin,"Finegan E, et al.

METHODS: A prototype of the PLS Functional Rating Scale (PLSFRS) was generated. Seventy-seven participants with PLS were enrolled and evaluated at 21 sites that comprised the PLSFRS study group. Participants were assessed using the PLSFRS, Neuro-Quality of Life (QoL), Schwab-England Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and the Clinical Global Impression of Change scales. Participants completed telephone assessments at 12, 24, and 48 weeks after enrollment.
RESULTS: The PLSFRS demonstrated internal consistency as well as intrarater, interrater, telephone test-retest reliability, and construct validity. Significant changes in disease progression were detected at 6 and 12 months; changes measured by the PLSFRS vs the ALSFRS-R were significantly higher.
DISCUSSION: The PLSFRS is a valid tool to assess the natural history of PLS in a shorter study period.","['Mitsumoto H', 'Chiuzan C', 'Gilmore M', 'Zhang Y', 'Simmons Z', 'Paganoni S', 'Kisanuki YY', 'Zinman L', 'Jawdat O', 'Sorenson E', 'Floeter MK', 'Pioro EP', 'Fernandes Filho JAM', 'Heitzman D', 'Fournier CN', 'Oskarsson B', 'Heiman-Patterson T', 'Maragakis N', 'Joyce N', 'Hayat G', 'Nations S', 'Scelsa S', 'Walk D', 'Elman L', 'Hupf J', 'McHale B', 'PLSFRS study group']",2020,61,2,Muscle Nerve,"Mitsumoto H, et al.

31735167,Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord masking motor neuron disease: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is a potentially reversible myelopathy typically associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. There is predominant involvement of spinal cord posterior and lateral tracts, and manifestations include peripheral paraesthesia, impaired proprioception, gait disturbance, neuropathy and cognitive changes. Motor neuron disease (MND) is an unremittingly progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving upper and lower motor neurons with an average prognosis of 2-3 years. The diagnosis is clinical and may be supported by electromyography. A subset of MND occurs concurrently with frontotemporal dementia (FTD-MND) and may be initially misdiagnosed as a primary psychotic disorder.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 57-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with confusion and dysarthria. Low vitamin B12 levels and MRI findings led to an initial diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Despite treatment, persistent dysarthria and presence of both upper and lower motor neuron signs on clinical examination prompted further assessment. Electromyography supported the diagnosis of MND. Comorbid chronic paranoid schizophrenia complicated the diagnostic process. We discuss overlapping features between B12 deficiency and MND as well as the neuropsychiatric overlap of B12 deficiency, FTD-MND and chronic schizophrenia.
CONCLUSIONS: Firstly, variability in neurocognitive and imaging manifestations of B12 deficiency can limit delineation of other pathologies. Failure to improve following correction of nutritional deficiencies warrants further investigation for an alternate diagnosis. Secondly, re-evaluation of patients with comorbid mental health conditions is important in reaching timely and accurate diagnoses.","['Loveland P', 'Wong A', 'Vivekanandam V', 'Lim WK']",2019,13,1,J Med Case Rep,"Loveland P, et al.

Riluzole and edaravone are the only approved drugs available in Japan to date. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial in rature, defined as the existence of disease-causing mutation. SOD1 is the most frequent causative gene for ALS among Japanese individuals, while C9orf72 mutation is more prevalent in Western countries. Genotype-phenotype correlation described in the literature of familial ALS enables to establish models of the disease. This review article describes the clinical characteristics of familial ALS based on each disease-causing mutation. The pathomechanism of ALS including proteostasis, RNA metabolism, and axonal pathology are discussed in detail.

31708062,Health Utilities and Costs for Motor Neurone Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) places a significant burden on patients, their carers, and healthcare systems.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate health utilities and costs of MND within the UK setting.
METHODS: Patients with MND, recruited via 22 regional clinics, completed a postal questionnaire of a cost and quality-of-life survey. Health outcome assessment included the EuroQoL (EQ)-5D-5L, EQ-5D-visual analogue scale, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Utility Index, and the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised. Clinical staging was based on the Kings and Milano-Torino (MiToS) systems. The questionnaire asked about patients' use of primary, secondary, and community care services in the previous 3 months. Variability in total costs was examined using regression models.
RESULTS: 595 patients were included in the health utility analysis, of whom 584 patients also completed a resource use questionnaire. Mean health utility decreased and costs increased between consecutive Kings stages, from 0.76 (95% CI 0.71-0.80) and £1096 (£757-£1240) in Kings stage 1, to 0.50 (0.45-0.54) and £3311 (£2666-£4151) in stage 4, respectively. The changes by MiToS stages were from 0.71 (0.69-0.73) and £1115 (£937-£1130) in MiToS stage 0, to 0.25 (0.07-0.42) and £2899 (£2190-£3840) in stage 2. Kings stages 3 and 4 and MiToS stages 1 and 2, respectively, were significant in explaining variability in total costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of MND on health utilities and costs differs by disease severity.

31696638,Thalamic nuclei in frontotemporal dementia: Mediodorsal nucleus involvement is universal but pulvinar atrophy is unique to C9orf72.,"Thalamic atrophy is a common feature across all forms of FTD but little is known about specific nuclei involvement. We aimed to investigate in vivo atrophy of the thalamic nuclei across the FTD spectrum. A cohort of 402 FTD patients (age: mean(SD) 64.3(8.2) years; disease duration: 4.8(2.8) years) was compared with 104 age-matched controls (age: 62.5(10.4) years), using an automated segmentation of T1-weighted MRIs to extract volumes of 14 thalamic nuclei. Stratification was performed by clinical diagnosis (180 behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), 85 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), 114 nonfluent variant PPA (nfvPPA), 15 PPA not otherwise specified (PPA-NOS), and 8 with associated motor neurone disease (FTD-MND), genetic diagnosis (27 MAPT, 28 C9orf72, 18 GRN), and pathological confirmation (37 tauopathy, 38 TDP-43opathy, 4 FUSopathy). The mediodorsal nucleus (MD) was the only nucleus affected in all FTD subgroups (16-33% smaller than controls). The laterodorsal nucleus was also particularly affected in genetic cases (28-38%), TDP-43 type A (47%), tau-CBD (44%), and FTD-MND (53%). The pulvinar was affected only in the C9orf72 group (16%). Both the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei were also affected in the genetic cases (10-20%), particularly the LGN in C9orf72 expansion carriers. Use of individual thalamic nuclei volumes provided higher accuracy in discriminating between FTD groups than the whole thalamic volume. The MD is the only structure affected across all FTD groups. Differential involvement of the thalamic nuclei among FTD forms is seen, with a unique pattern of atrophy in the pulvinar in C9orf72 expansion carriers.","['Bocchetta M', 'Iglesias JE', 'Neason M', 'Cash DM', 'Warren JD', 'Rohrer JD']",2020,41,4,Hum Brain Mapp,"Bocchetta M, et al.

31696295,"Do pain, anxiety and depression influence quality of life for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease? A national study reconciling previous conflicting literature.","INTRODUCTION: The importance of elucidating the relationships between pain, mood and quality of life (QoL) amongst people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease is evident to clinicians, yet the literature is limited and inconsistent. We explored the relationships between pain, depression, anxiety and QoL to reconcile the previous contrasting findings and inform future research and clinical practice.
METHODS: Patient-reported outcomes were obtained as part of the Trajectories of Outcomes in Neurological Conditions study. Mood and QoL scales underwent Rasch analysis. Correlation coefficients examined the strength of association between variables of interest. A bivariate regression model was developed to examine the effects of pain, depression and anxiety on joint psychological and physical QoL domains.
RESULTS: Of 636 people with ALS, 69% reported pain, of these most had mild pain. Seven percent (7%) of participants exceeded published cutoffs for probable depression and 14% had probable anxiety. Pain, depression and anxiety all influence quality of life; depression has a significant effect on both physical and psychological domains of QoL, whereas pain affects physical QoL and anxiety psychological QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show the importance of expressing quality of life in a conceptually appropriate way, as failing to take account of the multidimensional nature of QoL can result in important nuances being overlooked. Clinicians must be aware that pain, depression and anxiety all worsen QoL across their ranges, and not just when pain is severe or when anxiety or depression reach case level.","['Edge R', 'Mills R', 'Tennant A', 'Diggle PJ', 'Young CA', 'TONiC study group']",2020,267,3,J Neurol,"Edge R, et al.

31655407,Factors contributing to delays in the diagnosis of motor neuron disease - A South Australian study.,"OBJECTIVE(S): To characterize the clinical factors that influence time to diagnosis of motor neuron disease (MND) in a cohort of patients living in South Australia.
DESIGN: A retrospective study.
SETTING: Single centre study of patients managed at a tertiary referral hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with MND living in South Australia enrolled in the Australian MND Registry between January 2016 and January 2018. One participant was excluded as study variables of interest were missing.
RESULTS: The mean time to diagnosis was 13 ± 1 months (median 11 months; range 1-38 months) from symptom onset. 41% of patients were classified as having fast disease progression; mean age of disease onset of those with fast disease progression was significantly later in life compared to those with slow disease progression (68 ± 10 years vs 64 ± 8 years) (P < .05, t = -3.921, df = 220). Patients with fast disease progression were diagnosed significantly earlier than those with slow disease progression (8 ± 1 months vs 16 ± 2 months) (P < .0001, t = 34.6, df = 220), were less likely to undergo multiple specialist opinions prior to referral to a neurologist (53% vs 73%) (P < .05, Chi-squared = 9.5, df = 1), and were significantly more disabled at time of diagnosis (mean ALSFRS-R 33 ± 5) than those with slow disease progression (mean ALSFRS-R 41 ± 5) (P < .0001, t = 12.4, df = 220).
CONCLUSION(S): Fast disease progression identifies a dichotomy of MND patients that are diagnosed earlier, probable because they are more disabled at diagnosis, likely mediated by a more efficient referral process. A greater awareness of the disease and increased accessibility to neurologists is required to shorten time to diagnosis.","['Sharrad DF', 'Schultz DW']",2019,407,,J Neurol Sci,Sharrad DF and Schultz DW.

31640994,Process evaluation and exploration of telehealth in motor neuron disease in a UK specialist centre.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the processes involved in using a novel digitally enabled healthcare system (telehealth in motor neuron disease (TiM)) in people living with motor neuron disease (MND) and their informal carers. We examined TiM implementation, potential mechanisms of impact and contextual factors that might influence TiM implementation or impact.
DESIGN: An 18-month, single-centre process evaluation within a randomised, pilot and feasibility study.
INTERVENTION: TiM plus usual care versus usual care alone.
SETTING: A specialist UK MND care centre.
PARTICIPANTS: 40 patients with MND and 37 primary informal carers.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient, carer and staff outcomes and experiences using semistructured interviews. Descriptive data on implementation and use of TiM.
RESULTS: The TiM was acceptable and accessible to patients, carers and staff. Intervention uptake and adherence were good: 14 (70%) patients completed a TiM session at least fortnightly. Barriers to TiM use (such as technology experience and disability) were overcome with well-designed technology and face-to-face training. Reported potential benefits of TiM included improved communication and care coordination, reassurance, identification of complications and the potential for TiM to be an alternative or addition to clinic. Benefits depended on patients' current level of needs or disability. The main challenges were the large number of alerts that were generated by TiM, how the clinicians responded to these alerts and the mismatch between patient/carer expectations and nurses actions. This could be improved by better communication systems and adjusting the alerts algorithm.
CONCLUSION: TiM has the potential to facilitate access to specialist care, but further iterative developments to the intervention and process evaluations of the TiM in different services are required.

31640993,Using telehealth in motor neuron disease to increase access to specialist multidisciplinary care: a UK-based pilot and feasibility study.,"OBJECTIVES: Care of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) in a specialist, multidisciplinary clinic is associated with improved survival, but access is not universal. We wanted to pilot and establish the feasibility of a definitive trial of a novel telehealth system (Telehealth in Motor neuron disease, TiM) in patients with MND.
DESIGN: An 18-month, single-centre, mixed-methods, randomised, controlled pilot and feasibility study.
INTERVENTION: TiM telehealth plus usual care versus usual care.
SETTING: A specialist MND care centre in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with MND and their primary informal carers.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment, retention and data collection rates, clinical outcomes including participant quality of life and anxiety and depression.
RESULTS: Recruitment achieved the target of 40 patients and 37 carers. Participant characteristics reflected those attending the specialist clinic and included those with severe disability and those with limited experience of technology. Retention and data collection was good. Eighty per cent of patients and 82% of carer participants reported outcome measures were completed at 6 months. Using a longitudinal analysis with repeated measures of quality of life (QoL), a sample size of 131 per arm is recommended in a definitive trial. The methods and intervention were acceptable to participants who were highly motivated to participate to research. The low burden of participation and accessibility of the intervention meant barriers to participation were minimal. However, the study highlighted difficulties assessing the associated costs of the intervention, the challenge of recruitment in such a rare disease and the difficulties of producing rigorous evidence of impact in such a complex intervention.
CONCLUSION: A definitive trial of TiM is feasible but challenging. The complexity of the intervention and heterogeneity of the patient population means that a randomised controlled trial may not be the best way to evaluate the further development and implementation of the TiM.

31626077,Development and Validation of the Self-care in Motor Neuron Disease Index.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically test the properties of the Self-care in Motor Neuron Disease (SCMND) Index.
METHODS: This instrument development and validation study was conducted in 3 phases. The first is to identify self-care behaviors in people with motor neuron disease (MND), and the second is to evaluate the content validity of the SCMND Index. Then, between March 2017 and March 2018, the tool was administered to 107 people with MND for psychometric tests.
RESULTS: The SCMND Index was developed based on the middle-range theory of self-care of chronic illness, including 15 self-care behaviors related to respiration, nutrition, mobility, medication, medical visits, and complication management. Content validity was excellent. Data analysis suggests that the instrument has a good internal consistency in all 3 domains and excellent reproducibility. Increased self-care behaviors' median values were associated with mechanical ventilation, cough assistance, and dysphagia. Domains differed significantly based on access (maintenance), hospital admissions (monitoring and management), and respiratory infection (management).
CONCLUSIONS: Self-care is a patient-centered outcome, and it is a key point of healthcare. Results suggest that the SCMND Index is useful for both clinicians and researchers to evaluate self-care in MND.","['Bassola B', 'Lizio A', 'Lucchini M', 'Sansone VA', 'Lusignani M']",2019,51,6,J Neurosci Nurs,"Bassola B, et al.

31624953,Longitudinal multi-modal muscle-based biomarker assessment in motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical phenotypic heterogeneity represents a major barrier to trials in motor neuron disease (MND) and objective surrogate outcome measures are required, especially for slowly progressive patients. We assessed responsiveness of clinical, electrophysiological and radiological muscle-based assessments to detect MND-related progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 29 MND patients and 22 healthy controls was performed. Clinical measures, electrophysiological motor unit number index/size (MUNIX/MUSIX) and relative T2- and diffusion-weighted whole-body muscle magnetic resonance (MR) were assessed three times over 12 months. Multi-variable regression models assessed between-group differences, clinico-electrophysiological associations, and longitudinal changes. Standardized response means (SRMs) assessed sensitivity to change over 12 months.
RESULTS: MND patients exhibited 18% higher whole-body mean muscle relative T2-signal than controls (95% CI 7-29%, p < 0.01), maximal in leg muscles (left tibialis anterior 71% (95% CI 33-122%, p < 0.01). Clinical and electrophysiological associations were evident. By 12 months, 16 patients had died or could not continue. In the remainder, relative T2-signal increased over 12 months by 14-29% in right tibialis anterior, right quadriceps, bilateral hamstrings and gastrocnemius/soleus (p < 0.01), independent of onset-site, and paralleled progressive weakness and electrophysiological loss of motor units. Highest clinical, electrophysiological and radiological SRMs were found for revised ALS-functional rating scale scores (1.22), tibialis anterior MUNIX (1.59), and relative T2-weighted leg muscle MR (right hamstrings: 0.98), respectively. Diffusion MR detected minimal changes.
CONCLUSION: MUNIX and relative T2-weighted MR represent objective surrogate markers of progressive denervation in MND. Radiological changes were maximal in leg muscles, irrespective of clinical onset-site.","['Jenkins TM', 'Alix JJP', 'Fingret J', 'Esmail T', 'Hoggard N', 'Baster K', 'McDermott CJ', 'Wilkinson ID', 'Shaw PJ']",2020,267,1,J Neurol,"Jenkins TM, et al.

31616242,Kynurenine Pathway Metabolites as Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) currently lacks a robust and well-defined biomarker that can 1) assess the progression of the disease, 2) predict and/or delineate the various clinical subtypes, and 3) evaluate or predict a patient's response to treatments. The kynurenine Pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation represent a promising candidate as it is involved with several neuropathological features present in ALS including neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, immune system activation and dysregulation of energy metabolism. Some of the KP metabolites (KPMs) can cross the blood brain barrier, and many studies have shown their levels are dysregulated in major neurodegenerative diseases including ALS. The KPMs can be easily analyzed in body fluids and tissue and as they are small molecules, and are stable. KPMs have a Janus face action, they can be either or both neurotoxic and/or neuroprotective depending of their levels. This mini review examines and presents evidence supporting the use of KPMs as a relevant set of biomarkers for ALS, and highlights the criteria required to achieve a valid biomarker set for ALS.","['Tan VX', 'Guillemin GJ']",2019,13,,Front Neurosci,Tan VX and Guillemin GJ.

31594549,Extensive transcriptomic study emphasizes importance of vesicular transport in C9orf72 expansion carriers.,"The majority of the clinico-pathological variability observed in patients harboring a repeat expansion in the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex subunit (C9orf72) remains unexplained. This expansion, which represents the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND), results in a loss of C9orf72 expression and the generation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. The C9orf72 protein itself plays a role in vesicular transport, serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPases. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying C9orf72-related diseases and to identify potential disease modifiers, we performed an extensive RNA sequencing study. We included individuals for whom frontal cortex tissue was available: FTLD and FTLD/MND patients with (n = 34) or without (n = 44) an expanded C9orf72 repeat as well as control subjects (n = 24). In total, 6706 genes were differentially expressed between these groups (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). The top gene was C9orf72 (FDR = 1.41E-14), which was roughly two-fold lower in C9orf72 expansion carriers than in (disease) controls. Co-expression analysis revealed groups of correlated genes (modules) that were enriched for processes such as protein folding, RNA splicing, synaptic signaling, metabolism, and Golgi vesicle transport. Within our cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, machine learning uncovered interesting candidates associated with clinico-pathological features, including age at onset (vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGFA]), C9orf72 expansion size (cyclin dependent kinase like 1 [CDKL1]), DPR protein levels (eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase [EEF2K]), and survival after onset (small G protein signaling modulator 3 [SGSM3]). Given the fact that we detected a module involved in vesicular transport in addition to a GTPase activator (SGSM3) as a potential modifier, our findings seem to suggest that the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion might hamper vesicular transport and that genes affecting this process may modify the phenotype of C9orf72-linked diseases.","['Dickson DW', 'Baker MC', 'Jackson JL', 'DeJesus-Hernandez M', 'Finch NA', 'Tian S', 'Heckman MG', 'Pottier C', 'Gendron TF', 'Murray ME', 'Ren Y', 'Reddy JS', 'Graff-Radford NR', 'Boeve BF', 'Petersen RC', 'Knopman DS', 'Josephs KA', 'Petrucelli L', 'Oskarsson B', 'Sheppard JW', 'Asmann YW', 'Rademakers R', 'van Blitterswijk M']",2019,7,1,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Dickson DW, et al.

31558653,Development and assessment of the inter-rater and intra-rater reproducibility of a self-administration version of the ALSFRS-R.,"OBJECTIVE: The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) is widely applied to assess disease severity and progression in patients with motor neuron disease (MND). The objective of the study is to assess the inter-rater and intra-rater reproducibility, i.e., the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability and agreement, of a self-administration version of the ALSFRS-R for use in apps, online platforms, clinical care and trials.
METHODS: The self-administration version of the ALSFRS-R was developed based on both patient and expert feedback. To assess the inter-rater reproducibility, 59 patients with MND filled out the ALSFRS-R online and were subsequently assessed on the ALSFRS-R by three raters. To assess the intra-rater reproducibility, patients were invited on two occasions to complete the ALSFRS-R online. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients, agreement was assessed with Bland-Altman plots and paired samples 
RESULTS: The self-administration version of the ALSFRS-R demonstrated excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. The assessment of inter-rater agreement demonstrated small systematic differences between patients and raters and acceptable limits of agreement. The assessment of intra-rater agreement demonstrated no systematic changes between time points; limits of agreement were 4.3 points for the total score and ranged from 1.6 to 2.4 points for the domain scores. Coefficient alpha values were acceptable.
DISCUSSION: The self-administration version of the ALSFRS-R demonstrates high reproducibility and can be used in apps and online portals for both individual comparisons, facilitating the management of clinical care and group comparisons in clinical trials.","['Bakker LA', 'Schröder CD', 'Tan HHG', 'Vugts SMAG', 'van Eijk RPA', 'van Es MA', 'Visser-Meily JMA', 'van den Berg LH']",2020,91,1,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Bakker LA, et al.

31552724,Automated Brainstem Segmentation Detects Differential Involvement in Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes.,"OBJECTIVE: Brainstem segmentation has been useful in identifying potential imaging biomarkers for diagnosis and progression in atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS). However, the majority of work has been performed using manual segmentation, which is time consuming for large cohorts.
METHODS: We investigated brainstem involvement in APS using an automated method. We measured the volume of the medulla, pons, superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) and midbrain from T1-weighted MRIs in 67 patients and 42 controls. Diagnoses were corticobasal syndrome (CBS, n = 14), multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 16: 8 with parkinsonian syndrome, MSA-P; 8 with cerebellar syndrome, MSA-C), progressive supranuclear palsy with a Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS, n = 12), variant PSP (n = 18), and APS not otherwise specified (APS-NOS, n = 7).
RESULTS: All brainstem regions were smaller in MSA-C (19-42% volume difference, p < 0.0005) and in both PSP groups (18-33%, p < 0.0005) than in controls. MSA-P showed lower volumes in all regions except the SCP (15-26%, p < 0.0005). The most affected region in MSA-C and MSA-P was the pons (42% and 26%, respectively), while the most affected regions in both the PSP-RS and variant PSP groups were the SCP (33% and 23%, respectively) and midbrain (26% and 24%, respectively). The brainstem was less affected in CBS, but nonetheless, the pons (14%, p < 0.0005), midbrain (14%, p < 0.0005) and medulla (10%, p = 0.001) were significantly smaller in CBS than in controls. The brainstem was unaffected in APS-NOS.
CONCLUSION: Automated methods can accurately quantify the involvement of brainstem structures in APS. This will be important in future trials with large patient numbers where manual segmentation is unfeasible.","['Bocchetta M', 'Iglesias JE', 'Chelban V', 'Jabbari E', 'Lamb R', 'Russell LL', 'Greaves CV', 'Neason M', 'Cash DM', 'Thomas DL', 'Warren JD', 'Woodside J', 'Houlden H', 'Morris HR', 'Rohrer JD']",2020,13,1,J Mov Disord,"Bocchetta M, et al.

31552549,Neurofilament light chain in serum of adolescent and adult SMA patients under treatment with nusinersen.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic and monitoring value of serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
METHODS: We measured serum NfL in 46 SMA patients at baseline and over 14 months of treatment with the antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO) nusinersen using the ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology. Serum NfL levels of SMA patients were compared to controls and related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NfL, blood-CSF barrier function quantified by the albumin blood/CSF ratio (Qalb) and motor scores (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded, HFMSE; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, ALSFRS-R).
RESULTS: Serum NfL levels of SMA patients were in the range of controls (p = 0.316) and did not correlate with CSF NfL (ρ = 0.302, p = 0.142) or Qalb (ρ = - 0.160, p = 0.293). During therapy, serum NfL levels were relatively stable with notable concentration changes in single SMA patients, however, within the control range. Higher NfL levels were associated with worse motor performance in SMA (baseline: HFMSE ρ = - 0.330, p = 0.025, ALSFRS-R ρ = - 0.403, p = 0.005; after 10 months: HFMSE ρ = - 0.525, p = 0.008, ALSFRS-R ρ = - 0.537, p = 0.007), but changes in motor scores did not correlate with changes in serum NfL.
CONCLUSION: Diagnostic and monitoring performance of serum NfL measurement seems to differ between SMA subtypes. Unlike to SMA type 1, in adolescent and adult SMA type 2 and 3 patients, neurodegeneration is not reflected by increased NfL levels and short-term therapeutic effects cannot be observed. Long-term follow-up has to be performed to see if even low levels of NfL might be good prognostic markers.","['Wurster CD', 'Steinacker P', 'Günther R', 'Koch JC', 'Lingor P', 'Uzelac Z', 'Witzel S', 'Wollinsky K', 'Winter B', 'Osmanovic A', 'Schreiber-Katz O', 'Al Shweiki R', 'Ludolph AC', 'Petri S', 'Hermann A', 'Otto M', 'MND-Net']",2020,267,1,J Neurol,"Wurster CD, et al.

31512539,Experience of telehealth in people with motor neurone disease using noninvasive ventilation.,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence is emerging that telehealth provides timely and cost-effective support for individuals with motor neurone disease (MND). However, little is known about the subjective experience of using telehealth. This study was designed to examine the experiences of using telemonitoring in patients with MND on noninvasive ventilation (NIV).
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven patients (five males; mean age = 63 yrs; median illness duration = 14 m), who used a telemonitoring device for 24 weeks. Caregivers were present at five of the interviews; they supported communications and provided their feedback. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted to find overarching themes.
RESULTS: Five themes were identified: Benefits of Timely Intervention, Reducing the Unnecessary, Increased Self-Awareness, Taking Initiative, and Technical Challenges. Overall, timely interventions were observed as a result of regular monitoring, contributing to both physical and psychological well-being of the participants. The patient-caregiver dyads suggested that telemonitoring could reduce costs, save time and ameliorate hassles associated with attending hospital appointments. Participants articulated that telemonitoring enabled symptom awareness and interpretation; the device also enabled the participants to raise concerns and/or requests to the healthcare professionals via the messaging system. Participants confirmed that the telemonitoring device was easy to use, despite some technical issues.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring was positively experienced. The findings suggest this approach is empowering and effective in promoting patients' well-being, while potentially reducing unnecessary clinical contact.Implications for RehabilitationCare for people with MND demands a flexible approach to accommodate the diversity of clinical needs and relentless physical deterioration.Telehealth allows clinicians to provide person-centred care for everyone with MND through frequent monitoring.Holistic and rehabilitative service facilitated by telehealth is generally acceptable and preferred to routine appointments among MND NIV patients.Telehealth promotes time efficient engagement with professionals that leads to symptom awareness and interpretation, while benefiting physical and psychological well-being of MND NIV patients.","['Ando H', 'Ashcroft-Kelso H', 'Halhead R', 'Chakrabarti B', 'Young CA', 'Cousins R', 'Angus RM']",2021,16,5,Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol,"Ando H, et al.

31508679,Relationship between oral transit time and functional performance in motor neuron disease.,"Oral phase swallowing impairment in motor neuron disease (MND) is caused by tongue weakness, fasciculation and atrophy, which may compromise oral transit time and total feeding time. OBJECTIVE To describe and correlate total oral transit time (TOTT) with functional performance in MND using different food consistencies. METHODS The study was conducted on 20 patients with MND, regardless of type or duration of the disease, of whom nine were excluded due to issues on the videofluoroscopic swallowing images. The remaining 11 patients (nine men and two women) ranged from 31 to 87 years of age (mean: 57 years) with scores on the Penetration Aspiration Scale ranging from ≤ 2 to ≤ 4. The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - revised questionnaire was applied to classify individuals according to global, bulbar and bulbar/respiratory parameters. Videofluoroscopy of swallowing using 5ml of different consistencies was performed and a quantitative temporal analysis of the TOTT was carried out with the aid of specific software. RESULTS There was a wide variation in the TOTT within the same food consistency among MND patients. There was a correlation between the TOTT and overall functional performance for the thickened liquid consistency (r = -0.691) and between the TOTT and bulbar performance for the pureed consistency (r = -0.859). CONCLUSION Total oral transit time in MND varies within the same food consistency and the longer the TOTT, regardless of food consistency, the lower the functional performance in MND.","['Brandão BC', 'Silva MAOMD', 'Cola PC', 'Silva RGD']",2019,77,8,Arq Neuropsiquiatr,"Brandão BC, et al.

31499409,Cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of the upper cervical spinal cord in motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular disease characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. While neuroimaging studies of the brain can detect upper motor neuron degeneration, these brain MRI scans also include the upper part of the cervical spinal cord, which offers the possibility to expand the focus also towards lower motor neuron degeneration. Here, we set out to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal disease effects in the upper cervical spinal cord in patients with ALS, progressive muscular atrophy (PMA: primarily lower motor neuron involvement) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS: primarily upper motor neuron involvement), and their relation to disease severity and grey and white matter brain measurements.
METHODS: We enrolled 108 ALS patients without C9orf72 repeat expansion (ALS C9-), 26 ALS patients with C9orf72 repeat expansion (ALS C9+), 28 PLS patients, 56 PMA patients and 114 controls. During up to five visits, longitudinal T1-weighted brain MRI data were acquired and used to segment the upper cervical spinal cord (UCSC, up to C3) and individual cervical segments (C1 to C4) to calculate cross-sectional areas (CSA). Using linear (mixed-effects) models, the CSA differences were assessed between groups and correlated with disease severity. Furthermore, a relationship between CSA and brain measurements was examined in terms of cortical thickness of the precentral gyrus and white matter integrity of the corticospinal tract.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, CSAs at baseline showed significantly thinner UCSC in all groups in the MND spectrum. Over time, ALS C9- patients demonstrated significant thinning of the UCSC and, more specifically, of segment C3 compared to controls. Progressive thinning over time was also observed in C1 of PMA patients, while ALS C9+ and PLS patients did not show any longitudinal changes. Longitudinal spinal cord measurements showed a significant relationship with disease severity and we found a significant correlation between spinal cord and motor cortex thickness or corticospinal tract integrity for PLS and PMA, but not for ALS patients.
DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate atrophy of the upper cervical spinal cord in the motor neuron disease spectrum, which was progressive over time for all but PLS patients. Cervical spinal cord imaging in ALS seems to capture different disease effects than brain neuroimaging. Atrophy of the cervical spinal cord is therefore a promising additional biomarker for both diagnosis and disease progression and could help in the monitoring of treatment effects in future clinical trials.","['van der Burgh HK', 'Westeneng HJ', 'Meier JM', 'van Es MA', 'Veldink JH', 'Hendrikse J', 'van den Heuvel MP', 'van den Berg LH']",2019,24,,Neuroimage Clin,"van der Burgh HK, et al.

31498468,Neuropathological characterization of a novel TANK binding kinase (TBK1) gene loss of function mutation associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"AIMS: Mutations in TANK binding kinase gene (TBK1) are causative in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), however correlations between clinical features and TBK1 mutations have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to identify and compare TBK1 mutations to clinical features in a cohort of ALS patients from Northern England.
METHODS: TBK1 mutations were analysed in 290 ALS cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed in brain and spinal cord of one case with a novel in-frame deletion.
RESULTS: Seven TBK1 variants were identified, including one novel in-frame deletion (p.85delIle). In silico analysis and literature suggested four variants were pathogenic, and three were variants of uncertain significance or benign. Post-mortem immunohistochemistry established an individual with the novel in-frame deletion had classical ALS and Type B FTLD-TDP pathology, with no changes in TBK1 staining or interferon regulatory factor IRF3.
CONCLUSIONS: TBK1 mutations were present in 1.38% of our cohort, and screening showed no clear genotype-phenotype associations compared to other genetic and sporadic ALS cases. TBK1 immunohistochemistry was consistent with previously published literature and we are the first to show no differential expression of interferon regulatory factor IRF3, a downstream effector of TBK1 in the immune pathway, in the TBK1-mutant tissue, compared to controls.","['Weinreich M', 'Shepheard SR', 'Verber N', 'Wyles M', 'Heath PR', 'Highley JR', 'Kirby J', 'Shaw PJ']",2020,46,3,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Weinreich M, et al.

31480725,Production of β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and Its Isomers by Freshwater Diatoms.,"β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a non-protein amino acid that has been implicated as a risk factor for motor neurone disease (MND). BMAA is produced by a wide range of cyanobacteria globally and by a small number of marine diatoms. BMAA is commonly found with two of its constitutional isomers: 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB), and N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine (AEG). The isomer 2,4-DAB, like BMAA, has neurotoxic properties. While many studies have shown BMAA production by cyanobacteria, few studies have looked at other algal groups. Several studies have shown BMAA production by marine diatoms; however, there are no studies examining freshwater diatoms. This study aimed to determine if some freshwater diatoms produced BMAA, and which diatom taxa are capable of BMAA, 2,4-DAB and AEG production. Five axenic diatom cultures were established from river and lake sites across eastern Australia. Cultures were harvested during the stationary growth phase and intracellular amino acids were extracted. Using liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), diatom extracts were analysed for the presence of both free and protein-associated BMAA, 2,4-DAB and AEG. Of the five diatom cultures analysed, four were found to have detectable BMAA and AEG, while 2,4-DAB was found in all cultures. These results show that BMAA production by diatoms is not confined to marine genera and that the prevalence of these non-protein amino acids in Australian freshwater environments cannot be solely attributed to cyanobacteria.","['Violi JP', 'Facey JA', 'Mitrovic SM', 'Colville A', 'Rodgers KJ']",2019,11,9,Toxins (Basel),"Violi JP, et al.

31469706,Validity and Reliability of the Turkish Version of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to adapt the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire (ALSAQ), developed for the evaluation of quality of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, into the Turkish society.
METHODS: This methodological study was conducted in 92 ALS patients registered in 2 chapters (Istanbul and Izmir) of Turkish ALS-Motor Neuron Diseases Association. The expert opinion and forward-backward translation methods were applied for the linguistic validity of the ALSAQ (long and short versions: ALSAQ-40 and ALSAQ-5, respectively).
RESULTS: In the analysis of internal consistency, the Cronbach's α reliability coefficient was .96 for the total scale, whereas it was between .88 and .98 for the 5 dimensions. The dimensions of the long form were correlated with the items of the short form.
CONCLUSION: The Turkish versions of the ALSAQ short and long forms are valid and reliable tools to be used in the assessment of the quality of life in ALS patients.","['Alankaya N', 'Tülek Z', 'Özakgül A', 'Kaya A', 'Dik A']",2019,51,5,J Neurosci Nurs,"Alankaya N, et al.

31450699,Diagnostic and Prognostic Role of Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid and Blood Neurofilaments in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Review of the Literature.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) that still lacks an efficacious therapy. The failure of recent therapeutic trials in ALS, other than depending on the poor knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms responsible for MNs loss, is largely due to diagnostic delay and the lack of reliable biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and response to pharmacologic intervention. Neurofilaments (Nfs) are neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins, whose levels increased in biological fluids proportionally to the degree of axonal damage, both in normal and in pathologic conditions, representing potential biomarkers in various neurological disorders, such as motor neuron disorder (MND). Growing evidence has shown that phosphorylated neurofilaments heavy chain (p-NfH) and neurofilaments light chain (NfL) are increased in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients compared to healthy and neurological controls and are found to correlate with disease progression. In this review, we reported the most relevant studies investigating the diagnostic and prognostic role of Nfs in ALS. Given their reliability and reproducibility, we consider Nfs as promising and useful biomarkers in diagnosis of MND, early patient identification for inclusion in clinical trials, prediction of disease progression, and response to pharmacological intervention, and we suggest the validation of their measurement in clinical activity.","['Gagliardi D', 'Meneri M', 'Saccomanno D', 'Bresolin N', 'Comi GP', 'Corti S']",2019,20,17,Int J Mol Sci,"Gagliardi D, et al.

31449739,Health care professionals' views on psychological factors affecting nutritional behaviour in people with motor neuron disease: A thematic analysis.,"UNLABELLED: Motor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive muscle paralysis and typically leads to death within 3 years. As no cure is currently available, symptomatic management is the mainstay of treatment. An important part of this is optimizing nutritional intake with evidence that this may positively affect survival and quality of life. Health care professionals (HCPs) play a pivotal role in nutritional management of people with MND (pwMND) but, to date, their views on the psychological barriers faced by pwMND have not been explored. Such an exploration may identify ways in which the delivery of nutritional care for pwMND can be optimized.
METHODS: Five qualitative focus groups were carried out across the United Kingdom in June 2018 with 51 participants, including 47 HCPs involved with MND care and four service user representatives. Data were analysed through thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Four overarching themes were identified: psychological adjustment and patient engagement; nutrition and the need for control; knowledge of nutrition and the complexity of MND; and the psychosocial nature of eating.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the nutritional management of pwMND should be mindful of factors such as the impact of distress at the time of diagnosis, the availability of clear information on nutrition and MND, as well as the importance of illness perceptions and coping strategies. Moreover, tailored psychological interventions should be considered to mitigate the impact on MND on the experience of eating. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Since weight loss and reduced body mass index (BMI) have been identified as independent risk factors for prognosis and survival in motor neuron disease (MND), nutritional management represents an important component of the symptomatic care of people with MND (pwMND) aimed at prolonging survival and maintaining or improving quality of life. However, the current guidelines and quantitative and qualitative literature on the topic are mainly focused on issues around enteral feeding and gastrostomy insertion, and very little is currently known about potential psychological enablers or barriers to earlier nutritional management, especially from the perspectives of health care professionals (HCPs) involved in the delivery of nutritional care in pwMND. What does this study add? First qualitative investigation of enablers or barriers to nutritional care in pwMND from the perspective of HCPs. New insight into psychological factors (e.g., adjustment, avoidance, loss of control) in nutritional care for pwMND. Practical implications and novel clinical suggestions for HCPs involved in nutritional care of pwMND.","['Zarotti N', 'Coates E', 'McGeachan A', 'Williams I', 'Beever D', 'Hackney G', 'Norman P', 'Stavroulakis T', 'White D', 'White S', 'Halliday V', 'McDermott C', 'HighCALS Study Group']",2019,24,4,Br J Health Psychol,"Zarotti N, et al.

31402622,Regional motor cortex dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiological processes underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) need to be better understood, although cortical dysfunction has been implicated. Previous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have assessed cortical dysfunction from the hand. The aim of the present study was to determine whether cortical dysfunction was evident across representations of three body regions, and to relate these changes to clinical features of ALS.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, threshold tracking TMS was undertaken in 60 sporadic ALS patients, with motor evoked potential (MEP) responses recorded over the hand (abductor pollicis brevis), lower limb (tibialis anterior), and bulbar (trapezius) regions. The cross-sectional findings were compared to 28 age- and gender-matched controls.
RESULTS: Cortical dysfunction was evident across the representation of the three body regions, although the degree and nature of the dysfunction varied. Cortical hyperexcitability, as heralded by reduced short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), was evident in all cortical regions (hand, P < 0.01; leg, P < 0.05; bulbar, P < 0.05) in ALS patients when compared with healthy control subjects. Importantly, features of cortical hyperexcitability seemed more prominent in clinically affected body regions and correlated with functional disability and muscle weakness. Cortical inexcitability was more prominent in the leg (P < 0.001) and bulbar regions (P < 0.01) when compared with controls.
INTERPRETATION: The nature of cortical dysfunction varied across the body regions in ALS, with cortical hyperexcitability being more prominent in the upper limbs while cortical inexcitability was more evident in the lower limbs and bulbar regions. The findings suggest a heterogeneity of cortical pathophysiological processes in ALS.","['Menon P', 'Yiannikas C', 'Kiernan MC', 'Vucic S']",2019,6,8,Ann Clin Transl Neurol,"Menon P, et al.

31373263,Family Caregivers' Experiences with Dying and Bereavement of Individuals with Motor Neuron Disease in India.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Ideal management plan in MND includes palliative care initiated from the time of diagnosis. At present, most of the neurodegenerative conditions are cared for at home. Neuropalliative care is an emerging concept in India and social workers are integral team members in this process. The primary aims of the study were to explore (a) the caregivers' experiences of the end-of-life stage, and (b) the sources of support for individuals and their caregivers with MND at the end-of-life stage. In-depth interviews were conducted with seven bereaved caregivers of individuals with MND from a national tertiary referral care center for neuropsychiatry in South India. Interviews were conducted either in person or by telephone. Thematic analysis was done using the constant comparative method. Major themes derived from the interviews were: (1) Transition from person to patient, (2) support, (3) death, and (4) impact on the caregivers. Mapping of themes identified ""Support received during advanced stages"" as the central theme influencing all other themes. The need for a care manager seems evident and is a role that can be effectively fulfilled by the care teams' social workers.","['Warrier MG', 'Thomas PT', 'Sadasivan A', 'Balasubramaniam B', 'Vengalil S', 'Nashi S', 'Preethish-Kumar V', 'Polavarapu K', 'Mahajan NP', 'Chevula PCR', 'Nalini A']",2019,15,2-3,J Soc Work End Life Palliat Care,"Warrier MG, et al.

31357149,Diffusion kurtosis and quantitative susceptibility mapping MRI are sensitive to structural abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a clinical diagnostic biomarker using state-of-the-art microstructural MRI in the motor cortex of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHODS: Clinical and MRI data were obtained from 21 ALS patients (aged 54 ± 14 years, 33% female) and 63 age- and gender-matched controls (aged 48 ± 18 years, 43% female). MRI was acquired at 3T and included T1-weighted scan (for volumetrics), arterial spin labelling (for cerebral blood flow), susceptibility-weighted angiography (for iron deposition) and multiband diffusion kurtosis imaging (for tissue microstructure). Group differences in imaging measures in the motor cortex were tested by general linear model and relationships to clinical variables by linear regression.
RESULTS: The ALS group had mild-to-moderate impairment (disease duration: 1.8 ± 0.8 years; ALS functional rating scale 40.2 ± 6.0; forced vital capacity 83% ± 22%). No age or gender differences were present between groups. We found significant group differences in diffusion kurtosis metrics (apparent, mean, radial and axial kurtosis: p < .01) and iron deposition in the motor cortex (p = .03). Within the ALS group, we found significant relationships between motor cortex volume, apparent diffusion and disease duration (adjusted R

31300041,Reduction of ephrin-A5 aggravates disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brainstem, spinal cord and motor cortex. ALS is characterized by genetic and clinical heterogeneity, suggesting the existence of genetic factors that modify the phenotypic expression of the disease. We previously identified the axonal guidance EphA4 receptor, member of the Eph-ephrin system, as an ALS disease-modifying factor. EphA4 genetic inhibition rescued the motor neuron phenotype in zebrafish and a rodent model of ALS. Preventing ligands from binding to the EphA4 receptor also successfully improved disease, suggesting a role for EphA4 ligands in ALS. One particular ligand, ephrin-A5, is upregulated in reactive astrocytes after acute neuronal injury and inhibits axonal regeneration. Moreover, it plays a role during development in the correct pathfinding of motor axons towards their target limb muscles. We hypothesized that a constitutive reduction of ephrin-A5 signalling would benefit disease progression in a rodent model for ALS. We discovered that in the spinal cord of control and symptomatic ALS mice ephrin-A5 was predominantly expressed in neurons.

MATERIAL & METHODS: Data were obtained from the Swedish Register for Palliative Care, which documents care during the last week of life. Logistic regression was used to compare patients with MND (n = 419), CNS tumor (n = 799), and OND (n = 1,407) as the cause of death.
RESULTS: The most prevalent symptoms for all neurological disease groups were pain (52.7% to 72.2%) and rattles (58.1% to 65.6%). Compared to MND and OND, patients with CNS tumors were more likely to have totally relieved pain, shortness of breath, rattles, and anxiety. They were also more likely to have their pain assessed with a validated tool; to receive symptom treatment for anxiety, nausea, rattles, and pain; to have had family members receive end-of-life discussions; to have someone present at death; and to have had their family members offered bereavement support. Both patients with CNS tumor and MND were more likely than patients with OND to receive consultation with a pain unit and to have had end-of-life discussions.
CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals high symptom burden and differences in palliative care between the groups during the last week of life. There is a need for person-centered care planning based on a palliative approach, focused on improving symptom assessments, relief, and end-of-life conversations.","['Ozanne A', 'Sawatzky R', 'Håkanson C', 'Alvariza A', 'Fürst CJ', 'Årestedt K', 'Öhlén J']",2019,9,8,Brain Behav,"Ozanne A, et al.

31282612,Communication and cognitive impairments and health care decision making in MND: A narrative review.,"RATIONALE: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disease presenting with progressive weakness of voluntary muscles. For any condition, person-centred health care relies on the sharing of information and a mutual understanding of the person's needs and preferences. Decision making in MND becomes more complex as there is no cure and a high prevalence of co-morbid communication and/or cognitive difficulties.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the reported impact of communication and/or cognitive impairment on patient and carer involvement in health care decision making in MND.
METHODS: A review and synthesis of studies addressing issues of communication impairment and/or cognitive impairment in relation to decision making focussed on MND was conducted. Articles were excluded if they were reviews, case studies, conference papers, or commentaries. To be included studies needed to address issues of communication impairment or cognitive impairment specifically in relation to decision making. Relevant data were extracted verbatim and subjected to content analysis to support the narrative summary.
RESULTS: Seventy-six articles were identified, and 35 articles screened. Six articles met inclusion criteria each describing examples of decision making in MND. There was limited data related to communication and/or cognitive impairment, and the impact these impairments may have on decision making despite recognition that many people with MND may lose verbal communication or develop subtle cognitive impairments. The literature is primarily from the perspective of others.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights that the current body of literature exploring decision making within the MND population presents us with extremely limited insights into the impact of communication and/or cognitive impairments on health care decision making. Extant literature focuses on interventions (namely, ventilation and gastrostomy), the broad process of decision making, or cognitive assessment of decision-making ability. Whilst most studies acknowledge that deficits in communication or cognition impact the decision-making process, this issue is not the focus of any study.","['Paynter C', 'Cruice M', 'Mathers S', 'Gregory H', 'Vogel AP']",2019,25,6,J Eval Clin Pract,"Paynter C, et al.

31280399,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Signalling Induces Casein Kinase 1-Dependent Formation of Cytosolic TDP-43 Inclusions in Motor Neuron-Like Cells.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment. One of the principal pathological hallmarks is the deposition of TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in cytoplasmic inclusions. TDP-43 aggregation occurs in both familial and sporadic MND; however, the mechanism of endogenous TDP-43 aggregation in disease is incompletely understood. This study focused on the induction of cytoplasmic accumulation of endogenous TDP-43 in the motor neuronal cell line NSC-34. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor tunicamycin induced casein kinase 1 (CK1)-dependent cytoplasmic accumulation of endogenous TDP-43 in differentiated NSC-34 cells, as seen by immunocytochemistry. Immunoblotting showed that induction of ER stress had no effect on abundance of TDP-43 or phosphorylated TDP-43 in the NP-40/RIPA soluble fraction. However, there were significant increases in abundance of TDP-43 and phosphorylated TDP-43 in the NP-40/RIPA-insoluble, urea-soluble fraction, including high molecular weight species. In all cases, these increases were lowered by CK1 inhibition. Thus ER stress signalling, as induced by tunicamycin, causes CK1-dependent phosphorylation of TDP-43 and its consequent cytosolic accumulation.","['Hicks DA', 'Cross LL', 'Williamson R', 'Rattray M']",2020,45,6,Neurochem Res,"Hicks DA, et al.

31278107,Risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron disease among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a population-based cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Sleep disturbance may interfere with clearance of abnormal proteins that aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases. The objective of this study was to examine the association between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common disorder causing nocturia and sleep disturbance, and risk of ALS and other motor neuron disease (MND). We hypothesised that men with BPH, in comparison to men in the general population, would be at increased risk.
DESIGN: This is a nationwide, population-based cohort study.
SETTING: This study was conducted among the population of Denmark.
PARTICIPANTS: We used linked Danish medical databases to identify all men with a first-time diagnosis of BPH between 1 January 1980 and 30 November 2013 and no prior diagnosis of MND (BPH cohort, n=223 131) and an age-matched general population comparison cohort of men without BPH or MND (n=1 115 642).
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome is diagnosis of MND after the BPH diagnosis (index) date, with follow-up until MND diagnosis, emigration, death or 30 November 2013.
RESULTS: We used Cox regression to compute adjusted HR, comparing men with and without BPH. After 34 years of follow-up, there were 227 cases of MND in the BPH cohort (incidence rate 0.13/1000 person-years) and 1094 MND cases in the comparison cohort (0.12/1000 person-years; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22). Risk did not vary by follow-up time.
CONCLUSIONS: BPH is not associated with an increased risk of ALS and other MND. Future studies should examine the relation between other disorders that disrupt sleep and MND risk in men and women.","['Sørensen TT', 'Horváth-Puhó E', 'Nørgaard M', 'Ehrenstein V', 'Henderson VW']",2019,9,7,BMJ Open,"Sørensen TT, et al.

31244752,Biological Significance of microRNA Biomarkers in ALS-Innocent Bystanders or Disease Culprits?,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether expression changes of individual miRNAs are simply an indication of cellular dysfunction and degeneration, or actually promote functional changes in target gene expression relevant to disease pathogenesis, is unclear. Here we used bioinformatics to test the hypothesis that ALS-associated miRNAs exert their effects through targeting genes implicated in disease etiology. We documented deregulated miRNAs identified in studies of ALS patients, noting variations in participants, tissue samples, miRNA detection or quantification methods used, and functional or bioinformatic assessments (if performed). Despite lack of experimental standardization, overlap of many deregulated miRNAs between studies was noted; however, direction of reported expression changes did not always concur.

31242093,Making her end of life her own: further reflections on supporting a loved one with motor neurone disease.,"BACKGROUND: People can live for many months without knowing why their body is failing prematurely before being diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND); a terminal neurodegenerative disease which can be experienced as 'devastating' for the person and their family.
AIM: This study aimed to explore the meaning of supporting a loved one with MND to die.
METHODS: This study uses reflection and autobiographical story to connect with broader cultural, political and social meaning and understandings of dying.
FINDINGS: Four themes were identified relating to the end-of-life trajectory of MND. Loss of person (lived body experienced in silence); loss of relationships (lived relations are challenged); loss of home and loss of time (lived space and lived time take on new meaning); loss of future (dying-facing it alone).
CONCLUSION: Dying with MND is a complex phenomenon. When a person can no longer move and communicate, relationships between those involved in end-of-life care are challenging. A person with MND needs the support from those acting as power of attorney to make their end of life their own, and they themselves need support to find meaning in their suffering. This autoethnographic reflection provides vicarious experiences for nurses and other healthcare professionals working with people with MND and similar conditions.","['Harris DA', 'Jack K', 'Wibberley C']",2019,25,6,Int J Palliat Nurs,"Harris DA, et al.

31206160,Diagnostic Value of Cerebrospinal Fluid Neurofilament Light Protein in Neurology: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Neurofilament light protein (NfL) is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a number of neurological conditions compared with healthy controls (HC) and is a candidate biomarker for neuroaxonal damage. The influence of age and sex is largely unknown, and levels across neurological disorders have not been compared systematically to date.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the associations of age, sex, and diagnosis with NfL in CSF (cNfL) and to evaluate its potential in discriminating clinically similar conditions.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched for studies published between January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2016, reporting cNfL levels (using the search terms neurofilament light and cerebrospinal fluid) in neurological or psychiatric conditions and/or in HC.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting NfL levels measured in lumbar CSF using a commercially available immunoassay, as well as age and sex.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual-level data were requested from study authors. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the fixed effects of age, sex, and diagnosis on log-transformed NfL levels, with cohort of origin modeled as a random intercept.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The cNfL levels adjusted for age and sex across diagnoses.
RESULTS: Data were collected for 10 059 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.7 [18.8] years; 54.1% female). Thirty-five diagnoses were identified, including inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (n = 2795), dementias and predementia stages (n = 4284), parkinsonian disorders (n = 984), and HC (n = 1332). The cNfL was elevated compared with HC in a majority of neurological conditions studied. Highest levels were observed in cognitively impaired HIV-positive individuals (iHIV), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Huntington disease. In 33.3% of diagnoses, including HC, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease (AD), and Parkinson disease (PD), cNfL was higher in men than women. The cNfL increased with age in HC and a majority of neurological conditions, although the association was strongest in HC. The cNfL overlapped in most clinically similar diagnoses except for FTD and iHIV, which segregated from other dementias, and PD, which segregated from atypical parkinsonian syndromes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data support the use of cNfL as a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage and indicate that age-specific and sex-specific (and in some cases disease-specific) reference values may be needed. The cNfL has potential to assist the differentiation of FTD from AD and PD from atypical parkinsonian syndromes.","['Bridel C', 'van Wieringen WN', 'Zetterberg H', 'Tijms BM', 'Teunissen CE', 'and the NFL Group', 'Alvarez-Cermeño JC', 'Andreasson U', 'Axelsson M', 'Bäckström DC', 'Bartos A', 'Bjerke M', 'Blennow K', 'Boxer A', 'Brundin L', 'Burman J', 'Christensen T', 'Fialová L', 'Forsgren L', 'Frederiksen JL', 'Gisslén M', 'Gray E', 'Gunnarsson M', 'Hall S', 'Hansson O', 'Herbert MK', 'Jakobsson J', 'Jessen-Krut J', 'Janelidze S', 'Johannsson G', 'Jonsson M', 'Kappos L', 'Khademi M', 'Khalil M', 'Kuhle J', 'Landén M', 'Leinonen V', 'Logroscino G', 'Lu CH', 'Lycke J', 'Magdalinou NK', 'Malaspina A', 'Mattsson N', 'Meeter LH', 'Mehta SR', 'Modvig S', 'Olsson T', 'Paterson RW', 'Pérez-Santiago J', 'Piehl F', 'Pijnenburg YAL', 'Pyykkö OT', 'Ragnarsson O', 'Rojas JC', 'Romme Christensen J', 'Sandberg L', 'Scherling CS', 'Schott JM', 'Sellebjerg FT', 'Simone IL', 'Skillbäck T', 'Stilund M', 'Sundström P', 'Svenningsson A', 'Tortelli R', 'Tortorella C', 'Trentini A', 'Troiano M', 'Turner MR', 'van Swieten JC', 'Vågberg M', 'Verbeek MM', 'Villar LM', 'Visser PJ', 'Wallin A', 'Weiss A', 'Wikkelsø C', 'Wild EJ']",2019,76,9,JAMA Neurol,"Bridel C, et al.

31175383,Superconditioning TMS for examining upper motor neuron function in MND.,"We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex, including a novel four-pulse superconditioning (TMSsc) paradigm, in repeated examinations of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in eight subjects with motor neuron disease (MND), including seven with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The goals were: (1) to look for evidence of cortical hyperexcitability, including a reduction in short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI); and (2) to examine the utility of using TMSsc for quantifying upper motor neuron function during MND progression. Testing of abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles bilaterally was carried out every 3 months in MND subjects for up to 2 years; results were compared to those from a cohort of 15 control subjects. Measures of SICI were not significantly different between control and MND subjects for either APB or TA muscles. Other measures of cortical excitability, including TMS threshold and MEP amplitude, were consistent with lowered cortical excitability in MND subjects. Certain combinations of superconditioning TMS were capable of causing stronger inhibition or facilitation of MEPs compared to dual-pulse TMS, for both APB and TA target muscles. Moreover, there were multiple cases in which target muscles unresponsive to strong single-pulse TMS, whether at rest or when tested with an active contraction, showed an MEP in response to TMSsc optimized for facilitation. Our findings suggest that a multi-faceted neurophysiologic protocol for examining upper motor neuron function in MND subjects might benefit from inclusion of TMSsc testing.","['Calancie B', 'Young E', 'Watson ML', 'Wang D', 'Alexeeva N']",2019,237,8,Exp Brain Res,"Calancie B, et al.

31164256,Heteronymous H reflex in temporal muscle as sign of hyperexcitability in ALS patients.,"OBJECTIVE: The stimulation of the masseteric nerve elicits a homonymous and a heteronymous H reflex in the masseter muscle and in the temporalis one. The presence of the H reflex may be considered a sign of upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of the heteronymous H reflex in patients with ALS and compare it with normal subjects.
METHODS: We enrolled 36 ALS patients and 52 healthy subjects. We stimulated the masseteric nerve in the infratemporal fossa and recorded the muscle responses ipsilaterally to the stimulation.
RESULTS: The heteronymous temporalis H reflex was elicitable in 88.9% of ALS patients and in none of the controls.
CONCLUSION: The heteronymous H reflex does not disappear when the stimulation intensity is increased. It can be used as sign of UMN involvement and may prove useful in patients with suspected MND/ALS with purely lower motor neurons (LMN) signs and no signs of UMN involvement.
SIGNIFICANCE: The heteronymous H reflex is present far more often in ALS patients than in healthy people. It is a simple test that may be used to detect UMN involvement in patients in whom the only evident signs are LMN impairment, improving diagnosis of ALS.","['Libonati L', 'Barone TF', 'Ceccanti M', 'Cambieri C', 'Tartaglia G', 'Onesti E', 'Petrucci A', 'Frasca V', 'Inghilleri M']",2019,130,8,Clin Neurophysiol,"Libonati L, et al.

31129772,Diaphragm ultrasonography in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a diagnostic tool to assess ventilatory dysfunction and disease severity.,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure represents an unavoidable step in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other motor neuron diseases (MND). The development of diaphragm ultrasonography (DUS) provides an alternative useful and risk-free tool to supply clinical, functional, and neurophysiological assessment of respiratory muscle weakness. Our aim was to evaluate if sonographic changes (thickness and echogenicity in the costal portion of the diaphragm, at rest and during respiratory movements) may be used in ALS patients to assess disease severity over time, to rule out any risk or discomfort due to traditional neurophysiological investigations.
METHODS: Twenty ALS patients (mean age, 64.6 ± 10.5 years) were enrolled and data were compared with age-matched healthy volunteers; DUS data were correlated with respiratory function and disease severity scale. Examinations were performed using Telemed Echo-wave II or Esaote MyLabGamma devices in conventional B-Mode.
RESULTS: Mean resting thickness was reduced in all cases; changes in thickness during inspiration and expiration were also reduced (p < 0.0001) and lost in severe cases (n = 3). In bulbar-onset disease, respiratory scores were strictly correlated with the difference in diaphragm thickness between full inspiration-and expiration-as well as on the diaphragm thickness in expiration (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: DUS represents a simple, painless, and risk-free tool; moreover, it provides useful functional and structural insights to the understanding of diaphragm function and the degree of respiratory failure in ALS.","['Sartucci F', 'Pelagatti A', 'Santin M', 'Bocci T', 'Dolciotti C', 'Bongioanni P']",2019,40,10,Neurol Sci,"Sartucci F, et al.

31117107,Exome Sequencing Identifies a Mutation (Y740C) in Spastic Paraplegia 7 Gene Associated with Adult-Onset Primary Lateral Sclerosis in a Chinese Family.,"BACKGROUND: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is considered a rare variant of motor neuron disease (MND) characterized by selective upper motor neuron dysfunction leading to limb weakness, spasticity, and even bulbar symptoms. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in ALSIN, spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7), TBK1, ALS2, ERLIN2, and FIG4 are responsible for PLS. Most of them occurred in childhood to young-adult onset patients. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic lesion of patients with adult-onset PLS.
METHODS: We applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) and MND and ataxia-related genes filtering strategies to discover the genetic factors in a Chinese adult-onset PLS family. Sanger sequencing was used in the cosegregation analysis in the affected family members.
RESULTS: A mutation (c.2219A>G/p.Y740C) in exon 17 of SPG7 was identified in an adult-onset PLS patient and cosegregated with the affected members in this family. Meanwhile, the mutation was predicted to be deleterious by 3 bioinformatics programs (Polymorphism phenotyping-2, sorting intolerant from tolerant and MutationTaster). This variant may cause the structure changes of paraplegin protein.
CONCLUSIONS: We employed WES to detect a missense mutation of SPG7 gene in a PLS family. This finding expands the spectrum of known SPG7 mutations, and it may contribute to novel approaches to genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with PLS.","['Liu Y', 'Xu J', 'Tao W', 'Fu C', 'Liu J', 'Yu R', 'Zhang X']",2019,81,1-2,Eur Neurol,"Liu Y, et al.

31117082,Estimating Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Motor Neuron Disease Prevalence in Portugal Using a Pharmaco-Epidemiological Approach and a Bayesian Multiparameter Evidence Synthesis Model.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare and progressive neurodegenerative disease involving the upper and lower motor neurons. It is also the most common and the one with the worst prognosis among the motor neuron diseases (MND). ALS invariably progresses to respiratory failure, which is an essential factor affecting the prognosis of this disease. Its prevalence in the world is heterogeneous and, in many countries, is even unknown, since national registries are not mandatory or comprehensive enough. Worldwide, the ALS/MND prevalence is estimated between 4 and 8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, but in Portugal the prevalence was never studied. Because ALS and MND are rare diseases, population-based studies are very difficult to perform. In Portugal, there are no systematic patient registries.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to obtain the best available indirect estimates of ALS/MND prevalence, using a pharmaco-epidemiological approach.
METHOD: We developed a Bayesian multiparameter evidence synthesis model based on nationwide data of riluzole consumption, a drug highly specific for ALS/MND, combined with data from a nationwide hospital administrative database, data from the national institute of statistics, and data from other scientific articles focused on ALS/MND epidemiology, to estimate ALS/MND prevalence in Portugal.
RESULTS: We found an estimated ALS/MND prevalence in Portugal steadily increasing from 6.74 per 100,000 inhabitants (Bayesian 95% Credible Interval [95% CI] 5.39-9.37) in 2009 to 10.32 (95% CI 8.27-14.27) in 2016. In 2016, the estimated ALS/MND prevalence was higher in men, 12.08 per 100,000 (9.66-17.15), than in women, 8.56 (6.84-12.32). Regarding age groups, the estimated prevalence per 100,000 inhabitants were, in 2016 for women, 1.19 (0.78-1.85) for the <50 years' group, 8.48 (6.00-12.76) for the 51-60 group, 23.47 (18.05-33.88) for the 61-70 group, 28.77 (22.02-41.31) for the 71-80 group, and 14.45 (9.97-21.63) for the >80 group. For men, the prevalence estimates were 1.90 (1.32-2.84), 12.89 (9.44-19.16), 32.18 (24.91-45.74), 48.85 (38.72-71.40), and 31.27 (21.73-46.41), respectively, for each age group. We also observed a relevant variability across the country, with prevalence estimates, in 2016, of 9.31 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (7.45-12.86) in the Northern region of Portugal, 11.15 (8.9-15.34) in the Centre region, 10.74 (8.6-14.82) in Lisbon and Alentejo regions, and 5.55 (4.35-7.83) in the Algarve region.
CONCLUSION: Overall, and even though we must account for the limitations of the indirect methods and models used for prevalence estimation, we probably have a very high ALS/MND prevalence in Portugal. It would be important to create registries, particularly in rare diseases, for better organization and distribution of healthcare services and resources, particularly at the level of ventilatory support.","['Conde B', 'Winck JC', 'Azevedo LF']",2019,53,1-2,Neuroepidemiology,"Conde B, et al.

31107169,Delusional health beliefs.,"Delusional health beliefs can be difficult and costly for practitioners to diagnose and manage. Patients often deny that mental distress is the cause of their illness, when it may be the most significant factor. Such patients can be relentless in their pursuit of a physical cause and go from doctor to doctor to find one who agrees with them, using up significant NHS resources. The number of negative investigations increases year on year, with the patient being referred back to their general practitioner without a working diagnosis. The recent publication of Susanne O'Sullivan's book, ""It's All in your Head - True Stories of Imaginary Illness"", shines a bright and necessary light on the difficulties of getting these patients to accept that their problems originate in their minds. Doctors, alerted by fat files, may be well advised to question any previous diagnosis, if it is not borne out by physical evidence and does not conform to known diagnostic criteria and disease patterns. In this context, it is timely to consider the true cause of Stephen Hawking's illness, which he has called into question in his last book, published after his death. Allegedly, he had been suffering from motor neurone disease, diagnosed when he was a very young man.Yet he survived to the age of 76, albeit in his later years in an increasingly crippled and distressed state. Such longevity is totally inconsistent with MND. What then was the cause of Hawking's illness? Is there any firm evidence that a consultant neurologist ever made that diagnosis, and on what grounds? The interplay between mind and body is mysterious and complex, but we need to question every symptom, if it is not grounded in objective reality.",['May P'],2019,87,2,Med Leg J,May P.

31081694,A phase III trial of tirasemtiv as a potential treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of tirasemtiv, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator, vs. placebo in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Methods: VITALITY-ALS (NCT02496767) was a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants tolerating 2 weeks of open-label tirasemtiv (125 mg twice daily) were randomized 3:2:2:2 to placebo or one of three target tirasemtiv dose levels, using an escalating dosage protocol lasting 28 days. The primary outcome measure was changed in slow vital capacity (SVC) at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included a change in muscle strength and time to respiratory milestones of disease progression.
RESULTS: Of 744 participants, 565 tolerated open-label tirasemtiv and received randomized treatment. By 24 weeks, 23 (12.2%) placebo-treated participants discontinued study treatment vs. 129 (34.2%) randomized to tirasemtiv. SVC declined by 14.4% (95% CI: −16.8, −11.9) in the placebo group and 13.4% (95% CI: −15.3, −11.6) in the tirasemtiv group (p = 0.56). Secondary endpoints did not show significant differences. However, participants who tolerated tirasemtiv at their randomized dose showed a numeric trend toward a dose-related slowing of decline in SVC (p = 0.11). Dizziness, fatigue, nausea, weight loss, and insomnia occurred more frequently on tirasemtiv. Serious adverse events were similar across groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Tirasemtiv did not alter the decline of SVC or significantly impact secondary outcome measures. Poor tolerability of tirasemtiv may have contributed to this result. However, participants tolerating their intended dose exhibited a trend toward treatment benefit on SVC, suggesting the underlying mechanism of action may still hold promise, as is being tested with a different fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (NCT03160898).","['Shefner JM', 'Cudkowicz ME', 'Hardiman O', 'Cockcroft BM', 'Lee JH', 'Malik FI', 'Meng L', 'Rudnicki SA', 'Wolff AA', 'Andrews JA', 'VITALITY-ALS Study Group']",2019,0,0,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Shefner JM, et al.

31077599,Expression of p16 and p21 in the frontal association cortex of ALS/MND brains suggests neuronal cell cycle dysregulation and astrocyte senescence in early stages of the disease.,"AIMS: Cellular senescence plays a role in organismal ageing and has been linked to persistent DNA damage in age-related diseases. Brain senescence has been described in astrocytes and microglia, but it is less well understood in neurones. Evidence suggests that neurones activate a senescence-like mechanism that could contribute to neurodegeneration. We aimed to determine whether a persistent DNA damage response (DDR) and senescence activation are features of motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS/MND).
METHODS: We examined expression of senescence (p16 and p21) and DNA damage markers (8-OHdG and γH2AX) in motor cortex (MCx), frontal association cortex (FACx) and occipital cortex (OCx) in post-mortem tissue donated by patients with ALS/MND and controls.
RESULTS: Nuclear expression of p16 and p21 was detected in glial cells; double immunofluorescence for p16/p21 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) suggested that some of these cells were GFAP
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of p16 and p21 in glia, mainly in astrocytes, suggests senescence induction in these cells; however, neuronal p21 expression might reflect a more general mechanism of age-related cell cycle dysregulation. The significantly higher proportion of cells expressing either p16 or p21 in the FACx of ALS/MND donors could indicate senescence activation and cell cycle dysregulation in early stages of the disease.","['Vazquez-Villaseñor I', 'Garwood CJ', 'Heath PR', 'Simpson JE', 'Ince PG', 'Wharton SB']",2020,46,2,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Vazquez-Villaseñor I, et al.

31066065,Von Economo neurons are part of a larger neuronal population that are selectively vulnerable in C9orf72 frontotemporal dementia.,"AIMS: The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia with a C9orf72 expansion (C9-bvFTD) is characterised by early changes in social-emotional cognition that are linked to the loss of von Economo neurons (VENs). Together with a subset of neighbouring pyramidal neurons, VENs express the GABA receptor subunit theta (GABRQ). It is not known if the selective vulnerability of VENs in C9-bvFTD also includes this GABRQ-expressing population.
METHODS: We quantified VENs and GABRQ immunopositive neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in C9-bvFTD (n = 16), controls (n = 12) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 7). Second, we assessed VENs and GABRQ-expressing populations in relation to the clinicopathological profiles.
RESULTS: We found the number of VENs and GABRQ-expressing neurons and their ratio over the total layer 5 neuronal population was lower in C9-bvFTD compared to control and AD. C9-bvFTD donors with underlying TDP43 type A pathology in the ACC showed the highest loss of GABRQ-expressing neurons. C9-bvFTD donors that did not present with motor neuron disease (MND) symptoms in the first half of their disease course showed a prominent loss of GABRQ-expressing neurons compared to controls. C9-bvFTD donors with no symptoms of psychosis showed a higher loss compared to controls. Across all donors, the number of VENs correlated strongly with the number of GABRQ-expressing neurons.
CONCLUSION: We show that VENs, together with GABRQ-expressing neurons, are selectively vulnerable in C9-bvFTD but are both spared in AD. This suggests they are related and that this GABRQ-expressing population of VENs and pyramidal neurons, is a key modulator of social-emotional functioning.","['Gami-Patel P', 'van Dijken I', 'van Swieten JC', 'Pijnenburg YAL', 'Netherlands Brain Bank', 'Rozemuller AJM', 'Hoozemans JJM', 'Dijkstra AA']",2019,45,7,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Gami-Patel P, et al.

31058309,Use of coping strategies in MND/ALS: Association with demographic and disease-related characteristics.,"OBJECTIVE: Understanding the use of coping strategies and which factors are associated with strategy utilization might help clinical staff anticipate which coping strategies individuals are more likely to utilize. In this study, we assess coping strategy use in the motor neuron disease (MND, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS]) population and examine associations of demographic and disease variables with individual coping strategies.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 233 participants with MND/ALS were recruited into the ongoing Trajectories of Outcomes in Neurological Conditions study from MND clinics across the United Kingdom. Participants completed a questionnaire pack collecting data on demographics and a range of patient-reported measures including the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced scale. Associations between demographic and clinical characteristics and coping strategies were examined by simple and multiple ordinal logistic regression.
RESULTS: The most commonly used strategy was Acceptance, followed by Active Coping, Planning and Positive Re-interpretation and Growth. The least used strategies were Substance Use, Turning to Religion and Denial. Ten out of the fifteen strategies showed statistically significant associations with demographic and clinical characteristics. Most markedly, females were found to utilize many strategies more than males, namely Restraint, Seeking Instrumental Social Support, Seeking Emotional Social Support, Focus on and Venting of Emotions, Behavioural Disengagement and Mental Disengagement.
CONCLUSION: Clinical staff should be aware that coping strategy use is associated with several demographic and disease characteristics. Targeted advice on coping may improve coping capacity and facilitate psychosocial adjustment.","['Schlüter DK', 'Holland DP', 'Mills RJ', 'McDermott CJ', 'Williams TL', 'Young CA', 'TONiC study group']",2019,140,2,Acta Neurol Scand,"Schlüter DK, et al.

31041602,Communicating psychosocial well-being in motor neurone disease to staff: results from a World Café approach.,"OBJECTIVE: Little to no research has evaluated staff training and its effects on the well-being of people with MND. The aim of this study was to assess how educating multi-disciplinary staff about psychosocial well-being in MND can change approaches to working with people with MND.
METHODS: Multi-disciplinary staff attended a half-day workshop to receive training on psychosocial well-being in people with MND and to discuss QoL issues using the World Café approach. Prior to the workshop and 2 weeks post-workshop, staff completed a questionnaire on their knowledge of this topic. A selection of staff completed a follow-up interview 2 months later to assess changes in their practice.
RESULTS: 19 staff, including dieticians and occupational therapists, attended the workshop and completed the pre-workshop questionnaire. Ten filled in the post-workshop questionnaire and were interviewed. Clinicians identified six strategies/barriers of improving communication amongst MND staff, suggesting the need for better collaborative working, raising awareness of psychological and emotional issues in MND and barriers to service access due to health inequalities, amongst others.
CONCLUSIONS: This workshop raised staff awareness on communicating QoL in MND. Future work needs to look into implementing this training in clinical practice and evaluate their impact on QoL in MND.","['Giebel C', 'Medley G', 'Smith S', 'Thornton M', 'Furlong M', 'Ennis M', 'Young C']",2019,28,9,Qual Life Res,"Giebel C, et al.

31031584,The Pathobiology of TDP-43 C-Terminal Fragments in ALS and FTLD.,"During neurodegenerative disease, the multifunctional RNA-binding protein TDP-43 undergoes a vast array of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and cleavage. Many of these alterations may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies, which include most forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and approximately half of all frontotemporal dementia, pathologically identified as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 pathology. However, the relative contributions of the various TDP-43 post-translational modifications to disease remain unclear, and indeed some may be secondary epiphenomena rather than disease-causative. It is therefore critical to determine the involvement of each modification in disease processes to allow the design of targeted treatments. In particular, TDP-43 C-terminal fragments (CTFs) accumulate in the brains of people with ALS and FTLD and are therefore described as a neuropathological signature of these diseases. Remarkably, these TDP-43 CTFs are rarely observed in the spinal cord, even in ALS which involves dramatic degeneration of spinal motor neurons. Therefore, TDP-43 CTFs are not produced non-specifically in the course of all forms of TDP-43-related neurodegeneration, but rather variably arise due to additional factors influenced by regional heterogeneity in the central nervous system. In this review, we summarize how TDP-43 CTFs are generated and degraded by cells, and critique evidence from studies of TDP-43 CTF pathology in human disease tissues, as well as cell and animal models, to analyze the pathophysiological relevance of TDP-43 CTFs to ALS and FTLD. Numerous studies now indicate that, although TDP-43 CTFs are prevalent in ALS and FTLD brains, disease-related pathology is only variably reproduced in TDP-43 CTF cell culture models. Furthermore, TDP-43 CTF expression in both transgenic and viral-mediated ","['Berning BA', 'Walker AK']",2019,13,,Front Neurosci,Berning BA and Walker AK.

The umbrella term MND refers to diseases which cause the progressive loss of upper and/or lower motor neurons and a subsequent decrease in motor ability such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The study of these diseases is complex and has recently involved the use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, in the case of MND, it has been difficult to identify the complex genetics involved in subtypes, and functional investigation of new candidate disease genes is warranted.

31027498,Palliative care for patients with motor neurone disease and their bereaved carers: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Internationally, it is widely accepted that holistic care is as an integral part of the care for people with motor neurone disease (MND), and their informal carers. However the optimal role of generalist and specialist palliative care, and how it integrates with specialist neurology services, is not fully established. Using a qualitative approach we sought to examine end of life care for people with MND in Northern Ireland, and the role of specialist and generalist palliative care.
METHODS: Qualitative study involving a convenience sample of 13 bereaved carers recruited using the Northern Ireland MND Register. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews with the bereaved carers of patients who had died 3-24 months previously with a diagnosis of MND. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Findings illuminated variations in relation to the levels of holistic care provided to this cohort of patients. Unmanaged respiratory and psychological symptoms caused perceived distress amongst patients. Participants' experiences additionally highlighted reluctance amongst patients with MND to engage with services such as specialist palliative care. Conversely, for those who received input from specialist palliative care services carers portrayed these services to be of great benefit to the patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MND in Northern Ireland may have many unmet holistic care needs. Key areas that require particular focus in terms of service development include neuromuscular respiratory physiotherapy and psychological services for patients. Future research must explore an optimal model of holistic care delivery for patients with MND and how this can be effectively integrated to best meet this patient cohorts palliative care needs.","['Mc Veigh C', 'Donaghy C', 'Mc Laughlin B', 'Dick A', 'Kaur K', 'Mc Conville J', 'Watson M']",2019,18,1,BMC Palliat Care,"Mc Veigh C, et al.

31023181,The use of digital legacies with people affected by motor neurone disease for continuing bonds: An interpretative phenomenological analysis study.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease without cure. Little is known about how young people are affected when a family member has the illness and subsequently dies, resulting in a gap in understanding of how best to support them. One psychotherapeutic approach involves creating a legacy to pass onto the young person, but little research has investigated the use of an emerging format, digital legacies, where videos document a person's life, memories and achievements.
AIM: To investigate the views, perceptions and experiences of digital legacies with people affected by motor neurone disease.
DESIGN: A qualitative study underpinned by interpretative phenomenological analysis.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: People living with motor neurone disease (n = 4) and bereaved young people (n = 3) in the United Kingdom. Open-ended interviews were conducted in person. Ethical approval was granted by a University ethics committee.
RESULTS: Five key themes emerged exemplifying mutual challenges and benefits for people with motor neurone disease and bereaved young people. Creating a digital legacy provides a sense of purpose for people with motor neurone disease and a way to convey personality and life experiences. Bereaved young people can modify disease-related memories of the person and gain comfort from hearing and seeing videos.

31018212,"Assessing Inspiratory Muscle Strength for Early Detection of Respiratory Failure in Motor Neuron Disease: Should We Use MIP, SNIP, or Both?","BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND) invariably impacts on inspiratory muscle strength leading to respiratory failure. Regular assessment of sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) and/or maximal mouth inspiratory pressure (MIP) contributes to early detection of a requirement for ventilatory support.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the feasibility, agreement, and performance of both tests in MND.
METHODS: Patients with MND followed by a multidisciplinary consultation were prospectively included. Pulmonary follow-up included forced expiratory volumes, vital capacity (VC) seated and supine, MIP, SNIP, pulse oximetry, and daytime arterial blood gases.
RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included. SNIP and MIP could not be performed in 14 (21%) subjects; 74% of the subjects showed a decrease in MIP or SNIP at inclusion versus 31% for VC. Correlation between MIP and SNIP (Pearson's rho: 0.68, p < 0.001) was moderate, with a non-significant bias in favor of SNIP (3.6 cm H2O) and wide limits of agreement (-34 to 41 cm H2O). Results were similar in ""bulbar"" versus ""non-bulbar"" patients. At different proposed cut-off values for identifying patients at risk of respiratory failure, the agreement between MIP and SNIP (64-79%) and kappa values (0.29-0.53) was moderate.
CONCLUSIONS: MIP and SNIP were equally feasible. There was no significant bias in favor of either test, but a considerable disparity in results between tests, suggesting that use of both tests is warranted to screen for early detection of patients at risk of respiratory failure and avoid over diagnoses. SNIP, MIP, and VC all follow a relatively linear downhill course with a steeper slope for ""bulbar"" versus ""non-bulbar"" patients.","['Janssens JP', 'Adler D', 'Iancu Ferfoglia R', 'Poncet A', 'Genton Graf L', 'Leuchter I', 'Escher Imhof M', 'Héritier Barras AC']",2019,98,2,Respiration,"Janssens JP, et al.

OBJECTIVE: Improved prescription of assistive devices, through improved understanding of the relationship between clinical phenotypes, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) functional domain sub-scores and assistive technology required by people living with MND.
METHODS: Prospective, observational consecutive-sample study of 269 patients with MND diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MND phenotype, ALSFRS-R scores and assistive technology devices in use.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in total concurrent assistive technology item use was found between phenotypes (p = 0.001), with those with ALS Bulbar onset using the least. There was also a statistically significant difference in assistive technology usage in five of seven assistive technology categories across the clinical phenotypes, namely orthoses (p < 0.000), mobility devices (p < 0.000), transfer devices (p < 0.000), communication devices (p < 0.000), and activities of daily living devices (p = 0.016). Correlations between ALSFRS-R sub-score items and assistive technology count confirmed the utility of this outcome measure for equipment prescription.

31001186,Biomarkers in Motor Neuron Disease: A State of the Art Review.,"Motor neuron disease can be viewed as an umbrella term describing a heterogeneous group of conditions, all of which are relentlessly progressive and ultimately fatal. The average life expectancy is 2 years, but with a broad range of months to decades. Biomarker research deepens disease understanding through exploration of pathophysiological mechanisms which, in turn, highlights targets for novel therapies. It also allows differentiation of the disease population into sub-groups, which serves two general purposes: (a) provides clinicians with information to better guide their patients in terms of disease progression, and (b) guides clinical trial design so that an intervention may be shown to be effective if population variation is controlled for. Biomarkers also have the potential to provide monitoring during clinical trials to ensure target engagement. This review highlights biomarkers that have emerged from the fields of systemic measurements including biochemistry (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine analysis); imaging and electrophysiology, and gives examples of how a combinatorial approach may yield the best results. We emphasize the importance of systematic sample collection and analysis, and the need to correlate biomarker findings with detailed phenotype and genotype data.","['Verber NS', 'Shepheard SR', 'Sassani M', 'McDonough HE', 'Moore SA', 'Alix JJP', 'Wilkinson ID', 'Jenkins TM', 'Shaw PJ']",2019,10,,Front Neurol,"Verber NS, et al.

30952836,Dynamic interplay between H-current and M-current controls motoneuron hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a type of motor neuron disease (MND) in which humans lose motor functions due to progressive loss of motoneurons in the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. In patients and in animal models of MND it has been observed that there is a change in the properties of motoneurons, termed neuronal hyperexcitability, which is an exaggerated response of the neurons to a stimulus. Previous studies suggested neuronal excitability is one of the leading causes for neuronal loss, however the factors that instigate excitability in neurons over the course of disease onset and progression are not well understood, as these studies have looked mainly at embryonic or early postnatal stages (pre-symptomatic). As hyperexcitability is not a static phenomenon, the aim of this study was to assess the overall excitability of upper motoneurons during disease progression, specifically focusing on their oscillatory behavior and capabilities to fire repetitively. Our results suggest that increases in the intrinsic excitability of motoneurons are a global phenomenon of aging, however the cellular mechanisms that underlie this hyperexcitability are distinct in SOD1","['Buskila Y', 'Kékesi O', 'Bellot-Saez A', 'Seah W', 'Berg T', 'Trpceski M', 'Yerbury JJ', 'Ooi L']",2019,10,4,Cell Death Dis,"Buskila Y, et al.

METHODS: In this report, we discuss the palliative and ventilatory management of six ventilator-dependent patients with MND who had requested the withdrawal of MV as part of their end-of-life care.
RESULTS: We have withdrawn MV from six patients with MND at their request and our practice has been influenced by the Association of Palliative Medicine Guidelines.

The current diagnosis of MND is based on results of the clinical examination and neurophysiologic studies. The length of time of referral to a neuromuscular neurologist and the lack of validated diagnostic criteria can delay diagnosis. Although the role of imaging is currently most useful in excluding other conditions, several attempts to incorporate neuroimaging in the diagnosis of the disease and assessment of progression have shown promising results.We conducted a literature review via searches in PubMed and The Cochrane Database using multiple relevant terms to the topic. Two cases with a challenging diagnosis of MND are described, with a thorough discussion of how the diagnosis was suggested on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging evidence in each case. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging findings can be useful tools that add to the diagnostic criteria of MNDs, especially in cases where reaching a definitive diagnosis is difficult. Such findings might enable clinicians to reach an early diagnosis that can improve the patient's quality of life and prolong survival.","['Sawalha K', 'Gonzalez-Toledo E', 'Hussein O']",2019,23,,Perm J,"Sawalha K, et al.

METHODS: Two hundred MND patients were followed up prospectively for a median of 4.13 years. At baseline, subjects underwent neurological examination, cognitive assessment and brain MRI. Grey matter volumes of cortical and subcortical structures and diffusion tensor MRI metrics of white matter tracts were obtained. A multivariable Royston-Parmar survival model was created using clinical and cognitive variables. The increase of survival prediction accuracy provided by MRI variables was assessed.
RESULTS: The multivariable clinical model included predominant upper or lower motor neuron presentations and diagnostic delay as significant prognostic predictors, reaching an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of a 4-year survival prediction of 0.79. The combined clinical and MRI model including selected grey matter fronto-temporal volumes and diffusion tensor MRI metrics of the corticospinal and extra-motor tracts reached an AUC of 0.89. Considering amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients only, the clinical model including diagnostic delay and semantic fluency scores provided an AUC of 0.62, whereas the combined clinical and MRI model reached an AUC of 0.77.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that brain MRI measures of motor and extra-motor structural damage, when combined with clinical and cognitive features, are useful predictors of survival in patients with MND, particularly when a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is made.","['Agosta F', 'Spinelli EG', 'Riva N', 'Fontana A', 'Basaia S', 'Canu E', 'Castelnovo V', 'Falzone Y', 'Carrera P', 'Comi G', 'Filippi M']",2019,26,9,Eur J Neurol,"Agosta F, et al.

30919022,Using proteomics to identify ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs: how novel methods may unveil therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Ubiquitin ligases play an integral role in fine-tuning signaling cascades necessary for normal cell function. Aberrant regulation of ubiquitin ligases has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, generally, due to mutations within the E3 ligase itself. Several proteomic-based methods have recently emerged to facilitate the rapid identification of ligase-substrate pairs-a previously challenging feat due to the transient nature of ligase-substrate interactions. These novel methods complement standard immunoprecipitations (IPs) and include proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), ubiquitin ligase-substrate trapping, tandem ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs), and a molecular trapping unit known as the NEDDylator. The implementation of these techniques is expected to facilitate the rapid identification of novel substrates of E3 ubiquitin ligases, a process that is likely to enhance our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and highlight novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","['Rayner SL', 'Morsch M', 'Molloy MP', 'Shi B', 'Chung R', 'Lee A']",2019,76,13,Cell Mol Life Sci,"Rayner SL, et al.

30902826,Occupation and motor neuron disease: a New Zealand case-control study.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess associations between occupation and motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study with cases (n=321) recruited through the New Zealand Motor Neurone Disease Association and hospital discharge data. Controls (n=605) were recruited from the Electoral Roll. Information on personal and demographic details, lifestyle factors and a full occupational history was collected using questionnaires and interviews. Associations with ever/never employed and employment duration were estimated using logistic regression stratified by sex and adjusted for age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, education and smoking.
RESULTS: Elevated risks were observed for field crop and vegetable growers (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.77); fruit growers (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.78); gardeners and nursery growers (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.82); crop and livestock producers (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.44 to 9.02); fishery workers, hunters and trappers (OR 5.62, 95% CI 1.27 to 24.97); builders (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.41 to 5.96); electricians (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.34 to 9.74); caregivers (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.79); forecourt attendants (OR 8.31, 95% CI 1.79 to 38.54); plant and machine operators and assemblers (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.01); telecommunications technicians (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.20 to 14.64); and draughting technicians (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.07 to 8.53). Industries with increased risks were agriculture (particularly horticulture and fruit growing), construction, non-residential care services, motor vehicle retailing, and sport and recreation. Positive associations between employment duration and MND were shown for the occupations fruit growers, gardeners and nursery growers, and crop and livestock producers, and for the horticulture and fruit growing industry.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests associations between MND and occupations in agriculture and several other occupations.","['Chen GX', ""'t Mannetje AM"", 'Douwes J', 'van den Berg L', 'Pearce N', 'Kromhout H', ""D'Souza W"", 'McConnell M', 'Glass B', 'Brewer N', 'McLean DJ']",2019,76,5,Occup Environ Med,"Chen GX, et al.

30899244,An Overview of MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; MND, motor neuron disease) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease affecting 4.5 per 100,000 people per year around the world. There is currently no cure for this disease, and its causes are relatively unknown. Diagnosis is based on a battery of clinical tests up to a year after symptom onset, with no robust markers of diagnosis or disease progression currently identified. A major thrust of current research is to identify potential non-invasive markers (""biomarkers"") in body fluids such as blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to use for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), are found at detectable and stable levels in blood and other bodily fluids. Specific ncRNAs can vary in levels between ALS patients and non-ALS controls without the disease. In this review, we will provide an overview of early findings, demonstrate the potential of this new class as biomarkers, and discuss future challenges and opportunities taking this forward to help patients with ALS.","['Joilin G', 'Leigh PN', 'Newbury SF', 'Hafezparast M']",2019,10,,Front Neurol,"Joilin G, et al.

30857760,Foreground Detection Analysis of Ultrasound Image Sequences Identifies Markers of Motor Neurone Disease across Diagnostically Relevant Skeletal Muscles.,"Diagnosis of motor neurone disease (MND) includes detection of small, involuntary muscle excitations, termed fasciculations. There is need to improve diagnosis and monitoring of MND through provision of objective markers of change. Fasciculations are visible in ultrasound image sequences. However, few approaches that objectively measure their occurrence have been proposed; their performance has been evaluated in only a few muscles; and their agreement with the clinical gold standard for fasciculation detection, intramuscular electromyography, has not been tested. We present a new application of adaptive foreground detection using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), evaluating its accuracy across five skeletal muscles in healthy and MND-affected participants. The GMM provided good to excellent accuracy with the electromyography ground truth (80.17%-92.01%) and was robust to different ultrasound probe orientations. The GMM provides objective measurement of fasciculations in each of the body segments necessary for MND diagnosis and hence could provide a new, clinically relevant disease marker.","['Bibbings K', 'Harding PJ', 'Loram ID', 'Combes N', 'Hodson-Tole EF']",2019,45,5,Ultrasound Med Biol,"Bibbings K, et al.

30846210,Atypical Motor Neuron Disease variants: Still a diagnostic challenge in Neurology.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) represents a wide and heterogeneous expanding group of disorders involving the upper or lower motor neurons, mainly represented by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy and progressive bulbar palsy.

30843116,Cancer and motor neuron disease-causal or coincidental? Two contrasting cases.,"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) can occur in patients with cancer, but there is minimal evidence that this is more than by chance. We contrast two cases of motor neuronopathies occurring in the context of systemic malignancy and argue that in one case the cause was most likely paraneoplastic, while in the other it was not. CASE 1: A 61-year-old woman developed progressive walking difficulties over 9 months with weakness and stiffness in her legs. EMG showed fibrillations and positive sharp waves in multiple lower limb muscles bilaterally, with neurogenic units and a reduced recruitment pattern. An invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast was identified and she continued to deteriorate neurologically with worsening mobility, upper limb spasticity and fasciculations. She died approximately 26 months after symptom onset. CASE 2: A 57-year-old woman developed weight loss and weakness of her right arm without any sensory symptoms. At presentation, she had wasting and fasciculations in her right upper limb muscles, with normal reflexes, normal left upper limb and lower limb examination. Over the following week, she developed left upper limb weakness and fasciculations, brisk knee reflexes, and flexor plantar responses. Her EMG showed upper and lower limb denervation. She was found to have anti-Hu and anti-CV2 antibodies present in serum. A PET-CT showed active uptake in lymph nodes in the right hilum. Biopsy confirmed a small cell lung cancer. She had chemoradiation therapy and the tumour went into remission. She has remained well on follow-up 24 months later, regaining weight and strength after her chemotherapy. She continues to be monitored for cancer recurrence, but thus far appears to be in remission.
CONCLUSION: In cases with rapidly progressive MND, particularly of upper limb onset, consideration should be given to testing anti-neuronal antibodies and searching for an occult tumour.","['Goodfellow J', 'Gorrie G', 'Leach V', 'Patel S', 'Mackay G']",2019,40,7,Neurol Sci,"Goodfellow J, et al.

30835568,ALSgeneScanner: a pipeline for the analysis and interpretation of DNA sequencing data of ALS patients.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, MND) is a neurodegenerative disease of upper and lower motor neurons resulting in death from neuromuscular respiratory failure, typically within two years of first symptoms. Genetic factors are an important cause of ALS, with variants in more than 25 genes having strong evidence, and weaker evidence available for variants in more than 120 genes. With the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing data, non-specialists, including health care professionals and patients, are obtaining their genomic information without a corresponding ability to analyze and interpret it.

30805795,Changing epidemiology of motor neurone disease in Scotland.,"OBJECTIVES: Scotland benefits from an integrated national healthcare team for motor neurone disease (MND) and a tradition of rich clinical data capture using the Scottish MND Register (launched in 1989; one of the first national registers). The Scottish register was re-launched in 2015 as Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND), an electronic platform for prospective, population-based research. We aimed to determine if incidence of MND is changing over time.
METHODS: Capture-recapture methods determined the incidence of MND in 2015-2016. Incidence rates for 2015-2016 and 1989-1998 were direct age and sex standardised to allow time-period comparison. Phenotypic characteristics and socioeconomic status of the cohort are described.
RESULTS: Coverage of the CARE-MND platform was 99%. Crude incidence in the 2015-2017 period was 3.83/100,000 person-years (95% CI 3.53-4.14). Direct age-standardised incidence in 2015 was 3.42/100,000 (95% CI 2.99-3.91); in 2016, it was 2.89/100,000 (95% CI 2.50-3.34). The 1989-1998 direct standardised annual incidence estimate was 2.32/100,000 (95% CI 2.26-2.37). 2015-2016 standardised incidence was 66.9% higher than Northern European estimates. Socioeconomic status was not associated with MND.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a changing landscape of MND in Scotland, with a rise in incidence by 36.0% over a 25-year period. This is likely attributable to ascertainment in the context of improved neurological services in Scotland. Our data suggest that CARE-MND is a reliable national resource and findings can be extrapolated to the other Northern European populations.","['Leighton DJ', 'Newton J', 'Stephenson LJ', 'Colville S', 'Davenport R', 'Gorrie G', 'Morrison I', 'Swingler R', 'Chandran S', 'Pal S', 'CARE-MND Consortium']",2019,266,4,J Neurol,"Leighton DJ, et al.

30789031,Physicians' attitudes toward end-of-life decisions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims (1) to assess physicians' attitudes toward different palliative end-of-life (EOL) practices in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) care, including forgoing artificial nutrition and hydration (FANH), continuous sedation until death (CSD), and withdrawing invasive ventilation (WIV), and toward physician-assisted dying (PAD) including physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia and (2) to explore variables influencing these attitudes.
METHODS: We used two clinical vignettes depicting ALS patients in different stages of their disease progression to assess the influence of suffering (physical/psycho-existential) on attitudes toward WIV and the influence of suffering and prognosis (short-term/long-term) on attitudes toward FANH, CSD, and PAD.
RESULTS: 50 physicians from European ALS centers and neurological departments completed our survey. Short-term prognosis had a positive impact on attitudes toward offering FANH (p = 0.014) and CSD (p = 0.048) as well as on attitudes toward performing CSD (p = 0.036) and euthanasia (p = 0.023). Predominantly psycho-existential suffering was associated with a more favorable attitude toward WIV but influenced attitudes toward performing CSD negatively. Regression analysis showed that religiosity was associated with more reluctant attitudes toward palliative EOL practices and PAD, whereas training in palliative care was associated with more favorable attitudes toward palliative EOL practices only.
CONCLUSION: ALS physicians seem to acknowledge psycho-existential suffering as a highly acceptable motive for WIV but not CSD. Physicians appear to be comfortable with responding to the patient's requests, but more reluctant to assume a proactive role in the decision-making process. Palliative care training may support ALS physicians in these challenging situations.","['Thurn T', 'Borasio GD', 'Chiò A', 'Galvin M', 'McDermott CJ', 'Mora G', 'Sermeus W', 'Winkler AS', 'Anneser J']",2019,20,1-2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Thurn T, et al.

RESULTS: 396 individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were detected, the age-specific and sex-specific prevalence of MND was 4.02 per 100 000 inhabitants, higher among men (5.13 per 100 000) than women (3.01 per 100 000). Men were statistically significantly 40% less likely to receive a grant compared with women; among grant recipients, the younger the age of the participant, the higher the size of the grant received. The Index of Multiple Deprivation was not associated with either receiving a grant nor the amount of money received, among recipients.
CONCLUSION: Financial support by the Motor Neurone Disease Association is provided across individuals and across boroughs regardless of their socioeconomic circumstances. Differences that benefits women and younger patients were detected.","['Gkiouleka A', 'Manning A', 'Smith D', 'Malaspina A', 'Gallo V']",2019,9,2,BMJ Open,"Gkiouleka A, et al.

30741580,Rab-dependent cellular trafficking and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Rab GTPases are becoming increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, although their role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been somewhat overlooked. However, dysfunction of intracellular transport is gaining increasing attention as a pathogenic mechanism in ALS. Many previous studies have focused axonal trafficking, and the extreme length of axons in motor neurons may contribute to their unique susceptibility in this disorder. In contrast, the role of transport defects within the cell body has been relatively neglected. Similarly, whilst Rab GTPases control all intracellular membrane trafficking events, their role in ALS is poorly understood. Emerging evidence now highlights this family of proteins in ALS, particularly the discovery that C9orf72 functions in intra transport in conjunction with several Rab GTPases. Here, we summarize recent updates on cellular transport defects in ALS, with a focus on Rab GTPases and how their dysfunction may specifically target neurons and contribute to pathophysiology. We discuss the molecular mechanisms associated with dysfunction of Rab proteins in ALS. Finally, we also discuss dysfunction in other modes of transport recently implicated in ALS, including nucleocytoplasmic transport and the ER-mitochondrial contact regions (MAM compartment), and speculate whether these may also involve Rab GTPases.","['Parakh S', 'Perri ER', 'Jagaraj CJ', 'Ragagnin AMG', 'Atkin JD']",2018,53,6,Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol,"Parakh S, et al.

30712020,Assisted ventilation in motor neurone disease during inpatient palliative care: barriers and utilisation.,"OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) in the UK and Ireland use assisted ventilation, and a small proportion of these use long-term tracheostomy ventilation (TV).1 2 NICE guidelines recommend that patients with MND should routinely receive specialist palliative care input.3 The aim was to establish the extent to which hospices and specialist palliative care units (SPCUs) in the UK and Ireland currently manage patients with MND using assisted ventilation especially TV and to identify any associated barriers.
METHODS: A 25-item questionnaire was developed in Survey Monkey. A link to the questionnaire was emailed to every medical director (n=185) of inpatient hospices/SPCUs in the UK and Ireland.
RESULTS: The response rate was 42.4% (n=78). 97.4% of units admit patients with MND on non-invasive ventilation (NIV), but only 28.2% admit those using TV. 80.8% of units have adequate expertise in the management of NIV, compared with 7.7% for managing TV. 35.9% and 2.6% of units have a policy for managing patients using NIV and TV, respectively. 14.1% respondents had been involved in the care of patients with MND using TV, in the specialist palliative care setting in the last 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: A minority of UK and Irish hospices/SPUs provide support to TV MND patients and few units currently have management or admission policies for this cohort of patients. Respondents indicated a lack of appropriate expertise and experience. Further exploration of these barriers is required to establish how to optimise care for TV MND patients in this setting.","['Gleeson A', 'Johnson F']",2020,10,3,BMJ Support Palliat Care,Gleeson A and Johnson F.

30707358,Clinical and neuroimaging investigations of language disturbance in frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease patients.,"This study systematically investigated the neuropsychological profile of language disturbance in frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease (FTD-MND) using a data-driven approach. Neuroanatomical correlates of language profiles were also examined. Patients with FTD-MND (N = 26), pure motor neuron disease (N = 34), progressive non-fluent aphasia (N = 30), semantic dementia (N = 17), and controls (N = 31) underwent comprehensive language assessments. Clinical assessments were complemented with the Sydney Language Battery (SYDBAT), to assess semantic abilities, and the Test for Reception of Grammar (TROG), to assess syntactic comprehension. Two-step cluster analysis examined patterns of language impairment in FTD-MND and voxel-based morphometry investigated neuroanatomical differences between clusters. Almost all (88.5%) FTD-MND patients had language impairment, with anomia in 73.1% and impaired sentence comprehension in 56%. Cluster analysis revealed two main profiles of language impairment in FTD-MND; a mild mixed semantic and syntactic impairment (mild mixed subgroup) seen in 12 cases and a subgroup with more marked impairment particularly of syntactic comprehension (PNFA-like subgroup) seen in 7 cases. VBM revealed disproportionate atrophy of the caudate head and putamen bilaterally in the PNFA-like subgroup. In conclusion, language disturbances in FTD-MND are heterogeneous and more mixed than seen in FTD language phenotypes. Atrophy of the caudate and putamen was correlated with disproportionate impairment of syntactic comprehension. A pure semantic dementia like syndrome appears to be rare in FTD-MND.","['Long Z', 'Irish M', 'Piguet O', 'Kiernan MC', 'Hodges JR', 'Burrell JR']",2019,266,4,J Neurol,"Long Z, et al.

30665069,Superconditioning TMS unmasks latent voluntary innervation in MND - A case report.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) includes both ALS and Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA) as variants. Abnormalities in brain excitability and upper motor neuron (UMN) function are characteristic of ALS, but by definition are absent in PMA. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may be useful in demonstrating UMN pathology, but loss of muscle responsiveness with disease progression limits its usefulness in later stages of MND. We have developed a novel form of TMS comprised of 4 stimulating pulses that can enhance MEPs in target muscles already responding to traditional TMS inputs, in some cases even restoring MEPs in target muscles rendered unresponsive by the disease. An example of restored MEPs in response to this superconditioning TMS pattern (TMSsc) in a person with PMA is described, along with an unexpected finding. Despite a prolonged (> 5 year) history of movement paralysis in his right tibialis anterior (TA), immediately after cessation of TMSsc delivery the subject could now easily contract and relax this muscle; the presence of a latent pathway for voluntary innervation of his right TA was revealed. This modulation of central motor functional connectivity in response to TMSsc suggests a further, clinically-significant benefit of this form of noninvasive brain stimulation beyond its ability to enhance MEPs to traditional TMS inputs.","['Calancie B', 'Young E', 'Alexeeva N']",2019,398,,J Neurol Sci,"Calancie B, et al.

30659642,Combined fused in sarcoma-positive (FUS+) basophilic inclusion body disease and atypical tauopathy presenting with an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND)-plus phenotype.,"AIMS: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND) is characterized by the presence of inclusions containing TDP-43 within motor neurones. In rare cases, ALS/MND may be associated with inclusions containing other proteins, such as fused in sarcoma (FUS), while motor system pathology may rarely be a feature of other neurodegenerative disorders. We here have investigated the association of FUS and tau pathology.
METHODS: We report a case with an ALS/MND-plus clinical syndrome which pathologically demonstrated both FUS pathology and an atypical tauopathy.
RESULTS: Clinical motor involvement was predominantly present in the upper motor neurone, and was accompanied by extrapyramidal features and sensory involvement, but with only minimal cognitive impairment. The presentation was sporadic and gene mutation screening was negative. Post mortem study demonstrated inclusions positive for FUS, including basophilic inclusion bodies. This was associated with 4R-tauopathy, largely as non-fibrillary diffuse phospho-tau in neurones, with granulovacuolar degeneration in a more restricted distribution. Double-staining revealed that neurones contained both types of protein pathology.
CONCLUSION: FUS-positive basophilic inclusion body disease is a rare cause of ALS/MND, but in this case was associated with an unusual atypical tauopathy. The coexistence of two such rare neuropathologies raises the question of a pathogenic interaction.","['Wharton SB', 'Verber NS', 'Wagner BE', 'Highley JR', 'Fillingham DJ', 'Waller R', 'Strand K', 'Ince PG', 'Shaw PJ']",2019,45,6,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Wharton SB, et al.

This group of diseases has a high morbidity and mortality rate overall and delineating each type of disease can help guide appropriate clinical management and improve quality of life for patients. Of all MNDs, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is by far the most common comprising 80%-90% of cases. However, other mimics and variants of ALS can appear similar both clinically and radiographically. In this review, we delve into the epidemiological, physiological, neuroimaging, and prognostic characteristics and management of ALS and its most common MND mimics/variants.

30538137,Sexuality and intimacy in ALS: systematic literature review and future perspectives.,"Several features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) impact on sexuality and intimate relationship; however, the issue has received poor attention so far. We performed a systematic literature review in order to provide an up-to-date account of sexuality in ALS. References were identified by searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO (1970-2017, English literature). The following were the key terms: 'sexual' OR 'sexuality' OR 'intimacy' OR 'marital' AND 'ALS' OR 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis' OR 'Motor Neuron Disease' OR 'MND'. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance and a full-text analysis was performed on the selected articles. Studies were included if they referred to sexual well-being/activities/functions or intimate relationship between patients and their partners and management of such topic by clinicians. Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. A thematic and level of evidence classification of studies was performed. Studies' design, objectives, measurements and outcomes were summarised. Thirty articles were included and four topics were identified: intimacy in the dyads; sexual activities in patients and with their partners; sexual function disturbances; and sexuality and cognitive-behavioural alterations. The quality of the studies varies, with globally poor level of evidence. Some sexuality issues have been only sparsely addressed, such as gender-related differences, same-sex relationships and sexual activities other than intercourse. Sexuality in ALS is still not adequately considered by clinicians and researchers.

30515715,Fungal Neurotoxins and Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"We review several lines of evidence that point to a potential fungal origin of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is the most common form of motor neuron disease (MND) in adults. It is a progressive and fatal disease. Approximately 90% cases of ALS are sporadic, and 5-10% are due to genetic mutations (familial). About 25 genes implicated in familial ALS have been identified so far, including SOD1 and TARDBP, the gene encoding 43 kDa transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein (TDP-43). Despite intensive research over many decades, the aetiology of sporadic ALS is still unknown. An environmental cause, including grass or soil-associated fungal infections, is suggested from a range of widely diverse lines of evidence. Clusters of ALS have been reported in soccer players, natives of Guam and farmers. Grass-associated fungi are known to produce a range of neurotoxins and, in symbiotic associations, high levels of fungal SOD1. Exposure of neurons to fungal neurotoxins elicits a significant increase in glutamate production. High levels of glutamate stimulate TDP-43 translocation and modification, providing a link between fungal infection and one of the molecular and histologic hallmarks of sporadic ALS. A recent study provided evidence of a variety of fungi in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of ALS patients. This review provides a rational explanation for this observation. If a fungal infection could be confirmed as a potential cause of ALS, this could provide a straightforward treatment strategy for this fatal and incurable disease.","['French PW', 'Ludowyke R', 'Guillemin GJ']",2019,35,4,Neurotox Res,"French PW, et al.

30511086,Neurons selectively targeted in frontotemporal dementia reveal early stage TDP-43 pathobiology.,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation is the most common pathological hallmark in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and characterizes nearly all patients with motor neuron disease (MND). The earliest stages of TDP-43 pathobiology are not well-characterized, and whether neurodegeneration results from TDP-43 loss-of-function or aggregation remains unclear. In the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD), patients undergo selective dropout of von Economo neurons (VENs) and fork cells within the frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortices. Here, we examined TDP-43 pathobiology within these vulnerable neurons in the FI across a clinical spectrum including 17 patients with sporadic bvFTD, MND, or both. In an exploratory analysis based on our initial observations, we further assessed ten patients with C9orf72-associated bvFTD/MND. VENs and fork cells showed early, disproportionate TDP-43 aggregation that correlated with anatomical and clinical severity, including loss of emotional empathy. The presence of a TDP-43 inclusion was associated with striking nuclear and somatodendritic atrophy. An intriguing minority of neurons lacked detectable nuclear TDP-43 despite the apparent absence of a cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusion. These cells showed neuronal atrophy comparable to inclusion-bearing neurons, suggesting that the loss of nuclear TDP-43 function promotes neurodegeneration, even when TDP-43 aggregation is inconspicuous or absent.","['Nana AL', 'Sidhu M', 'Gaus SE', 'Hwang JL', 'Li L', 'Park Y', 'Kim EJ', 'Pasquini L', 'Allen IE', 'Rankin KP', 'Toller G', 'Kramer JH', 'Geschwind DH', 'Coppola G', 'Huang EJ', 'Grinberg LT', 'Miller BL', 'Seeley WW']",2019,137,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Nana AL, et al.

30496320,Measurement of spinal cord atrophy using phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) imaging in motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: The spectrum of motor neuron disease (MND) includes numerous phenotypes with various life expectancies. The degree of upper and lower motor neuron involvement can impact prognosis. Phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) imaging has been shown to detect in vivo gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy in the spinal cord of other patient populations but has not been explored in MND.
METHODS: In this study, total cord, WM and GM areas of ten patients with a diagnosis within the MND spectrum were compared to those of ten healthy controls (HC). Patients' diagnosis included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, primary muscular atrophy, facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy and ALS-Frontotemporal dementia. Axial 2D PSIR images were acquired at four cervical disc levels (C2-C3, C3-C4, C5-C6 and C7-T1) with a short acquisition time (2 minutes) protocol. Total cross-sectional areas (TCA), GM and WM areas were measured using a combination of highly reliable manual and semi-automated methods. Cord areas in MND patients were compared with HC using linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex. Correlation of WM and GM areas in MND patients was explored to gain insights into underlying atrophy patterns.
RESULTS: MND patients as a group had significantly smaller cervical cord GM area compared to HC at all four levels (C2-C3: p = .009; C3-C4: p = .001; C5-C6: p = .006; C7-T1: p = .002). WM area at C5-C6 level was significantly smaller (p = .001). TCA was significantly smaller at C3-C4 (p = .018) and C5-C6 (p = .002). No significant GM and WM atrophy was detected in the two patients with predominantly bulbar phenotype. Concomitant GM and WM atrophy was detected in solely upper or lower motor neuron level phenotypes. There was a significant correlation between GM and WM areas at all four levels in this diverse population of MND.
CONCLUSION: Spinal cord GM and WM atrophy can be detected in vivo in patients within the MND spectrum using a short acquisition time 2D PSIR imaging protocol. PSIR imaging shows promise as a method for quantifying spinal cord involvement and thus may be useful for diagnosis, prognosis and for monitoring disease progression.","['Olney NT', 'Bischof A', 'Rosen H', 'Caverzasi E', 'Stern WA', 'Lomen-Hoerth C', 'Miller BL', 'Henry RG', 'Papinutto N']",2018,13,11,PLoS One,"Olney NT, et al.

Falls are frequent in the MND population, and are associated with an increased burden of disease. The complex interplay of both motor and extramotor manifestations in this disease contributes to the heterogeneous and multifactorial causes of such dysfunction. This review highlights the pathophysiologic influence of motor degeneration in gait disturbance, but also the additional influence on postural instability from other inputs such as cognitive impairment, autonomic dysregulation, cerebellar dysfunction, sensory impairment, and extrapyramidal involvement. In various combinations, these impairments are responsible for reduced gait speed and alteration in gait cycle, as well as structurally more variable and disorganized gait patterns. Based on these features, this chapter will also provide disease-specific interventions to assess, manage, and prevent falls in the MND cohort.","['Dharmadasa T', 'Matamala JM', 'Huynh W', 'Zoing MC', 'Kiernan MC']",2018,159,,Handb Clin Neurol,"Dharmadasa T, et al.

We report anonymised aggregated data from the first year's enrolment. 12th July 2018, there were 142 participants enrolled in the NZ MND Registry. Participant sex distribution reflects the demographics reported worldwide, but ethnicity is divergent from what is seen in New Zealand overall, with an over-representation of people who identify as New Zealand European. 85.5% of participants are diagnosed with sporadic MND and 6.1% with familial MND. The remainder were participants who have not been diagnosed but have a family history, or positive genetic test for a MND-causing mutation. Levels of disability are reported using ALSFRS-R scores, and show that the majority of participants are within the higher range of the scale. The registry has facilitated entry of patients into three studies to date. The establishment of the NZ MND Registry illustrates a swift launch of a rare disease patient registry. The role of patient registries is an ever changing one, but with clear utility at every point of along the pathway to drug discovery.","['Walker KL', 'Rodrigues MJ', 'Watson B', 'Reilly C', 'Scotter EL', 'Brunton H', 'Turnbull J', 'Roxburgh RH']",2019,60,,J Clin Neurosci,"Walker KL, et al.

30468382,Quantum Capacitance Based Amplified Graphene Phononics for Studying Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease (MND) characterized by a rapid loss of upper and lower motor neurons resulting in patient death from respiratory failure within 3-5 years of initial symptom onset. Although at least 30 genes of major effect have been reported, the pathobiology of ALS is not well understood. Compounding this is the lack of a reliable laboratory test which can accurately diagnose this rapidly deteriorating disease. Herein, we report on the phonon vibration energies of graphene as a sensitive measure of the composite dipole moment of the interfaced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that includes a signature-composition specific to the patients with ALS disease.

30458059,A pilot trial of RNS60 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"INTRODUCTION: RNS60 is a novel immune-modulatory agent that has shown neuroprotective effects in amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) preclinical models. RNS60 is administered by weekly intravenous infusion and daily nebulization. The objective of this pilot open-label trial was to test the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of long-term RNS60 administration in ALS patients.
METHODS: The planned treatment duration was 23 weeks and the primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes included PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and plasma biomarkers of inflammation.
RESULTS: Sixteen participants with ALS received RNS60 and 13 (81%) completed 23 weeks of RNS60 treatment. There were no serious adverse events and no participants withdrew from the trial due to drug-related adverse events. There were no significant changes in the biomarkers.
DISCUSSION: Long-term RNS60 administration was safe and well-tolerated. A large, multicenter, phase II trial of RNS60 is currently enrolling participants to test the effects of RNS60 on ALS biomarkers and disease progression.

30442280,Mapping ALSFRS-R and ALSUI to EQ-5D in Patients with Motor Neuron Disease.,"BACKGROUND: The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) is the preferred measure of health outcome in clinical trials in motor neuron disease (MND). It, however, does not provide a preference-based health utility score required for estimating quality-adjusted life-years in economic evaluations for health technology assessments.
OBJECTIVES: To develop algorithms for mapping from measures used in MND clinical studies to allow for future prediction of the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) utility in populations of patients with MND when utility data have not been collected.
METHODS: Direct mapping models were developed using ordinary least squares and Tobit regression analyses to estimate EQ-5D-5L utilities (based on English tariffs), with ALSFRS-R total, domain, and item scores used as explanatory variables, using patient-level data from a UK cohort study. Indirect mapping models were also used to map EQ-5D-5L domains, using the same variables, along with the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale for MND using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Goodness of fit was assessed along with predicted values for each mapping model.
RESULTS: The best-performing model predicting EQ-5D-5L utilities used five items of the ALSFRS-R items as explanatory variables in a stepwise ordinary least squares regression. The mean squared error was 0.0228, and the mean absolute error was 0.1173. Prediction was good, with 55.4% of estimated values within 0.1 and 91.4% within 0.25 of the observed EQ-5D-5L utility value. Indirect mapping using the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale for MND provided less predictive power than direct mapping models.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to present mapping algorithms to crosswalk between ALSFRS-R and EQ-5D-5L. This analysis demonstrates that the ALSFRS-R can be used to estimate EQ-5D-5L utilities when they have not been collected directly within a trial.","['Moore A', 'Young CA', 'Hughes DA']",2018,21,11,Value Health,"Moore A, et al.

30428468,Cerebrospinal Fluid Neurofilaments May Discriminate Upper Motor Neuron Syndromes: A Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients presenting with upper motor neuron (UMN) signs may widely diverge in prognosis, ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (hSP). Neurofilaments are emerging as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for ALS, but the diagnosis of UMN syndromes still relies mostly on clinical long-term observation and on familiarity or genetic confirmation.
OBJECTIVES: To test whether phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) may discriminate different UMN syndromes at diagnosis and to test their prognostic role among these diseases.
METHODS: We measured the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum pNfH of 30 patients presenting with UMN signs and diagnosed with ALS, hSP, and PLS, plus 9 healthy controls (HC).
RESULTS: ALS patients had higher levels of pNfH in CSF and serum compared to HC (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 in CSF and serum, respectively) and PLS (p = 0.015 and p = 0.038) and hSP (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001) patients. PLS and hSP patients had similar CSF and serum pNfH concentrations, but a higher CSF pNfH concentration, compared to HC (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003 for PLS and hSP, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curves for discriminating ALS from PLS and hSP showed an area under the curve of 0.79 for CSF and 0.81 for serum. In multivariable survival analysis including relevant clinical factors CSF pNfH represented the strongest variable predicting survival (HR 40.43; 95% CI 3.49-467.79, p = 0.003) independently of clinical group.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite some statistical instability of the results due to limitations in sample size, our study supports the role of CSF pNfH as a prognostic biomarker for motor neuron diseases presenting with UMN signs. A potential power to discriminate between ALS and other UMN syndromes at presentation, and between all of the examined MND and HC, has been detected for both CSF and serum pNfH.","['Zucchi E', 'Bedin R', 'Fasano A', 'Fini N', 'Gessani A', 'Vinceti M', 'Mandrioli J']",2018,18,5-6,Neurodegener Dis,"Zucchi E, et al.

30423874,Geographic Analysis of Motor Neuron Disease Mortality and Heavy Metals Released to Rivers in Spain.,"The etiology of motor neuron disease (MND) is still unknown. The aims of this study were to: (1) analyze MND mortality at a fine-grained level; and (2) explore associations of MND and heavy metals released into Spanish river basins. MND deaths were extracted from the Spanish nationwide mortality registry (2007⁻2016). Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for MND were estimated at a municipal level. Sites that emitted quantities of heavy metals above the regulatory thresholds were obtained from the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register database (2007⁻2015). The relative risks for non-exposed and exposed municipalities (considering a downstream 20 km river section) by type of heavy metal were analyzed using a log-linear model. SMRs were significantly higher in central and northern municipalities. SMRs were 1.14 (1.10⁻1.17) higher in areas exposed to heavy metals than in non-exposed areas: 0.95 (0.92⁻0.96). Considering the different metals, we found the following increased MND death risks in exposed areas: 20.9% higher risk for lead, 20.0% for zinc, 16.7% for arsenic, 15.7% for chromium, 15.4% for cadmium, 12.7% for copper, and 12.4% for mercury. This study provides associations between MND death risk and heavy metals in exposed municipalities. Further studies investigating heavy metal exposure are needed to progress in MND understanding.","['Sánchez-Díaz G', 'Escobar F', 'Badland H', 'Arias-Merino G', 'Posada de la Paz M', 'Alonso-Ferreira V']",2018,15,11,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Sánchez-Díaz G, et al.

30422940,Protein disulphide isomerase is associated with mutant SOD1 in canine degenerative myelopathy.,"Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder prevalent in the canine population. It may represent a unique, naturally occurring disease model for human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) because of similar clinical signs and association with superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1) mutations. Misfolded SOD1 aggregates and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are major pathophysiological features associated with ALS. Interestingly, an ER foldase, protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) is upregulated during ALS and it co-localizes with SOD1 inclusions in ALS patient tissues. Furthermore, mutations in the gene encoding PDI were recently associated with ALS. Given the genetic similarity between DM and ALS, we investigated whether ER stress and PDI were associated with DM. Protein extracts from spinal cord tissue of DM-affected dogs bearing a SOD1 mutation were examined for ER stress by western blotting. Immunohistochemical staining was also carried out to examine co-localization between endogenous PDI and SOD1 inclusions in spinal cord tissues of dogs affected with DM. PDI and CHOP, the proapoptotic protein induced during ER stress, were significantly upregulated in DM-affected dogs compared with controls. Furthermore, PDI co-localized with intracellular SOD1 aggregates in DM-affected dogs in all motor neurons examined, indicating that PDI may be a cellular defence mechanism against SOD1 misfolding in DM. Our results imply that ER stress is induced in DM-affected dogs; hence, it is a common pathological mechanism associated with both ALS and DM. The possibility that PDI may be a therapeutic target to inhibit SOD1 aggregation in DM dogs is also raised by this study.","['Chang RC', 'Parakh S', 'Coates JR', 'Long S', 'Atkin JD']",2019,30,1,Neuroreport,"Chang RC, et al.

METHOD: Patients with a new diagnosis of MND over a five-year period (1 February 2013-31 January 2018) were identified via a clinical coding search of all outpatient and inpatient encounters. Records were then individually screened to confirm a new diagnosis of MND via both clinical (confirmation by a neurologist) and neurophysiological (needle electromyography) criteria.
RESULTS: Twenty-five new diagnoses of MND were identified. The incidence was 2.9 per 100,000/year. Mean and median age at diagnosis were 69 and 72 respectively (range 38-84), and the male:female ratio was 13:12. Of the 25 identified cases, 21 (84%) were of European descent, two (8%) of Māori descent, and two of undetermined ethnicity.
DISCUSSION: The findings from this study (incidence of 2.9/100,000) are in concordance with the higher incidence of MND found in other regions of New Zealand compared with other areas of the world.

30296856,The Swedish motor neuron disease quality registry.,"OBJECTIVE: We set up the Swedish Motor Neuron Disease (MND) Quality Registry to assure early diagnosis and high-quality health care for all MND patients (mainly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS), and to create a research base by prospectively following the entire MND population in Sweden.
METHODS: Since 2015, the MND Quality Registry continuously collects information about a wide range of clinical measures, biological samples, and quality of life outcomes from all MND patients recruited at the time of MND diagnosis in Sweden and followed at each clinic visit approximately every 12 weeks. The Registry includes an Internet based patient own reporting portal that involves patients in the registration of their current symptoms and health status.
RESULTS: As of 20th January 2017, the MND Quality Registry included 99% of the MND patients of the Stockholm area (N = 194), consisting mostly of ALS patients (N = 153, 78.9%), followed by patients labeled as MND due to a neurophysiology finding but not fulfilling the criteria for ALS (N = 20, 10.3%), primary lateral sclerosis (N = 13, 6.7%), and progressive spinal muscular atrophy patients (N = 8, 4.1%). A higher proportion of these patients were women (N = 100, 52%), and women and men had a similar age at symptoms onset (59 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Main strengths of the MND Quality Registry are its clinical, quantitative, qualitative, and prospective nature, providing the researchers potential means of identifying appropriate candidates for clinical trials and other research projects, as well as assuring to the patients an effective and adequate time spent on-site with the healthcare professionals.","['Longinetti E', 'Regodón Wallin A', 'Samuelsson K', 'Press R', 'Zachau A', 'Ronnevi LO', 'Kierkegaard M', 'Andersen PM', 'Hillert J', 'Fang F', 'Ingre C']",2018,19,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Longinetti E, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TIGAR Immunohistochemistry, using a range of antibodies, was undertaken for detailed assessment of TIGAR in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from post mortem brains of PD patients and other neurodegenerative disorders (n = 10 controls, 10 PD cases, 10 dementia with Lewy bodies, 5 motor neurone disease (MND), 3 multiple system atrophy (MSA)) and complemented by immunohistochemistry for p53, hexokinase I (HK-I) and hexokinase II (HK-II; n = 4 control, 4 PD, and 4 dementia with Lewy bodies).
RESULTS: TIGAR was detected in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the substantia nigra of sporadic PD and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients. Staining of adjacent sections and double staining confirmed the presence of TIGAR alongside alpha-synuclein in these LB and neurites. In contrast, TIGAR-positive aggregates were not seen in cortical Lewy bodies. TIGAR protein was also absent in both TDP-43-positive inclusions in MND and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA. Subsequent investigation of the TIGAR-upstream regulator p53 and the downstream targets HK-I and HK-II in PD brains suggested a possible mild increase in HK-I.
CONCLUSIONS: TIGAR protein, is present in SN Lewy bodies of both sporadic PD and DLB. The absence of TIGAR protein in the pathological inclusions of MND or MSA suggests disease specificity and further raises the possibility that TIGAR may be involved in PD pathogenesis.","['López KLR', 'Simpson JE', 'Watson LC', 'Mortiboys H', 'Hautbergue GM', 'Bandmann O', 'Highley JR']",2019,1706,,Brain Res,"López KLR, et al.

Awareness of cognitive impairment in ALS has increased in recent years. We describe the epidemiology and clinical features of ALS in a county in northern Norway over a period of 15 years.
METHODS: All patients with motor neuron disease (MND) living in Nordland County in the period 2000-2015 were identified and the medical records were scrutinized. The average annual incidence was calculated for the whole period and for five-year periods. Prevalence point was 1 January 2015.
RESULTS: We identified 74 cases with MND. The crude point prevalence was 4.1 per 100,000. The average annual incidence was 2.1 per 100,000 for the whole period, 2.0 in the period 2000-2004, 2.3 in 2005-2009, and 2.0 in 2010-2014. All except one of the 22 patients with other forms of MND developed ALS during the course of the disease. The mean survival time was 38 months, patients with bulbar symptoms at diagnosis had a mean survival time of 29 months and those with solely spinal symptoms had a mean survival time of 50 months. Seven patients were diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
CONCLUSION: The incidence was stable during the study period. Other forms of MND converts to clinical ALS given time. Survival time is almost two years shorter in patients with bulbar symptoms at the first examination, compared to those with solely symptoms from spinal muscles.

Although pain as a symptom appears in many patients with MND, it is often misdiagnosed as other diseases when occurs before the onset of weakness. Patients are often assigned to non-neurological departments due to the atypical symptoms, which can lead to diagnostic delay and inappropriate treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the causes of misdiagnosis and improve the clinician's understanding of neck pain in patients with MND.
METHODS: We reviewed relevant literature and retrospectively reported a misdiagnosis case of MND-associated neck pain.
RESULTS: A case of MND presenting prominently as neck pain was suspected of suffering from cervical spondylosis and wrongly assigned to orthopedic clinic. When eventually being diagnosed as MND, his neck pain was found to be caused by intracranial hypertension (ICH) resulting from hypoxia via insidious respiratory failure through ventilator insufficiency.
CONCLUSION: Careful evaluation of the clinical progression of the symptoms, extensive EMG and nerve conduction study, as well as the establishment of better clinical approach to the diagnosis and higher public awareness allow a reduction of misdiagnosis.","['Lai X', 'Gu X', 'Yang X', 'Sun J', 'Jiang M', 'Bu B', 'Feng G', 'Li L']",2018,55,,J Clin Neurosci,"Lai X, et al.

30232045,Clinical and prognostic features of ALS/MND in different phenotypes-data from a hospital-based registry.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the natural history, clinical features, and survival relevance of patients presenting with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) with different phenotypes.
METHODS: All patients were prospectively enrolled in a hospital-based register from 2006 to 2015. Cases were classified according to established phenotypes: classic, bulbar, flail arm, flail leg, upper motor neuron dominate, respiratory, pure lower motor neuron and pure upper motor neuron. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1157 patients with complete clinical information were registered in the current cohort study. The classic phenotype was the most frequent phenotype. The mean age of onset, diagnostic delay, smoking status, exposure to pesticides and mean survival time were significantly different among different phenotypes. The median survival time was 3.1 years for all patients. At the end of the analysis, the 3-year survival rate was 62.1%, the 5-year survival rate was 39.6%, and the 10-year survival rate was 22.0%. The Cox analysis revealed that the disease phenotype was an independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio = 0.825, P < 0.001), after adjusting for other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the natural history data of ALS/MND and supported the theory that varied disease phenotypes had different clinical, demographic and prognostic characteristics, which provided the basis for analysis of future management and treatment for ALS/MND. Furthermore, the phenotypic expression of ALS/MND with distinctive characteristics is important for providing complementary information for identifying the underlying mechanisms of the diseases.","['Wei QQ', 'Chen Y', 'Chen X', 'Cao B', 'Ou R', 'Zhang L', 'Hou Y', 'Shang H']",2018,142,,Brain Res Bull,"Wei QQ, et al.

30183086,The width of the third ventricle associates with cognition and behaviour in motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVES: An enlarged width of the third ventricle (WTV) has been described in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, although its clinical meaning is unknown. The aims of this study were to evaluate the contribution of demographical, clinical and genetic factors to the WTV in different motor neuron disease (MND) phenotypes and to assess its brain structural correlates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The WTV was measured by transcranial ultrasound in 107 MND patients (82 diagnosed with classical ALS, 16 with progressive muscular atrophy and 9 with primary lateral sclerosis) and 25 controls. Genetic analysis, and neurological and neuropsychological examinations were performed in patients. Brain volumetric analysis of MR images was obtained in 85 patients. The association of WTV with demographical, clinical, genetic and neuropsychological variables as well as with brain volumes was assessed by multivariable models.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients were diagnosed with genetic MND and 42.3% of patients showed executive or behavioural impairment (EBI). MND patients showed larger WTV than controls. The WTV was significantly associated with age, spinal onset and the presence of EBI, but not with the genetic background, the phenotype or disability. Greater WTV was also associated with reduced subcortical grey matter volume, but not with the cortical or the white matter volume.
CONCLUSIONS: The enlargement of the WTV found in the different MND phenotypes is attributable to the subcortical grey matter atrophy and is associated with cognitive and behavioural impairment. Larger longitudinal studies are needed to determine its role as biomarker in MND patients with frontotemporal dementia.","['Vázquez-Costa JF', 'Carratalà-Boscà S', 'Tembl JI', 'Fornés-Ferrer V', 'Pérez-Tur J', 'Martí-Bonmatí L', 'Sevilla T']",2019,139,2,Acta Neurol Scand,"Vázquez-Costa JF, et al.

Most of reports describing ASL-FTD cases show a strong association between ALS and the behavioural form of FTD. Conversely, the association between ALS and pure Semantic Dementia or Progressive Non-Fluent Aphasia (PNFA) is extremely rare, ranging from 1 to 3%. A clinical phenotype characterized by a rapidly progressive aphasic dementia and motoneuron disease (MND) has been described in few case reports; since the updating of PNFA diagnostic criteria in 2011, no clinical report has been related. We want to describe a case of patient presented, at the onset, as PNFA who developed, one year later, ALS with bulbar onset. The patient was screened for the main genes causing or associated with MND and/or dementia but no variants with a pathogenetic effect were observed.","['De Marchi F', 'Tondo G', 'Sarnelli MF', 'Corrado L', 'Solara V', ""D'Alfonso S"", 'Cantello R', 'Mazzini L']",2019,129,7,Int J Neurosci,"De Marchi F, et al.

Mean age 52 years, 59% female. 41 173 (22%) went to an emergency department for respiratory complications on average 1.6 times every 3 years; 14 947 (8%) individuals were admitted to hospital 1.4 times every 3 years. Outpatient respiratory specialist visits occurred for 64 084 (35%) with four visits every 3 years, although substantial variation in visit frequency was found. 157 285 (85%) went to the emergency department (all-cause) almost 4 times every 3 years, 100 052 (54%) were admitted to hospital. Individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND) had more emergency department visits compared with other types of NMD (p<0.0001).One-third of adults with NMD received respiratory specialist care at a frequency recommended by professional guidelines, although substantial variation exists.

30133939,Clinical features of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia that are useful for predicting underlying pathological subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"BACKGROUND: The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is the most common phenotype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTLD is divided into three main pathological subtypes: tau-positive FTLD (FTLD-tau), FTLD-TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP), and FTLD-Fused in sarcoma (FUS). At present, it is difficult to predict the underlying pathological subtypes of sporadic bvFTD before a patient's death.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical features of 34 Japanese patients with sporadic bvFTD, with or without motor neuron disease (MND), who had been pathologically diagnosed with FTLD. We examined whether, and how, the clinical features differed among Pick's disease, FTLD-TDP, and FTLD-FUS patients.
RESULTS: Six of the 34 patients developed MND during the course of bvFTD. These six bvFTD-MND patients were all pathologically diagnosed with FTLD-TDP. The other 28 patients were composed of 12 FTLD-tau patients including 11 Pick's disease patients, 8 FTLD-TDP patients, and 8 FTLD-FUS patients. A comparison of the clinical features of the three pathological subtypes of the 33 patients demonstrated that the age at onset was significantly younger in FTLD-FUS patients than in Pick's disease or FTLD-TDP patients. Furthermore, while hyperorality and dietary changes in the early stage of the disease were present in approximately 40% of Pick's disease and FTLD-FUS patients, they were absent in FTLD-TDP patients.
CONCLUSION: The comorbidity of MND, a younger age at onset, and hyperorality and dietary changes in the early stage may be useful clinical features for predicting underlying pathological subtypes of sporadic bvFTD. The results of our study should be confirmed by prospective studies employing a larger number of cases.","['Kobayashi Z', 'Arai T', 'Kawakami I', 'Yokota O', 'Hosokawa M', 'Oshima K', 'Niizato K', 'Shiraishi A', 'Akiyama H', 'Mizusawa H']",2018,18,4,Psychogeriatrics,"Kobayashi Z, et al.

30076267,Cognitive and behavioural changes in PLS and PMA:challenging the concept of restricted phenotypes.,"OBJECTIVES: Cognitive and behavioural changes within the spectrum of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are observed frequently in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Whether these changes also occur in other forms of motor neuron disease (MND) is not well studied. We therefore systemically screened a large cohort of patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) for cognitive and behavioural changes, and subsequently compared our findings with a cohort of patients with ALS.
METHODS: Using a set of screening instruments (Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen, ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia Questionnaire, Frontal Assessment Battery, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), the presence of cognitive and behavioural changes as well as anxiety and depression in 277 patients with ALS, 75 patients with PLS and 143 patients with PMA was evaluated retrospectively.
RESULTS: We found a high frequency of cognitive and behavioural abnormalities with similar profiles in all three groups. Subjects with behavioural variant FTD were identified in all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of patients with PLS and PMA with cognitive dysfunction was similar to patients with ALS, emphasising the importance for cognitive screening as part of routine clinical care in all three patient groups. With a similar cognitive profile, in line with genetic and clinical overlap between the MNDs, the view of PLS as an MND exclusively affecting upper motor neurons and PMA exclusively affecting lower motor neurons cannot be held. Therefore, our findings are in contrast to the recently revised El Escorial criteria of 2015, where PLS and PMA are described as restricted phenotypes. Our study favours a view of PLS and PMA as multidomain diseases similar to ALS.","['de Vries BS', 'Rustemeijer LMM', 'Bakker LA', 'Schröder CD', 'Veldink JH', 'van den Berg LH', 'Nijboer TCW', 'van Es MA']",2019,90,2,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"de Vries BS, et al.

30039719,Caregiver burden and quality of life of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in India.,"AIM: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND) is a progressive degenerative disorder that can have significant debilitating impact. Few studies have explored living with ALS in the developing countries. The study aims to understand the relationship between functionality, quality of life, and caregiver burden in ALS in the sociocultural scenario in India.
METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed among 30 persons with ALS and their caregivers (men = 19; women = 11) receiving treatment from a national quaternary referral care center for Neurological disorders in Southern India. All patients were diagnosed as Definite ALS according to El Escorial Criteria. The mean age at onset of illness was 51.6 years and mean duration of illness at presenting to hospital was 11 months. The caregivers were spouses, offspring, or siblings. Variables were assessed with ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS- R), ALS Specific Quality of Life Scale (ALSSQOL-R) with the patients and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) with the caregiver.
RESULTS: Functionality and quality of life negatively correlated with caregiver burden. Caregiver burden was negatively associated with ""negative emotional state"" and ""interaction of the patient with family and environment"", sub domains in ALSQOL scale. No significant association was noted between caregiver burden and intimacy, religiosity as well as physical symptoms domains of quality of life.
CONCLUSION: ALS patients and caregivers would benefit from structured care plan that is sensitive to the impact of the illness on the specific domains of quality of life as well as the deterioration in the neurological functioning.","['Thomas PT', 'Warrier MG', 'Sadasivan A', 'Balasubramanium B', 'Preethish-Kumar V', 'Nashi S', 'Polavarapu K', 'Krishna G', 'Vengalil S', 'Rajaram P', 'Nalini A']",2018,19,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Thomas PT, et al.

30029693,Poly-GR dipeptide repeat polymers correlate with neurodegeneration and Clinicopathological subtypes in C9ORF72-related brain disease.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is heterogeneous in clinical presentation, neuropathological characteristics and genetics. An expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of both FTLD and motor neuron disease (MND). Dipeptide repeat polymers (DPR) are generated through repeat-associated non-ATG translation, and they aggregate in neuronal inclusions with a distribution distinct from that of TDP-43 pathology. Recent studies from animal and cell culture models suggest that DPR might be toxic, but that toxicity may differ for specific DPR. Arginine containing DPR (poly-GR and poly-PR) have the greatest toxicity and are less frequent than other DPR (poly-GP, poly-GA). A unique feature of arginine-containing DPR is their potential for post-translational modification by methyl-transferases, which produces methylarginine DPR. In this report, we explored the relationship of DPR and methylarginine to markers of neurodegeneration using quantitative digital microscopic methods in 40 patients with C9ORF72 mutations and one of three different clinicopathologic phenotypes, FTLD, FTLD-MND or MND. We find that density and distribution of poly-GR inclusions are different from poly-GA and poly-GP inclusions. We also demonstrate colocalization of poly-GR with asymmetrical dimethylarginine (aDMA) immunoreactivity in regions with neurodegeneration. Differences in aDMA were also noted by clinical phenotype. FTLD-MND had the highest burden of poly-GR pathology compared to FTLD and MND, while FTLD-MND had higher burden of aDMA than FTLD. The results suggest that poly-GR pathology is associated with toxicity and neurodegeneration. It remains to be determined if dimethylarginine modification of poly-GR could contribute to its toxicity.","['Sakae N', 'Bieniek KF', 'Zhang YJ', 'Ross K', 'Gendron TF', 'Murray ME', 'Rademakers R', 'Petrucelli L', 'Dickson DW']",2018,6,1,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Sakae N, et al.

We presented the first case of patient affected by HER2-positive breast tumor and possible paraneoplastic lower motor neuron disease. In literature, few cases are reported but no one highlights the tumor receptors' profile. Instead, HER2-positive breast cancers are prone to be related to anti-Yo-associated paraneoplastic cerebellar disorders. Anti-onconeural antibodies positivity can be rarely found, confirming that paraneoplastic MND have no specific biomarkers.

Degenerative diseases of central nervous system (CNS) are quite common, contributing significantly to morbidity as well as mortality %. In neurodegenerative diseases such as motor neuron disease (MND), Cerebellar Ataxia (CA) and Parkinson's disease (PD), there is no direct evidence for involvement of metals and free radicals in the etiology but circumstantial evidence provides a hypothesis that alteration in metals and free radicals contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in these disorders. The aim of the present study was to estimate free radicals cascade i.e. damage caused in terms of malondialdehyde (MDA) and defense system Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in blood and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of neurodegenerative diseases (MND, CA and PD), to analyze correlation with level of free radical and the clinical variables like age, severity of diseases and duration of illness and any possibility from this clinical parameters to identify a biomarker for diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

29990963,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Mortality in the United States, 2011-2014.","BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10) did not include a code specific for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) until 2017. Instead, code G12.2 included both ALS and other motor neuron diseases (MND). Our objective was to determine US mortality rates for ALS exclusively by excluding other MND and progressive supranuclear palsy.
METHODS: All mortality data coded as G12.2 under the pre-2017 rubric were obtained for 2011-2014. Deaths without ALS listed in one of the un-coded cause-of-death fields were excluded. ALS death rates per 100,000 persons were age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population using the direct method.
RESULTS: The proportion of excluded records coded G12.2 but not ALS was 0.21, resulting in 24,328 ALS deaths. The overall age-adjusted mortality rate was 1.70 (95% CI 1.68-1.72). The rate among males was 2.09 (95% CI 2.05-2.12) and females was 1.37 (95% CI 1.35-1.40). The overall rate among whites was 1.84, blacks 1.03, and other races 0.70. For both sexes and all races, the rate increased with age and peaked among 75-79 year-olds. Rates tended to be greater in states at higher latitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous reports of ALS mortality in the United States showed similar age, sex, and race distributions but with greater age-adjusted mortality rates due to the inclusion of other diseases in the case definition. When using ICD-10 data collected prior to 2017, additional review of multiple-cause of death data is required for the accurate estimation of ALS deaths.","['Larson TC', 'Kaye W', 'Mehta P', 'Horton DK']",2018,51,1-2,Neuroepidemiology,"Larson TC, et al.

The accumulation of an RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, is the most significant pathological finding in approximately 95% of ALS cases and 50% of FTD cases, and discovery of this common pathological signature, together with an increasing understanding of the shared genetic basis of these disorders, has led to FTD and ALS being considered as part of a single disease continuum. Given the widespread aggregation and accumulation of TDP-43 in FTD-ALS spectrum disorder, TDP-43 may have potential as a biomarker in these diseases.
METHODS: We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic utility of TDP-43 detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with FTD-ALS spectrum disorder.
RESULTS: From seven studies, our results demonstrate that patients with ALS have a statistically significantly higher level of TDP-43 in CSF (effect size 0.64, 95% CI: 0.1-1.19, p = 0.02).

29953699,Tremor in motor neuron disease may be central rather than peripheral in origin.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motor neuron disease (MND) refers to a spectrum of degenerative diseases affecting motor neurons. Recent clinical and post-mortem observations have revealed considerable variability in the phenotype. Rhythmic involuntary oscillations of the hands during action, resembling tremor, can occur in MND, but their pathophysiology has not yet been investigated.
METHODS: A total of 120 consecutive patients with MND were screened for tremor. Twelve patients with action tremor and no other movement disorders were found. Ten took part in the study. Tremor was recorded bilaterally using surface electromyography (EMG) and triaxial accelerometer, with and without a variable weight load. Power spectra of rectified EMG and accelerometric signal were calculated. To investigate a possible cerebellar involvement, eyeblink classic conditioning was performed in five patients.
RESULTS: Action tremor was present in about 10% of our population. All patients showed distal postural tremor of low amplitude and constant frequency, bilateral with a small degree of asymmetry. Two also showed simple kinetic tremor. A peak at the EMG and accelerometric recordings ranging from 4 to 12 Hz was found in all patients. Loading did not change peak frequency in either the electromyographic or accelerometric power spectra. Compared with healthy volunteers, patients had a smaller number of conditioned responses during eyeblink classic conditioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with MND can present with action tremor of a central origin, possibly due to a cerebellar dysfunction. This evidence supports the novel idea of MND as a multisystem neurodegenerative disease and that action tremor can be part of this condition.","['Latorre A', 'Rocchi L', 'Stamelou M', 'Batla A', 'Ciocca M', 'Balint B', 'Sidle K', 'Berardelli A', 'Rothwell JC', 'Bhatia KP']",2019,26,3,Eur J Neurol,"Latorre A, et al.

29943193,Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of TDP-43 studied in real time: impaired microglia function leads to axonal spreading of TDP-43 in degenerating motor neurons.,"Transactivating DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) deposits represent a typical finding in almost all ALS patients, more than half of FTLD patients and patients with several other neurodegenerative disorders. It appears that perturbation of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport is an important event in these conditions but the mechanistic role and the fate of TDP-43 during neuronal degeneration remain elusive. We have developed an experimental system for visualising the perturbed nucleocytoplasmic transport of neuronal TDP-43 at the single-cell level in vivo using zebrafish spinal cord. This approach enabled us to image TDP-43-expressing motor neurons before and after experimental initiation of cell death. We report the formation of mobile TDP-43 deposits within degenerating motor neurons, which are normally phagocytosed by microglia. However, when microglial cells were depleted, injury-induced motor neuron degeneration follows a characteristic process that includes TDP-43 redistribution into the cytoplasm, axon and extracellular space. This is the first demonstration of perturbed TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic transport in vivo, and suggests that impairment in microglial phagocytosis of dying neurons may contribute towards the formation of pathological TDP-43 presentations in ALS and FTLD.","['Svahn AJ', 'Don EK', 'Badrock AP', 'Cole NJ', 'Graeber MB', 'Yerbury JJ', 'Chung R', 'Morsch M']",2018,136,3,Acta Neuropathol,"Svahn AJ, et al.

29941342,Initial Identification of a Blood-Based Chromosome Conformation Signature for Aiding in the Diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: The identification of blood-based biomarkers specific to the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an active field of academic and clinical research. While inheritance studies have advanced the field, a majority of patients do not have a known genetic link to the disease, making direct sequence-based genetic testing for ALS difficult. The ability to detect biofluid-based epigenetic changes in ALS would expand the relevance of using genomic information for disease diagnosis.
METHODS: Assessing differences in chromosomal conformations (i.e. how they are positioned in 3-dimensions) represents one approach for assessing epigenetic changes. In this study, we used an industrial platform, EpiSwitch™, to compare the genomic architecture of healthy and diseased patient samples (blood and tissue) to discover a chromosomal conformation signature (CCS) with diagnostic potential in ALS. A three-step biomarker selection process yielded a distinct CCS for ALS, comprised of conformation changes in eight genomic loci and detectable in blood.
FINDINGS: We applied the ALS CCS to determine a diagnosis for 74 unblinded patient samples and subsequently conducted a blinded diagnostic study of 16 samples. Sensitivity and specificity for ALS detection in the 74 unblinded patient samples were 83∙33% (CI 51∙59 to 97∙91%) and 76∙92% (46∙19 to 94∙96%), respectively. In the blinded cohort, sensitivity reached 87∙50% (CI 47∙35 to 99∙68%) and specificity was 75∙0% (34∙91 to 96∙81%).
INTERPRETATIONS: The sensitivity and specificity values achieved using the ALS CCS identified and validated in this study provide an indication that the detection of chromosome conformation signatures is a promising approach to disease diagnosis and can potentially augment current strategies for diagnosing ALS.

29934198,"Safety and efficacy of rasagiline as an add-on therapy to riluzole in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.","BACKGROUND: Rasagiline, a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor with neuroprotective potential in Parkinson's disease, has shown a disease-modifying effect in the SOD1-Gly93Ala low-expressing mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, both alone and in combination with riluzole. We sought to test whether or not rasagiline 1 mg/day can prolong survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also receiving riluzole.
METHODS: Patients with possible, probable, or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were enrolled to our randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, phase 2 trial from 15 German network for motor neuron diseases (MND-NET) centres (university hospitals or clinics). Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, had onset of progressive weakness within the 36 months before the study, had disease duration of more than 6 months and less than 3 years, and had a best-sitting slow vital capacity of at least 50%. After a 4-week screening period, eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either rasagiline (1 mg/day) or placebo in addition to riluzole (100 mg/day), after stratification for site of onset (bulbar or spinal) and study centre. Patients and all personnel assessing outcome parameters were masked to treatment allocation. Patients were followed up 2, 6, 12, and 18 months after randomisation. The primary endpoint was survival time, defined as the time to death or time to study cutoff date (ie, the last patient's last visit plus 14 days). Analyses of primary outcome and safety measures were done in all patients who received at least one dose of trial treatment (intention-to-treat population). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01879241.
FINDINGS: Between July 2, 2013, and Nov 11, 2014, 273 patients were screened for eligibility, and 252 patients were randomly assigned to receive rasagiline (n=127) or placebo (n=125). 126 patients taking rasagiline and 125 taking placebo were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. For the primary outcome, the survival probability at the end of the study was 0·43 (95% CI 0·25-0·59) in the rasagiline group (n=126) and 0·53 (0·43-0·62) in the placebo group (n=125). The estimated effect size (hazard ratio) was 0·91 (one-sided 97·5% CI -infinity to 1·34; p=0·31). Rasagiline was well tolerated, and most adverse events were due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease progression rather than treatment; the most frequent of these were dysphagia (32 [25%] taking rasagiline vs 24 [19%] taking placebo) and respiratory failure (25 [20%] vs 31 [25%]). Frequency of adverse events were comparable between both groups.
INTERPRETATION: Rasagiline was safe in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome of survival, although post-hoc analysis suggested that rasagiline might modify disease progression in patients with an initial slope of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised greater than 0·5 points per month at baseline. This should be confirmed in another clinical trial.

HIV-associated MND has only been identified in few cases to date. We analysed two Brazilian patients with HIV infection who developed MND. The diagnosis of HIV infection was concomitant with diagnosis of MND in one patient and it occurred eight years before the MND symptoms in another patient. The manifestation of MND in our patients with HIV infection was similar to classic ALS. The antiretroviral therapy improves their HIV infection. However, slow progression of MND occurred in the two patients despite their antiretroviral therapy or HIV viral load (undetectable). We revised the international literature (PubMed database) of the patients reported with MND and HIV infection.","['Lorenzoni PJ', 'Ducci RD', 'Dalledone GO', 'Kay CSK', 'de Almeida SM', 'Werneck LC', 'Scola RH']",2018,171,,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,"Lorenzoni PJ, et al.

29903695,Sharing and Empathy in Digital Spaces: Qualitative Study of Online Health Forums for Breast Cancer and Motor Neuron Disease (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).,"BACKGROUND: The availability of an increasing number of online health forums has altered the experience of living with a health condition, as more people are now able to connect and support one another. Empathy is an important component of peer-to-peer support, although little is known about how empathy develops and operates within online health forums.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to explore how empathy develops and operates within two online health forums for differing health conditions: breast cancer and motor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
METHODS: This qualitative study analyzed data from two sources: interviews with forum users and downloaded forum posts. Data were collected from two online health forums provided by UK charities: Breast Cancer Care and the Motor Neurone Disease Association. We analyzed 84 threads from the breast cancer forum and 52 from the MND forum. Threads were purposively sampled to reflect varied experiences (eg, illness stages, topics of conversation, and user characteristics). Semistructured interviews were conducted with 14 Breast Cancer Care forum users and five users of the MND forum. All datasets were analyzed thematically using Braun and Clarke's six-phase approach and combined to triangulate the analysis.
RESULTS: We found that empathy develops and operates through shared experiences and connections. The development of empathy begins outside the forum with experiences of illness onset and diagnosis, creating emotional and informational needs. Users came to the forum and found their experiences and needs were shared and understood by others, setting the empathetic tone and supportive ethos of the forum. The forum was viewed as both a useful and meaningful space in which they could share experiences, information, and emotions, and receive empathetic support within a supportive and warm atmosphere. Empathy operated through connections formed within this humane space based on similarity, relationships, and shared feelings. Users felt a need to connect to users who they felt were like themselves (eg, people sharing the same specific diagnosis). They formed relationships with other users. They connected based on the emotional understanding of ill health. Within these connections, empathic communication flourished.
CONCLUSIONS: Empathy develops and operates within shared experiences and connections, enabled by structural possibilities provided by the forums giving users the opportunity and means to interact within public, restricted, and more private spaces, as well as within groups and in one-to-one exchanges. The atmosphere and feeling of both sites and perceived audiences were important facilitators of empathy, with users sharing a perception of virtual communities of caring and supportive people. Our findings are of value to organizations hosting health forums and to health professionals signposting patients to additional sources of support.","['Hargreaves S', 'Bath PA', 'Duffin S', 'Ellis J']",2018,20,6,J Med Internet Res,"Hargreaves S, et al.

29886477,Distinct Clinical Features and Outcomes in Motor Neuron Disease Associated with Behavioural Variant Frontotemporal Dementia.,"AIM: To determine the motor phenotype and outcome in a clinically ascertained group of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
METHODS: This is an observational retrospective clinical study of patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for MND-FTD. A contemporary series of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without dementia were included for comparison. Demographic, clinical, genetic, and neuropathological data were collected. A descriptive and comparative data analysis was performed.
RESULTS: We identified 22 patients with MND-FTD. Selective distal upper limb muscle weakness and atrophy with non-significant lower limb weakness during follow-up was the most frequent motor pattern, present in 18 patients - in 15 of them associated with severe dysphagia. Aspiration pneumonia was the most common cause of death (12/19; 63%) despite gastrostomy. One-third of the patients did not develop upper motor neuron dysfunction. When compared to classic ALS without dementia (n = 162), these features were significantly different. A neuro-pathological examination was performed on 7 patients, and it confirmed the presence of MND with TDP43 protein aggregates in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The MND-FTD patients frequently displayed a distinctive motor pattern characterized by weakness and atrophy in distal upper limb muscles and dysphagia, with no or little spreading to other regions. These features may help to define specific subgroups of patients, which is important with regard to clinical management, outcome, and research.","['Cortés-Vicente E', 'Turon-Sans J', 'Gelpi E', 'Clarimón J', 'Borrego-Écija S', 'Dols-Icardo O', 'Illán-Gala I', 'Lleó A', 'Illa I', 'Blesa R', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Rojas-García R']",2018,45,3-4,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,"Cortés-Vicente E, et al.

METHODS: 158 patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and 86 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled in a prospective, two-center study with a common structural MRI protocol. Cortical thickness measures were extracted for the prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, motor cortex, and occipital cortex using FreeSurfer, adjusted for age and sex, and tested for normality of distribution.
RESULTS: Cortical thickness measures of the bilateral prefrontal, premotor, motor, and occipital cortex were normally distributed in patients and healthy controls. MND-related cortical thinning was observed in the right motor cortex (
CONCLUSION: The study shows that prefrontal cortical thickness in MND is normally distributed but shifted towards thinner cortex in MND patients with cognitive and/or behavioural impairment. The distribution of thickness values did not indicate the assumption of a bimodal distribution although patients with comorbid cognitive deficits are more likely to suffer from prefrontal cortical thinning.","['Machts J', 'Cardenas-Blanco A', 'Acosta-Cabronero J', 'Kaufmann J', 'Loewe K', 'Kasper E', 'Schuster C', 'Prudlo J', 'Vielhaber S', 'Nestor PJ']",2018,18,,Neuroimage Clin,"Machts J, et al.

29872871,The role of survival motor neuron protein (SMN) in protein homeostasis.,"Ever since loss of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein was identified as the direct cause of the childhood inherited neurodegenerative disorder spinal muscular atrophy, significant efforts have been made to reveal the molecular functions of this ubiquitously expressed protein. Resulting research demonstrated that SMN plays important roles in multiple fundamental cellular homeostatic pathways, including a well-characterised role in the assembly of the spliceosome and biogenesis of ribonucleoproteins. More recent studies have shown that SMN is also involved in other housekeeping processes, including mRNA trafficking and local translation, cytoskeletal dynamics, endocytosis and autophagy. Moreover, SMN has been shown to influence mitochondria and bioenergetic pathways as well as regulate function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this review, we summarise these diverse functions of SMN, confirming its key role in maintenance of the homeostatic environment of the cell.","['Chaytow H', 'Huang YT', 'Gillingwater TH', 'Faller KME']",2018,75,21,Cell Mol Life Sci,"Chaytow H, et al.

Neurological illness, loss and disruption.","The sense of freedom and independence that being able to drive generates may be taken for granted by many until it is threatened by illness. Drawing on the 'mobility turn' in social sciences that emphasises the social and emotional significance of the car (Sheller and Urry , ), this article presents secondary analysis of narratives of driving and its significance across four neurological conditions (epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, transient ischaemic attack and motor neurone disease). Taking an interactionist approach we explore how the withdrawal of a driving licence can represent not just a practical and emotional loss of independence, but also loss of enjoyment; of a sense and feeling of 'normal' adulthood and social participation; and of an identity (in some cases gendered) of strength and power. Conversely the ability to keep driving can maintain an unbroken thread of narrative, for example enabling people with speech difficulties to feel and look normal behind the wheel. Moments of pleasure and normality illuminate the importance of examining the micro-strands of disruption illness can cause.","['Stepney M', 'Kirkpatrick S', 'Locock L', 'Prinjha S', 'Ryan S']",2018,40,7,Sociol Health Illn,"Stepney M, et al.

29771729,Self-Regulation and Executive Functioning as Related to Survival in Motor Neuron Disease: Preliminary Findings.,"OBJECTIVE: Disease progression varies widely among patients with motor neuron disease (MND). Patients with MND and coexisting dementia have shorter survival. However, implications of mild cognitive and behavioral difficulties are unclear. The present study examined the relative contribution of executive functioning and self-regulation difficulties on survival over a 6-year period among patients with MND, who scored largely within normal limits on cognitive and behavioral indices.
METHODS: Patients with MND (N = 37, age = 59.97 ± 11.57, 46% female) completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task as an executive functioning perseveration index. The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF-A) was used as a behavioral measure of self-regulation in two subdomains self-regulatory behavior (Behavioral Regulation) and self-regulatory problem-solving (Metacognition). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used.
RESULTS: In total, 23 patients died during follow-up. In Cox proportional hazard regressions adjusted for a priori covariates, each 10-point t-score increment in patient-reported BRIEF-A self-regulatory behavior and problem-solving difficulties increased mortality risk by 94% and 103%, respectively (adjusted HR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.07-3.52; adjusted HR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.19-3.48). In sensitivity analyses, patient-reported self-regulatory problem-solving remained significant independent of disease severity and a priori covariates (adjusted HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.01-2.78), though the predictive value of self-regulatory behavior was attenuated in adjusted models (HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.85-3.27). Caregiver-reported BRIEF-A ratings of patients and Wisconsin Card Sorting Task perseverative errors did not significantly predict survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests patient-reported self-regulatory problem-solving difficulties indicate poorer prognosis in MND. Further research is needed to uncover mechanisms that negatively impact patient survival.","['Garcia-Willingham NE', 'Roach AR', 'Kasarskis EJ', 'Segerstrom SC']",2018,80,7,Psychosom Med,"Garcia-Willingham NE, et al.

29750730,The changing landscape of motor neuron disease imaging: the transition from descriptive studies to precision clinical tools.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuroimaging in motor neuron disease (MND) has traditionally been seen as an academic tool with limited direct relevance to individualized patient care. This has changed radically in recent years as computational imaging has emerged as a viable clinical tool with true biomarker potential. This transition is not only fuelled by technological advances but also by important conceptual developments.
RECENT FINDINGS: The natural history of MND is now evaluated by presymptomatic, postmortem and multi-timepoint longitudinal imaging studies. The anatomical spectrum of MND imaging has also been expanded from an overwhelmingly cerebral focus to innovative spinal and muscle applications. In contrast to the group-comparisons of previous studies, machine-learning and deep-learning approaches are increasingly utilized to model real-life diagnostic dilemmas and aid prognostic classification. The focus from evaluating focal structural changes has shifted to the appraisal of network integrity by connectivity-based approaches. The armamentarium of MND imaging has also been complemented by novel PET-ligands, spinal toolboxes and the availability of magnetoencephalography and high-field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging platforms.
SUMMARY: In addition to the technological and conceptual advances, collaborative multicentre research efforts have also gained considerable momentum. This opinion-piece reviews emerging trends in MND imaging and their implications to clinical care and drug development.","['Bede P', 'Querin G', 'Pradat PF']",2018,31,4,Curr Opin Neurol,"Bede P, et al.

29725842,Motor neuron disease of paraneoplastic origin: a rare but treatable condition.,"Paraneoplastic motor neuron disorders (MND) are rare conditions; their exact clinical and electrophysiological phenotype have not been exhaustively described yet. The purpose of this study is to depict the main characteristics of paraneoplastic MND to highlight the features that may allow its diagnosis. Based on the description of eight original cases, and on the revision of 21 patients identified from a systematic review of the literature, the main features of paraneoplastic MND can be summarized as follows: (1) subacute; (2) lower motor neuron syndrome, associated or not with upper motor neuron involvement; (3) predominant asymmetric upper limb involvement; (4) presence of other non-motor neurological manifestations, including sensory neuronopathy; (5) signs of inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); (6) neurological improvement or stabilization after immunotherapy and tumor treatment. The diagnosis of paraneoplastic MND may be difficult because of its rarity, the absence of pathognomonic clinical features, and the frequent absence of prior tumor history. However, it is of capital importance to correctly identify patients with paraneoplastic MND, as this represents a potentially treatable condition. In the presence of subacute lower motor neuron impairment, especially when atypical clinical features for degenerative MND or other non-motor neurological manifestations are present, we recommend testing for onconeural antibodies. In the case, the search for onconeural antibodies is negative, but it exists a strong clinical suspicion for a paraneoplastic etiology; CSF analysis and total-body 18FDG-PET/CT imaging should be performed to circumstantiate diagnosis.","['Mélé N', 'Berzero G', 'Maisonobe T', 'Salachas F', 'Nicolas G', 'Weiss N', 'Beaudonnet G', 'Ducray F', 'Psimaras D', 'Lenglet T']",2018,265,7,J Neurol,"Mélé N, et al.

BMAA has been found to be produced by a range of cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates worldwide, and is present in freshwater, saltwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. Surface scum samples were collected from waterways in rural and urban New South Wales, Australia and algal species identified. Reverse phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyse sixteen cyanobacterial scum for the presence of BMAA as well as its toxic structural isomer 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB). BMAA was detected in ten of the samples analysed, and 2,4-DAB in all sixteen.

29715546,TDP-43 interacts with mitochondrial proteins critical for mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics.,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) functions as a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein and is the major pathological protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND). TDP-43 pathology may also be present as a comorbidity in approximately 20-50% of sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases. In a mouse model of MND, full-length TDP-43 increases association with the mitochondria and blocking the TDP-43/mitochondria interaction ameliorates motor dysfunction. Utilizing a proteomics screen, several mitochondrial TDP-43-interacting partners were identified, including voltage-gated anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a crucial mitophagy receptor. Overexpression of TDP-43 led to an increase in PHB2 whereas TDP-43 knockdown reduced PHB2 expression in cells treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an inducer of mitophagy. These results suggest that TDP-43 expression contributes to metabolism and mitochondrial function however we show no change in bioenergetics when TDP-43 is overexpressed and knocked down in HEK293T cells. Furthermore, the fusion protein mitofusin 2 (MFN2) interacts in complex with TDP-43 and selective expression of human TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex induced an age-dependent change in Mfn2 expression. Mitochondria morphology is altered in 9-month-old mice selectively expressing TDP-43 in an APP/PS1 background compared with APP/PS1 littermates. We further confirmed TDP-43 localization to the mitochondria using immunogold labeled TDP-43 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and mitochondrial isolation methods There was no increase in full-length TDP-43 localized to the mitochondria in APP/PS1 mice compared to wild-type (littermates); however, using C- and N-terminal-specific TDP-43 antibodies, the N-terminal (27 kDa, N27) and C-terminal (30 kDa, C30) fragments of TDP-43 are greatly enriched in mitochondrial fractions. In addition, when the mitochondrial peptidase (PMPCA) is overexpressed there is an increase in the N-terminal fragment (N27). These results suggest that TDP-43 processing may contribute to metabolism and mitochondrial function.","['Davis SA', 'Itaman S', 'Khalid-Janney CM', 'Sherard JA', 'Dowell JA', 'Cairns NJ', 'Gitcho MA']",2018,678,,Neurosci Lett,"Davis SA, et al.

29692728,Purinergic Receptors in Neurological Diseases With Motor Symptoms: Targets for Therapy.,"Since proving adenosine triphosphate (ATP) functions as a neurotransmitter in neuron/glia interactions, the purinergic system has been more intensely studied within the scope of the central nervous system. In neurological disorders with associated motor symptoms, including Parkinson's disease (PD), motor neuron diseases (MND), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's Disease (HD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), and ataxias, alterations in purinergic receptor expression and activity have been noted, indicating a potential role for this system in disease etiology and progression. In neurodegenerative conditions, neural cell death provokes extensive ATP release and alters calcium signaling through purinergic receptor modulation. Consequently, neuroinflammatory responses, excitotoxicity and apoptosis are directly or indirectly induced. This review analyzes currently available data, which suggests involvement of the purinergic system in neuro-associated motor dysfunctions and underlying mechanisms. Possible targets for pharmacological interventions are also discussed.","['Oliveira-Giacomelli Á', 'Naaldijk Y', 'Sardá-Arroyo L', 'Gonçalves MCB', 'Corrêa-Velloso J', 'Pillat MM', 'de Souza HDN', 'Ulrich H']",2018,9,,Front Pharmacol,"Oliveira-Giacomelli Á, et al.

29653550,Mecasin treatment in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes paralysis of limb, swallowing, and breathing muscles. Riluzole, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for ALS, provides minimal benefit, prolonging patient life by only 2-3 months. Previous studies have found a neuro-protective and anti-neuroinflammatory effect of Mecasin, with retrospective studies providing suggestive evidence for a beneficial effect of Mecasin. The aim of this study was to develop a protocol to determine the proper dosage of Mecasin.
METHODS: This is a phase II-A, multi-center, randomized study with three arms. Thirty-six patients with ALS will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, each receiving the standard treatment with 100 mg of riluzole in addition to one of 1.6 g of Mecasin, 2.4 g of Mecasin, or a placebo. The Primary outcome is the Korean version of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised result after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes include results of the Short Form Health Survey-8, Medical Research Council Scale, Visual Analogue Scale for Pain, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Fatigue Severity Scale, Patient Global Impression of Change, pulmonary function test, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and its ratio to forced vital capacity, creatine kinase, and body weight. The frequencies of total adverse events and serious adverse events will be described and documented. The trial protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Wonkwang University Gwangju and Sanbon Hospital (2016-5-4 and 2016-34-01, respectively). An Investigational New Drug status (30731) was granted by the Korea Food and Drug Administration.
DISCUSSION: This trial will aim to identify the optimal dosage of Mecasin. Additionally, it will test the efficacy and safety of Mecasin in conjunction with standard treatment, riluzole, for alleviating the functional decline in patients with ALS.

29652734,Being Yourself and Thinking About the Future in People With Motor Neuron Disease: A Grounded Theory of Self-care Processes.,"INTRODUCTION: Self-care is a crucial aspect in the management of people with motor neuron disease (MND). Nurses and healthcare professionals must know the processes used by patients in performing self-care to identify problems and help them. Decision-making processes, self-understanding, and political and social support influence the self-care process in chronic diseases. Little is known about the self-care process in MND.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to gain insight on the self-care processes in people with MND.
METHOD: A grounded theory method was chosen for this study. Data from interviews were gathered, and a simultaneous comparative analysis was conducted to identify categories and codes.
RESULTS: Twenty-one people with spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis participated in the study. Five categories were identified as grounded in the data. The process starts from ""being yourself in the care,"" and it develops thanks to ""growing and changing"" and with a ""thinking about the future"" approach. ""Family role"" and ""you and who helps you"" categories affect the process itself.
CONCLUSION: The self-care process in people with MND is not seen in a daily perspective but changes with the evolution of the disease. For the growing patients with MND, changing, accepting and controlling the disease while deciding autonomously are the foundations of the process.","['Bassola B', 'Sansone VA', 'Lusignani M']",2018,50,3,J Neurosci Nurs,"Bassola B, et al.

29650794,Comprehensive analysis of the mutation spectrum in 301 German ALS families.,"OBJECTIVES: Recent advances in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) genetics have revealed that mutations in any of more than 25 genes can cause ALS, mostly as an autosomal-dominant Mendelian trait. Detailed knowledge about the genetic architecture of ALS in a specific population will be important for genetic counselling but also for genotype-specific therapeutic interventions.
METHODS: Here we combined fragment length analysis, repeat-primed PCR, Southern blotting, Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing to obtain a comprehensive profile of genetic variants in ALS disease genes in 301 German pedigrees with familial ALS. We report 
RESULTS: 49% of our German ALS families carried a likely pathogenic variant in at least one of the earlier identified ALS genes. In 45% of the ALS families, likely pathogenic variants were detected in 
CONCLUSIONS: We here present a comprehensive genetic characterisation of German familial ALS.

29649521,Modelling motor neuron disease in fruit flies: Lessons from spinal muscular atrophy.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is characterised by muscle weakness and paralysis downstream of motor neuron degeneration. Genetic factors play a major role in disease pathogenesis and progression. This is best underscored by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most common MND affecting children. Although SMA is caused by homozygous mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, partial compensation by the paralogous SMN2 gene and/or genetic modifiers influence age of onset and disease severity. SMA is also the first MND that is treatable thanks to the recent development of a molecular-based therapy. This key milestone was possible following an intense research campaign in which animal models had a starring role. In this review, we specifically focus on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and highlight its sterling contributions aimed at furthering our understanding of SMA pathogenesis. Methods of gene disruption utilised to generate SMA fly models are discussed and ways through which neuromuscular defects have been characterised are elaborated on. A phenotypic overlap with patients and mammalian models, allowed the use of SMA fly models to identify genetic modifiers, hence spurring investigators to discover pathways that are perturbed in disease. Targeting these can potentially lead to complimentary therapies for SMA. The same output is expected from the use of SMA fly models to identify therapeutic compounds that have an ameliorative effect. We believe that lessons gained from SMA will allow researchers to eagerly exploit Drosophila to confirm novel genes linked to MND, reveal disease mechanisms and ultimately identify therapeutics.","['Aquilina B', 'Cauchi RJ']",2018,310,,J Neurosci Methods,Aquilina B and Cauchi RJ.

29602909,Age-dependent sex ratios of motor neuron disease: French nationwide study and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation of age with male-to-female (M/F) ratios and incidence rates of motor neuron disease (MND) in a French nationwide study and meta-analysis of incidence studies.
METHODS: We used data from the French National Health Insurance databases. Patients with incident MND (2010-2014) were identified based on drug claims (riluzole), hospitalization records, death records, and long-term chronic disease benefits. We estimated age-specific M/F incidence ratios using Poisson regression. Poisson, Gompertz, and multistep models were used to model the relation between age and incidence. We performed a meta-analysis (n = 28 studies) and used meta-regression to examine the relation of age with incidence rates and ratios.
RESULTS: In France, we identified 10,848 patients with incident MND (6,021 men, 4,827 women). Incidence was higher in men than in women in all age groups. M/F ratios were significantly different across age groups and followed a quadratic trend (
CONCLUSION: The relation between age and M/F incidence ratios of MND follows a quadratic U-shaped pattern with an abrupt drop after the fifth decade. The change in M/F ratios before and after menopause suggests that reproductive/hormonal protective factors have a role in women and should prompt further studies to explore this hypothesis.","['Ahmadzai P', 'Kab S', 'Vlaar T', 'Artaud F', 'Carcaillon-Bentata L', 'Canonico M', 'Moisan F', 'Elbaz A']",2018,90,18,Neurology,"Ahmadzai P, et al.

29571877,'The shock of diagnosis': Qualitative accounts from people with Motor Neurone Disease reflecting the need for more person-centred care.,"The diagnosis of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is devastating for people with MND (PwMND) and their families. The objective of this study is to describe the experiences of PwMND in receiving the diagnosis in order to inform a more person-centred approach to communicating such bad news. The design was an anonymous postal survey facilitated by all MND associations across Australia (2014-15). Survey questions centred on the SPIKES protocol for communicating bad news; each question contained an area for written responses, which were thematically analysed for content. Two hundred and forty-eight responses were received from people with MND (29% response rate). Four themes emerged: challenges in being diagnosed with MND; the emotions experienced; the good and the bad; and links to further information and support. Receiving such a diagnosis requires preparation, forethought, sensitive and individualised care on the part of the neurologist, including where and how the diagnosis is given; the supports required; and timing, amounts and sources of giving information. The emotional reactions of the neurologist also caused a lasting impression on those receiving the diagnosis. This study could form the basis for best practice programs implementing a more person-centred approach to caring for PwMND right from the diagnosis stage. The focus needs to shift on the person's values, preferences, psychosocial and existential concerns in the context of the underlying disease experience and the manner clinical practice is delivered.","['Aoun SM', ""O'Brien MR"", 'Breen LJ', ""O'Connor M""]",2018,387,,J Neurol Sci,"Aoun SM, et al.

We carried out a genome-wide association study comparing 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Independently, we performed a rare variant burden analysis comparing 1,138 index familial ALS cases and 19,494 controls. Through both approaches, we identified kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) as a novel gene associated with ALS. Interestingly, mutations predominantly in the N-terminal motor domain of KIF5A are causative for two neurodegenerative diseases: hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (CMT2). In contrast, ALS-associated mutations are primarily located at the C-terminal cargo-binding tail domain and patients harboring loss-of-function mutations displayed an extended survival relative to typical ALS cases. Taken together, these results broaden the phenotype spectrum resulting from mutations in KIF5A and strengthen the role of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of ALS.","['Nicolas A', 'Kenna KP', 'Renton AE', 'Ticozzi N', 'Faghri F', 'Chia R', 'Dominov JA', 'Kenna BJ', 'Nalls MA', 'Keagle P', 'Rivera AM', 'van Rheenen W', 'Murphy NA', 'van Vugt JJFA', 'Geiger JT', 'Van der Spek RA', 'Pliner HA', 'Shankaracharya', 'Smith BN', 'Marangi G', 'Topp SD', 'Abramzon Y', 'Gkazi AS', 'Eicher JD', 'Kenna A', 'ITALSGEN Consortium', 'Mora G', 'Calvo A', 'Mazzini L', 'Riva N', 'Mandrioli J', 'Caponnetto C', 'Battistini S', 'Volanti P', 'La Bella V', 'Conforti FL', 'Borghero G', 'Messina S', 'Simone IL', 'Trojsi F', 'Salvi F', 'Logullo FO', ""D'Alfonso S"", 'Corrado L', 'Capasso M', 'Ferrucci L', 'Genomic Translation for ALS Care (GTAC) Consortium', 'Moreno CAM', 'Kamalakaran S', 'Goldstein DB', 'ALS Sequencing Consortium', 'Gitler AD', 'Harris T', 'Myers RM', 'NYGC ALS Consortium', 'Phatnani H', 'Musunuri RL', 'Evani US', 'Abhyankar A', 'Zody MC', 'Answer ALS Foundation', 'Kaye J', 'Finkbeiner S', 'Wyman SK', 'LeNail A', 'Lima L', 'Fraenkel E', 'Svendsen CN', 'Thompson LM', 'Van Eyk JE', 'Berry JD', 'Miller TM', 'Kolb SJ', 'Cudkowicz M', 'Baxi E', 'Clinical Research in ALS and Related Disorders for Therapeutic Development (CReATe) Consortium', 'Benatar M', 'Taylor JP', 'Rampersaud E', 'Wu G', 'Wuu J', 'SLAGEN Consortium', 'Lauria G', 'Verde F', 'Fogh I', 'Tiloca C', 'Comi GP', 'Sorarù G', 'Cereda C', 'French ALS Consortium', 'Corcia P', 'Laaksovirta H', 'Myllykangas L', 'Jansson L', 'Valori M', 'Ealing J', 'Hamdalla H', 'Rollinson S', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Orrell RW', 'Sidle KC', 'Malaspina A', 'Hardy J', 'Singleton AB', 'Johnson JO', 'Arepalli S', 'Sapp PC', 'McKenna-Yasek D', 'Polak M', 'Asress S', 'Al-Sarraj S', 'King A', 'Troakes C', 'Vance C', 'de Belleroche J', 'Baas F', 'Ten Asbroek ALMA', 'Muñoz-Blanco JL', 'Hernandez DG', 'Ding J', 'Gibbs JR', 'Scholz SW', 'Floeter MK', 'Campbell RH', 'Landi F', 'Bowser R', 'Pulst SM', 'Ravits JM', 'MacGowan DJL', 'Kirby J', 'Pioro EP', 'Pamphlett R', 'Broach J', 'Gerhard G', 'Dunckley TL', 'Brady CB', 'Kowall NW', 'Troncoso JC', 'Le Ber I', 'Mouzat K', 'Lumbroso S', 'Heiman-Patterson TD', 'Kamel F', 'Van Den Bosch L', 'Baloh RH', 'Strom TM', 'Meitinger T', 'Shatunov A', 'Van Eijk KR', 'de Carvalho M', 'Kooyman M', 'Middelkoop B', 'Moisse M', 'McLaughlin RL', 'Van Es MA', 'Weber M', 'Boylan KB', 'Van Blitterswijk M', 'Rademakers R', 'Morrison KE', 'Basak AN', 'Mora JS', 'Drory VE', 'Shaw PJ', 'Turner MR', 'Talbot K', 'Hardiman O', 'Williams KL', 'Fifita JA', 'Nicholson GA', 'Blair IP', 'Rouleau GA', 'Esteban-Pérez J', 'García-Redondo A', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Project MinE ALS Sequencing Consortium', 'Rogaeva E', 'Zinman L', 'Ostrow LW', 'Maragakis NJ', 'Rothstein JD', 'Simmons Z', 'Cooper-Knock J', 'Brice A', 'Goutman SA', 'Feldman EL', 'Gibson SB', 'Taroni F', 'Ratti A', 'Gellera C', 'Van Damme P', 'Robberecht W', 'Fratta P', 'Sabatelli M', 'Lunetta C', 'Ludolph AC', 'Andersen PM', 'Weishaupt JH', 'Camu W', 'Trojanowski JQ', 'Van Deerlin VM', 'Brown RH', 'van den Berg LH', 'Veldink JH', 'Harms MB', 'Glass JD', 'Stone DJ', 'Tienari P', 'Silani V', 'Chiò A', 'Shaw CE', 'Traynor BJ', 'Landers JE']",2018,97,6,Neuron,"Nicolas A, et al.

Among the various types of iPSCs, urine-derived iPSCs have become a promising source of stem cells because they can be safely and noninvasively isolated and easily reprogrammed. Here, for the first time, we differentiated urine-derived iPSCs (urine-iPSCs) into motor neurons (MNs) and compared the capacity of urine-iPSCs and cord-blood-derived iPSCs (B-iPSCs) to differentiate into MNs. With the use of small molecules, mature MNs were generated from urine-iPSCs as early as 26 days in culture. Furthermore, in coculture with muscle cells, MNs projected long axons and formed neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Immunofluorescence and PCR confirmed the expression levels of both MN and NMJ markers. The comparison of the ratios of positive labeling for MN markers between urine-iPSCs and B-iPSCs demonstrated that the differentiation potentials of these cells were not significantly different. The abovementioned results indicate that urine-iPSCs are a new, promising source of stem cells for MND modeling and further cellular therapeutic development.","['Yi H', 'Xie B', 'Liu B', 'Wang X', 'Xu L', 'Liu J', 'Li M', 'Zhong X', 'Peng F']",2018,2018,,Stem Cells Int,"Yi H, et al.

29518277,The meaning of living with uncertainty for people with motor neurone disease.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the meaning of living with uncertainty for people diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND).
BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition resulting in multiple needs, arising from the complex nature of the disease trajectory. People with MND are often required to make decisions for symptom management and end-of-life care. Research into the lived experience of MND has previously highlighted the following: the shock of receiving such a diagnosis and prognosis; subsequent concerns relating to the future and loss; and the existential suffering for a person with MND. The lived experiences of MND accentuate the devastating nature of the disease, and this can impact upon how people respond to care.
DESIGN: Hermeneutic (interpretive) phenomenology: suitable for studying lifeworld experiences.
METHOD: Life story interviews were conducted with four participants and subjected to interpretive analysis.
RESULTS: Three phases of the MND illness trajectory emerged: ""body failing prematurely and searching for answers,"" ""body deterioration and responses to care"" and ""body nearing its end and needing to talk."" These phases highlight the phenomenon under study, all relating to uncertainty for people living with MND.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that people with MND are living with uncertainty and other concerns throughout their illness trajectory. People are having to turn to palliative care professionals who are more able to meet their concerns than those caring for other aspects of their disease.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Motor neurone disease is a complex disease, and it is important that professionals continue to provide holistic care throughout the illness trajectory. The identification of three distinct phases of the MND illness trajectory will help nurses and other professionals to better understand the meaning of uncertainty and other concerns for people with MND.","['Harris DA', 'Jack K', 'Wibberley C']",2018,27,9-10,J Clin Nurs,"Harris DA, et al.

29514947,Clinical value of neurofilament and phospho-tau/tau ratio in the frontotemporal dementia spectrum.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical value of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and the phospho-tau/total tau ratio (p/t-tau) across the entire frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum in a large, well-defined cohort.
METHODS: CSF NfL and p/t-tau levels were studied in 361 patients with FTD: 179 behavioral variant FTD, 17 FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), 36 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA), 19 nonfluent variant PPA, 4 logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA), 42 corticobasal syndrome, and 64 progressive supranuclear palsy. Forty-five cognitively healthy controls were also included. Definite pathology was known in 68 patients (49 frontotemporal lobar degeneration [FTLD]-TDP, 18 FTLD-tau, 1 FTLD-FUS).
RESULTS: NfL was higher in all diagnoses, except lvPPA (n = 4), than in controls, equally elevated in behavioral variant FTD, semantic variant PPA, nonfluent variant PPA, and corticobasal syndrome, and highest in FTD-MND. The p/t-tau was lower in all clinical groups, except lvPPA, than in controls and lowest in FTD-MND. NfL did not discriminate between TDP and tau pathology, while the p/t-tau ratio had a good specificity (76%) and moderate sensitivity (67%). Both high NfL and low p/t-tau were associated with poor survival (hazard ratio on tertiles 1.7 for NfL, 0.7 for p/t-tau).
CONCLUSION: NfL and p/t-tau similarly discriminated FTD from controls, but not between clinical subtypes, apart from FTD-MND. Both markers predicted survival and are promising monitoring biomarkers for clinical trials. Of note, p/t-tau, but not NfL, was specific to discriminate TDP from tau pathology in vivo.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with cognitive issues, CSF NfL and p/t-tau levels discriminate between those with and without FTD spectrum disorders.","['Meeter LHH', 'Vijverberg EG', 'Del Campo M', 'Rozemuller AJM', 'Donker Kaat L', 'de Jong FJ', 'van der Flier WM', 'Teunissen CE', 'van Swieten JC', 'Pijnenburg YAL']",2018,90,14,Neurology,"Meeter LHH, et al.

The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised/BR (ALSFRS-R/BR) was applied, and only the bulbar parameter, which includes speech, salivation and swallowing, was analyzed, with scores raging from 0 (disability) to 12 (normal functionality). Swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed using the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) described by Rosenbek et al. (1996). The Pearson correlation test was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: According to food consistency, the PAS level ranged from 1 to 5 for puree consistency, 1 to 4 for thickened liquid, and 1 to 3 for liquid, and no laryngotracheal aspiration was observed. Negative correlation between bulbar functionality and laryngeal penetration was observed for all food consistencies (pasty: r=-0.487, p=0.041; thickened liquid: r=-0.442, p=0.076; liquid r=0.460, p=0.073), but statistically significant difference was found only for the puree consistency, that is, individuals with poor bulbar functionality presented higher levels of laryngeal penetration.
CONCLUSION: Negative correlation was observed between bulbar functionality and laryngeal penetration in MND. The bulbar parameters of the ALSFRS-R/BR are significant for predicting risk of laryngotracheal aspiration for pasty consistency in MND.","['Brandão BC', 'Galdino AS', 'Lourenção LG', 'Trindade GS', 'Silva MAOMD', 'Silva RGD']",2018,30,1,Codas,"Brandão BC, et al.

29493298,Phenotypic and genotypic studies of ALS cases in ALS-SMA families.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are the most frequent motor neuron disorders in adulthood and infancy, respectively. There is a growing literature supporting common pathophysiological patterns between those disorders. One important clinical issue for that is the co-occurrence of both diseases within a family.
OBJECTIVES: To collect families in which ALS and SMA patients co-exist and describe the phenotype and the genotype of ALS patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine families with co-occurrence of SMA and ALS have been gathered over the last 15 years. Epidemiological, phenotype and genetic status were collected.
RESULTS: Out of the nine families, six corresponded to the criteria of familial ALS (FALS). Clinical data were available for 11 patients out of the 15 ALS cases. Mean age of onset was 58.5 years, site of onset was lower limbs in nine cases (81.8%), median duration was 22 months. Four ALS patients carried a mutation: three mutations in SOD1 gene (G147N in two cases and one with E121G) and one repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene. Three patients had abnormal SMN1 copy numbers.
CONCLUSIONS: While the high proportion of familial history of ALS cases in these ALS-SMA pedigrees could have suggested that these familial clusters of the two most frequent MND rely on a genetic background, we failed to exclude that this occurred by chance.","['Corcia P', ""Vourc'h P"", 'Blasco H', 'Couratier P', 'Dangoumau A', 'Bellance R', 'Desnuelle C', 'Viader F', 'Pautot V', 'Millecamps S', 'Bakkouche S', 'Salachas F', 'Andres CR', 'Meininger V', 'Camu W']",2018,19,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Corcia P, et al.

This study aimed to identify predictors of activity and participation in people with motor neurone disease (MND), people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and people with Parkinson's Disease (PD).
METHODS: The Oxford Participation and Activities Questionnaire (Ox-PAQ) and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Survey (MOS SF-36) were administered by postal survey to 386 people with a confirmed diagnosis of MND, MS or PD. Data analyses focused on stepwise regression analyses in order to identify predictors of activity and participation in the three conditions assessed.
RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty four participants completed the survey, a response rate of 86.5%. Regression analyses identified multiple predictors of activity and participation dependent on Ox-PAQ domain and disease group, the most prominent being social and physical functioning as measured by the MOS SF-36.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the physical and social consequences of neurological illness are of greatest relevance to people experiencing the conditions assessed. Whilst the largely inevitable physical implications of disease take hold, emphasis should be placed on the avoidance of social withdrawal and isolation, and the maintenance of social engagement should become a significant priority.","['Morley D', 'Dummett S', 'Kelly L', 'Fitzpatrick R', 'Jenkinson C']",2018,18,1,BMC Neurol,"Morley D, et al.

29451026,The TiM system: developing a novel telehealth service to improve access to specialist care in motor neurone disease using user-centered design.,"OBJECTIVES: Attendance at a specialist multidisciplinary motor neurone disease (MND) clinic is associated with improved survival and may also improve quality of life and reduce hospital admissions. However, patients struggle to travel to clinic and may experience difficulties between clinic visits that may not be addressed in a timely manner. We wanted to explore how we could improve access to specialist MND care.
METHODS: We adopted an iterative, user-centered co-design approach, collaborating with those with experience of providing and receiving MND care including patients, carers, clinicians, and technology developers. We explored the unmet needs of those living with MND, how they might be met through service redesign and through the use of digital technologies. We developed a new digital solution and performed initial testing with potential users including clinicians, patients, and carers.
RESULTS: We used these findings to develop a telehealth system (TiM) using an Android app into which patients and carers answer a series of questions about their condition on a weekly basis. The questions aim to capture all the physical, emotional, and social difficulties associated with MND. This information is immediately uploaded to the internet for review by the MND team. The data undergoes analysis in order to alert clinicians to any changes in a patient or carer's condition.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the benefits of developing a novel digitally enabled service underpinned by participatory design. Future trials must evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the TiM system within a clinical environment.","['Hobson EV', 'Baird WO', 'Partridge R', 'Cooper CL', 'Mawson S', 'Quinn A', 'Shaw PJ', 'Walsh T', 'Wolstenholme D', 'Mcdermott CJ']",2018,19,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Hobson EV, et al.

29445532,Sleep disordered breathing in motor neurone disease.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disease defined by axonal loss and gliosis of upper and lower motor neurones in the motor cortex, lower brainstem nuclei and ventral horn of the spinal cord. MND is currently incurable and has a poor prognosis, with death typically occurring 3 to 5 years after disease onset. The disease is characterised by rapidly progressive weakness leading to paralysis, fasciculations, bulbar symptoms (including dysarthria and dysphagia) and respiratory compromise. Respiratory complications arise as a result of weakness of upper airway (pharyngeal and laryngeal) muscles and respiratory muscles (diaphragm, intercostal and accessory muscles) leading to respiratory failure. Due to early involvement of respiratory muscles in MND, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) occurs at a higher frequency than compared to the general population. SDB usually precedes daytime respiratory symptoms and chronic respiratory failure. It significantly impacts upon patients' quality of life and survival and its presence may predict prognosis. Managing SDB in MND with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) improves quality of life and survival. Early identification and management of SDB in MND patients is therefore crucial. This update will review assessments of respiratory muscle function, types of SDB and the effects of NIV in patients with MND.","[""D'Cruz RF"", 'Murphy PB', 'Kaltsakas G']",2018,10,Suppl 1,J Thorac Dis,"D'Cruz RF, et al.

29409023,ERp57 is protective against mutant SOD1-induced cellular pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder and mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) account for 20% of familial ALS cases. The aetiology of ALS remains unclear, but protein misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neuronal apoptosis are implicated. We previously established that protein disulphide isomerase (PDIA1) is protective against ER stress and apoptosis in neuronal cells expressing mutant SOD1, and recently mutations in PDIA1 and related PDI family member endoplasmic reticulum protein 57 (ERp57/PDIA3), were associated with ALS. Here, we examined whether ERp57 is also protective against mutant SOD1 or whether distinct specificity exists amongst individual PDI family members. Neuronal cells co-expressing SOD1 and ERp57 were examined for inclusion formation, ER stress, ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction and apoptosis. Over-expression of ERp57 inhibited inclusion formation, ER stress, UPS dysfunction and apoptosis, whereas silencing of ERp57 expression enhanced mutant SOD1 inclusion formation, ER stress and toxicity, indicating a protective role for ERp57 against SOD1 misfolding. ERp57 also inhibited the formation of mutant SOD1 inclusions and apoptosis in primary cortical neurons, thus confirming results obtained from cell lines. ERp57 partially co-localized with TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43)-positive inclusions in spinal cords from sporadic ALS patients, thus linking ERp57 to protein misfolding in human sporadic disease. Our results therefore imply that ERp57 has a protective role against pathological events induced by mutant SOD1 and they link ERp57 to the misfolding of TDP-43. This study therefore has implications for the design of novel therapeutics based on the activities of the PDI family of proteins.","['Parakh S', 'Jagaraj CJ', 'Vidal M', 'Ragagnin AMG', 'Perri ER', 'Konopka A', 'Toth RP', 'Galper J', 'Blair IP', 'Thomas CJ', 'Walker AK', 'Yang S', 'Spencer DM', 'Atkin JD']",2018,27,8,Hum Mol Genet,"Parakh S, et al.

29382218,Motor neuron disease mortality rates in New Zealand 1992-2013.,"BACKGROUND: We determined the mortality rates of motor neuron disease (MND) in New Zealand over 22 years from 1992 to 2013. Previous studies have found an unusually high and/or increasing incidence of MND in certain regions of New Zealand; however, no studies have examined MND rates nationwide to corroborate this.
METHODS: Death certificate data coded G12.2 by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 coding, or 335.2 by ICD-9 coding were obtained. These codes specify amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy, or other motor neuron diseases as the underlying cause of death. Mortality rates for MND deaths in New Zealand were age-standardized to the European Standard Population and compared with rates from international studies that also examined death certificate data and were age-standardized to the same standard population.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The age-standardized mortality from MND in New Zealand was 2.3 per 100,000 per year from 1992-2007 and 2.8 per 100,000 per year from 2008-2013. These rates were 3.3 and 4.0 per 100,000 per year, respectively, for the population 20 years and older. The increase in rate between these two time periods was likely due to changes in MND death coding from 2008. Contrary to a previous regional study of MND incidence, nationwide mortality rates did not increase steadily over this time period once aging was accounted for. However, New Zealand MND mortality rate was higher than comparable studies we examined internationally (mean 1.67 per 100,000 per year), suggesting that further analysis of MND burden in New Zealand is warranted.","['Cao MC', 'Chancellor A', 'Charleston A', 'Dragunow M', 'Scotter EL']",2018,19,3-4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Cao MC, et al.

Identifying specific disease biomarkers would help to not only improve diagnostic delay but also to classify disease subtypes, monitor response to therapeutic drugs and track disease progression. miRNAs are small non-coding RNA responsible for regulating gene expression and ultimately protein expression and have been used as biomarkers for many cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Investigating the detection of miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that bathes the central nervous system (CNS) is a prime target for identifying potential biomarkers for ALS. This is the first study to investigate the expression of miRNAs in the CSF of ALS patients using small RNA sequencing. We detected 11 differentially expressed miRNAs in the CSF of sporadic ALS (sALS) patients related to neural and glial activity. Additionally, miRNAs involved in glucose metabolism and the regulation of oxidative stress were also identified. Detecting the presence of potential CSF derived miRNA biomarkers in sALS could open up a whole new area of knowledge to help gain a better understanding of disease pathophysiology. Additionally, with further investigation, the tracking of CSF miRNA over the disease course could be used to follow the disease progression and monitor the effect of novel therapeutics that could be personalized to an individual disease phenotype.","['Waller R', 'Wyles M', 'Heath PR', 'Kazoka M', 'Wollff H', 'Shaw PJ', 'Kirby J']",2017,11,,Front Neurosci,"Waller R, et al.

29374665,Needs of informal caregivers across the caregiving course in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a qualitative analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a debilitating terminal condition. Informal caregivers are key figures in ALS care provision. The physical, psychological and emotional impact of providing care in the home requires appropriate assistance and support. The objective of this analysis is to explore the needs of informal ALS caregivers across the caregiving course.
DESIGN: In an open-ended question as part of a semistructured interview, caregivers were asked what would help them in their role. Interviews took place on three occasions at 4-month to 6-month intervals. Demographic, burden and quality of life data were collected, in addition to the open-ended responses. We carried out descriptive statistical analysis and thematic analysis of qualitative data.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Home interviews at baseline (n=81) and on two further occasions (n=56, n=41) with informal caregivers of people with ALS attending the National ALS/MND Clinic at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.
RESULTS: The majority of caregivers were family members. Hours of care provided and caregiver burden increased across the interview series. Thematic analysis identified what would help them in their role, and needs related to external support and services, psychological-emotional factors, patient-related behaviours, a cure and 'nothing'. Themes were interconnected and their prevalence varied across the interview time points.
CONCLUSION: This study has shown the consistency and adaptation in what caregivers identified as helpful in their role, across 12-18 months of a caregiving journey. Support needs are clearly defined, and change with time and the course of caregiving. Caregivers need support from family, friends and healthcare professionals in managing their tasks and the emotional demands of caregiving. Identifying the specific needs of informal caregivers should enable health professionals to provide tailored supportive interventions.","['Galvin M', 'Carney S', 'Corr B', 'Mays I', 'Pender N', 'Hardiman O']",2018,8,1,BMJ Open,"Galvin M, et al.

29359485,"Australian family carer responses when a loved one receives a diagnosis of Motor Neurone Disease-""Our life has changed forever"".","While the experiences of family members supporting a person with a terminal illness are well documented, less is known about the needs of carers of people with neurological diseases, in particular, Motor Neurone Disease (MND). This paper describes the qualitative data from a large Australian survey of family carers of people with MND, to ascertain their experiences of receiving the diagnosis. The aim of the study was to describe the experiences of family carers of people with MND in receiving the diagnosis in order to inform and improve ways in which the diagnosis is communicated. Anonymous postal surveys were sent to people with MND in Australia and their family carers respectively. The perceived ability/skills of neurologists was assessed using a five-point scale from excellent to poor. Attributes of communication of bad news was measured by the SPIKES protocol. Each survey question invited further written responses. Eight hundred and sixty-four questionnaires were posted to people with MND and their family carers, with assistance from MND associations. One hundred and ninety-six family carers submitted responses, of which 171 (88%) were patient-carer dyads. Analyses were conducted on 190 family carers. Five themes emerged from reading and re-reading written responses: frustrations with the diagnosis; giving information; family carer observations of the neurologist; the setting; and what would have made the diagnosis easier? The delivery of the diagnosis is a pivotal event in the MND trajectory. Satisfaction for patients and their family carers is related to the neurologists showing empathy and responding appropriately to their emotions, exhibiting knowledge and providing longer consultations. Neurologists may benefit from education and training in communication skills to adequately respond to patients' and families' emotions and development of best practice protocols.","[""O'Connor M"", 'Aoun SM', 'Breen LJ']",2018,26,3,Health Soc Care Community,"O'Connor M, et al.

29342275,Hot-spot KIF5A mutations cause familial ALS.,"Heterozygous missense mutations in the N-terminal motor or coiled-coil domains of the kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) gene cause monogenic spastic paraplegia (HSP10) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2). Moreover, heterozygous de novo frame-shift mutations in the C-terminal domain of KIF5A are associated with neonatal intractable myoclonus, a neurodevelopmental syndrome. These findings, together with the observation that many of the disease genes associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disrupt cytoskeletal function and intracellular transport, led us to hypothesize that mutations in KIF5A are also a cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Using whole exome sequencing followed by rare variant analysis of 426 patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 6137 control subjects, we detected an enrichment of KIF5A splice-site mutations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (2/426 compared to 0/6137 in controls; P = 4.2 × 10-3), both located in a hot-spot in the C-terminus of the protein and predicted to affect splicing exon 27. We additionally show co-segregation with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of two canonical splice-site mutations in two families. Investigation of lymphoblast cell lines from patients with KIF5A splice-site mutations revealed the loss of mutant RNA expression and suggested haploinsufficiency as the most probable underlying molecular mechanism. Furthermore, mRNA sequencing of a rare non-synonymous missense mutation (predicting p.Arg1007Gly) located in the C-terminus of the protein shortly upstream of the splice donor of exon 27 revealed defective KIF5A pre-mRNA splicing in respective patient-derived cell lines owing to abrogation of the donor site. Finally, the non-synonymous single nucleotide variant rs113247976 (minor allele frequency = 1.00% in controls, n = 6137), also located in the C-terminal region [p.(Pro986Leu) in exon 26], was significantly enriched in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (minor allele frequency = 3.40%; P = 1.28 × 10-7). Our study demonstrates that mutations located specifically in a C-terminal hotspot of KIF5A can cause a classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotype, and underline the involvement of intracellular transport processes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis.","['Brenner D', 'Yilmaz R', 'Müller K', 'Grehl T', 'Petri S', 'Meyer T', 'Grosskreutz J', 'Weydt P', 'Ruf W', 'Neuwirth C', 'Weber M', 'Pinto S', 'Claeys KG', 'Schrank B', 'Jordan B', 'Knehr A', 'Günther K', 'Hübers A', 'Zeller D', 'Kubisch C', 'Jablonka S', 'Sendtner M', 'Klopstock T', 'de Carvalho M', 'Sperfeld A', 'Borck G', 'Volk AE', 'Dorst J', 'Weis J', 'Otto M', 'Schuster J', 'Del Tredici K', 'Braak H', 'Danzer KM', 'Freischmidt A', 'Meitinger T', 'Strom TM', 'Ludolph AC', 'Andersen PM', 'Weishaupt JH', 'German ALS network MND-NET']",2018,141,3,Brain,"Brenner D, et al.

Here we describe a case of MND presenting as pure spastic monoparesis in which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gave a substantial contribution in confirming the diagnosis and assessing the severity of UMN involvement. An isolated pyramidal syndrome, with complete absence of LMN signs, is a rare phenotype in the context of MND (less than 4% of total cases), especially if restricted to only one limb.

29293261,Treatment of fatigue in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is terminal, progressive neurological condition for which there are no curative treatments. Among people with ALS/MND, fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom, which is characterised by reversible motor weakness and whole-body tiredness that is only partially relieved by rest. The effectiveness of pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments for fatigue in ALS/MND is not yet established.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue in ALS/MND.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases on 5 September 2017: Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, and ERIC. We also searched two clinical trials registries.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of any intervention which sought to reduce fatigue for people with ALS/MND. We included studies if reduction in fatigue was a primary or secondary outcome of the trial.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
MAIN RESULTS: We included one pharmacological (modafinil) study and three non-pharmacological studies (resistance exercise, respiratory exercise, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)), involving a total of 86 participants with ALS/MND. None of the included studies were free from risk of bias. Since there was only one trial for each intervention, no meta-analysis was possible. All studies assessed fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS; scale from 9 to 63, higher scores indicate more fatigue). Information for assessing bias was often lacking in study reports, making the risk of bias unclear across several domains in all trials. Blinding of participants was not possible in exercise trials, but the outcome assessment was blinded.We found very low-quality evidence suggesting possible improvements in fatigue for modafinil treatment versus placebo (MD -11.00, 95% CI -23.08 to 1.08), respiratory exercise versus a sham intervention (MD -9.65, 95% CI -22.04 to 2.73), and rTMS versus sham rTMS (data not provided), which warrant further investigation to clarify the efficacy of these treatments for fatigue in ALS/MND. We found no clear improvements in fatigue for resistance exercise versus usual care (MD 0.20, 95% CI -10.98 to 11.38; very low-quality evidence).Three participants in the modafinil group dropped out of the modafinil study, two citing issues with headache and one with chest tightness; other adverse effects were anxiety, nausea, dizziness, and sialorrhoea (probably ALS-related). The trials reported no adverse effects of exercise or rTMS.We cannot be certain about the effects of any of the interventions studied because of imprecision (small numbers of participants, wide CI), and possible study limitations.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is impossible to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions to improve fatigue for people with ALS/MND as there are few randomised studies, and the quality of available evidence is very low.","['Gibbons C', 'Pagnini F', 'Friede T', 'Young CA']",2018,1,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Gibbons C, et al.

METHODS: MUNIX and AMPS technique were prospectively performed on thenar muscles in 20 consecutive patients referred to our neurophysiological laboratory with the clinical diagnosis of a possible motoneurone disorder (MND). The clinical and paraclinical assessment confirmed the diagnosis of MND in 13 out of 20 patients, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 9 (with MND group). In the other 7 patients, there were neither evidence of MND, nor of any peripheral nervous system disease (without MND group).
RESULTS: AMPS and MUNIX data were significantly (p < 0.001) lower in patients with MND than in patients without MND. There was a strong significant positive linear correlation between AMPS and MUNIX values (n = 20; R = 0.83; p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Both MUNIX and AMPS methods could serve as a reliable marker to document the motor unit loss.

29284475,Existential decision-making in a fatal progressive disease: how much do legal and medical frameworks matter?,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare legislation in European countries is similar in many respects. Most importantly, the framework of informed consent determines that physicians have the duty to provide detailed information about available therapeutic options and that patients have the right to refuse measures that contradict their personal values. However, when it comes to end-of-life decision-making a number of differences exist in the more specific regulations of individual countries. These differences and how they might nevertheless impact patient's choices will be addressed in the current debate.
MAIN TEXT: In this article we show how the legal and medical frameworks of Germany, Poland and Sweden differ with regard to end-of-life decisions for patients with a fatal progressive disease. Taking Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as an example, we systematically compare clinical guidelines and healthcare law, pointing out the country-specific differences most relevant for existential decision-making. A fictional case report discusses the implications of these differences for a patient with ALS living in either of the three countries. Patients with ALS in Germany, Poland and Sweden are confronted with a similar spectrum of treatment options. However, the analysis of the normative frameworks shows that the conditions for making existential decisions differ considerably in Germany, Poland and Sweden. Specifically, these differences concern (1) the legal status of advance directives, (2) the conditions under which life-sustaining therapies are started or withheld, and (3) the legal regulations on assisted dying.
CONCLUSION: According to the presented data, regulations of terminating life-sustaining treatments and the framework of ""informed consent"" are quite differently understood and implemented in the legal setting of the three countries. It is possible, and even likely, that these differences in the legal and medical frameworks have a considerable influence on existential decisions of patients with ALS.","['Weber C', 'Fijalkowska B', 'Ciecwierska K', 'Lindblad A', 'Badura-Lotter G', 'Andersen PM', 'Kuźma-Kozakiewicz M', 'Ludolph AC', 'Lulé D', 'Pasierski T', 'Lynöe N']",2017,16,1,BMC Palliat Care,"Weber C, et al.

29273900,Synapse loss in the prefrontal cortex is associated with cognitive decline in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"In addition to motor neurone degeneration, up to 50% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients present with cognitive decline. Understanding the neurobiological changes underlying these cognitive deficits is critical, as cognitively impaired patients exhibit a shorter survival time from symptom onset. Given the pathogenic role of synapse loss in other neurodegenerative diseases in which cognitive decline is apparent, such as Alzheimer's disease, we aimed to assess synaptic integrity in the ALS brain. Here, we have applied a unique combination of high-resolution imaging of post-mortem tissue with neuropathology, genetic screening and cognitive profiling of ALS cases. Analyses of more than 1 million synapses using two complimentary high-resolution techniques (electron microscopy and array tomography) revealed a loss of synapses from the prefrontal cortex of ALS patients. Importantly, synapse loss was significantly greater in cognitively impaired cases and was not due to cortical atrophy, nor associated with dementia-associated neuropathology. Interestingly, we found a trend between pTDP-43 pathology and synapse loss in the frontal cortex and discovered pTDP-43 puncta at a subset of synapses in the ALS brains. From these data, we postulate that synapse loss in the prefrontal cortex represents an underlying neurobiological substrate of cognitive decline in ALS.","['Henstridge CM', 'Sideris DI', 'Carroll E', 'Rotariu S', 'Salomonsson S', 'Tzioras M', 'McKenzie CA', 'Smith C', 'von Arnim CAF', 'Ludolph AC', 'Lulé D', 'Leighton D', 'Warner J', 'Cleary E', 'Newton J', 'Swingler R', 'Chandran S', 'Gillingwater TH', 'Abrahams S', 'Spires-Jones TL']",2018,135,2,Acta Neuropathol,"Henstridge CM, et al.

29270111,Motor Neuron Gene Therapy: Lessons from Spinal Muscular Atrophy for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are severe nervous system diseases characterized by the degeneration of lower motor neurons. They share a number of additional pathological, cellular, and genetic parallels suggesting that mechanistic and clinical insights into one disorder may have value for the other. While there are currently no clinical ALS gene therapies, the splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide, nusinersen, was recently approved for SMA. This milestone was achieved through extensive pre-clinical research and patient trials, which together have spawned fundamental insights into motor neuron gene therapy. We have thus tried to distil key information garnered from SMA research, in the hope that it may stimulate a more directed approach to ALS gene therapy. Not only must the type of therapeutic (e.g., antisense oligonucleotide vs. viral vector) be sensibly selected, but considerable thought must be applied to the ","['Tosolini AP', 'Sleigh JN']",2017,10,,Front Mol Neurosci,Tosolini AP and Sleigh JN.

29235420,"A self-care, problem-solving and mindfulness intervention for informal caregivers of people with motor neurone disease: A pilot study.","BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers of people with motor neurone disease (MND) take on an extensive role. Caregivers are at increased risk of experiencing psychological distress and burden, yet, there is a lack of intervention programmes to support them.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a therapeutic group intervention promoting self-care, problem-solving and mindfulness to informal caregivers of people with MND.
DESIGN: Pilot study that utilised a one-arm pre- and post-design. Acceptability of the intervention was assessed 2 weeks post intervention with a questionnaire designed specifically for this study. Feasibility was assessed with consent, adherence and reasons for non-participation, refusal and attrition. Participants completed baseline and follow-up (6-week post intervention) questionnaires for psychological morbidity, burden, problem-solving, mindfulness and preparedness. Settings/participants: Caregivers of people with a diagnosis of MND within the past 12 months who were 18 years or older; who could speak, read and write in English and who were attending a progressive neurological diseases clinic were eligible.
RESULTS: A total of 13 caregivers participated in one of three group intervention sessions which were focused on self-care, problem-solving and mindfulness. The intervention appeared to be feasible and acceptable. All participants stated that they would recommend the intervention to others. The group format appeared to be highly valued. There was no significant change in measures between pre-intervention and 6 weeks post intervention.

29156917,Advance care planning for patients with advanced neurology diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Advanced neurology diseases including motor neuron disease (MND) are usually progressive life-limiting illness and could be devastating for patients, families and caregivers. Although medical technologies, such as enteral feeding and non-invasive ventilation, may prolong life expectancy of the patients, their utilization prompts important ethical questions in regard to their quality of life (QoL). Little attention had been paid on how ACP practice would practically help with patients suffering from different neurology diseases. We are unaware of any published studies on ACP practice among patients with different neurology diseases. In our study, we assessed end-of-life (EOL) care preferences, documentation, and communication in patients with various types of advanced neurology diseases.
METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of all patients referred to the neuro-palliative care team (NPCT) in a local acute hospital in Hong Kong. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Hong Kong. NPCT consultation was hand abstracted from the electronic health record if there was a subspecialty palliative care (PC) consultation note during the study period. Hand abstraction of data also included any content related to advance care planning (ACP) [advance directive (AD), resuscitation order, ventilator support, artificial feeding, patient wishes, legacy].
RESULTS: For patient who signed AD, items including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (100%), mechanical ventilation (100%), artiﬁcial nutrition and hydration (80%) were mentioned more frequently than other EOL interventions. For patients who had ACP but without AD, the most common diagnosis is bad stroke (60%). Place of death, artiﬁcial nutrition and hydration were most mentioned EOL interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: EOL decision making in patients with advanced neurology disease is often delayed. This study showed that MND patients are readier to discuss their EOL issues and signed their AD. The NPCT can play a valuable role in EOL discussions in patients with advanced neurology diseases under collaboration between the PC and the neurology teams.","['Cheung KC', 'Lau VW', 'Un KC', 'Wong MS', 'Chan KY']",2018,7,3,Ann Palliat Med,"Cheung KC, et al.

29156906,The development of neurology palliative care service for motor neuron disease (MND) patients: Hong Kong experience.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem and motor cortex. Clinically it is manifested as progressive decline in physical, respiratory, swallowing and communication function and ultimately death. Traditional model of care was fragmented and did not match with patients and carers multi-facet needs.
METHODS: A special workgroup for MND patients that includes neurologist, respiratory physician, rehabilitation specialist and palliative care (PC) physician was formed in Hong Kong since year 2013. In various disease phase, each specialty team play a leading role in coordinated care of MND patients.
RESULTS: From Apr 2013 to Mar 2015, 41 patients newly diagnosed with MND were cared in our model. 96.4% agreed to participate in the ACP discussion. Seventy-five percent of them opted for do-not-attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) and no intubation/mechanical ventilation. There were 16 (51.6%) of patients passed away within the review period. All of them succumbed with no CPR performed which was honoring their wish. The average duration under PC was 118 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Strategies toward standardizing care delivery for MND patients and carers may help to address the physical, psychosocial and spiritual needs of MND patients.

29131108,"Genetic and Pathological Assessment of hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2/B1, and hnRNPA3 in Familial and Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.","BACKGROUND: Mutations in the genes encoding the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2/B1 have been reported in a multisystem proteinopathy that includes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia. Mutations were also described in the prion-like domain of hnRNPA1 in patients with classic ALS. Another hnRNP protein, hnRNPA3, has been found to be associated with the ALS/frontotemporal dementia protein C9orf72.
OBJECTIVE: To further assess their role in ALS, we examined these hnRNPs in spinal cord tissue from sporadic (SALS) and familial ALS (FALS) patients, including C9orf72 repeat expansion-positive patients, and controls. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HNRNPA1, HNRNPA2B1, and HNRNPA3 mutations in Australian ALS patients.
METHODS: Immunostaining was used to assess hnRNPs in ALS patient spinal cords. Mutation analysis of the HNRNPA1, HNRNPA2B1, and HNRNPA3 genes was performed in FALS and of their prion-like domains in SALS patients.
RESULTS: Immunostaining of spinal motor neurons of ALS patients with the C9orf72 repeat expansion showed significant mislocalisation of hnRNPA3, and no differences in hnRNPA1 or A2/B1 localisation, compared to controls. No novel or known mutations were identified in HNRNPA1, HNRNPA2B1, or HNRNPA3 in Australian ALS patients.
CONCLUSIONS: hnRNPA3 pathology was identified in motor neurons of ALS patients with C9orf72 repeat expansions, implicating hnRNPA3 in the pathogenesis of C9orf72-linked ALS. hnRNPA3 warrants further investigation into the pathogenesis of ALS linked to C9orf72. This study also determined that HNRNP mutations are not a common cause of FALS and SALS in Australia.","['Fifita JA', 'Zhang KY', 'Galper J', 'Williams KL', 'McCann EP', 'Hogan AL', 'Saunders N', 'Bauer D', 'Tarr IS', 'Pamphlett R', 'Nicholson GA', 'Rowe D', 'Yang S', 'Blair IP']",2017,17,6,Neurodegener Dis,"Fifita JA, et al.

29115989,Clusterin protects neurons against intracellular proteotoxicity.,"It is now widely accepted in the field that the normally secreted chaperone clusterin is redirected to the cytosol during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, although the physiological function(s) of this physical relocation remain unknown. We have examined in this study whether or not increased expression of clusterin is able to protect neuronal cells against intracellular protein aggregation and cytotoxicity, characteristics that are strongly implicated in a range of neurodegenerative diseases. We used the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated protein TDP-43 as a primary model to investigate the effects of clusterin on protein aggregation and neurotoxicity in complementary in vitro, neuronal cell and Drosophila systems. We have shown that clusterin directly interacts with TDP-43 in vitro and potently inhibits its aggregation, and observed that in ER stressed neuronal cells, clusterin co-localized with TDP-43 and specifically reduced the numbers of cytoplasmic inclusions. We further showed that the expression of TDP-43 in transgenic Drosophila neurons induced ER stress and that co-expression of clusterin resulted in a dramatic clearance of mislocalized TDP-43 from motor neuron axons, partially rescued locomotor activity and significantly extended lifespan. We also showed that in Drosophila photoreceptor cells, clusterin co-expression gave ER stress-dependent protection against proteotoxicity arising from both Huntingtin-Q128 and mutant (R406W) human tau. We therefore conclude that increased expression of clusterin can provide an important defense against intracellular proteotoxicity under conditions that mimic specific features of neurodegenerative disease.","['Gregory JM', 'Whiten DR', 'Brown RA', 'Barros TP', 'Kumita JR', 'Yerbury JJ', 'Satapathy S', 'McDade K', 'Smith C', 'Luheshi LM', 'Dobson CM', 'Wilson MR']",2017,5,1,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Gregory JM, et al.

29089397,Imaging muscle as a potential biomarker of denervation in motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical, electrophysiological and whole-body muscle MRI measurements of progression in patients with motor neuron disease (MND), as tools for future clinical trials, and to probe pathophysiological mechanisms in vivo.
METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, observational, clinicoelectrophysiological and radiological cohort study was performed. Twenty-nine patients with MND and 22 age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls were assessed with clinical measures, electrophysiological motor unit number index (MUNIX) and T2-weighted whole-body muscle MRI, at first clinical presentation and 4 months later. Between-group differences and associations were assessed using age-adjusted and gender-adjusted multivariable regression models. Within-subject longitudinal changes were assessed using paired t-tests. Patterns of disease spread were modelled using mixed-effects multivariable regression, assessing associations between muscle relative T2 signal and anatomical adjacency to site of clinical onset.
RESULTS: Patients with MND had 30% higher relative T2 muscle signal than controls at baseline (all regions mean, 95% CI 15% to 45%, p<0.001). Higher T2 signal was associated with greater overall disability (coefficient -0.009, 95% CI -0.017 to -0.001, p=0.023) and with clinical weakness and lower MUNIX in multiple individual muscles. Relative T2 signal in bilateral tibialis anterior increased over 4 months in patients with MND (right: 10.2%, 95% CI 2.0% to 18.4%, p=0.017; left: 14.1%, 95% CI 3.4% to 24.9%, p=0.013). Anatomically, contiguous disease spread on MRI was not apparent in this model.
CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body muscle MRI offers a new approach to objective assessment of denervation over short timescales in MND and enables investigation of patterns of disease spread in vivo. Muscles inaccessible to conventional clinical and electrophysiological assessment may be investigated using this methodology.","['Jenkins TM', 'Alix JJP', 'David C', 'Pearson E', 'Rao DG', 'Hoggard N', ""O'Brien E"", 'Baster K', 'Bradburn M', 'Bigley J', 'McDermott CJ', 'Wilkinson ID', 'Shaw PJ']",2018,89,3,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Jenkins TM, et al.

This study aimed to examine total and concurrent equipment items prescribed with phenotype consideration.
METHODS: A prospective, observational consecutive cohort study was undertaken. Data regarding Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, phenotype, symptom onset and Functional Independence Measure (inpatients only) was recorded. Equipment utilized was coded by therapist as: speech devices; transfer devices; mobility devices (including power wheelchairs); orthoses; activities of daily living equipment; assisted technology and home modification equipment.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-three people with motor neuron disease participated, mean age 67 years, mean amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised score 32, a moderate level of disability. Equipment items per participant ranged from 0 to 20, median 5. The electric lift recliner chair was the most commonly used equipment item, used by 51.2% of the cohort. There was a statistically significant difference in equipment use between flail leg and bulbar (Md 11, 3 items, respectively; p = .005), and flail leg and cervical phenotypes (Md 11, 3.5 items respectively; p = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: People with motor neuron disease have high equipment needs to optimize quality of life. Information regarding phenotype relative to equipment requirement, and most frequently prescribed equipment items can assist health-care providers anticipate equipment needs, burden and intensity for those with motor neuron disease. Implications for rehabilitation People with motor neuron disease have high concurrent equipment needs.

29052789,Computational Analysis of Pharyngeal Swallowing Mechanics in Patients with Motor Neuron Disease: A Pilot Investigation.,"Swallowing impairment (dysphagia) is a common sequela in patients with motor neuron disease (MND). The purpose of this retrospective, observational pilot investigation was to characterize how pharyngeal swallowing mechanics are impacted in patients with MND using a comparison with healthy, non-dysphagic control group. Computational analysis of swallowing mechanics (CASM) was used to determine covariate biomechanics of pharyngeal swallowing from videofluoroscopic assessment in 15 patients with MND and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Canonical variant analysis with post hoc discriminate function analysis (DFA) was performed on coordinate data mapping functional muscle groups underlying pharyngeal swallowing. Differences in swallowing mechanics associated with group (MND; control), motor neuron predominance (upper; lower), onset (bulbar; spinal), and swallow task (thin, pudding) were evaluated and visualized. Pharyngeal swallowing mechanics differed significantly in patients with MND compared with healthy controls (D = 2.01, p < 0.0001). Post hoc DFA pairwise comparisons suggest differences in pharyngeal swallow mechanics by motor neuron predominance (D = 5.03, p < 0.0001), onset (D = 2.03, p < 0.0001), and swallow task (D = 1.04, p < 0.0001). Pharyngeal swallowing mechanics of patients with MND differ from and are more heterogeneous than healthy controls. These findings suggest patients with MND may compensate reductions in pharyngeal shortening and tongue base retraction by extending the head and neck and increasing hyolaryngeal excursion. This work and further CASM investigations will lead to further insights into development and evaluation of targeted clinical treatments designed to prolong safe and efficient swallowing function in patients with MND.","['Garand KL', 'Schwertner R', 'Chen A', 'Pearson WG']",2018,33,2,Dysphagia,"Garand KL, et al.

METHODS: Six hundred patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), upper motor neuron (UMN) or lower motor neuron (LMN) phenotypes were invited for a questionnaire concerning symptom development. A binomial test was used to examine distribution of symptoms from site of onset. Development of symptoms over time was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: There were 470 respondents (ALS = 254; LMN = 100; UMN = 116). Subsequent symptoms were more often in the contralateral limb following unilateral limb onset (ALS: arms p = 1.05 × 10
CONCLUSIONS: Preferred spread of symptoms from one limb to the contralateral limb, and to adjacent sites appears to be a characteristic of MND phenotypes, suggesting that symptom spread is organized, possibly involving axonal connectivity.

29034688,End-of-life Characteristics and Palliative Care Provision for Patients With Motor Neuron Disease.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disease and manifested as progressive decline in physical, respiratory, swallowing and communication function, and ultimately death. Traditional model of care was fragmented and did not match with multifacet needs of patients and carers. Furthermore, there could be lack of integrated care at end of life for patients with MND in most lower- and middle-income countries or in places with inadequate palliative care (PC) coverage. In view of this, a special workgroup for patients with MND, which includes neurologist, respiratory physician, rehabilitation specialist, and PC physician was formed in Hong Kong since year 2011. In various disease phase, each specialty team plays a leading role in coordinated care of patients with MND. From July 2011 to June 2017, a total of 52 patients with MND were referred for PC; 41 deceased patients with MND were included into data analysis. Major cause of death remains pneumonia (54.8%) and respiratory failure (40.5%). Most of the patients with MND (66.7%) died in acute ward and neurology units, with only 11.9% dying in PC units and hospices. The PC team plays a major role in advance care planning (ACP), and most patients had their ACP documented at second or third PC clinic visit (93.8%). Patients with MND often have limitations in mobility, swallowing difficulty, respiratory insufficiency requiring ventilator support, and various psychosocial needs. This highlighted the importance of early PC referral.","['Cheng HWB', 'Chan OMI', 'Chan CHR', 'Chan WH', 'Fung KS', 'Wong KY']",2018,35,6,Am J Hosp Palliat Care,"Cheng HWB, et al.

28991679,Brainstem cytokine changes in healthy ageing and Motor Neurone Disease.,"Neuroinflammation is linked to healthy ageing, but its role in the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is unclear. In this pilot study we used a multiplex assay approach to compare 27 cytokines in 6 young adult and 6 ageing control brainstems with those in 6 MND brainstems. We report that healthy ageing is associated with significantly increased brainstem levels of IL-1β, IP-10 and MIP-1β which co-localise immunocytochemically to astrocytes. MND brainstem is also characterised by a general increase in both pro- and anti-cytokine levels, but fails to show the expected age-related increase in MIP-1β and IP-10. This pilot study is the first to show that MND is associated with a failure of specific features of the normal age-related neuroinflammatory process. We suggest that our pilot data indicates that neuroinflammation during healthy ageing may not always be detrimental to motoneuronal survival and that age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as MND, may instead result from defective neuroinflammation.","['Tennakoon A', 'Katharesan V', 'Johnson IP']",2017,381,,J Neurol Sci,"Tennakoon A, et al.

28982219,Mechanical ventilation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Neuromuscular respiratory failure is the most common cause of death, which usually occurs within two to five years of the disease onset. Supporting respiratory function with mechanical ventilation may improve survival and quality of life. This is the second update of a review first published in 2009.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of mechanical ventilation (tracheostomy-assisted ventilation and non-invasive ventilation (NIV)) on survival, functional measures of disease progression, and quality of life in ALS, and to evaluate adverse events related to the intervention.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 30 January 2017. We also searched two clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving non-invasive or tracheostomy-assisted ventilation in participants with a clinical diagnosis of ALS, independent of the reported outcomes. We included comparisons with no intervention or the best standard care.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For the original review, four review authors independently selected studies for assessment. Two review authors reviewed searches for this update. All review authors independently extracted data from the full text of selected studies and assessed the risk of bias in studies that met the inclusion criteria. We attempted to obtain missing data where possible. We planned to collect adverse event data from the included studies.
MAIN RESULTS: For the original Cochrane Review, the review authors identified two RCTs involving 54 participants with ALS receiving NIV. There were no new RCTs or quasi-RCTs at the first update. One new RCT was identified in the second update but was excluded for the reasons outlined below.Incomplete data were available for one published study comparing early and late initiation of NIV (13 participants). We contacted the trial authors, who were not able to provide the missing data. The conclusions of the review were therefore based on a single study of 41 participants comparing NIV with standard care. Lack of (or uncertain) blinding represented a risk of bias for participant- and clinician-assessed outcomes such as quality of life, but it was otherwise a well-conducted study with a low risk of bias.The study provided moderate-quality evidence that overall median survival was significantly different between the group treated with NIV and the standard care group. The median survival in the NIV group was 48 days longer (219 days compared to 171 days for the standard care group (estimated 95% confidence interval 12 to 91 days, P = 0.0062)). This survival benefit was accompanied by an enhanced quality of life. On subgroup analysis, in the subgroup with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function (20 participants), median survival was 205 days longer (216 days in the NIV group versus 11 days in the standard care group, P = 0.0059), and quality of life measures were better than with standard care (low-quality evidence). In the participants with poor bulbar function (21 participants), NIV did not prolong survival or improve quality of life, although there was significant improvement in the mean symptoms domain of the Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index by some measures. Neither trial reported clinical data on intervention-related adverse effects.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-quality evidence from a single RCT of NIV in 41 participants suggests that it significantly prolongs survival, and low-quality evidence indicates that it improves or maintains quality of life in people with ALS. Survival and quality of life were significantly improved in the subgroup of people with better bulbar function, but not in those with severe bulbar impairment. Adverse effects related to NIV should be systematically reported, as at present there is little information on this subject. More RCT evidence to support the use of NIV in ALS will be difficult to generate, as not offering NIV to the control group is no longer ethically justifiable. Future studies should examine the benefits of early intervention with NIV and establish the most appropriate timing for initiating NIV in order to obtain its maximum benefit. The effect of adding cough augmentation techniques to NIV also needs to be investigated in an RCT. Future studies should examine the health economics of NIV. Access to NIV remains restricted in many parts of the world, including Europe and North America. We need to understand the factors, personal and socioeconomic, that determine access to NIV.","['Radunovic A', 'Annane D', 'Rafiq MK', 'Brassington R', 'Mustfa N']",2017,10,10,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Radunovic A, et al.

28931454,The experience of informal caregivers of patients with motor neurone disease: A thematic synthesis.,"UNLABELLED: ABSTRACTObjective:Research is required in order to illustrate and detail the experiences of informal caregivers of patients with motor neurone disease (pwMND) to further advance the research base and to inform the development of future support structures and services. Due to the heterogeneous nature of caregiving for pwMND, one way in which this can be achieved is through a qualitative review. A qualitative thematic analysis of existing qualitative studies has not, to the best of the authors' knowledge, been previously undertaken. Thus, the present synthesis aims to identify caregivers' experiences and to suggest factors that contribute to these experiences in order to fulfill the required research needs.
METHOD: A thematic synthesis of qualitative literature was conducted. AMED, Medline, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and PubMed were electronically searched from inception until September of 2015. Studies were eligible if they included qualitative literature reporting on firsthand experience of informal caregivers of patients with MND, were published in English, and contained verbatim quotations. Critical appraisal was undertaken using a 13-item consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) checklist.
RESULTS: A total of 10 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 148 (50 male) current or previous informal caregivers of pwMND identified. Critical appraisal demonstrated that study design and reflexivity were underreported. The synthesis derived three themes: (1) loss of control, (2) inability to choose, and (3) isolation.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The synthesis highlighted the factors that contribute to both positive and negative caregiving experiences. Through these experiences, such suggestions for service provision as improving communication with healthcare professionals and having a single point of contact emerged. However, the outcome of such suggestions on the experience of caregivers is beyond the scope of our synthesis, so that further research is required.","['Holkham L', 'Soundy A']",2018,16,4,Palliat Support Care,Holkham L and Soundy A.

28892874,Mortality from multiple sclerosis in British military personnel.,"BACKGROUND: While analysing trends in occupational mortality in England and Wales, we noticed an unexpectedly elevated proportion of deaths from multiple sclerosis (MS) among men in the armed forces.
AIMS: To document and explore possible explanations for the observed excess.
METHODS: We analysed data on underlying cause of death and last full-time occupation for 3,688,916 deaths among men aged 20-74 years in England and Wales during 1979-2010, calculating proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) standardised for age. We compared PMRs for MS in the armed forces with those for each main social class, and in selected other occupations. We also compared PMRs for MS with those for motor neurone disease (MND).
RESULTS: The overall PMR for MS in the armed forces during 1979-2010 was 243 (95%CI 203-288). The excess was apparent in each of three separate decades of study (PMRs, ranging from 220 to 259), and across the entire age range. PMRs for MS were not elevated to the same extent in comparator occupations, nor in any of the main social classes. There was no parallel increase in PMRs for MND.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the high proportional mortality from MS in British military personnel is unlikely to have occurred by chance, or as an artefact of the method of investigation. However, the only military cohort study with published results on MS does not support an increased risk. It would be useful to analyse data on MS from other established military cohorts, to check for evidence of a hazard.","['Harris EC', 'Palmer KT', 'Cox V', 'Darnton A', 'Osman J', 'Coggon D']",2017,67,6,Occup Med (Lond),"Harris EC, et al.

28859337,Amygdala TDP-43 Pathology in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Motor Neuron Disease.,"TDP-43-positive inclusions are present in the amygdala in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND) including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Behavioral abnormalities, one of the chief symptoms of FTLD, could be, at least partly, related to amygdala pathology. We examined TDP-43 inclusions in the amygdala of patients with sporadic FTLD/MND (sFTLD/MND), FTLD/MND with mutation of the C9ORF72 (FTLD/MND-C9) and FTLD with mutation of the progranulin (FTLD-GRN). TDP-43 inclusions were common in each one of these subtypes, which can otherwise be distinguished on topographical and genetic grounds. Conventional and immunological stainings were performed and we quantified the numerical density of inclusions on a regional basis. TDP-43 inclusions in amygdala could be seen in 10 out of 26 sFTLD/MND cases, 5 out of 9 FTLD/MND-C9 cases, and all 4 FTLD-GRN cases. Their numerical density was lower in FTLD/MND-C9 than in sFTLD/MND and FTLD-GRN. TDP-43 inclusions were more numerous in the ventral region of the basolateral nucleus group in all subtypes. This contrast was apparent in sporadic and C9-mutated FTLD/MND, while it was less evident in FTLD-GRN. Such differences in subregional involvement of amygdala may be related to the region-specific neuronal connections that are differentially affected in FTLD/MND and FTLD-GRN.","['Takeda T', 'Seilhean D', 'Le Ber I', 'Millecamps S', 'Sazdovitch V', 'Kitagawa K', 'Uchihara T', 'Duyckaerts C']",2017,76,9,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Takeda T, et al.

28833988,"Beyond weakness: Characterization of pain, sensory profile and conditioned pain modulation in patients with motor neuron disease: A controlled study.","BACKGROUND: Motor neuron diseases (MND) represent a group of disorders that evolve with inexorable muscle weakness and medical management is based on symptom control. However, deeper characterization of non-motor symptoms in these patients have been rarely reported.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to describe non-motor symptoms in MND and their impact on quality of life and functional status, with a focus on pain and sensory changes. Eighty patients (31 females, 55.7 ± 12.9 years old) with MND underwent a neurological examination, pain, mood, catastrophizing and psychophysics assessments [quantitative sensory testing (QST) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM)], and were compared to sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC).
RESULTS: Chronic pain was present in 46% of patients (VAS =5.18 ± 2.0). Pain of musculoskeletal origin occurred in 40.5% and was mainly located in the head/neck (51%) and lower back (35%). Neuropathic pain was not present in this sample. Compared to HC, MND patients had a lower cold detection threshold (p < 0.002), and significantly lower CPM scores (4.9 ± 0.2% vs. 22.1 ± 0.2%, p = 0.012). QST/CPM results did not differ between MND patients with and without pain. Pain intensity was statistically correlated with anxiety, depression and catastrophism, and spasticity scores were inversely correlated with CPM (ρ = -0.30, p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: Pain is frequently reported by patients with MNDs. Somatosensory and CPM changes exist in MNDs and may be related to the neurodegenerative nature of the disease. Further studies should investigate the most appropriate treatment strategies for these patients.
SIGNIFICANCE: We report a comprehensive evaluation of pain and sensory abnormalities in motor neuron disease (MND) patients. We assessed the different pain syndromes present in MND with validated tools, and described the QST and conditioned pain modulation profiles in a controlled design.","['Lopes LCG', 'Galhardoni R', 'Silva V', 'Jorge FMH', 'Yeng LT', 'Callegaro D', 'Chadi G', 'Teixeira MJ', 'Ciampi de Andrade D']",2018,22,1,Eur J Pain,"Lopes LCG, et al.

28829002,"Supporting wellbeing in motor neurone disease for patients, carers, social networks, and health professionals: A scoping review and synthesis.","UNLABELLED: ABSTRACTObjective:Disease management in motor neurone disease (MND) is focused on preserving quality of life. However, the emphasis has so far been on physical symptoms and functioning and not psychosocial wellbeing. MND affects the wellbeing of carers, of family and social network members, and of healthcare providers, as well as of the patients. We therefore aimed to assess and synthesize the knowledge about maximizing MND-related psychosocial wellbeing across all these groups.
METHOD: We used a systematic search and selection process to assess the scope of the literature along with a narrative synthesis of recent high-quality reviews.
RESULTS: The original studies were mainly observational studies of patients and, to a lesser extent, of carers. There were few interventional studies, mainly of patients. There were very few studies of any type on wellbeing in their wider social network or in healthcare professionals. All the review literature looked at MND patient or carer wellbeing, with some covering both. No reviews were found of wellbeing in other family members, patients' social networks, or their healthcare professionals. The reviews demonstrated wellbeing problems for patients linked to psychosocial issues. Carer wellbeing is also compromised. Psychotherapies, social supports, improved decision supports, and changes to healthcare delivery are among the suggested strategies for improved patient and carer wellbeing, but no proven interventions were identified for either. Early access to palliative care, also not well-tested but recommended, is poorly implemented.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Work on interventions to deal with well-established wellbeing problems for patients and carers is now a research priority. Explicit use of current methods for patient and public involvement and for design and testing of interventions provide a toolkit for this research. Observational research is needed in other groups. There is a potential in considering needs across patients' social networks rather than looking individually at particular groups.","['Harris M', 'Thomas G', 'Thomas M', 'Cafarella P', 'Stocks A', 'Greig J', 'McEvoy RD']",2018,16,2,Palliat Support Care,"Harris M, et al.

28817497,Self-care in People With Motor Neuron Disease: An Integrative Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Self-care is a crucial aspect in the management of chronic diseases. People with motor neuron disease (MND) live with a chronic degenerative condition in rapid evolution, which leads them to high dependencies. During their illness, they must apply several behaviors including adherence to ventilation and nutritional therapy.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to systematically explore the concept of self-care for people with MND.
METHOD: An integrative review of the literature has been conducted. The electronic databases CINAHL, PubMed, and SCOPUS were searched.
RESULTS: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed; 7 of them discuss decision-making process and adherence to ventilation and nutritional therapy. Five of them discuss strategies used by people with MND to optimize living with this illness. Four of them discuss care and monitoring behaviors performed and recommended to people with MND. No studies focused on self-care in people with MND was identified in the literature.
CONCLUSIONS: The concept of self-care in people with MND is related to inventiveness, to adaptability, and to dependence. Further studies seem to be needed to understand the concept of self-care in this population.","['Bassola B', 'Lusignani M']",2017,49,5,J Neurosci Nurs,Bassola B and Lusignani M.

28789478,Perry Syndrome: A Distinctive Type of TDP-43 Proteinopathy.,"Perry syndrome is a rare atypical parkinsonism with depression, apathy, weight loss, and central hypoventilation caused by mutations in dynactin p150glued (DCTN1). A rare distal hereditary motor neuropathy, HMN7B, also has mutations in DCTN1. Perry syndrome has TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusions as a defining feature. Other TDP-43 proteinopathies include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with and without motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). TDP-43 forms aggregates in neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs), neuronal intranuclear inclusions, dystrophic neurites (DNs), as well as axonal spheroids, oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions, and perivascular astrocytic inclusions (PVIs). We performed semiquantitative assessment of these lesions and presence of dynactin subunit p50 lesions in 3 cases of Perry syndrome and one of HMN7B. We compared them with 3 cases of FTLD-MND, 3 of ALS, and 3 of hippocampal sclerosis (HpScl). Perry syndrome had NCIs, DNs, and frequent PVIs and spheroids. Perry syndrome cases were similar, but different from ALS, FTLD-MND, and HpScl. TDP-43 pathology was not detected in HMN7B. Dynactin p50 inclusions were observed in both Perry syndrome and HMN7B, but not in the other conditions. These results suggest that Perry syndrome may be distinctive type of TDP-43 proteinopathy.","['Mishima T', 'Koga S', 'Lin WL', 'Kasanuki K', 'Castanedes-Casey M', 'Wszolek ZK', 'Oh SJ', 'Tsuboi Y', 'Dickson DW']",2017,76,8,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Mishima T, et al.

28759804,Multidimensional apathy and executive dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Apathy and cognitive dysfunction are prominent symptoms of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). More specifically ALS patients show increased Initiation apathy-a lack of motivation for self-generation of thoughts as assessed by the Dimensional Apathy Scale. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive underpinnings of apathy subtypes in ALS. We hypothesized that increased Initiation apathy would be associated deficits on tests of intrinsic response generation, such as verbal fluency. We also explored the relationship of other apathy subtypes to cognitive processes, in particular emotional apathy with emotional and social cognition deficits and executive apathy with planning and goal management deficits. ALS patients, and their carers (N = 30), and healthy matched controls, and their informants (N = 29) were recruited. All participants completed self- and informant/carer-rated Dimensional Apathy Scale, to quantify apathy subtypes (Executive, Emotional and Initiation), along with standard apathy and depression measures. Patients and controls completed the Edinburgh Cognitive and behavioural ALS Screen, and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery including emotional recognition, social cognition, intrinsic response generation tasks (verbal fluency and random number generation) and a new ecologically valid, computerised measure of planning and goal management. The results demonstrated that increased Initiation apathy was the only significantly elevated subtype in ALS (self-rated p < .05, informant/carer-rated p < .01). Initiation apathy was found to be significantly associated with verbal fluency deficit, while Emotional apathy was significantly associated with emotional recognition deficits. No associations were found between apathy subtypes and depression or in controls. This is the first study to show specific associations between apathy subtypes (Emotional and Initiation) and executive and emotional cognitive dysfunction, indicating possible distinct underlying mechanisms to these demotivational symptoms.","['Radakovic R', 'Stephenson L', 'Newton J', 'Crockford C', 'Swingler R', 'Chandran S', 'Abrahams S']",2017,94,,Cortex,"Radakovic R, et al.

28745069,A case series of PLS patients with frontotemporal dementia and overview of the literature.,"OBJECTIVE: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare form of motor neuron disease characterised by UMN degeneration leading to slowly progressive spasticity. Whether it is a separate disease or a subtype of ALS has been debated. In ALS comorbid frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is frequently seen (±15%). However, cognitive and behavioural changes are generally not considered to be a part of PLS.
METHODS: To report the clinical findings and frequency of PLS patients that developed FTD in a referral-based cohort and provide an overview of the literature.
RESULTS: In our cohort six out of 181 (3.3%) PLS patients developed FTD. In the literature a few cases of PLS with FTD have been reported and only a limited number of small studies have investigated cognition in PLS. However, when these studies are summarised a pattern emerges with FTD diagnoses in ±2% and frontotemporal impairment in 22% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PLS is part of the FTD-MND continuum and would favour viewing it as a subtype of ALS. It is, however, not a restricted (isolated UMN involvement) phenotype.","['de Vries BS', 'Rustemeijer LMM', 'van der Kooi AJ', 'Raaphorst J', 'Schröder CD', 'Nijboer TCW', 'Hendrikse J', 'Veldink JH', 'van den Berg LH', 'van Es MA']",2017,18,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"de Vries BS, et al.

28727213,Farming and incidence of motor neuron disease: French nationwide study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association of farming with motor neuron disease (MND) is unclear, with conflicting studies. We performed a French nationwide study of the association of farming with MND incidence, and compared findings with those for Parkinson's disease (PD), which has been shown to be more frequent in farmers.
METHODS: We used the French national health insurance and hospital discharge databases to identify MND/PD incident cases. The Mutualité Sociale Agricole (MSA) guarantees health insurance for farmers and agricultural workers. We compared the incidence of MND (2010-2014) and PD (2011-2012) in MSA farmers, MSA workers and non-MSA affiliates, and estimated relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used for external smoking adjustment.
RESULTS: Analyses relied on 8931 MND (MSA, 9%) and 45 409 PD (MSA,11%) cases. There was a trend towards higher MND incidence in MSA farmers compared with non-MSA affiliates (RR,1.08; 95% CI,0.99-1.18) and MSA workers (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.31) that strengthened after smoking adjustment (if associated with MND). PD incidence was higher in MSA farmers than non-MSA affiliates (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.17) and MSA workers (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18); this association remained after smoking adjustment (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.14).
CONCLUSIONS: This French nationwide study suggested an association between farming and MND, and confirmed higher PD incidence in farmers in France, a country with high pesticide use.","['Kab S', 'Moisan F', 'Elbaz A']",2017,24,9,Eur J Neurol,"Kab S, et al.

TDP-43 is involved in so many cellular processes that perturbation of protein homeostasis can lead to countless downstream effects. Understanding what leads to this disease-related protein imbalance and the resulting cellular and molecular effects will help to develop targets for disease intervention, whether it be prevention of protein accumulation, or addressing a secondary effect of protein accumulation. Here we review the current literature of TDP-43 and TDP-43 pathologies, the effects of TDP-43 overexpression and disruption of synaptic proteins through its binding of messenger RNA, leading to synaptic dysfunction. This review highlights some of the still-limited knowledge of the protein TDP-43 and how it can contribute to disease.","['Heyburn L', 'Moussa CE']",2017,83,,Mol Cell Neurosci,Heyburn L and Moussa CE.

Enteral tube feeding can benefit these patients but side effects including fullness, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation are frequent and can lead to non-compliance. Changes in feed formulation, regimens and the use of prokinetic medication can help symptoms. We describe a case where the use of gastric pressure relief bags during enteral feeding improved symptoms of bloating in a hospice inpatient with MND. Symptoms recurred when these were not used, which were only partially relieved by manual venting of the gastrostomy tube. We suggest that this simple, non-pharmacological approach to bloating may provide opportunities for symptom relief in the palliative care setting.","['Phippen A', 'Brennan E', 'Ealing J', 'Kay S', 'Waterman D']",2017,7,3,BMJ Support Palliat Care,"Phippen A, et al.

We enrolled 19 C9orf72 and 67 disease severity-matched sporadic MND patients, and 22 controls. Sporadic cases were grouped in patients with: no cognitive/behavioral deficits (sporadic-motor); same patterns of cognitive/behavioral impairment as C9orf72 cases (sporadic-cognitive); shorter disease duration versus other sporadic groups (sporadic-early). C9orf72 patients showed cerebellar and thalamic atrophy versus all sporadic cases. All MND patients showed motor, frontal, and temporoparietal cortical thinning and motor and extramotor white matter damage versus controls, independent of genotype and presence of cognitive impairment. Compared with sporadic-early, C9orf72 patients revealed an occipital cortical thinning. C9orf72 patients had enhanced visual network functional connectivity versus sporadic-motor and sporadic-early cases. Structural cerebellar and thalamic damage and posterior cortical alterations are the brain magnetic resonance imaging signatures of C9orf72 MND. Frontotemporal cortical and widespread white matter involvement are likely to be an effect of the disease evolution rather than a C9orf72 marker.","['Agosta F', 'Ferraro PM', 'Riva N', 'Spinelli EG', 'Domi T', 'Carrera P', 'Copetti M', 'Falzone Y', 'Ferrari M', 'Lunetta C', 'Comi G', 'Falini A', 'Quattrini A', 'Filippi M']",2017,57,,Neurobiol Aging,"Agosta F, et al.

28664472,Trends in Research Literature Describing Dysphagia in Motor Neuron Diseases (MND): A Scoping Review.,"Dysphagia in motor neuron diseases (MNDs) is highly complex, affecting all stages of swallowing and leading to impaired swallowing safety and efficiency. In order to explore the degree to which research is capturing the symptom of dysphagia in MND, we conducted a scoping review of the existing literature. The primary aims of this review were to identify common themes within the literature on dysphagia in MND, explore patterns and trends in research focus, and identify if any imbalances exist between the research themes related to dysphagia description and management. A comprehensive search strategy yielded 1690 unique articles for review. Following relevance screening, a total of 157 articles were included in the synthesis. Relevant data and keywords were extracted from each article and grouped into themes. Frequency estimates were calculated for each theme to identify trends across research literature. Swallowing impairment in MNDs is described in a variety of ways across current research. The most commonly reported theme was Aspiration/Penetration, mentioned in 73.2% of all included articles; a significant imbalance was identified between reports of swallowing safety and efficiency (p = 0.008). The most frequently reported theme related to dysphagia management was Enteral Nutrition, and very few studies have reported on the efficacy of Rehabilitation/Compensatory recommendations. It is suggested that researchers and clinicians remain mindful of imbalances and gaps in research, and aim to characterize dysphagia in MNDs in a comprehensive manner. Further research investigating discrete, measureable changes in swallowing pathophysiology would be beneficial to delineate the key factors contributing to impaired swallowing safety and efficiency.","['Waito AA', 'Valenzano TJ', 'Peladeau-Pigeon M', 'Steele CM']",2017,32,6,Dysphagia,"Waito AA, et al.

28651750,Reduced orexin immunoreactivity in Perry syndrome and multiple system atrophy.,"INTRODUCTION: Orexin is a neuropeptide that plays a key role in maintaining a state of arousal, and possibly associates with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). Reduced orexin immunoreactivity has been reported in various neurologic conditions such as narcolepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA); however, there has been no report investigating orexin in Perry syndrome, a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease characterized by four clinical cardinal signs (parkinsonism, depression/apathy, weight loss, and central hypoventilation). Perry syndrome patients frequently have sleep disturbances, including SAS and insomnia.
METHODS: We evaluated orexin immunoreactivity in Perry syndrome. Using imaging analysis, we quantitatively assessed orexin immunoreactivity in the nucleus basalis of Meynert in three Perry syndrome cases, as well as five cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease, five cases of MSA and five age-matched controls. For these cases, antemortem clinical information on sleep disturbances has been reviewed.
RESULTS: In Perry syndrome and MSA, there was reduction of orexin immunoreactivity compared with controls (Perry syndrome: p = 0.020, MSA: p < 0.001). In contrast, FTLD-MND did not have significant reduction of orexin immunoreactivity. Two out of three cases of Perry syndrome had SAS confirmed by polysomnography.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report assessing orexin immunoreactivity in Perry syndrome, and it showed significant reduction, similar to select neurodegenerative diseases, such as MSA. Further analysis with more cases will be needed to elucidate the specific mechanism of orexin loss in these disorders.","['Mishima T', 'Kasanuki K', 'Koga S', 'Castanedes-Casey M', 'Wszolek ZK', 'Tsuboi Y', 'Dickson DW']",2017,42,,Parkinsonism Relat Disord,"Mishima T, et al.

28642865,Spinal Muscular Atrophy: From Defective Chaperoning of snRNP Assembly to Neuromuscular Dysfunction.,"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder that results from decreased levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN is part of a multiprotein complex that also includes Gemins 2-8 and Unrip. The SMN-Gemins complex cooperates with the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) complex, whose constituents include WD45, PRMT5 and pICln. Both complexes function as molecular chaperones, interacting with and assisting in the assembly of an Sm protein core onto small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) to generate small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are the operating components of the spliceosome. Molecular and structural studies have refined our knowledge of the key events taking place within the crowded environment of cells and the numerous precautions undertaken to ensure the faithful assembly of snRNPs. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether a loss of chaperoning in snRNP assembly, considered as a ""housekeeping"" activity, is responsible for the selective neuromuscular phenotype in SMA. This review thus shines light on ","['Lanfranco M', 'Vassallo N', 'Cauchi RJ']",2017,4,,Front Mol Biosci,"Lanfranco M, et al.

28634653,"Assessing the Combined Toxicity of BMAA and Its Isomers 2,4-DAB and AEG In Vitro Using Human Neuroblastoma Cells.","The non-protein amino acid (NPAA) ß-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is produced by a diverse range of cyanobacteria, diatoms and dinoflagellates, and is present in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems globally. Exposure to BMAA has been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). BMAA is often found in nature along with its structural isomers 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB) and aminoethylglycine (AEG); however, the toxicity of these NPAAs in combination has not been examined. We have previously demonstrated that BMAA induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and increases caspase and cathepsin activity in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), effects consistent with proteotoxic stress due to disturbances in protein synthesis, folding or turnover. The current study investigates whether 2,4-DAB and AEG share a similar mechanism of toxicity to BMAA, and if simultaneous exposure of cells to BMAA and its isomers results in increased toxicity in vitro. We show that a 48-h treatment with both 500 μM BMAA and 2,4-DAB decreases cell viability in vitro whereas AEG was not cytotoxic under the same conditions. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 2,4-DAB did not increase expression of ER stress markers. Combined treatment of cells with BMAA and 2,4-DAB resulted in increased caspase activity and increased apoptosis above that of BMAA or 2,4-DAB on their own. These results suggest that 2,4-DAB does not share the same mechanism of toxicity as BMAA but the presence of 2,4-DAB increases the toxicity of BMAA to human cells in vitro.","['Main BJ', 'Rodgers KJ']",2018,33,1,Neurotox Res,"Main BJ and Rodgers KJ.

The internet provided peer support and information about MND but information could be distressing or unreliable. Participants preferred information from professionals and official organisations. Participants were generally supportive of using of technology to access medical care. Barriers to technology, such as lack of digital literacy skills and upper limb dysfunction, and potential solutions were identified. More challenging barriers included language and cognitive difficulties, and the fear of becoming dependent on technology. Addressing the barriers identified in this research could help pwMND access technology. However, as healthcare delivery becomes more reliant on digital technology, care should be taken to ensure that those who are unable or unwilling to use technology continue to have their needs met in alternative ways.","['Hobson EV', 'Fazal S', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ']",2017,18,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Hobson EV, et al.

28631955,Cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light concentration in motor neuron disease and frontotemporal dementia predicts survival.,"OBJECTIVE: To aid diagnostics, patient stratification and studies seeking to find treatments for the related diseases motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), there is a need to establish a way to assess disease severity and the amount of ongoing neurodegeneration. Previous studies have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NFL) may serve this purpose.
METHODS: We cross-referenced the Swedish mortality registry with the laboratory database at Sahlgrenska University Hospital to produce a dataset of CSF NFL concentrations and mortality information for 715 MND patients, 87 FTD patients, and 107 healthy controls. Biomarker concentrations were analysed in relation to recorded cause of death and time of death.
RESULTS: MND patients had significantly higher CSF NFL concentrations than FTD patients. Both groups had significantly higher concentrations than the healthy controls (mean 709% increase in MND and 307% increase in FTD). Higher concentrations of CSF NFL were associated with shorter survival in both MND and FTD.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study strengthen the notion of CSF NFL as a useful tool for determining disease intensity in MND and FTD patients. Further studies in patient cohorts with clinically subtyped and genetically classified diagnoses are needed.","['Skillbäck T', 'Mattsson N', 'Blennow K', 'Zetterberg H']",2017,18,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Skillbäck T, et al.

The clinical phenotype is characterized by loss of motor neurons (MNs), muscular weakness and atrophy eventually leading to paralysis and death due to respiratory failure within 3-5 years after disease onset. No effective treatment or cure is currently available that halts or reverses ALS and MND except FDA approved drug riluzole that only modestly slows the progression of ALS in some patients.

We sought to examine the AEs following placebo administration in placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials (RCTs) for motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: After a systematic literature search for RCTs for MND pharmacotherapy treatments, we assessed the number of discontinuations because of placebo intolerance.
RESULTS: Data were extracted from 12 RCTs fulfilling our search criteria. Approximately eight in 10 placebo-treated patients (78.3%, 95% CI 74.3-82.0%) reported at least one AE and approximately one in 12 placebo-treated patients discontinued placebo treatment because of AEs (8.4%, 95% CI 6.7-10.4%). All patients participating in the MND trials reported similar AEs independently of the study arm to which they belonged.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates significant nocebo in trials for MND treatment, adversely affecting adherence and efficacy of current treatments in clinical practice, with additional implications for trial design.","['Shafiq F', 'Mitsikostas DD', 'Zis P']",2017,18,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Shafiq F, et al.

Recent advances in gene discovery have led to a pressing need to better understand the implications of predictive genetic testing. Here we review the uptake of genetic counselling, predictive and reproductive testing, and the factors that impact the decision to undergo testing, for consideration in clinical practice. The literature suggests that the factors impacting the decision to undergo testing are complex due to the nature of these diseases, absence of available preventative medical treatment and variable age of onset in mutation carriers.

A cure is yet to be found, and a single disease-modifying treatment has had a modest effect in slowing disease progression. Specialized multidisciplinary ALS care has been shown to extend survival and improve patients' quality of life, by providing coordinated interprofessional care that seeks to address the complex needs of this patient group. This review examines the nature of specialized multidisciplinary care in ALS and draws on a broad range of evidence that has shaped current practice. The authors explain how multidisciplinary ALS care is delivered. The existing models of care, the role of palliative care within multidisciplinary ALS care, and the costs of formal and informal care are examined. Critical issues of ALS care are then discussed in the context of the support rendered by multidisciplinary-based care. The authors situate the patient and family as key stakeholders and decision makers in the multidisciplinary care network. Finally, the current challenges to the delivery of coordinated interprofessional care in ALS are explored, and the future of coordinated interprofessional care for people with ALS and their family caregivers is considered.","['Hogden A', 'Foley G', 'Henderson RD', 'James N', 'Aoun SM']",2017,10,,J Multidiscip Healthc,"Hogden A, et al.

28566149,Clinical profile of motor neuron disease patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and neurogenic bladder.,"INTRODUCTION: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are frequent in motor neuron disease (MND) patients, but clinical factors related to them are unknown. We describe differences in LUTS among MND phenotypes and their relationship with other clinical characteristics, including prognosis.
METHODS: For this study, we collected clinical data of a previously published cohort of patients diagnosed with classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (cALS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) or primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) with and without LUTS. Familial history was recorded and the C9ORF72 expansion was analysed in the entire cohort. Patients were followed-up for survival until August 2016.
RESULTS: Fifty-five ALS patients (37 cALS, 10 PMA and 8 PLS) were recruited. Twenty-four reported LUTS and neurogenic bladder (NB) could be demonstrated in nine of them. LUTS were not influenced by age, phenotype, disability, cognitive or behavioural impairment, or disease progression, but female sex appeared to be a protective factor (OR=0.39, p=0.06). Neither family history nor the C9ORF72 expansion was linked to LUTS or NB. In the multivariate analysis, patients reporting LUTS early in the disease course tended to show poorer survival.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, LUTS appear to be more frequent in male MND patients, but are not related to age, clinical or genetic characteristics. When reported early, LUTS could be a sign of rapid disease spread and poor prognosis. Further prospective longitudinal and neuroimaging studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis.","['Vázquez-Costa JF', 'Arlandis S', 'Hervas D', 'Martínez-Cuenca E', 'Cardona F', 'Pérez-Tur J', 'Broseta E', 'Sevilla T']",2017,378,,J Neurol Sci,"Vázquez-Costa JF, et al.

28523551,Epigenetic Mechanisms of Gene Regulation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Despite being clinically described 150 years ago, the mechanisms underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis have not yet been fully understood. Studies in both animal models of ALS and human patients reveal a plethora of alterations such as increased glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, redox stress, increased apoptosis, defective axonal transport, protein-misfolding events, mitochondrial impairment and sustained unregulated immune responses. Regardless of being sporadic or familiar ALS, the final outcome at the cellular level is the death of upper and lower motor neurons, and once diagnosed, ALS is typically lethal within the next 5 years. There are neither clear biomarkers nor therapeutic or disease-modifying treatments for ALS.Accumulating evidence supports the concept that epigenetic-driven modifications, including altered chromatin remodelling events, RNA editing and non-coding RNA molecules, might shed light into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying sporadic/familiar ALS onset and/or severity to facilitate the identification of effective therapies, early diagnosis and potentially early-stage therapeutic interventions to increase the survival outcome of ALS patients.","['Jimenez-Pacheco A', 'Franco JM', 'Lopez S', 'Gomez-Zumaquero JM', 'Magdalena Leal-Lasarte M', 'Caballero-Hernandez DE', 'Cejudo-Guillén M', 'Pozo D']",2017,978,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Jimenez-Pacheco A, et al.

28482893,Decision-making and referral processes for patients with motor neurone disease: a qualitative study of GP experiences and evaluation of a new decision-support tool.,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of motor neurone disease (MND) is known to be challenging and there may be delay in patients receiving a correct diagnosis. This study investigated the referral process for patients who had been diagnosed with MND, and whether a newly-developed tool (The Red Flags checklist) might help General Practitioners (GPs) in making referral decisions.
METHODS: We carried out interviews with GPs who had recently referred a patient diagnosed with MND, and interviews/surveys with GPs who had not recently referred a patient with suspected MND. We collected data before the Red Flags checklist was introduced; and again one year later. We analysed the data to identify key recurring themes.
RESULTS: Forty two GPs took part in the study. The presence of fasciculation was the clinical feature that most commonly led to consideration of a potential MND diagnosis. GPs perceived that their role was to make onward referrals rather than attempting to make a diagnosis, and delays in correct diagnosis tended to occur at the specialist level. A quarter of participants had some awareness of the newly-developed tool; most considered it useful, if incorporated into existing systems.
CONCLUSIONS: While fasciculation is the most common symptom associated with MND, other bulbar, limb or respiratory features, together with progression should be considered. There is a need for further research into how decision-support tools should be designed and provided, in order to best assist GPs with referral decisions. There is also a need for further work at the level of secondary care, in order that referrals made are re-directed appropriately.","['Baxter S', 'McDermott CJ']",2017,17,1,BMC Health Serv Res,Baxter S and McDermott CJ.

Early diagnosis permit to set up immediately adapted treatment and cares. Available diagnostic criteria are based on the detection of both central and peripheral motor neuron injury in bulbar, cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions. Electrodiagnostic (EDX) tests are the key tools to identify peripheral motor neuron involvement. Needle examination records abnormal activities at rest, and looks for neurogenic pattern during muscle contraction. Motor unit potentials morphology is modified primary to recruitment. Motor evoked potentials remain the test of choice to identify impairment of central motor neurons. In the absence of diagnostic biomarker of ALS and among essential investigations of suspected MND, a careful clinical and neurophysiological work-up is essential to rule out the differential diagnosis.","['Lenglet T', 'Camdessanché JP']",2017,173,5,Rev Neurol (Paris),Lenglet T and Camdessanché JP.

28446118,Motor neurone disease: progress and challenges.,"Major progress has been made over the past decade in the understanding of motor neurone disease (MND), changing the landscape of this complex disease. Through identifying positive prognostic factors, new evidence-based standards of care have been established that improve patient survival, reduce burden of disease for patients and their carers, and enhance quality of life. These factors include early management of respiratory dysfunction with non-invasive ventilation, maintenance of weight and nutritional status, as well as instigation of a multidisciplinary team including neurologists, general practitioners and allied health professionals. Advances in technology have enhanced our understanding of the genetic architecture of MND considerably, with implications for patients, their families and clinicians. Recognition of extra-motor involvement, particularly cognitive dysfunction, has identified a spectrum of disease from MND through to frontotemporal dementia. Although riluzole remains the only disease-modifying medication available in clinical practice in Australia, several new therapies are undergoing clinical trials nationally and globally, representing a shift in treatment paradigms. Successful translation of this clinical research through growth in community funding, awareness and national MND research organisations has laid the foundation for closing the research-practice gap on this debilitating disease. In this review, we highlight these recent developments, which have transformed treatment, augmented novel therapeutic platforms, and established a nexus between research and the MND community. This era of change is of significant relevance to both specialists and general practitioners who remain integral to the care of patients with MND.","['Dharmadasa T', 'Henderson RD', 'Talman PS', 'Macdonell RA', 'Mathers S', 'Schultz DW', 'Needham M', 'Zoing M', 'Vucic S', 'Kiernan MC']",2017,206,8,Med J Aust,"Dharmadasa T, et al.

METHODS: To describe the core clinical features of a syndrome of MND associated with downbeat nystagmus, clinical features were collected from 6 patients.
RESULTS: All patients had slowly progressive muscle weakness and wasting in combination with downbeat nystagmus, which was clinically most obvious in downward and lateral gaze. Onset was in the second to fourth decade with finger extension weakness, progressing to other distal and sometimes more proximal muscles. Visual complaints were not always present. Electrodiagnostic testing showed signs of regional motor axonal loss in all patients.
DISCUSSION: The etiology of this syndrome remains elusive. Because finger extension weakness and downbeat nystagmus are the discriminating clinical features of this MND, we propose the name FEWDON-MND syndrome.

METHODS: We reviewed the final diagnosis of all patients prospectively registered in the Sant Pau-MND register from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2015. A detailed clinical evaluation and a clinically-guided electrophysiological study were performed at first evaluation.
RESULTS: Twenty of 314 (6.4%) patients included were re-diagnosed as having a condition other than ALS, in 18 cases already at first evaluation. An alternative specific diagnosis was identified in 17 of those 20, consisting of a wide range of conditions. The main finding leading to an alternative diagnosis was the result of the electrophysiological study. Fifty per cent did not fulfil the El Escorial revised criteria (EECr) for ALS. The most common clinical phenotype at onset in patients with ALS mimic syndromes was progressive muscular atrophy (PMA).
CONCLUSIONS: Misdiagnosing ALS is still a common problem. Early identification of ALS mimic syndromes is possible based on atypical clinical features and a clinically-guided electrophysiological study. Patients should be attended in specialised centres. The application of EECr helps to identify ALS misdiagnoses.","['Cortés-Vicente E', 'Pradas J', 'Marín-Lahoz J', 'De Luna N', 'Clarimón J', 'Turon-Sans J', 'Gelpí E', 'Díaz-Manera J', 'Illa I', 'Rojas-Garcia R']",2017,18,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Cortés-Vicente E, et al.

Heterogeneous ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs) maintain RNA metabolism and changes in their function may underpin the pathogenesis of FTLD. Immunostaining for hnRNP A1, A2/B1 and A3 was performed on sections of temporal cortex with hippocampus from 61 patients with FTLD, stratified by pathological hallmarks into FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP type A, B and C subtypes, and by genetics into patients with C9orf72 expansions, MAPT or GRN mutations, or those without known mutation. Four patients with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) with C9orf72 expansions and 10 healthy controls were also studied. Semi-quantitative analysis assessed hnRNP staining intensity in dentate gyrus (DG) and CA4 region of hippocampus, and temporal cortex (Tcx) in the different pathological and genetic groups.Immunostaining for hnRNP A1, A2/B1 and A3 revealed no consistent changes in pattern or amount of physiological staining across any of the pathological or genetic groups. No immunostaining of any inclusions resembling TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions or dystrophic neurites, was seen in either Tcx or DG of the hippocampus in any of the FTLD cases investigated for hnRNP A1, A2/B1 and A3. However, immunostaining for hnRNP A3 showed that inclusion bodies, resembling those TDP-43 negative, p62-immunopositive structures containing dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR) were variably observed in hippocampus and cerebellum. The proportion of cases showing hnRNP A3-immunoreactive DPR, and the number of hnRNP A3-positive inclusions within cases, was significantly greater in DG than in cells of CA4 region and cerebellum, but the latter was significantly less in all three regions compared to that detected by p62 immunostaining.","['Davidson YS', 'Flood L', 'Robinson AC', 'Nihei Y', 'Mori K', 'Rollinson S', 'Richardson A', 'Benson BC', 'Jones M', 'Snowden JS', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Haass C', 'Lashley T', 'Mann DMA']",2017,5,1,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Davidson YS, et al.

28393008,An unusual cause of ventilatory failure in motor neurone disease.,"A patient previously diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) and gastrostomy-fed was under surveillance for ventilatory decline via our respiratory centre. At a planned review she was found to be hypercapnic, which would usually prompt an offer of non-invasive ventilation for home use. However, she was alkalotic and not acidotic as we might expect. Her serum potassium was checked urgently and confirmed as low. It was established that the community team had prescribed a feeding regime with insufficient potassium. Correction of hypokalaemia resolved her ventilatory failure. This case demonstrates the importance of co-ordinated care in the management of patients with MND.","['Valsamis EM', 'Smith I', 'De Sousa A']",2017,21,,Respir Med Case Rep,"Valsamis EM, et al.

28387447,WITHDRAWN: Interventions for fatigue and weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness.,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue and unintentional weight loss are two of the commonest symptoms experienced by people with advanced progressive illness. Appropriate interventions may bring considerable improvements in function and quality of life to seriously ill people and their families, reducing physical, psychological and spiritual distress.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct an overview of the evidence available on the efficacy of interventions used in the management of fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness by reviewing the evidence contained within Cochrane reviews.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) for all systematic reviews evaluating any interventions for the management of fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 8). We reviewed titles of interest by abstract. Where the relevance of a review remained unclear we reached a consensus regarding the relevance of the participant group and the outcome measures to the overview. Two overview authors extracted the data independently using a data extraction form. We used the measurement tool AMSTAR (Assessment of Multiple SysTemAtic Reviews) to assess the methodological quality of each systematic review.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 27 systematic reviews (302 studies with 31,833 participants) in the overview. None of the included systematic reviews reported quantitative data on the efficacy of interventions to manage fatigue or weight loss specific to people with advanced progressive illness. All of the included reviews apart from one were deemed of high methodological quality. For the remaining review we were unable to ascertain the methodological quality of the research strategy as it was described. None of the systematic reviews adequately described whether conflict of interests were present within the included studies. Management of fatigueAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) - we identified one systematic review (two studies and 52 participants); the intervention was exercise.Cancer - we identified five systematic reviews (116 studies with 17,342 participants); the pharmacological interventions were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and any drug therapy for the management of cancer-related fatigue and the non pharmacological interventions were exercise, interventions by breast care nurses and psychosocial interventions.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - we identified three systematic reviews (59 studies and 4048 participants); the interventions were self management education programmes, nutritional support and pulmonary rehabilitation.Cystic fibrosis - we identified one systematic review (nine studies and 833 participants); the intervention was physical training.Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) - we identified two systematic reviews (21 studies and 748 participants); the interventions were progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise.Multiple sclerosis (MS) - we identified five systematic reviews (23 studies and 1502 participants); the pharmacological interventions were amantadine and carnitine. The non pharmacological interventions were diet, exercise and occupational therapy.Mixed conditions in advanced stages of illness - we identified one systematic review (five studies and 453 participants); the intervention was medically assisted hydration. Management of weight lossALS/MND - we identified one systematic review but no studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review; the intervention was enteral tube feeding.Cancer - we identified three systematic reviews with a fourth systematic review also containing extractable data on cancer (66 studies and 5601 participants); the pharmacological interventions were megestrol acetate and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (this systematic review is also included in the cancer fatigue section above). The non pharmacological interventions were enteral tube feeding and non invasive interventions for patients with lung cancer.COPD - we identified one systematic review (59 studies and 4048 participants); the intervention was nutritional support. This systematic review is also included in the COPD fatigue section.Cystic fibrosis - we identified two systematic reviews (three studies and 131 participants); the interventions were enteral tube feeding and oral calorie supplements.HIV/AIDS - we identified four systematic reviews (42 studies and 2071 participants); the pharmacological intervention was anabolic steroids. The non pharmacological interventions were nutritional interventions, progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise. Both of the systematic reviews on exercise interventions were also included in the HIV/AIDS fatigue section.MS - we found no systematic reviews which considered interventions to manage unintentional weight loss for people with a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis at any stage of illness.Mixed conditions in advanced stages of illness - we identified two systematic reviews (32 studies and 4826 participants); the interventions were megestrol acetate and medically assisted nutrition.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of robust evidence for interventions to manage fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in the advanced stage of progressive illnesses such as advanced cancer, heart failure, lung failure, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia and AIDS. The evidence contained within this overview provides some insight into interventions which may prove of benefit within this population such as exercise, some pharmacological treatments and support for self management.Researchers could improve the methodological quality of future studies by blinding of outcome assessors. Adopting uniform reporting mechanisms for fatigue and weight loss outcome measures would also allow the opportunity for meta-analysis of small studies.Researchers could also improve the applicability of recommendations for interventions to manage fatigue and unintentional weight loss in advanced progressive illness by including subgroup analysis of this population within systematic reviews of applicable interventions.More research is required to ascertain the best interventions to manage fatigue and/or weight loss in advanced illness. There is a need for standardised reporting of these symptoms and agreement amongst researchers of the minimum duration of studies and minimum percentage change in symptom experience that proves the benefits of an intervention. There are, however, challenges in providing meaningful outcome measurements against a background of deteriorating health through disease progression. Interventions to manage these symptoms must also be mindful of the impact on quality of life and should be focused on patient-orientated rather than purely disease-orientated experiences for patients. Systematic reviews and primary intervention studies should include the impact of the interventions on standardised validated quality of life measures.","['Payne C', 'Wiffen PJ', 'Martin S']",2017,4,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Payne C, et al.

28387141,Nationwide incidence of motor neuron disease using the French health insurance information system database.,"OBJECTIVE: There are no estimates of the nationwide incidence of motor neuron disease (MND) in France. We used the French health insurance information system to identify incident MND cases (2012-2014), and compared incidence figures to those from three external sources.
METHODS: We identified incident MND cases (2012-2014) based on three data sources (riluzole claims, hospitalisation records, long-term chronic disease benefits), and computed MND incidence by age, gender, and geographic region. We used French mortality statistics, Limousin ALS registry data, and previous European studies based on administrative databases to perform external comparisons.
RESULTS: We identified 6553 MND incident cases. After standardisation to the United States 2010 population, the age/gender-standardised incidence was 2.72/100,000 person-years (males, 3.37; females, 2.17; male:female ratio = 1.53, 95% CI1.46-1.61). There was no major spatial difference in MND distribution. Our data were in agreement with the French death database (standardised mortality ratio = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.96-1.06) and Limousin ALS registry (standardised incidence ratio = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.72-1.15). Incidence estimates were in the same range as those from previous studies.
CONCLUSIONS: We report French nationwide incidence estimates of MND. Administrative databases including hospital discharge data and riluzole claims offer an interesting approach to identify large population-based samples of patients with MND for epidemiologic studies and surveillance.","['Kab S', 'Moisan F', 'Preux PM', 'Marin B', 'Elbaz A']",2017,18,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Kab S, et al.

This literature review aims at summarising and discussing current knowledge about emergencies in MNDs. Emergencies that have been reported in MND patients include: respiratory, bulbar, cardiac, septic, epileptic, psychiatric, pain-related, and traumatic emergencies. Emergencies due to respiratory insufficiency have the strongest impact on morbidity and mortality in MNDs. To optimise the management of emergencies in MNDs, it is recommended to discuss these topics with the patient prior to their occurrence. After informed consent, patients may indicate their decision by signing an advance directive as to how such emergencies should be managed in case they arise. Generally, treatment of emergencies in MNDs is not at variance from treatment of similar emergencies due to other causes, but some peculiarities need to be pointed out. It is concluded that patients with MNDs may experience various emergencies during the disease course. Management of these conditions should be discussed with the patient prior to their appearance. Management of these emergencies follows general guidelines, which widely vary between countries, and depend on the availability of a patient's advance directive.","['Finsterer J', 'Stöllberger C']",2017,12,5,Intern Emerg Med,Finsterer J and Stöllberger C.

28245254,Accuracy of routinely-collected healthcare data for identifying motor neurone disease cases: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare neurodegenerative condition, with poorly understood aetiology. Large, population-based, prospective cohorts will enable powerful studies of the determinants of MND, provided identification of disease cases is sufficiently accurate. Follow-up in many such studies relies on linkage to routinely-collected health datasets. We systematically evaluated the accuracy of such datasets in identifying MND cases.
METHODS: We performed an electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science for studies published between 01/01/1990-16/11/2015 that compared MND cases identified in routinely-collected, coded datasets to a reference standard. We recorded study characteristics and two key measures of diagnostic accuracy-positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. We conducted descriptive analyses and quality assessments of included studies.
RESULTS: Thirteen eligible studies provided 13 estimates of PPV and five estimates of sensitivity. Twelve studies assessed hospital and/or death certificate-derived datasets; one evaluated a primary care dataset. All studies were from high income countries (UK, Europe, USA, Hong Kong). Study methods varied widely, but quality was generally good. PPV estimates ranged from 55-92% and sensitivities from 75-93%. The single (UK-based) study of primary care data reported a PPV of 85%.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic accuracy of routinely-collected health datasets is likely to be sufficient for identifying cases of MND in large-scale prospective epidemiological studies in high income country settings. Primary care datasets, particularly from countries with a widely-accessible national healthcare system, are potentially valuable data sources warranting further investigation.","['Horrocks S', 'Wilkinson T', 'Schnier C', 'Ly A', 'Woodfield R', 'Rannikmäe K', 'Quinn TJ', 'Sudlow CL']",2017,12,2,PLoS One,"Horrocks S, et al.

28235672,Neurobiology of axonal transport defects in motor neuron diseases: Opportunities for translational research?,"Intracellular trafficking of cargoes is an essential process to maintain the structure and function of all mammalian cell types, but especially of neurons because of their extreme axon/dendrite polarisation. Axonal transport mediates the movement of cargoes such as proteins, mRNA, lipids, membrane-bound vesicles and organelles that are mostly synthesised in the cell body and in doing so is responsible for their correct spatiotemporal distribution in the axon, for example at specialised sites such as nodes of Ranvier and synaptic terminals. In addition, axonal transport maintains the essential long-distance communication between the cell body and synaptic terminals that allows neurons to react to their surroundings via trafficking of for example signalling endosomes. Axonal transport defects are a common observation in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, and mutations in components of the axonal transport machinery have unequivocally shown that impaired axonal transport can cause neurodegeneration (reviewed in El-Kadi et al., 2007, De Vos et al., 2008; Millecamps and Julien, 2013). Here we review our current understanding of axonal transport defects and the role they play in motor neuron diseases (MNDs) with a specific focus on the most common form of MND, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).","['De Vos KJ', 'Hafezparast M']",2017,105,,Neurobiol Dis,De Vos KJ and Hafezparast M.

28226395,Healthcare professionals' accounts of challenges in managing motor neurone disease in primary healthcare: a qualitative study.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurological disease causing muscle wasting, gradual paralysis and respiratory failure, with a life expectancy of 2-4 years. In order to better understand how MND is managed in the community, we conducted a qualitative study to explore the challenges healthcare professionals encounter when managing MND in primary healthcare. Based on data from 15 semi-structured interviews with primary healthcare professionals in Norway, we found that MND is viewed as a condition that requires exceptional effort and detailed planning. Healthcare professionals reported five main challenges in managing MND in primary healthcare: (i) building relationships with those giving and receiving care in the home; (ii) preventing caregiver burnout and breakdown; (iii) providing tailored care; (iv) ensuring good working conditions in patients' homes; and (v) recruiting and retaining qualified nursing assistants. Healthcare professionals reported needing working conditions that allow them to tailor their approach to the personal, emotional and existential nature of care preferences of those living with MND. However, people with MND and their families were sometimes perceived by healthcare professionals to prefer a strictly task-focused relationship with care providers. Such relationships limited the healthcare professionals' control over the MND trajectory and their capacity to prevent family caregiver burnout and breakdown. Adequate resources, along with training and support of nursing assistants, may increase the continuity of nursing assistants. Responsiveness to patient and family needs may enhance collaboration and promote tailored primary care and support for patients with MND and their families.","['Lerum SV', 'Solbraekke KN', 'Frich JC']",2017,25,4,Health Soc Care Community,"Lerum SV, et al.

28089419,Risk factors for respiratory failure of motor neuron disease in a multiracial Asian population.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a devastating degenerative disorder. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is the most common and severe form of MND. Respiratory failure arising from ventilator musculature atrophy is the most common cause of death for ALS patients. Exploring the factors correlated with respiratory failure can contribute to disease management.
PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical features of MND and determine the factors that may affect respiratory failure of MND patients.
METHODS: The case records of all MND patients seen in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) between January 2004 and December 2014 were examined. Demographic, clinical information were collected by reviewing case records. Mortality data, if not available from records, were obtained via phone call interview of family members. Demographic data and clinical treatments were compared between Respiratory support group and Non-respiratory support group.
RESULTS: There were 73 patients included in our study. 49 (67.1%) patients died during follow-up. The mean age of onset was 58±11.1years. With regard to treatment, 63% needed feeding support, and 42.5% required ventilation aid. The median overall survival was 36months from symptom onset. Chi-square tests showed there was significantly higher percentage of respiratory support needed in Chinese than in other races (P=0.016). Compared with non-feeding support patients, patients with feeding support were more likely to require assisted ventilation (P=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that the need of feeding support is significantly associated with assisted ventilation. Chinese MND patients may be more inclined to require respiratory support.","['Deng X', 'Hao Y', 'Xiao B', 'Tan EK', 'Lo YL']",2017,39,,J Clin Neurosci,"Deng X, et al.

28072907,Symptomatic treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND), which is also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), causes a wide range of symptoms but the evidence base for the effectiveness of the symptomatic treatment therapies is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Systematic Reviews of all symptomatic treatments for MND.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) on 15 November 2016 for systematic reviews of symptomatic treatments for MND. We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables.
MAIN RESULTS: We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data.The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, but it is not clear whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison ""usual activities"", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with ""usual activities"" or ""usual care"" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND.None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas.We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life).","['Ng L', 'Khan F', 'Young CA', 'Galea M']",2017,1,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Ng L, et al.

28067943,Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Imbalance of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and related modulators has been implicated as an important factor in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND). In this context, the role and mechanism of action of gabapentin and baclofen have been extensively investigated, although with conflicting results. This is the first systematic review to assess clinical trials of GABA modulators for the treatment of ALS.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators in delaying the progression of ALS, and to evaluate adverse effects of these interventions
SEARCH METHODS: On 16 August 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and LILACS. In addition, we checked the bibliographies of the trials found in order to identify any other trials, and contacted trial authors to identify relevant unpublished results or additional clinical trials. On 30 August 2016, we searched two clinical trials registries.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTsTypes of participants: adults with a diagnosis of probable or definite ALSTypes of interventions: gabapentin, baclofen, or other GABA modulators compared with placebo, no treatment, or each otherPrimary outcome: survival at one year from study enrollmentSecondary outcomes: individual rate of decline of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), expressed as arm megascore; rate of decline of per cent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC); rate of decline of ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS); health-related quality of life; survival evaluated by pooling hazards; and adverse events DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently checked titles and abstracts identified by the searches. The review authors obtained and independently analyzed original individual participant data from each included study; additional review authors and the Cochrane Neuromuscular Managing Editor checked the outcome data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in included studies.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently checked titles and abstracts identified by the searches. The review authors obtained and independently analyzed original individual participant data from each included study; additional review authors and the Cochrane Neuromuscular Managing Editor checked the outcome data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in included studies.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified two double-blind RCTs of gabapentin treatment in ALS for inclusion in this review. We found no eligible RCTs of baclofen or other GABA modulators. The selected studies were phase II and phase III trials, which lasted six and nine months, respectively. They were highly comparable because both were comparisons of oral gabapentin and placebo, performed by the same investigators. The trials enrolled 355 participants with ALS: 80 in the gabapentin group and 72 in the placebo group in the first (phase II) trial and 101 in the gabapentin group and 102 in the placebo group in the second (phase III) trial. Neither trial was long enough to report survival at one year, which was our primary outcome. We found little or no difference in estimated one-year survival between the treated group and the placebo group (78% versus 77%, P = 0.63 by log-rank test; high-quality evidence). We also found little or no difference in the rate of decline of MVIC expressed as arm megascore, or rate of FVC decline (high-quality evidence). One trial investigated monthly decline in the ALSFRS and quality of life measured using the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) and found little or no difference between groups (moderate-quality evidence). The trials reported similar adverse events. Complaints that were clearly elevated in those taking gabapentin, based on analyses of the combined data, were light-headedness, drowsiness, and limb swelling (high-quality evidence). Fatigue and falls occurred more frequently with gabapentin than with placebo in one trial, but when we combined the data for fatigue from both trials, there was no clear difference between the groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias in the included trials as low.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: According to high-quality evidence, gabapentin is not effective in treating ALS. It does not extend survival, slow the rate of decline of muscle strength, respiratory function and, based on moderate-quality evidence, probably does not improve quality of life or slow monthly decline in the ALSFRS. Other GABA modulators have not been studied in randomized trials.","['Diana A', 'Pillai R', 'Bongioanni P', ""O'Keeffe AG"", 'Miller RG', 'Moore DH']",2017,1,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Diana A, et al.

28054828,Comparison of the King's and MiToS staging systems for ALS.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare two ALS staging systems, King's clinical staging and Milano-Torino (MiToS) functional staging, using data from the LiCALS phase III clinical trial (EudraCT 2008-006891-31).
METHODS: Disease stage was derived retrospectively for each system from the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised subscores using standard methods. The two staging methods were then compared for timing of stages using box plots, correspondence using chi-square tests, agreement using a linearly weighted kappa coefficient and concordance using Spearman's rank correlation.
RESULTS: For both systems, progressively higher stages occurred at progressively later proportions of the disease course, but the distribution differed between the two methods. King's stage 3 corresponded to MiToS stage 1 most frequently, with earlier King's stages 1 and 2 largely corresponding to MiToS stage 0 or 1. The Spearman correlation was 0.54. There was fair agreement between the two systems with kappa coefficient of 0.21.
CONCLUSION: The distribution of timings shows that the two systems are complementary, with King's staging showing greatest resolution in early to mid-disease corresponding to clinical or disease burden, and MiToS staging having higher resolution for late disease, corresponding to functional involvement. We therefore propose using both staging systems when describing ALS.","['Fang T', 'Al Khleifat A', 'Stahl DR', 'Lazo La Torre C', 'Murphy C', 'Uk-Mnd LicalS', 'Young C', 'Shaw PJ', 'Leigh PN', 'Al-Chalabi A']",2017,18,3-4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Fang T, et al.

28019106,Geographic distributions of motor neuron disease mortality and well water use in U.S. counties.,"OBJECTIVE: We recently reported that U.S. mortality rates for motor neuron disease (MND) at the level of the state are associated with well water use. However, data at the state level may not accurately reflect data at the individual level. We therefore examined the association between MND mortality and well water use utilizing data from smaller geographic units that may better reflect exposure and disease at the individual level.
METHODS: We used data on age-adjusted MND mortality rates at the level of the county, obtained from the CDC, and corresponding data on the prevalence of well water use, obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey. Data were analyzed by multivariate linear regression and by Getis-Ord Gi*, a measure of spatial clustering.
RESULTS: Age-adjusted mortality rates for MND in 923 U.S. counties were significantly correlated with the prevalence of well water (p < 0.0001). 'Hot spots' of MND mortality were significantly associated with 'hot spots' of well water use (p < 0.0005).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that an agent present in well water plays an etiologic role in ALS. Further study of water use among individuals with ALS is warranted.","['Schwartz GG', 'Rundquist BC', 'Simon IJ', 'Swartz SE']",2017,18,3-4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Schwartz GG, et al.

28017247,Clinical characteristics of parkinsonism in frontotemporal dementia according to subtypes.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the prevalence of parkinsonism in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) subtypes and the cognitive and behavioral differences between FTD with and without parkinsonism in a well-structured, prospective cohort.
METHODS: One hundred and ninety-one FTD patients were enrolled and all patients underwent comprehensive neurological evaluations, neuropsychological tests, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.
RESULTS: The prevalence of parkinsonism was 38.7% (74 patients), and included 33 (46.5%) behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), 16 (24.2%) semantic dementia (SD), 19 (45.2%) progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and 6 (50%) FTD associated with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). SD patients with parkinsonism had higher CDR sum of boxes scores (9.7±4.5 vs 6.2±4.5, p=0.024), frontal behavioral inventory total score (33.7±20.5 vs 24.3±14.5, p=0.045), and executive function score of frontal executive dysfunction, disinhibition, and apathy (28.9±13.7 vs 19.2±12.9, p=0.021) than those without parkinsonism. Seoul Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score (bvFTD: 23.5±11.7 vs 17.3±11.3, p=0.031, SD: 23.1±11.1 vs 11.3±9.3, p=0.005) was higher for bvFTD and SD with parkinsonism than for those without parkinsonism.
CONCLUSIONS: Parkinsonism is found to be more common in patients with bvFTD, PNFA, and FTD-MND patients than those with SD. Behavioral disturbances were more prominent in SD with parkinsonism than without. Additional studies are needed to determine the pathomechanism and optimal treatment of parkinsonism in different FTD subtypes.","['Park HK', 'Park KH', 'Yoon B', 'Lee JH', 'Choi SH', 'Joung JH', 'Yoon SJ', 'Kim BC', 'Kim SH', 'Kim EJ', 'Na DL', 'Park KW']",2017,372,,J Neurol Sci,"Park HK, et al.

28017202,Family carers' experiences of receiving the news of a diagnosis of Motor Neurone Disease: A national survey.,"Family carers have a central role in the care and support of people with MND and face the challenges of the disease from diagnosis to progression and the multiple losses of MND, but their support needs are often neglected. This study aimed to investigate the experiences of family carers at the time of diagnosis and their satisfaction with receiving the news. An anonymous postal survey was facilitated by all MND Associations in Australia (2014) and 190 family carers completed the questionnaire. The questions centred on the SPIKES protocol for communicating bad news. Two-thirds of family carers rated the skills of their neurologists as above average and were satisfied with the delivery of the diagnosis, in terms of having a significantly longer consultation time, the neurologist being warm and caring, satisfaction with the amount and content of information they received and relevant supports, and a plan for following up support. Conversely those who rated the neurologist's skills as below average commented on the difficulties they encountered and the long term emotional stress engendered by poor communication. The study emphasises previous research that suggested that neurologists may require education and training in communicating the diagnosis and this should include family carers as a vital member in MND care.","['Aoun SM', 'Breen LJ', 'Oliver D', 'Henderson RD', 'Edis R', ""O'Connor M"", 'Howting D', 'Harris R', 'Birks C']",2017,372,,J Neurol Sci,"Aoun SM, et al.

28008946,HtrA2 suppresses autoimmune arthritis and regulates activation of STAT3.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that is related to the induction of T helper (Th)17 cells, which secrete interleukin-17, and activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. The expression of high-temperature requirement protein A (HtrA) 2, a serine protease involved in apoptosis, was decreased in RA patients nonresponsive to drug treatment of RA. The aim of this study was to determine whether overexpression of HtrA2 has a therapeutic effect on RA. Th17 differentiation, osteoclastogenesis, and lymphocyte activation are increased in motor neuron degeneration (mnd)2 mice, which lack HtrA2 activity because of a missense mutation (Ser276Cys) in the protease domain of HtrA2. The inhibitor of HtrA2 also increased Th17 differentiation. On the other hand, HtrA2 induced cleavage of STAT3 and overexpression of HtrA2 attenuated CIA in a mouse model. HtrA2 overexpression inhibited plaque development as well as the differentiation of Th17 in ApoE","['Lee SH', 'Moon YM', 'Seo HB', 'Kim SY', 'Kim EK', 'Yi J', 'Nam MK', 'Min JK', 'Park SH', 'Rhim H', 'Cho ML']",2016,6,,Sci Rep,"Lee SH, et al.

27995822,Factors to consider for motor neurone disease carer intervention research: A narrative literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: The experience of caregiving in the context of motor neurone disease (MND) is extremely challenging. Over the past 15 years, quantitative and qualitative studies have delineated the psychosocial aspects of this experience, exploring its impact on caregivers' quality of life, rates of depression, distress, anxiety, and burden. Our paper aimed to provide an overview of the lived experience of MND caregivers, identifying the variables that can influence MND caregiver functioning that are relevant to the development of an intervention.
METHOD: A narrative review was conducted, synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from 2000 to early 2016.
RESULTS: A total of 37 articles were included in the review. The articles varied considerably in terms of methodology and quality. The main influential aspects reported and identified were factors pertaining to the patient, factors intrinsic to the caregiver, relationship factors, and social support factors.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: There is evidence to support the fact that caregivers have poorer outcomes when they care for patients with a more severe clinical profile, poorer emotional health or neurobehavioral concerns, or when the caregivers themselves struggle with adaptive problem-solving and coping skills. The availability and use of social support are also likely to be important for caregiver psychosocial outcomes. Further investigation is required to clarify the influence of changes in the relationship with the patient. Significant factors affecting the caregiver experience are considered in relation to their amenability to psychosocial intervention. Recommendations are made regarding the optimal features of future psychosocial intervention research.","['Gluyas C', 'Mathers S', 'Hennessy Anderson N', 'Ugalde A']",2017,15,5,Palliat Support Care,"Gluyas C, et al.

27992849,Motor neuron disease mortality and lifetime petrol lead exposure: Evidence from national age-specific and state-level age-standardized death rates in Australia.,"BACKGROUND: The age standardized death rate from motor neuron disease (MND) for persons 40-84 years of age in the Australian States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland increased dramatically from 1958 to 2013. Nationally, age-specific MND death rates also increased over this time period, but the rate of the rise varied considerably by age-group. The historic use of lead (Pb) additives in Australian petrol is a candidate explanation for these trends in MND mortality (International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 G12.2).
METHODS: Leveraging temporal and spatial variation in petrol lead exposure risk resulting from the slow rise and rapid phase-out of lead as a constituent in gasoline in Australia, we analyze relationships between (1) national age-specific MND death rates in Australia and age-specific lifetime petrol lead exposure, (2) annual between-age dispersions in age-specific MND death rates and age-specific lifetime petrol lead exposure; and (3) state-level age-standardized MND death rates as a function of age-weighted lifetime petrol lead exposure.
RESULTS: Other things held equal, we find that a one percent increase in lifetime petrol lead exposure increases the MND death rate by about one-third of one percent in both national age-specific and state-level age-standardized models of MND mortality. Lending support to the supposition that lead exposure is a driver of MND mortality risk, we find that the annual between-age group standard deviation in age-specific MND death rates is strongly correlated with the between-age standard deviation in age-specific lifetime petrol lead exposure.
CONCLUSION: Legacy petrol lead emissions are associated with age-specific MND death rates as well as state-level age-standardized MND death rates in Australia. Results indicate that we are approaching peak lead exposure-attributable MND mortality.","['Zahran S', 'Laidlaw MA', 'Rowe DB', 'Ball AS', 'Mielke HW']",2017,153,,Environ Res,"Zahran S, et al.

27975196,Economic Studies in Motor Neurone Disease: A Systematic Methodological Review.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a devastating condition which greatly diminishes patients' quality of life and limits life expectancy. Health technology appraisals of future interventions in MND need robust data on costs and utilities. Existing economic evaluations have been noted to be limited and fraught with challenges.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and critique methodological aspects of all published economic evaluations, cost studies, and utility studies in MND.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed all relevant published studies in English from 1946 until January 2016, searching the databases of Medline, EMBASE, Econlit, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Economics Evaluation Database (HEED). Key data were extracted and synthesised narratively.
RESULTS: A total of 1830 articles were identified, of which 15 economic evaluations, 23 cost and 3 utility studies were included. Most economic studies focused on riluzole (n = 9). Six studies modelled the progressive decline in motor function using a Markov design but did not include mutually exclusive health states. Cost estimates for a number of evaluations were based on expert opinion and were hampered by high variability and location-specific characteristics. Few cost studies reported disease-stage-specific costs (n = 3) or fully captured indirect costs. Utilities in three studies of MND patients used the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire or standard gamble, but included potentially unrepresentative cohorts and did not consider any health impacts on caregivers.
CONCLUSION: Economic evaluations in MND suffer from significant methodological issues such as a lack of data, uncertainty with the disease course and use of inappropriate modelling framework. Limitations may be addressed through the collection of detailed and representative data from large cohorts of patients.","['Moore A', 'Young CA', 'Hughes DA']",2017,35,4,Pharmacoeconomics,"Moore A, et al.

27956443,Motor neuron disease: biomarker development for an expanding cerebral syndrome.,"Descriptions of motor neuron disease (MND) documented more than a century ago remain instantly recognisable to the physician. The muscle weakness, typically with signs of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, is uniquely relentless. Over the last 30 years, a wider cerebral pathology has emerged, despite the lack of overt cognitive impairment in the majority of patients. From the initial linkage of a small number of cases to mutations in SOD1, diverse cellular pathways have been implicated in pathogenesis. An increasingly complex clinical heterogeneity has emerged around a significant variability in survival. Defining a cellular signature of aggregated TDP-43 common to nearly all MND and a large proportion of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), has placed MND alongside more traditional cerebral neurodegeneration. With new genetic causes, most notably a hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72 associated with both MND and FTD, the development of biomarkers against which to test therapeutic candidates is a priority.",['Turner MR'],2016,16,Suppl 6,Clin Med (Lond),Turner MR.

Etiology and pathogenesis of FTD with MND are still uncertain.
CASE REPORT: A 71-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of progressive muscle weakness and cognitive deficits. We diagnosed this patient as FTD with MND by neurological examination, electromyography, brain imaging and neuro-psychological evaluation. We also confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in this patient as a way to rule out secondary causes of MND.
CONCLUSIONS: This was a very rare case of FTD with MND in APS.

27892707,Is firstly diagnosed ALS really ALS? Results of a population-based study with long-term follow-up.,"OBJECTIVE: To revise the first diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in patients from a well-defined population.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with ALS in the years 1998-2002 and resident of Lombardy Region, Northern Italy were followed until death or April 30 2016 to assess long-term survival. During follow-up, the caring neurologists were asked to confirm the first diagnosis. Revised diagnoses were classified as confirmed and unconfirmed motor neuron disease (MND) with further specification where available. The two groups were compared for age, sex, disease duration at diagnosis, site of onset, and El Escorial category. Survival with predictors were also compared.
RESULTS: Included were 280 men and 203 women aged 18-93 years. During follow-up, 25 cases (5.2%) received a diagnosis different from MND. Diseases of spinal roots and peripheral nerves and vascular encephalopathy predominated. Patients with definite (OR 0.15; 95%CI 0.04-0.52) and probable (OR 0.15; 95%CI 0.04-0.62) ALS were least likely to have an unconfirmed MND diagnosis. At end of follow-up, 2.2% of patients with confirmed MND and 44.0% of patients with unconfirmed MND were reported alive (HR 0.14; 95%CI 0.08-0.25).

OBJECTIVE: Considering that dementia is one of the most frequent non-motor symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and that hippocampus is one of the brain areas with greater presence of amyloid-related changes in neurodegenerative diseases, our aim was to analyze the molecular markers of the amyloid cascade of APP in pathology studies of the hippocampus of autopsied patients with ALS and ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
METHODS: We included nine patients with MND and four controls. Immunohistochemical studies and confocal microscopy were used to analyze the expression of APP, TDP-43, pho-TDP-43, Aβ, APP intracellular cytoplasmatic domain (AICD) peptide, Fe65 protein, and pho-TAU in the hippocampus of seven patients with ALS, two patients with ALS-FTD, and four controls. These findings were correlated with clinical data.
RESULTS: Patients displayed increased expression of APP and Aβ peptide. The latter was correlated with cytoplasmic pho-TDP-43 expression. We also found decreased Fe65 expression. A parallel increase in AICD expression was not found. Patients showed increased expression of pho-TAU in the hippocampus. Findings were similar in patients with ALS and those with ALS-FTD, though more marked in the latter group.
CONCLUSION: Post-mortem analyses showed that the amyloid cascade is activated in the hippocampus of patients with MND and correlated with cytoplasmic pho-TDP-43 expression. The number of intracellular or extracellular aggregates of Aβ peptides was not significant.","['Gómez-Pinedo U', 'Villar-Quiles RN', 'Galán L', 'Matías-Guiu JA', 'Benito-Martin MS', 'Guerrero-Sola A', 'Moreno-Ramos T', 'Matías-Guiu J']",2016,7,,Front Neurol,"Gómez-Pinedo U, et al.

27858953,The concept and diagnostic criteria of primary lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVES: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is commonly considered as a motor neuron disease (MND) variant which almost exclusively affects upper motor neurons (UMN). There is still no consensus whether PLS should be regarded as an independent disease entity separate from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or as a comparatively slowly progressive variant of ALS. Given these different views, clinical diagnosis of PLS is a challenge. In this multicenter study, we analyzed clinical features of patients diagnosed with PLS in four specialized MND centers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical, laboratory, imaging, and electrophysiological data of 76 patients with PLS diagnosed in four specialized ALS centers. We analyzed the concept of the disease based on our findings and an extensive review of the literature.
RESULTS: We found that 79% of patients showed asymmetrical symptoms, 60% showed clinical or electrophysiological signs of lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement after a mean of 8.4 ± 5.0 years, and extrapyramidal and/or non-motoric symptoms were frequently observed. Interestingly, none of the patients diagnosed with PLS fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed by Pringle et al. in 1992.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that PLS as a disease entity is still not well enough defined and that there are different concepts about its clinical presentation. We believe that further prospective longitudinal studies are needed in order to refine diagnostic criteria to reflect current clinical practice. Furthermore, neuropathological and neuroimaging approaches might help to arrange PLS in the MND spectrum and its classification.","['Wais V', 'Rosenbohm A', 'Petri S', 'Kollewe K', 'Hermann A', 'Storch A', 'Hanisch F', 'Zierz S', 'Nagel G', 'Kassubek J', 'Weydt P', 'Brettschneider J', 'Weishaupt JH', 'Ludolph AC', 'Dorst J']",2017,136,3,Acta Neurol Scand,"Wais V, et al.

METHODS: In this case-control study, we reviewed the clinical histories of 66 patients with FTD/MND and 57 symptomatic C9 carriers (24 overlapping cases), a total of 99 charts, for history of autoimmune disease. The prevalence of autoimmune disease in C9 and FTD/MND cohorts was determined by χ
RESULTS: Our combined C9 and FTD/MND cohort has a 12% prevalence of nonthyroid autoimmune disease. The prevalence of nonthyroid autoimmune disease in C9 and FTD/MND is similar to the rates in previously detailed progranulin and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia cohorts and elevated in comparison to previously collected normal control and typical Alzheimer disease cohorts, as well as a newly screened progressive supranuclear palsy cohort. Furthermore, the types of autoimmune disease in this combined C9 and FTD/MND cohort cluster within the same 3 categories previously described in progranulin and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia: inflammatory arthritides, cutaneous conditions, and gastrointestinal disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between selective autoimmune disease and neurodegenerative disorders unified by the underlying pathology frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) extends to C9 and FTD/MND cohorts, providing further evidence that select autoimmune inflammation may be intrinsically linked to FTLD-TDP pathophysiology.","['Miller ZA', 'Sturm VE', 'Camsari GB', 'Karydas A', 'Yokoyama JS', 'Grinberg LT', 'Boxer AL', 'Rosen HJ', 'Rankin KP', 'Gorno-Tempini ML', 'Coppola G', 'Geschwind DH', 'Rademakers R', 'Seeley WW', 'Graff-Radford NR', 'Miller BL']",2016,3,6,Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm,"Miller ZA, et al.

27822919,Cell-based therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is also known as motor neuron disease (MND) is a fatal disease associated with rapidly progressive disability, for which no definitive treatment as yet exists. Current treatment regimens largely focus on relieving symptoms to improve the quality of life of those affected. Based on data from preclinical studies, cell-based therapy is a promising treatment for ALS/MND.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of cell-based therapy for people with ALS/MND, compared with placebo or no additional treatment.
SEARCH METHODS: On 21 June 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched two clinical trials' registries for ongoing or unpublished studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster RCTs that assigned people with ALS/MND to receive cell-based therapy versus a placebo or no additional treatment. Co-interventions were allowable, provided that they were given to each group equally.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
MAIN RESULTS: No studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. We identified four ongoing trials.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to guide practice on the use of cell-based therapy to treat ALS/MND.We need large, prospective RCTs to establish the efficacy of cellular therapy and to determine patient-, disease- and cell treatment-related factors that may influence the outcome of cell-based therapy. The major goals of future research should be to determine the appropriate cell source, phenotype, dose, and route of delivery, as these will be key elements in designing an optimal cell-based therapy programme for people with ALS/MND. Future research should also explore novel treatment strategies, including combinations of cellular therapy and standard or novel neuroprotective agents, to find the best possible approach to prevent or reverse the neurological deficit in ALS/MND, and to prolong survival in this debilitating and fatal condition.","['Abdul Wahid SF', 'Law ZK', 'Ismail NA', 'Azman Ali R', 'Lai NM']",2016,11,11,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Abdul Wahid SF, et al.

We aimed to analyse and compare proposed candidate markers for disease progression in the course of ALS. Blood samples were taken from 125 ALS patients, including nine patients with C9orf72 or SOD1 mutation, at regular intervals of six months. ALS patients were characterized by the ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS). We quantified neurofilament light chain (NF-L), S100B, and progranulin (PGRN) and analysed it in relation to disease progression. Results showed that, at baseline, serum concentrations of NF-L but not PGRN or S100B discriminated significantly between ALS and controls. Within 24 months follow-up the marker concentrations remained stable. Baseline serum NF-L levels correlated with survival time, which was confirmed in subgroups with fast, intermediate, and slow disease progression and there was a weak association with disease duration. For S100B and PGRN we found an association with ALSFRS-R score changes and a trend for decreased levels in the fast progressor subgroup. In conclusion, serum NF-L in any ALS disease stage is a promising marker to support diagnosis and predict outcome, while serum PGRN and S100B are only of minor prognostic value.","['Steinacker P', 'Huss A', 'Mayer B', 'Grehl T', 'Grosskreutz J', 'Borck G', 'Kuhle J', 'Lulé D', 'Meyer T', 'Oeckl P', 'Petri S', 'Weishaupt J', 'Ludolph AC', 'Otto M']",2017,18,1-2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Steinacker P, et al.

Drawing from a narrative-based study with people living with motor neuron disease (MND), I show how one couple tried to be recognized as active agents in their life, although oscillating between positions of less and more power. Through an examination of the practices of care that the couple enacted, I illustrate how their positioning in relation to practices of care helped them create meaning in their life. In their efforts to create a way of living they were satisfied with, they engaged in negotiations between varieties of subjectivity. Their subjectivity was not static but was constructed as they shared power to carry out everyday self-care activities.

27764523,Benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in advanced malignant and non-malignant diseases in adults.,"BACKGROUND: This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 2010, on 'Benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in advanced malignant and non-malignant diseases in adults'. Breathlessness is one of the most common symptoms experienced in the advanced stages of malignant and non-malignant disease. Benzodiazepines are widely used for the relief of breathlessness in advanced diseases and are regularly recommended in the literature. At the time of the previously published Cochrane review, there was no evidence for a beneficial effect of benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in people with advanced cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in people with advanced disease. Secondary objectives were to determine the efficacy of different benzodiazepines, different doses of benzodiazepines, different routes of application, adverse effects of benzodiazepines, and the efficacy in different disease groups.
SEARCH METHODS: This is an update of a review published in 2010. We searched 14 electronic databases up to September 2009 for the original review. We checked the reference lists of all relevant studies, key textbooks, reviews, and websites. For the update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE and registers of clinical trials for further ongoing or unpublished studies, up to August 2016. We contacted study investigators and experts in the field of palliative care asking for further studies, unpublished data, or study details when necessary.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) assessing the effect of benzodiazepines compared with placebo or active control in relieving breathlessness in people with advanced stages of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), motor neurone disease (MND), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed identified titles and abstracts. Three review authors independently performed assessment of all potentially relevant studies (full text), data extraction, and assessment of methodological quality. We carried out meta-analysis where appropriate.
MAIN RESULTS: Overall, we identified eight studies for inclusion: seven in the previous review and an additional study for this update. We also identified two studies awaiting classification in this update. The studies were small (a maximum number of 101 participants) and comprised data from a total of 214 participants with advanced cancer or COPD, which we analysed. There was only one study of low risk of bias. Most of the studies had an unclear risk of bias due to lack of information on random sequence generation, concealment, and attrition. Analysis of all studies did not show a beneficial effect of benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness (the primary outcome) in people with advanced cancer and COPD (8 studies, 214 participants) compared to placebo, midazolam, morphine, or promethazine. Furthermore, we observed no statistically significant effect in the prevention of episodic breathlessness (breakthrough dyspnoea) in people with cancer (after 48 hours: risk ratio of 0.76 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.09; 2 studies, 108 participants)) compared to morphine. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no statistically significant differences regarding type of benzodiazepine, dose, route and frequency of delivery, duration of treatment, or type of control. Benzodiazepines caused statistically significantly more adverse events, particularly drowsiness and somnolence, when compared to placebo (risk difference 0.74 (95% CI 0.37, 1.11); 3 studies, 38 participants). In contrast, two studies reported that morphine caused more adverse events than midazolam (RD -0.18 (95% CI -0.31, -0.04); 194 participants).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Since the last version of this review, we have identified one new study for inclusion, but the conclusions remain unchanged. There is no evidence for or against benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in people with advanced cancer and COPD. Benzodiazepines caused more drowsiness as an adverse effect compared to placebo, but less compared to morphine. Benzodiazepines may be considered as a second- or third-line treatment, when opioids and non-pharmacological measures have failed to control breathlessness. There is a need for well-conducted and adequately powered studies.","['Simon ST', 'Higginson IJ', 'Booth S', 'Harding R', 'Weingärtner V', 'Bausewein C']",2016,10,10,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Simon ST, et al.

Recently, low titers of VGKC-complex Abs have also been reported in neurodegenerative disorders, but their clinical relevance is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the prevalence of VGKC-complex Abs in slow-progression motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: We compared 11 patients affected by slow-progression MND with 9 patients presenting typical progression illness. Sera were tested for VGKC-complex Abs by radioimmunoassay. The distribution of VGKC-complex Abs was analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the mean values in the study and control groups. A case with long-survival MND harboring VGKC-complex Abs and treated with intravenous immunoglobulins is described.
CONCLUSION: Although VGKC-complex Abs are not likely to be pathogenic, these results could reflect the coexistence of an immunological activation in patients with slow disease progression.","['Godani M', 'Zoccarato M', 'Beronio A', 'Zuliani L', 'Benedetti L', 'Giometto B', 'Del Sette M', 'Raggio E', 'Baldi R', 'Vincent A']",2017,17,1,Neurodegener Dis,"Godani M, et al.

27798094,Modelling C9orf72 dipeptide repeat proteins of a physiologically relevant size.,"C9orf72 expansions are the most common genetic cause of FTLD and MND identified to date. Although being intronic, the expansion is translated into five different dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) that accumulate within patients' neurons. Attempts have been made to model DPRs in cell and animals. However, the majority of these use DPRs repeat numbers much shorter than those observed in patients. To address this we have generated a selection of DPR expression constructs with repeat numbers in excess of 1000 repeats, matching what is seen in patients. Small and larger DPRs produce inclusions with similar morphology but different cellular effects. We demonstrate a length dependent effect using electrophysiology with a phenotype only occurring with the longest DPRs. These data highlight the importance of using physiologically relevant repeat numbers when modelling DPRs.","['Bennion Callister J', 'Ryan S', 'Sim J', 'Rollinson S', 'Pickering-Brown SM']",2016,25,23,Hum Mol Genet,"Bennion Callister J, et al.

The data were examined in the context of their utility as a diagnostic marker of bulbar disease.
METHOD: Tongue and jaw movements were recorded cross-sectionally (n = 33 individuals with ALS, 13 controls) and longitudinally (n = 10 individuals with ALS) using a three-dimensional electromagnetic articulography system during the production of the sentence Buy Bobby a puppy. The movements were examined for evidence of changes in size, speed, and duration and with respect to disease severity and time in the study.
RESULTS: Maximum speed of tongue movements and movement durations were significantly different only at an advanced stage of bulbar ALS compared with the healthy control group. The longitudinal analysis revealed a reduction in tongue movement size and speed with time at early stages of disease, which was not seen cross-sectionally. As speaking rate declined, tongue movements decreased in maximum speed, whereas jaw movements increased in maximum speed.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analyses of sentence-level kinematic data show their sensitivity to early bulbar impairment. A change in articulatory kinematics can serve as a useful diagnostic marker for bulbar ALS and to track bulbar disease progression in a clinical setting.","['Shellikeri S', 'Green JR', 'Kulkarni M', 'Rong P', 'Martino R', 'Zinman L', 'Yunusova Y']",2016,59,5,J Speech Lang Hear Res,"Shellikeri S, et al.

27590623,In vitro prion-like behaviour of TDP-43 in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of motor neuron disease (MND), and >95% of familial and sporadic cases involve the deposition of insoluble aggregated, phosphorylated and cleaved TDP-43 protein. Accumulating clinical and biological evidence now indicates that ALS bears a number of similarities to the prion diseases, with TDP-43 acting as a misfolded 'prion-like' protein demonstrating similar underlying pathobiology. Here we systematically address the hypothesis that ALS is a prion-like disorder. First we demonstrate that TDP-43 demonstrates seeded polymerisation in vitro directly from both ALS brain and spinal cord. We next show that the seeding of TDP-43 results in the formation of characteristic insoluble, aggregated, and phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology that directly recapitulates the morphological diversity of TDP-43 inclusions detected in ALS patient CNS tissue. We next demonstrate that this reaction can be serially propagated to produce increasing amounts of phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology, and that aggregates can spread from cell to cell in an analogous fashion to that seen in the prion diseases. Finally, we reproduced our findings in a murine motor neuron-like cell line (NSC-34), where the seeding of TDP-43 induces the formation of TDP-43 oligomers and reduced cell viability. These findings may guide therapeutic strategies in this rapidly progressive and invariably fatal disease.","['Smethurst P', 'Newcombe J', 'Troakes C', 'Simone R', 'Chen YR', 'Patani R', 'Sidle K']",2016,96,,Neurobiol Dis,"Smethurst P, et al.

27704280,Distinct conformers of transmissible misfolded SOD1 distinguish human SOD1-FALS from other forms of familial and sporadic ALS.,"Evidence of misfolded wild-type superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) has been detected in spinal cords of sporadic ALS (sALS) patients, suggesting an etiological relationship to SOD1-associated familial ALS (fALS). Given that there are currently a number of promising therapies under development that target SOD1, it is of critical importance to better understand the role of misfolded SOD1 in sALS. We previously demonstrated the permissiveness of the G85R-SOD1:YFP mouse model for MND induction following injection with tissue homogenates from paralyzed transgenic mice expressing SOD1 mutations. This prompted us to examine whether WT SOD1 can self-propagate misfolding of the G85R-SOD1:YFP protein akin to what has been observed with mutant SOD1. Using the G85R-SOD1:YFP mice, we demonstrate that misfolded conformers of recombinant WT SOD1, produced in vitro, induce MND with a distinct inclusion pathology. Furthermore, the distinct pathology remains upon successive passages in the G85R-SOD1:YFP mice, strongly supporting the notion for conformation-dependent templated propagation and SOD1 strains. To determine the presence of a similar misfolded WT SOD1 conformer in sALS tissue, we screened homogenates from patients diagnosed with sALS, fALS, and non-ALS disease in an organotypic spinal cord slice culture assay. Slice cultures from G85R-SOD1:YFP mice exposed to spinal homogenates from patients diagnosed with ALS caused by the A4V mutation in SOD1 developed robust inclusion pathology, whereas spinal homogenates from more than 30 sALS cases and various controls failed. These findings suggest that mutant SOD1 has prion-like attributes that do not extend to SOD1 in sALS tissues.","['Ayers JI', 'Diamond J', 'Sari A', 'Fromholt S', 'Galaleldeen A', 'Ostrow LW', 'Glass JD', 'Hart PJ', 'Borchelt DR']",2016,132,6,Acta Neuropathol,"Ayers JI, et al.

RESULTS: 5 major clinical phenotypes were determined and included ALS bulbar onset, ALS cervical onset and ALS lumbar onset, flail arm and leg and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Of the 1834 registered patients, 1677 (90%) could be allocated a clinical phenotype. ALS bulbar onset had a significantly lower length of survival when compared with all other clinical phenotypes (p<0.004). There were delays in the median time to diagnosis of up to 12 months for the ALS phenotypes, 18 months for the flail limb phenotypes and 19 months for PLS. Riluzole treatment was started in 78-85% of cases. The median delays in initiating riluzole therapy, from symptom onset, varied from 10 to 12 months in the ALS phenotypes and 15-18 months in the flail limb phenotypes. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was implemented in 8-36% of ALS phenotypes and 2-9% of the flail phenotypes. Non-invasive ventilation was started in 16-22% of ALS phenotypes and 21-29% of flail phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of a cohort registry for ALS/MND is able to determine clinical phenotypes, survival and monitor time to key milestones in disease progression. It is intended to expand the cohort to a more population-based registry using opt-out methodology and facilitate data linkage to other national registries.","['Talman P', 'Duong T', 'Vucic S', 'Mathers S', 'Venkatesh S', 'Henderson R', 'Rowe D', 'Schultz D', 'Edis R', 'Needham M', 'Macdonnell R', 'McCombe P', 'Birks C', 'Kiernan M']",2016,6,9,BMJ Open,"Talman P, et al.

27679581,"Skeletal Muscle Satellite Cells, Mitochondria, and MicroRNAs: Their Involvement in the Pathogenesis of ALS.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a fatal motor neuron disorder. It results in progressive degeneration and death of upper and lower motor neurons, protein aggregation, severe muscle atrophy and respiratory insufficiency. Median survival with ALS is between 2 and 5 years from the onset of symptoms. ALS manifests as either familial ALS (FALS) (~10% of cases) or sporadic ALS (SALS), (~90% of cases). Mutations in the copper/zinc (CuZn) superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene account for ~20% of FALS cases and the mutant SOD1 mouse model has been used extensively to help understand the ALS pathology. As the precise mechanisms causing ALS are not well understood there is presently no cure. Recent evidence suggests that motor neuron degradation may involve a cell non-autonomous phenomenon involving numerous cell types within various tissues. Skeletal muscle is now considered as an important tissue involved in the pathogenesis of ALS by activating a retrograde signaling cascade that degrades motor neurons. Skeletal muscle heath and function are regulated by numerous factors including satellite cells, mitochondria and microRNAs. Studies demonstrate that in ALS these factors show various levels of dysregulation within the skeletal muscle. This review provides an overview of their dysregulation in various ALS models as well as how they may contribute individually and/or synergistically to the ALS pathogenesis.","['Tsitkanou S', 'Della Gatta PA', 'Russell AP']",2016,7,,Front Physiol,"Tsitkanou S, et al.

27611334,Age-Related Uptake of Heavy Metals in Human Spinal Interneurons.,"Toxic heavy metals have been implicated in the loss of spinal motoneurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND). Motoneuron loss in the spinal anterior horn is severe in ALS/MND at the time of death, making this tissue unsuitable for examination. We therefore examined spinal cords of people without muscle weakness to look for any presence of heavy metals that could make these neurons susceptible to damage. Spinal cord samples from 50 individuals aged 1-95 y who had no clinical or histopathological evidence of spinal motoneuron loss were studied. Seven μm formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were stained for heavy metals with silver nitrate autometallography (AMGHM) which detects intracellular mercury, silver or bismuth. Neurons in the spinal cord were classified as interneurons or α-motoneurons based on their site and cell body diameter. Spinal interneurons containing heavy metals were present in 8 of 24 people (33%) aged 61-95 y, but not at younger ages. These AMGHM interneurons were most numerous in the lumbar spinal cord, with moderate numbers in the caudal cervical cord, few in the rostral cervical cord, and almost none in the thoracic cord. All people with AMGHM interneurons had occasional AMGHM staining in α-motoneurons as well. In one man AMGHM staining was present in addition in dorsomedial nucleus and sensory neurons. In conclusion, heavy metals are present in many spinal interneurons, and in a few α-motoneurons, in a large proportion of older people. Damage to inhibitory interneurons from toxic metals in later life could result in excitotoxic injury to motoneurons and may underlie motoneuron injury or loss in conditions such as ALS/MND, multiple sclerosis, sarcopenia and calf fasciculations.","['Pamphlett R', 'Kum Jew S']",2016,11,9,PLoS One,Pamphlett R and Kum Jew S.

27600654,Pathogenesis of FUS-associated ALS and FTD: insights from rodent models.,"Disruptions to genes linked to RNA processing and homeostasis are implicated in the pathogenesis of two pathologically related but clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in the Fused-in-Sarcoma (FUS) gene encoding a 526 amino-acid RNA-binding protein are found in a small subset of ALS cases, but FUS mutations do not appear to be a direct cause of FTD. Structural and functional similarities between FUS and another ALS-related RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, highlight the potential importance of aberrant RNA processing in ALS/FTD, and this pathway is now a major focus of interest. Recently, several research groups have reported transgenic vertebrate models of FUSopathy, with varying results. Here, we discuss the evidence for FUS pathogenicity in ALS/FTD, review the experimental approaches used and phenotypic features of FUS rodent models reported to date, and outline their contribution to our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. Further refinement of vertebrate models will likely aid our understanding of the role of FUS in both diseases.","['Nolan M', 'Talbot K', 'Ansorge O']",2016,4,1,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Nolan M, et al.

Changing environmental factors could influence disease risk differently throughout life span, and also between genders, birth cohorts, and seasons of birth. We aimed at describing long-term ALS mortality trends in Norway between 1951 and 2014 using age-period-cohort analysis. The Norwegian Cause of Death Registry provided ALS mortality data that were age- and sex-adjusted through direct standardization. Poisson regression analyses were used for identification of mortality trends and potential month of birth effects. We identified 5345 ALS cases, of which 54.7 % were men. ALS mortality increased throughout the whole period (p < 0.001), with a mean annual increase of 1.14 %. The increase was confined to those older than 60 years, but rates consistently dropped amongst the absolute oldest. The increase was mainly driven by birth cohort effects that increased from 1860 until 1934 (p < 0.001). No month of birth effect or change in sex ratio was found. The continuous increase in ALS mortality since 1951 is best explained by the long-term changes in exposure to risk factors or in case ascertainment, affecting men and women equally in the generations born since 1860 and at least into 1934.","['Nakken O', 'Lindstrøm JC', 'Tysnes OB', 'Holmøy T']",2016,263,12,J Neurol,"Nakken O, et al.

The objective of this study was to identify the treatments that are commonly prescribed, and to describe how experienced clinicians manage a patient with treatment resistant symptoms. Twenty-three clinicians were approached, of which 19 from 16 centres across the UK provided case report forms for a total of 119 ALS patients identified as having problematic oral secretions. The use of five anticholinergics, salivary gland botulinum toxin injections, conservative management approaches and carbocisteine were reported. Of the 72 patients who were evaluated following the initiation of a first anticholinergic, 61% had symptomatic improvement. Only 19% of patients achieved symptomatic improvement with the use of an alternative anticholinergic when an initial anticholinergic achieved no symptomatic improvement. Problems with thick and thin secretions often coexisted, with 37% of patients receiving treatment for both types of problem. In conclusion, a variety of treatment options are employed by expert clinicians for problematic oral secretions in ALS patients. The variation in management highlights the need for further prospective research in this area.","['McGeachan AJ', 'Hobson EV', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Stephenson J', 'Chandran S', 'Crawley F', 'Dick D', 'Donaghy C', 'Ellis CM', 'Gorrie G', 'Hanemann CO', 'Harrower T', 'Jung A', 'Malaspina A', 'Morrison KE', 'Orrell RW', 'Talbot K', 'Turner MR', 'Williams TL', 'Young CA', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ']",2017,18,1-2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"McGeachan AJ, et al.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated mean survival as 7.9 years (range: 1-19 years, SD = 4.64). Familial and sporadic cases exhibited similar survival, including progranulin (GRN) gene mutation cases. No significant differences in survival were associated with sex, disease onset, Braak disease stage, or disease subtype, but higher survival was associated with lower post-mortem brain weight. Survival was significantly reduced in cases with associated motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) but increased with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or hippocampal sclerosis (HS) co-morbidity. Cox regression analysis suggested that reduced survival was associated with increased densities of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) while increased survival was associated with greater densities of enlarged neurons (EN) in the frontal and temporal lobes. The data suggest that: (1) survival in FTLD-TDP is more prolonged than typical in pre-senile dementia but shorter than some clinical subtypes such as the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), (2) MND co-morbidity predicts poor survival, and (3) NCI may develop early and EN later in the disease.

27504105,Non-Motor Symptoms in Patients Suffering from Motor Neuron Diseases.,"BACKGROUND: The recently postulated ""disease spreading hypothesis"" has gained much attention, especially for Parkinson's disease (PD). The various non-motor symptoms (NMS) in neurodegenerative diseases would be much better explained by this hypothesis than by the degeneration of disease-specific cell populations. Motor neuron disease (MND) is primarily known as a group of diseases with a selective loss of motor function. However, recent evidence suggests disease spreading into non-motor brain regions also in MND. The aim of this study was to comprehensively detect NMS in patients suffering from MND.
METHODS: We used a self-rating questionnaire including 30 different items of gastrointestinal, autonomic, neuropsychiatric, and sleep complaints [NMS questionnaire (NMSQuest)], which is an established tool in PD patients. 90 MND patients were included and compared to 96 controls.
RESULTS: In total, MND patients reported significantly higher NMS scores (median: 7 points) in comparison to controls (median: 4 points). Dribbling, impaired taste/smelling, impaired swallowing, weight loss, loss of interest, sad/blues, falling, and insomnia were significantly more prevalent in MND patients compared to controls. Interestingly, excessive sweating was more reported in the MND group. Correlation analysis revealed an increase of total NMS score with disease progression.
CONCLUSION: NMS in MND patients seemed to increase with disease progression, which would fit with the recently postulated ""disease spreading hypothesis."" The total NMS score in the MND group significantly exceeded the score for the control group, but only 8 of the 30 single complaints of the NMSQuest were significantly more often reported by MND patients. Dribbling, impaired swallowing, weight loss, and falling could primarily be connected to motor neuron degeneration and declared as motor symptoms in MND.","['Günther R', 'Richter N', 'Sauerbier A', 'Chaudhuri KR', 'Martinez-Martin P', 'Storch A', 'Hermann A']",2016,7,,Front Neurol,"Günther R, et al.

27459838,Motoneuron diseases: impact on health professionals.,"The approach to patients affected by motor neuron disease (MND) and their caregivers requires specific training for the care-team. In fact, the progression of the disease, with the decline of physical--and sometimes cognitive--function, the increasing difficulties in speaking, breathing, and swallowing and the need of invasive choices, as the artificial nutrition and tracheostomy, constitute a challenge for the health professionals, often generating distress. For this reason, their cohesion and sharing abilities are fundamental. Psychologist assumes a strategic role in supporting and facilitating the analysis of clinical cases and of the team's intra/interpersonal dynamics. For this aim, he/she needs specific training and instruments. We here present a semi-structured interview--the Motor Neuron Disease-Psychological Interview (MoNeDi-PI)--which may guide in the psychological assessment of patients affected by MNDs and their caregivers. It can also be a handy reference tool for other members of the healthcare team providing necessary information about the patient and caregiver in order to optimize clinical decision making about which health interventions to apply.","['Cerutti P', 'Solara V', 'Ferrario SR']",2016,38,2,G Ital Med Lav Ergon,"Cerutti P, et al.

Through imputation and mixed-model association analysis in 12,577 cases and 23,475 controls, combined with 2,579 cases and 2,767 controls in an independent replication cohort, we fine-mapped a new risk locus on chromosome 21 and identified C21orf2 as a gene associated with ALS risk. In addition, we identified MOBP and SCFD1 as new associated risk loci. We established evidence of ALS being a complex genetic trait with a polygenic architecture. Furthermore, we estimated the SNP-based heritability at 8.5%, with a distinct and important role for low-frequency variants (frequency 1-10%).

27454577,Treatment approaches in motor neurone disease.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although there is no cure for motor neurone disease (MND), the advent of multidisciplinary care and neuroprotective agents has improved treatment interventions and enhanced quality of life for MND patients and their carers.
RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence-based multidisciplinary care, respiratory management and disease-modifying therapy have improved the outcomes of patients diagnosed with MND. Supportive approaches to nutritional maintenance and optimization of symptomatic treatments, including management of communication and neuropsychiatric issues, improve the quality of life for MND patients.
SUMMARY: Recent progress in the understanding of the clinical, pathophysiological and genetic heterogeneity of MND has improved the approach of clinicians to treatment. Notwithstanding improvement to care and quality of life, survival benefit has become evident with the advent of a multidisciplinary care framework, early treatment with riluzole and noninvasive ventilation. Weight maintenance remains critical, with weight loss associated with more rapid disease progression. The end-of-life phase is poorly defined and treatment is challenging, but effective symptom control through palliative care is achievable and essential. Encouragingly, current progress of clinical trials continues to close the gap towards the successful development of curative treatment in MND.","['Dharmadasa T', 'Matamala JM', 'Kiernan MC']",2016,29,5,Curr Opin Neurol,"Dharmadasa T, et al.

This study aimed to establish a knowledge base of current Australian practice of breaking the news of an MND diagnosis, to assess the neurologists' educational and training needs and to compare the feedback obtained from neurologists and patients to international practice guidelines. An anonymous survey of neurologists was undertaken in Australia (2014). 73 neurologists responded to this national survey (50.4% response rate). Nearly 70% of neurologists reported finding it ""somewhat to very difficult"" communicating the MND diagnosis, and 65% reported feeling moderate to high stress and anxiety at the delivery of diagnosis. Compared to international guidelines, areas for improvement include length of consultation, period of follow up and referral to MND associations. Two-thirds of neurologists were interested in further training to respond to patient's emotions and development of best practice guidelines. This is the first national study to provide a comprehensive insight into the process of delivering the MND diagnosis from the neurologists' perspective and to make comparisons with those of patients and the international guidelines. This study forms the basis for developing protocols to improve communication skills and alleviate the emotional burden associated with breaking bad news.","['Aoun SM', 'Breen LJ', 'Edis R', 'Henderson RD', 'Oliver D', 'Harris R', 'Howting D', ""O'Connor M"", 'Birks C']",2016,367,,J Neurol Sci,"Aoun SM, et al.

Defects in nerve-muscle signaling cause a variety of neuromuscular disorders with features of ataxia, paralysis, skeletal muscle wasting, and degeneration. Here we show that the nuclear zinc finger protein ZFP106 is highly enriched in skeletal muscle and is required for postnatal maintenance of myofiber innervation by motor neurons. Genetic disruption of Zfp106 in mice results in progressive ataxia and hindlimb paralysis associated with motor neuron degeneration, severe muscle wasting, and premature death by 6 mo of age. We show that ZFP106 is an RNA-binding protein that associates with the core splicing factor RNA binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) and localizes to nuclear speckles adjacent to spliceosomes. Upon inhibition of pre-mRNA synthesis, ZFP106 translocates with other splicing factors to the nucleolus. Muscle and spinal cord of Zfp106 knockout mice displayed a gene expression signature of neuromuscular degeneration. Strikingly, altered splicing of the Nogo (Rtn4) gene locus in skeletal muscle of Zfp106 knockout mice resulted in ectopic expression of NOGO-A, the neurite outgrowth factor that inhibits nerve regeneration and destabilizes neuromuscular junctions. These findings reveal a central role for Zfp106 in the maintenance of nerve-muscle signaling, and highlight the involvement of aberrant RNA processing in neuromuscular disease pathogenesis.","['Anderson DM', 'Cannavino J', 'Li H', 'Anderson KM', 'Nelson BR', 'McAnally J', 'Bezprozvannaya S', 'Liu Y', 'Lin W', 'Liu N', 'Bassel-Duby R', 'Olson EN']",2016,113,31,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Anderson DM, et al.

27401201,Nutritional pathway for people with motor neurone disease.,"This paper provides an overview of the nutritional management and care of people living with motor neurone disease (MND) in a specialist nutrition clinic. A specialist pathway of care has been developed to enable people living with MND to undergo a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure in a safe way; the pathway incorporates attendance at a dedicated nutrition clinic, a stratification tool to identify patients with a high periprocedural risk and a PEG insertion team with significant experience in the MND population. Since this pathway has been in place, gastrostomies have been successfully placed in patients with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 50%; previously, this would not have been possible.","['Marsden R', 'Allan P', 'Blackwell V', 'East J', 'Lawson C', 'Nickol AH', 'Millard E', 'Talbot K', 'Thompson AG', 'Turner MR']",2016,21,7,Br J Community Nurs,"Marsden R, et al.

27400329,Therapeutic approach to pain in neurodegenerative diseases: current evidence and perspectives.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are increasing in parallel to the lengthening of survival. The management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD-related disorders, and motor neuron diseases (MND), is mainly targeted to motor and cognitive impairment, with special care for vital functions such as breathing and feeding. Areas covered: The present review focuses on chronic pain in main neurodegenerative diseases, addressing current evidence on pain therapeutic management, pain frequency and clinical features, and possible pathophysiological mechanisms. The search on PubMed had no time limits and was performed by searching for the following key issues: pain, dementia, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, extrapyramidal disorders, motoneuronal disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, FXTAS, frequency, pathophysiology, treatments, therapy, efficacy, opioids, side effects. No controlled therapeutic trials and guidelines are currently available. The effects of current therapies such as L-Dopa or riluzole on pain symptoms are not clear. Emerging evidences on the possible anti-nociceptive effects of cannabis or botulinum toxin might be available soon. Expert commentary: Pain needs to be better evaluated and fully considered in the global management of neurodegenerative disease because a more focused treatment may have a positive impact on the global burden of these devastating disorders.","['de Tommaso M', 'Kunz M', 'Valeriani M']",2017,17,2,Expert Rev Neurother,"de Tommaso M, et al.

27378910,Etiologic Framework for the Study of Neurodegenerative Disorders as Well as Vascular and Metabolic Comorbidities on the Grounds of Shared Epidemiologic and Biologic Features.,"BACKGROUND: During the last two decades, protein aggregation at all organismal levels, from viruses to humans, has emerged from a neglected area of protein science to become a central issue in biology and biomedicine. This article constitutes a risk-based review aimed at supporting an etiologic scenario of selected, sporadic, protein-associated, i.e., conformational, neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), and their vascular- and metabolic-associated ailments.
METHODS: A rationale is adopted, to incorporate selected clinical data and results from animal-model research, complementing epidemiologic evidences reported in two prior articles.
FINDINGS: Theory is formulated assuming an underlying conformational transmission mechanism, mediated either by horizontal transfer of mammalian genes coding for specific aggregation-prone proteins, or by xeno-templating between bacterial and host proteins. We build a few population-based and experimentally-testable hypotheses focusing on: (1) non-disposable surgical instruments for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and other rapid progressive neurodegenerative dementia (sRPNDd), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and motor neuron disease (MND); and (2) specific bacterial infections such as B. pertussis and E. coli for all forms, but particularly for late-life sporadic conformational, NDDs, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and atherosclerosis where natural protein fibrils present in such organisms as a result of adaptation to the human host induce prion-like mechanisms.
CONCLUSION: Implications for cohort alignment and experimental animal research are discussed and research lines proposed.","['de Pedro-Cuesta J', 'Martínez-Martín P', 'Rábano A', 'Ruiz-Tovar M', 'Alcalde-Cabero E', 'Calero M']",2016,8,,Front Aging Neurosci,"de Pedro-Cuesta J, et al.

27378085,A clinical tool for predicting survival in ALS.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and usually fatal neurodegenerative disease. Survival from diagnosis varies considerably. Several prognostic factors are known, including site of onset (bulbar or limb), age at symptom onset, delay from onset to diagnosis and the use of riluzole and non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Clinicians and patients would benefit from a practical way of using these factors to provide an individualised prognosis.
METHODS: 575 consecutive patients with incident ALS from a population-based registry in South-East England register for ALS (SEALS) were studied. Their survival was modelled as a two-step process: the time from diagnosis to respiratory muscle involvement, followed by the time from respiratory involvement to death. The effects of predictor variables were assessed separately for each time interval.
FINDINGS: Younger age at symptom onset, longer delay from onset to diagnosis and riluzole use were associated with slower progression to respiratory involvement, and NIV use was associated with lower mortality after respiratory involvement, each with a clinically significant effect size. Riluzole may have a greater effect in younger patients and those with longer delay to diagnosis. A patient's survival time has a roughly 50% chance of falling between half and twice the predicted median.
INTERPRETATION: A simple and clinically applicable graphical method of predicting an individual patient's survival from diagnosis is presented. The model should be validated in an independent cohort, and extended to include other important prognostic factors.","['Knibb JA', 'Keren N', 'Kulka A', 'Leigh PN', 'Martin S', 'Shaw CE', 'Tsuda M', 'Al-Chalabi A']",2016,87,12,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Knibb JA, et al.

In a recent study by Steinberg and colleagues, 2 recessive missense mutations were identified in the Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel gene (CACNA1H), in a family with an affected proband (early onset, long duration ALS) and 2 unaffected parents. We have introduced and functionally characterized these mutations using transiently expressed human Cav3.2 channels in tsA-201 cells. Both of these mutations produced mild but significant changes on T-type channel activity that are consistent with a loss of channel function. Computer modeling in thalamic reticular neurons suggested that these mutations result in decreased neuronal excitability of thalamic structures. Taken together, these findings implicate CACNA1H as a susceptibility gene in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","['Rzhepetskyy Y', 'Lazniewska J', 'Blesneac I', 'Pamphlett R', 'Weiss N']",2016,10,6,Channels (Austin),"Rzhepetskyy Y, et al.

27324739,Motor neuron disease mortality rates in U.S. states are associated with well water use.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with an unknown cause and invariably fatal outcome. We sought to evaluate a correlation between motor neuron disease (MND) mortality rates and residential radon levels that was previously reported for counties in the United Kingdom. We examined the relationships between age-adjusted MND mortality rates in U.S. states with residential radon levels, well water use, and other variables using structural equation modeling. We observed a significant correlation between MND mortality rates and radon levels. However, in structural equation models, radon did not have a significant, direct effect on MND mortality rates. Conversely, MND mortality rates were significantly and directly predicted by race and by the percentage of the population of each state using well water (p < 0.001 and p = 0.022). We observed similar, significant effects for well water use and MND mortality for males and females separately (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we hypothesize that the association of MND mortality rates with well water use reflects contamination of wells with Legionella, a bacterium common in well water that is known to cause neurologic disease. A Legionella hypothesis is a biologically plausible cause of ALS and suggests new avenues for etiologic research.","['Schwartz GG', 'Klug MG']",2016,17,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,Schwartz GG and Klug MG.

27313396,Pain in Neurodegenerative Disease: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are going to increase as the life expectancy is getting longer. The management of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD related disorders, motor neuron diseases (MND), Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), is mainly addressed to motor and cognitive impairment, with special care to vital functions as breathing and feeding. Many of these patients complain of painful symptoms though their origin is variable, and their presence is frequently not considered in the treatment guidelines, leaving their management to the decision of the clinicians alone. However, studies focusing on pain frequency in such disorders suggest a high prevalence of pain in selected populations from 38 to 75% in AD, 40% to 86% in PD, and 19 to 85% in MND. The methods of pain assessment vary between studies so the type of pain has been rarely reported. However, a prevalent nonneuropathic origin of pain emerged for MND and PD. In AD, no data on pain features are available. No controlled therapeutic trials and guidelines are currently available. Given the relevance of pain in neurodegenerative disorders, the comprehensive understanding of mechanisms and predisposing factors, the application and validation of specific scales, and new specific therapeutic trials are needed.","['de Tommaso M', 'Arendt-Nielsen L', 'Defrin R', 'Kunz M', 'Pickering G', 'Valeriani M']",2016,2016,,Behav Neurol,"de Tommaso M, et al.

27288208,Improved PCR based methods for detecting C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions.,"Due to the GC-rich, repetitive nature of C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions, PCR based detection methods are challenging. Several limitations of PCR have been reported and overcoming these could help to define the pathogenic range. There is also a need to develop improved repeat-primed PCR assays which allow detection even in the presence of genomic variation around the repeat region. We have optimised PCR conditions for the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, using betaine as a co-solvent and specific cycling conditions, including slow ramping and a high denaturation temperature. We have developed a flanking assay, and repeat-primed PCR assays for both 3' and 5' ends of the repeat expansion, which when used together provide a robust strategy for detecting the presence or absence of expansions greater than ∼100 repeats, even in the presence of genomic variability at the 3' end of the repeat. Using our assays, we have detected repeat expansions in 47/442 Scottish ALS patients. Furthermore, we recommend the combined use of these assays in a clinical diagnostic setting.","['Cleary EM', 'Pal S', 'Azam T', 'Moore DJ', 'Swingler R', 'Gorrie G', 'Stephenson L', 'Colville S', 'Chandran S', 'Porteous M', 'Warner JP']",2016,30,4,Mol Cell Probes,"Cleary EM, et al.

27245439,Reduced levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin in cerebrospinal fluid of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: a novel approach for a potential treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable neurodegenerative motor neuron disease that involves activation of the immune system and inflammatory response in the nervous system. Reduced level of the immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory protein alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is associated with inflammation-related pathologies. The objective of the present is to determine AAT levels and IL-23 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients and control group.
FINDINGS: CSF samples from newly diagnosed ALS patients and age-matched controls were analyzed for AAT and IL-23 by ELISA and magnetic luminex screening, respectively. A statistically significant reduction of 45 % in mean AAT levels was observed in the CSF of ALS patients (21.4 μg/ml) as compared to the control group (mean 38.8 μg/ml, p = 0.013). A statistically significant increase of 30.8 % in CSF mean levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-23 was observed in ALS patients (1647 pg/ml) in comparison to the controls (1259 pg/ml, p = 0.012). A negative correlation coefficient (r = -0.543) was obtained by linear regression analysis of the two measured parameters (p = 0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced AAT and elevated IL-23 CSF levels support the notion of neuroinflammatory process occurring in ALS patients. Increasing AAT levels in the patients' nervous system should be further investigated as a new therapeutic approach and a novel potential tool for ALS treatment.","['Wormser U', 'Mandrioli J', 'Vinceti M', 'Fini N', 'Sintov A', 'Brodsky B', 'Proskura E', 'Finkelstein Y']",2016,13,1,J Neuroinflammation,"Wormser U, et al.

27188215,Analysis of terms used for the diagnosis and classification of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuron disease.,"There is no test for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and so attempts have been made to produce standardized diagnostic criteria based on clinical and electrophysiological findings, e.g. El Escorial. However, the phenotypic classification of the subtypes of ALS is also based on clinical features leading to conflation of diagnosis and phenotype. We used a five-question online survey with ALS specialists to explore the range of descriptors and how they are used. Of 101 specialists approached, 72 completed the survey. The most frequently used labels were 'ALS', 'PLS' and 'familial'. Labels other than the El Escorial categories were mainly used as clinical descriptors (83%). Approximately 50% of respondents recorded that the El Escorial criteria had no useful role in patient discussion or in the diagnostic process. Only 31% of respondents rated their current classification system above the median for being logical. A more rational system explicitly distinguishing diagnostic and phenotypic criteria is essential.","['Rutter-Locher Z', 'Turner MR', 'Leigh PN', 'Al-Chalabi A']",2016,17,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Rutter-Locher Z, et al.

It includes the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), the semantic and non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA and nfvPPA), FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome. The diagnosis of the FTLD spectrum of diseases is based on clinical symptoms which hampers the differentiation of the diseases among each other and with other disorders that show a similar clinical appearance resulting in a high rate of misdiagnoses. This highlights the need for objective and selective measures in the diagnostic criteria and there is extensive research on neurochemical biomarkers in FTLD as one option to address this unmet clinical need. Here, we review the advances in CSF biomarker research in FTLD in the last 2 years with regard to the validation of previously suggested and identification of new biomarker candidates for the differential diagnosis of FTLD. New biomarkers for frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are urgently needed to support differential diagnosis within the disease spectrum and with related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD).

27173737,Identifying and addressing the support needs of family caregivers of people with motor neurone disease using the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool.,"OBJECTIVE: Family caregivers of people with motor neurone disease (MND) experience adverse health outcomes as a result of their caregiving experience. This may be alleviated if their support needs are identified and addressed in a systematic and timely manner. The objective of the present study was to assess the feasibility and relevance of the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool (CSNAT) in home-based care during the period of caregiving from the perspectives of the family caregivers of people with MND and their service providers.
METHOD: The study was conducted during 2014 in Western Australia. Some 30 family caregivers and 4 care advisors participated in trialing the CSNAT intervention, which involved two visits from care advisors (6-8 weeks apart) to identify and address support needs. The feedback from family caregivers was obtained via telephone interviews and that of care advisors via a self-administered questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 24 caregivers completed the study (80% completion rate) and identified the highest support priorities as ""knowing what to expect in the future,"" ""knowing who to contact if concerned,"" and ""equipment to help care."" The majority found that this assessment process adequately addressed their needs and gave them a sense of validation, reassurance, and empowerment. Care advisors advocated the CSNAT approach as an improvement over standard practice, allowing them to more clearly assess needs, to offer a more structured follow-up, and to focus on the caregiver and family.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The CSNAT approach for identifying and addressing family caregivers' support needs was found to be relevant and feasible by MND family caregivers and care advisors. The tool provided a formal structure to facilitate discussions with family caregivers and thus enable needs to be addressed. Such discussions can also inform an evidence base for the ongoing development of services, ensuring that new and improved services are designed to meet the explicit needs of the family caregivers of people with a motor neurone disease.","['Aoun SM', 'Deas K', 'Kristjanson LJ', 'Kissane DW']",2017,15,1,Palliat Support Care,"Aoun SM, et al.

27165157,How integrated are neurology and palliative care services? Results of a multicentre mapping exercise.,"BACKGROUND: Patients affected by progressive long-term neurological conditions might benefit from specialist palliative care involvement. However, little is known on how neurology and specialist palliative care services interact. This study aimed to map the current level of connections and integration between these services.
METHODS: The mapping exercise was conducted in eight centres with neurology and palliative care services in the United Kingdom. The data were provided by the respective neurology and specialist palliative care teams. Questions focused on: i) catchment and population served; ii) service provision and staffing; iii) integration and relationships.
RESULTS: Centres varied in size of catchment areas (39-5,840 square miles) and population served (142,000-3,500,000). Neurology and specialist palliative care were often not co-terminus. Service provisions for neurology and specialist palliative care were also varied. For example, neurology services varied in the number and type of provided clinics and palliative care services in the settings they work in. Integration was most developed in Motor Neuron Disease (MND), e.g., joint meetings were often held, followed by Parkinsonism (made up of Parkinson's Disease (PD), Multiple-System Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), with integration being more developed for MSA and PSP) and least in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), e.g., most sites had no formal links. The number of neurology patients per annum receiving specialist palliative care reflected these differences in integration (range: 9-88 MND, 3-25 Parkinsonism, and 0-5 MS).
CONCLUSIONS: This mapping exercise showed heterogeneity in service provision and integration between neurology and specialist palliative care services, which varied not only between sites but also between diseases. This highlights the need and opportunities for improved models of integration, which should be rigorously tested for effectiveness.","['van Vliet LM', 'Gao W', 'DiFrancesco D', 'Crosby V', 'Wilcock A', 'Byrne A', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Chaudhuri KR', 'Evans C', 'Silber E', 'Young C', 'Malik F', 'Quibell R', 'Higginson IJ', 'OPTCARE Neuro']",2016,16,,BMC Neurol,"van Vliet LM, et al.

27117334,Lower motor neuron dysfunction in ALS.,"In the motor system there is a complex interplay between cortical structures and spinal cord lower motor neurons (LMN). In this system both inhibitory and excitatory neurons have relevant roles. LMN loss is a marker of motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS). Conventional needle electromyography (EMG) does not allow LMN loss to be quantified. Measurement of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude or area, and the neurophysiological index, provide a surrogate estimate of the number of functional motor units. Increased motor neuronal excitability is a neurophysiological marker of ALS in the context of a suspected clinical and electrophysiological diagnosis. In the LMN system, fasciculation potentials (FPs) are the earliest changes observed in affected muscles, a feature of LMN hyperexcitability. Reinnervation is best investigated by needle EMG although other methods can be explored. Moreover needle EMG give information about the temporal profile of the reinnervation process, important ancillary data. Quantitative motor unit potential analysis is a valuable method of evaluating reinnervation. The importance of FPs has been recognized in the Awaji criteria for the electrodiagnosis of ALS, criteria that are a sensitive adjunct to the revised El Escorial criteria. Finally, functionality of LMN's, and perhaps excitability studies in motor nerves, aids understanding of the disease process, allowing measurement of potential treatment effects in clinical trials. Other investigational techniques, such as electrical impedance myography, muscle and nerve ultrasound, and spinal cord imaging methods may prove useful in future.","['de Carvalho M', 'Swash M']",2016,127,7,Clin Neurophysiol,de Carvalho M and Swash M.

27098242,Trends in motor neuron disease: association with latitude and air lead levels in Spain.,"Motor neuron diseases (MND) are a group of disorders characterized by motor neuron degeneration. Among them, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is by far the most common in adulthood. This paper assesses the trend and geographical pattern in MND incidence in Spain and the possible air lead levels effect on this pathology. To confirm this concept, we performed a retrospective analysis of the deaths due to MND in Spain during 2000 and 2013, determined the geographical differences, and explored the relationship between MND and the air levels of lead. Overall, between 2000 and 2013, 11,355 people died in Spain because of MND. Disease mortality significantly increased in recent years (2007-2013) when compared with the first time of the period. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient also showed a statistically significant positive trend (CC = 0.824, p = 0.0002). Among people over 65 years, mortality rates were higher in Northern provinces. Moreover, we found a significant association of MND mortality with higher air lead levels (CC = 0.457, p = 0.01). Our study confirms that MND mortality is increasing in Spain, with a significant latitude gradient, which suggests an important role of environmental exposures. This ecological study suggests that air lead levels may be implicated in ALS pathogenesis.","['Santurtún A', 'Villar A', 'Delgado-Alvarado M', 'Riancho J']",2016,37,8,Neurol Sci,"Santurtún A, et al.

27093948,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuron syndromes in Asia.,"While the past 2 decades have witnessed an increasing understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) arising from East Asia, particularly Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China, knowledge of ALS throughout the whole of Asia remains limited. Asia represents >50% of the world population, making it host to the largest patient cohort of ALS. Furthermore, Asia represents a diverse population in terms of ethnic, social and cultural backgrounds. In this review, an overview is presented that covers what is currently known of ALS in Asia from basic epidemiology and genetic influences, through to disease characteristics including atypical phenotypes which manifest a predilection for Asians. With the recent establishment of the Pan-Asian Consortium for Treatment and Research in ALS to facilitate collaborations between clinicians and researchers across the region, it is anticipated that Asia and the Pacific will contribute to unravelling the uncertainties in ALS.","['Shahrizaila N', 'Sobue G', 'Kuwabara S', 'Kim SH', 'Birks C', 'Fan DS', 'Bae JS', 'Hu CJ', 'Gourie-Devi M', 'Noto Y', 'Shibuya K', 'Goh KJ', 'Kaji R', 'Tsai CP', 'Cui L', 'Talman P', 'Henderson RD', 'Vucic S', 'Kiernan MC']",2016,87,8,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Shahrizaila N, et al.

27053272,Development of patient decision support tools for motor neuron disease using stakeholder consultation: a study protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a terminal, progressive, multisystem disorder. Well-timed decisions are key to effective symptom management. To date, there are few published decision support tools, also known as decision aids, to guide patients in making ongoing choices for symptom management and quality of life. This protocol is to develop and validate decision support tools for patients and families to use in conjunction with health professionals in MND multidisciplinary care. The tools will inform patients and families of the benefits and risks of each option, as well as the consequences of accepting or declining treatment.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is being conducted from June 2015 to May 2016, using a modified Delphi process. A 2-stage, 7-step process will be used to develop the tools, based on existing literature and stakeholder feedback. The first stage will be to develop the decision support tools, while the second stage will be to validate both the tools and the process used to develop them. Participants will form expert panels, to provide feedback on which the development and validation of the tools will be based. Participants will be drawn from patients with MND, family carers and health professionals, support association workers, peak body representatives, and MND and patient decision-making researchers.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study has been granted by Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC), approval number 5201500658. Knowledge translation will be conducted via publications, seminar and conference presentations to patients and families, health professionals and researchers.","['Hogden A', 'Greenfield D', 'Caga J', 'Cai X']",2016,6,4,BMJ Open,"Hogden A, et al.

27042141,Molecular Mechanisms of Neurodegeneration in Spinal Muscular Atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease with a high incidence and is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is primarily characterized by degeneration of the spinal motor neurons that leads to skeletal muscle atrophy followed by symmetric limb paralysis, respiratory failure, and death. In humans, mutation of the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene shifts the load of expression of SMN protein to the SMN2 gene that produces low levels of full-length SMN protein because of alternative splicing, which are sufficient for embryonic development and survival but result in SMA. The molecular mechanisms of the (a) regulation of SMN gene expression and (b) degeneration of motor neurons caused by low levels of SMN are unclear. However, some progress has been made in recent years that have provided new insights into understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of SMA pathogenesis. In this review, we have briefly summarized recent advances toward understanding of the molecular mechanisms of regulation of SMN levels and signaling mechanisms that mediate neurodegeneration in SMA.","['Ahmad S', 'Bhatia K', 'Kannan A', 'Gangwani L']",2016,10,,J Exp Neurosci,"Ahmad S, et al.

27036121,Pathological tau deposition in Motor Neurone Disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.,"It has been suggested that patients with motor neurone disease (MND) and those with MND combined with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (ie FTD + MND) or with FTD alone might exist on a continuum based on commonalities of neuropathology and/or genetic risk. Moreover, it has been reported that both a neuronal and a glial cell tauopathy can accompany the TDP-43 proteinopathy in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) with cognitive changes, and that the tauopathy may be fundamental to disease pathogenesis and clinical phenotype. In the present study, we sought to substantiate these latter findings, and test this concept of a pathological continuum, in a consecutive series of 41 patients with MND, 16 with FTD + MND and 23 with FTD without MND. Paraffin sections of frontal, entorhinal, temporal and occipital cortex and hippocampus were immunostained for tau pathology using anti-tau antibodies, AT8, pThr(175) and pThr(217), and for amyloid β protein (Aβ) using 4G8 antibody. Twenty four (59 %) patients with MND, 7 (44 %) patients with FTD + MND and 10 (43 %) patients with FTD showed 'significant' tau pathology (ie more than just an isolated neurofibrillary tangle or a few neuropil threads in one or more brain regions examined). In most instances, this bore the histological characteristics of an Alzheimer's disease process involving entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, temporal cortex, frontal cortex and occipital cortex in decreasing frequency, accompanied by a deposition of Aβ up to Thal phase 3, though 2 patients with MND, and 1 with FTD did show tau pathology beyond Braak stage III. Four other patients with MND showed novel neuronal tau pathology, within the frontal cortex alone, specifically detected by pThr(175) antibody, which was characterised by a fine granular or more clumped aggregation of tau without neurofibrillary tangles or neuropil threads. However, none of these 4 patients had clinically evident cognitive disorder, and this type of tau pathology was not seen in any of the FTD + MND or FTD patients. Finally, two patients, one with MND and one with FTD, showed a tau pathology consistent with Argyrophilic Grain Disease (AGD). Western blotting and use of 3- and 4-repeat tau antibodies confirmed the histological interpretation of Alzheimer's disease type pathology in all instances except for those patients with accompanying AGD where a banding pattern on western blot, and immunohistochemistry, confirmed 4-repeat tauopathy. In all 3 patient groups, amyloid pathology was more likely to be present in patients dying after 65 years of age, and in the presence of APOE ε4 allele. We conclude that tau pathological changes are equally common amongst patients with MND, FTD + MND and FTD though, in most instances, these are limited in extent. In patients with MND, when cognitive impairment is present this is most likely due to an accompanying/evolving (coincidental) Alzheimer's disease process or, as in a single case, Dementia with Lewy bodies, within the cerebral cortex rather than as a result of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Conversely, in FTD and FTD + MND dementia is more likely to be associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy than tau. Hence, present study shows no progression in severity of (tau) pathology from MND through FTD + MND to FTD, and does not support the concept of these conditions forming a continuum of clinical or pathological change.","['Behrouzi R', 'Liu X', 'Wu D', 'Robinson AC', 'Tanaguchi-Watanabe S', 'Rollinson S', 'Shi J', 'Tian J', 'Hamdalla HH', 'Ealing J', 'Richardson A', 'Jones M', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Davidson YS', 'Strong MJ', 'Hasegawa M', 'Snowden JS', 'Mann DM']",2016,4,,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Behrouzi R, et al.

27019797,Quo vadis motor neuron disease?,"Motor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition that is invariably fatal, usually within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis. The aetio-pathogenesis of MND remains unresolved and no effective treatments exist. The only Food and Drug Administration approved disease modifying therapy is riluzole, a glutamate antagonist, which prolongs survival by up to 3 mo. Current management is largely symptomatic/supportive. There is therefore a desperate and unmet clinical need for discovery of disease mechanisms to guide novel therapeutic strategy. In this review, we start by introducing the organizational anatomy of the motor system, before providing a clinical overview of its dysfunction specifically in MND. We then summarize insights gained from pathological, genetic and animal models and conclude by speculating on optimal strategies to drive the step change in discovery, which is so desperately needed in this arena.","['Balendra R', 'Patani R']",2016,6,1,World J Methodol,Balendra R and Patani R.

27015868,Eosinophilic Enteritis in Horses with Motor Neuron Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Equine motor neuron disease (EMND) is a neuromuscular disorder that affects adult horses. Although EMND has been linked to vitamin E deficiency, its etiopathogenesis is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical features, laboratory results, and postmortem findings in a series of young horses with motor neuron disease (MND).
ANIMALS: A herd of 15 young Andalusian horses with weakness, weight loss, muscle atrophy, and muscle fasciculations related to restricted intake of green forage.
METHODS: A case series is presented in which horses were subjected to a clinical examination and plasma vitamin E measurement. Five severely affected horses were euthanized for detailed postmortem examination. Muscle specimens were taken from the M. sacrocaudalis dorsalis medialis and the M. gluteus medius for histopathologic and morphometric evaluation.
RESULTS: MND was diagnosed in 5 horses based on clinical signs, low serum levels of vitamin E (0.11 ± 0.05 mg/dL; normal range,: 0.3-1.5 mg/dL), changes in muscle histopathology (neurogenic atrophy), and spinal cord lesions (neuronal chromatolysis in ventral horns). An unexpected postmortem finding was the presence of intestinal inflammation (catarrhal enteritis, edema, and eosinophilic infiltrate) associated with the presence of giant ciliated protozoa in all of the horses.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a mechanistic link could not be established, it is hypothesized that intestinal inflammation may have been involved in the decreased absorption of vitamin E, thus favoring the development of MND.","['Díez de Castro E', 'Zafra R', 'Acevedo LM', 'Pérez J', 'Acosta I', 'Rivero JL', 'Aguilera-Tejero E']",2016,30,3,J Vet Intern Med,"Díez de Castro E, et al.

26995730,Recent evidence for an expanded role of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism in neurological diseases.,"The kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan metabolism has emerged in recent years as a key regulator of the production of both neuroprotective (e.g. kynurenic and picolinic acid, and the essential cofactor NAD+) and neurotoxic metabolites (e.g. quinolinic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine). The balance between the production of the two types of metabolites is controlled by key rate-limiting enzymes such as indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), and in turn, molecular signals such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which activate the KP metabolism of tryptophan by this enzyme, as opposed to alternative pathways for serotonin and melatonin production. Dysregulated KP metabolism has been strongly associated with neurological diseases in recent years, and is the subject of increasing efforts to understand how the metabolites are causative of disease pathology. Concurrent with these endeavours are drug development initiatives to use inhibitors to block certain enzymes in the pathway, resulting in reduced levels of neurotoxic metabolites (e.g. quinolinic acid, an excitotoxin and N-Methyl-d-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist), while in turn enhancing the bioavailability of the neuroprotective metabolites such as kynurenic acid. Neurodegenerative diseases often have a substantial autoimmune or inflammatory component; hence a greater understanding of how KP metabolites influence the inflammatory cascade is required. Additionally, challenges exist in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and motor neurone disease (MND), which do not have reliable biomarkers. Clinical diagnosis can often be prolonged in order to exclude other diseases, and often diagnosis occurs at an advanced state of disease pathology, which does not allow a lengthy time for patient assessment and intervention therapies. This review considers the current evidence for involvement of the KP in several neurological diseases, in biomarkers of disease and also the parallels that exist in KP metabolism with what is known in other diseases such as HIV, Alzheimer's disease/dementia, infection, immune privilege and cardiovascular disease.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled adults with ALS and slow vital capacity (SVC) > 50% from 73 centers in eight countries. Patients who tolerated open-label tirasemtiv 125 mg b.i.d. for one week were randomized to double-blind treatment either to placebo or tirasemtiv, escalating to a maximum tolerated dose up to 250 mg b.i.d. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in ALSFRS-R; secondary endpoints included SVC, maximum voluntary ventilation, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, isometric muscle strength, and sub-maximum handgrip fatigue. Of 711 patients enrolled, 596 were randomized and received at least one dose of double-blind treatment. The primary endpoint showed no treatment effect (tirasemtiv: -2.98 ± 0.28, placebo: -2.40 ± 0.25, p = 0.114); however, SVC and muscle strength declined significantly more slowly on tirasemtiv (95% CI p = 0.0006, p = 0.0158, respectively). Dropouts and serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the tirasemtiv group.

26914558,Scintigraphic Evaluation of Mild to Moderate Dysphagia in Motor Neuron Disease.,"PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: Approximately 30% of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) present swallowing difficulties even in early disease stages. The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of esophageal scintigraphy in detecting early stage of dysphagia in MND.
METHODS: Esophageal scintigraphy (ES) including mean transit time (MTT) estimation was performed in 121 MND patients presenting various levels of upper (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration.
RESULTS: ES detected dysphagia in more than 80% of MND patients who had referenced swallowing difficulties. In MND patients with ES-confirmed dysphagia, the MTT was increased approximately 2-fold without significant differences between the clinical phenotypes. The MTT was significantly longer in patients with bulbar-pseudobulbar syndrome in comparison to patients with isolated pseudobulbar syndrome, which indicates a higher involvement of the LMN deficiency in developing dysphagia in MND. The esophageal passage in MND was not dependent on age, sex, disease duration, or diagnosis delay. Interestingly, ES was also able to detect dysphagia in almost 70% of MND individuals who had no swallowing complaints (subclinical dysphagia). A more benign disease course and a higher percentage of male patients characterized this group.
CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal scintigraphy is a helpful screening tool in determining early swallowing impairment in a high percent of patients with MND of various clinical phenotypes.","['Szacka K', 'Potulska-Chromik A', 'Fronczewska-Wieniawska K', 'Spychała A', 'Kròlicki L', 'Kuźma-Kozakiewicz M']",2016,41,4,Clin Nucl Med,"Szacka K, et al.

26913547,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and motor neuron disease: An unconfirmed association.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptors blockers (ARBs) and motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: This is a population-based nested case-control study. Data were obtained from a population registry and the administrative database of the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy) from 2000 through 2010. Included were 1,200 patients with newly diagnosed MND/ALS and 120,000 controls, randomly selected from the same population and matched for gender, age and area of residence. Exposure to ACEIs or ARBs was quantified using defined daily doses (DDDs). Cumulative DDD (cDDD) was estimated as the sum of dispensed DDDs in the preceding 5 years, excluding 1 year before the MND/ALS diagnosis. Overall exposure, levels of exposure, and individual drugs were all assessed. Subgroup analyses were performed according to age, sex, ALS and ACEI-ARB association.
RESULTS: There was no significant association between MND/ALS and antecedent use of ACEIs or ARBs. Data were confirmed in multivariable models and in subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: A protective role of ACEIs and ARBs in MND was not confirmed. Differences with a previous report (showing an inverse association between ACEIs and ALS) can be explained by different genetic background, dietary habits and susceptibility to environmental exposures, including drugs.","['Franchi C', 'Bianchi E', 'Pupillo E', 'Poloni M', 'Nobili A', 'Fortino I', 'Bortolotti A', 'Merlino L', 'Beghi E']",2016,17,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Franchi C, et al.

26911713,Family caregivers' accounts of caring for a family member with motor neurone disease in Norway: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurological disease causing muscle wasting, gradual paralysis, respiratory failure. MND care is demanding, complex and involves a variety of care tasks. Family members may experience significant and enduring strain. We conducted a qualitative study to understand more about family caregivers' work and sense of responsibility, exploring family caregivers' accounts of caring for a family member with MND.
METHODS: We recruited and interviewed a total of 25 participants from Norway, including 17 current and eight bereaved family caregivers. Drawing on theories of care by Corbin and Strauss, we analysed the data by a theoretical reading of the material to identify different types of care work.
RESULTS: We found that caregivers were engaged in five lines of care work that could be parallel or closely interconnected: i) immediate care work; ii) seeking information and clarity about the disease; iii) managing competing obligations; iv) maintaining normality; and v) managing external resources and assistance. Caregivers' priorities were shaped by their interactions with the person with MND, available assistive devices, the development of the illness, and utilisation of paid care. Care work had a symbolic and moral meaning for caregivers, and was associated with self-worth and respect from others. Caregivers tried to balance their own expectations and others' expectations without being overwhelmed by care work.
CONCLUSIONS: A changing and potentially chaotic situation for family caregivers may compromise their capacity to utilise supportive services. Using the lines of work as a framework to assess caregivers' preferences and priorities, health professionals may tailor assistance and support to family members caring for persons with MND.","['Lerum SV', 'Solbrække KN', 'Frich JC']",2016,15,,BMC Palliat Care,"Lerum SV, et al.

26858605,Adducin at the Neuromuscular Junction in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Hanging on for Dear Life.,"The neurological dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neurone disease (MND) is associated with defective nerve-muscle contacts early in the disease suggesting that perturbations of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) linking the pre- and post-synaptic components of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) are involved. To search for candidate proteins implicated in this degenerative process, researchers have studied the Drosophila larval NMJ and find that the cytoskeleton-associated protein, adducin, is ideally placed to regulate synaptic contacts. By controlling the levels of synaptic proteins, adducin can de-stabilize synaptic contacts. Interestingly, elevated levels of phosphorylated adducin have been reported in ALS patients and in a mouse model of the disease. Adducin is regulated by phosphorylation through protein kinase C (PKC), some isoforms of which exhibit Ca(2+)-dependence, raising the possibility that changes in intracellular Ca(2+) might alter PKC activation and secondarily influence adducin phosphorylation. Furthermore, adducin has interactions with the alpha subunit of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. Thus, the phosphorylation of adducin may secondarily influence synaptic stability at the NMJ and so influence pre- and post-synaptic integrity at the NMJ in ALS.","['Krieger C', 'Wang SJ', 'Yoo SH', 'Harden N']",2016,10,,Front Cell Neurosci,"Krieger C, et al.

26847526,Advance care planning in motor neuron disease: A qualitative study of caregiver perspectives.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease is a fatal disease, characterised by progressive loss of motor function, often associated with cognitive deterioration and, in some, the development of frontotemporal dementia. Life-sustaining technologies are available (e.g. non-invasive ventilation and enteral nutrition) but may compromise quality of life for some patients. Timely commencement of 'Advance Care Planning' enables patients to participate in future care choices; however, this approach has rarely been explored in motor neuron disease.
AIM: We aimed to investigate caregiver perspectives on the acceptability and impact of advance care planning, documented in a letter format, for patients with motor neuron disease and caregivers.
DESIGN: This is a qualitative cross-sectional study. Data were analysed by a narrative synthesis approach.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Structured interviews were held with 18 former caregivers of deceased patients with motor neuron disease. A total of 10 patients had created a disease-specific advanced directive, 'Letter of Future Care', and 8 had not.
RESULTS: A total of four global themes emerged: Readiness for death, Empowerment, Connections and Clarifying decisions and choices. Many felt the letter of future care was or would be beneficial, engendering autonomy and respect for patients, easing difficult decision-making and enhancing communication within families. However, individuals' 'readiness' to accept encroaching death would influence uptake. Appropriate timing to commence advance care planning may depend on case-based clinical and personal characteristics.
CONCLUSION: Advance care planning can assist patients to achieve a sense of control and 'peace of mind' and facilitates important family discussion. However, the timing and style of its introduction needs to be approached sensitively. Tools and strategies for increasing the efficacy of advance care planning for motor neuron disease should be evaluated and implemented.","['Murray L', 'Butow PN', 'White K', 'Kiernan MC', ""D'Abrew N"", 'Herz H']",2016,30,5,Palliat Med,"Murray L, et al.

26839121,Experiences and reflections of patients with motor neuron disease on breaking the news in a two-tiered appointment: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Breaking bad news should be fine-tuned to the individual patient, contain intelligible information, include emotional support and offer a tailor-made treatment plan. To achieve this goal in motor neuron disease (MND), neurologists of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) centre Amsterdam deliver the message on 2 separate visits within 14 days.
AIM: To evaluate how patients with MND react to and view disclosure of the diagnosis, in this 2-tiered approach.
METHODS: Non-participating observations and in-depth interviews with patients were conducted in 1 tertiary ALS referral centre. Qualitative analysis consisted of inductive analysis of observation reports and verbatim typed out interviews.
RESULTS: 10 2-tiered appointments were observed and 21 Dutch patients with MND interviewed. They experienced the straightforward message to be suffering from a fatal disease as devastating, yet unavoidable. The prospect of a short-term second appointment offered structure for the period immediately following the diagnosis. The time between appointments provided the opportunity for a first reorientation on their changed perspective on their life. The second appointment allowed for detailed discussions about various aspects of MND and a tailor-made treatment plan.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2-tiered approach fits well with the way in which Dutch patients with MND process the disclosure of their diagnosis, gather information and handle the changed perspective on their life.

26833930,Structural brain correlates of cognitive and behavioral impairment in MND.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the structural correlates of cognitive and behavioral impairment in motor neuron diseases (MND) using multimodal MRI.
METHODS: One hundred one patients with sporadic MND (56 classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 31 upper motor neuron phenotype, and 14 lower motor neuron phenotype) and 51 controls were enrolled. Patients were classified into MND with a pure motor syndrome (MND-motor) and with cognitive/behavioral symptoms (MND-plus). Cortical thickness measures and diffusion tensor (DT) metrics of white matter (WM) tracts were assessed. A random forest approach was used to explore the independent role of cortical and WM abnormalities in explaining major cognitive and behavioral symptoms.
RESULTS: There were 48 MND-motor and 53 MND-plus patients. Relative to controls, both patient groups showed a distributed cortical thinning of the bilateral precentral gyrus, insular and cingulate cortices, and frontotemporal regions. In all regions, there was a trend toward a more severe involvement in MND-plus cases, particularly in the temporal lobes. Both patient groups showed damage to the motor callosal fibers, which was more severe in MND-plus. MND-plus patients also showed a more severe involvement of the extra-motor WM tracts. The best predictors of executive and non-executive deficits and behavioral symptoms in MND were diffusivity abnormalities of the corpus callosum and frontotemporal tracts, including the uncinate, cingulum, and superior longitudinal fasciculi.
CONCLUSIONS: Cortical thinning and WM degeneration are highly associated with neuropsychological and behavioral symptoms in patients with MND. DT MRI metrics seem to be the most sensitive markers of extra-motor deficits within the MND spectrum.","['Agosta F', 'Ferraro PM', 'Riva N', 'Spinelli EG', 'Chiò A', 'Canu E', 'Valsasina P', 'Lunetta C', 'Iannaccone S', 'Copetti M', 'Prudente E', 'Comi G', 'Falini A', 'Filippi M']",2016,37,4,Hum Brain Mapp,"Agosta F, et al.

26822316,Metabolomics in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: how far can it take us?,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease. Alongside identification of aetiologies, development of biomarkers is a foremost research priority. Metabolomics is one promising approach that is being utilized in the search for diagnosis and prognosis markers. Our aim is to provide an overview of the principal research in metabolomics applied to ALS. References were identified using PubMed with the terms 'metabolomics' or 'metabolomic' and 'ALS' or 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis' or 'MND' or 'motor neuron disorders'. To date, nine articles have reported metabolomics research in patients and a few additional studies examined disease physiology and drug effects in patients or models. Metabolomics contribute to a better understanding of ALS pathophysiology but, to date, no biomarker has been validated for diagnosis, principally due to the heterogeneity of the disease and the absence of applied standardized methodology for biomarker discovery. A consensus on best metabolomics methodology as well as systematic independent validation will be an important accomplishment on the path to identifying the long-awaited biomarkers for ALS and to improve clinical trial designs.","['Blasco H', 'Patin F', 'Madji Hounoum B', 'Gordon PH', ""Vourc'h P"", 'Andres CR', 'Corcia P']",2016,23,3,Eur J Neurol,"Blasco H, et al.

28582251,Communications Technology and Motor Neuron Disease: An Australian Survey of People With Motor Neuron Disease.,"BACKGROUND: People with Motor Neuron Disease (MND), of which amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form in adults, typically experience difficulties with communication and disabilities associated with movement. Assistive technology is essential to facilitate everyday activities, promote social support and enhance quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the types of mainstream and commonly available communication technology used by people with MND including software and hardware, to identify the levels of confidence and skill that people with MND reported in using technology, to determine perceived barriers to the use of technology for communication, and to investigate the willingness of people with MND to adopt alternative modes of communication.
METHODS: An on-line survey was distributed to members of the New South Wales Motor Neuron Disease Association (MND NSW). Descriptive techniques were used to summarize frequencies of responses and cross tabulate data. Free-text responses to survey items and verbal comments from participants who chose to undertake the survey by telephone were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Responses from 79 MND NSW members indicated that 15-21% had difficulty with speaking, writing and/or using a keyboard. Commonly used devices were desktop computers, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. Most participants (84%) were connected to the Internet and used it for email (91%), to find out more about MND (59%), to follow the news (50%) or for on-line shopping (46%). A third of respondents used Skype or its equivalent, but few used this to interact with health professionals.
CONCLUSIONS: People with MND need greater awareness of technology options to access the most appropriate solutions. The timing for people with MND to make decisions about technology is critical. Health professionals need skills and knowledge about the application of technology to be able to work with people with MND to select the best communication technology options as early as possible after diagnosis. If people with MND are willing to trial telehealth technology, there is potential for tele-consultations via Skype or its equivalent, with health professionals. People with MND can benefit from health professional involvement to match technology to their functional limitations and personal preferences. However, health professionals need a comprehensive understanding of the application of available technology to achieve this.","['Mackenzie L', 'Bhuta P', 'Rusten K', 'Devine J', 'Love A', 'Waterson P']",2016,3,1,JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,"Mackenzie L, et al.

26798979,Clinical significance of cation channel antibodies in motor neuron disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Antibodies against cation channels, including voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex, voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC), and ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (gAChR), are detected in subgroups of autoimmune disorders, and rarely occur in motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: This investigation was a case-control study of 28 MND patients positive for cation channel antibodies in comparison with 56 age/gender/onset/diagnostic-category-matched MND patients without such antibodies.
RESULTS: One or more cation channel antibodies were detected in 6.9% of MND patients, mostly at low titers. The rate of MND progression determined by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was statistically indistinguishable between the antibody-positive and control groups. Incidence rates of cancer and coexisting autoimmune disorders were similar between both groups, based on non-comprehensive screening.
CONCLUSION: Cation channel antibodies in MND patients do not appear to affect disease progression. Routine testing for paraneoplastic antibodies is probably of limited usefulness in most MND patients.

26786249,Current Therapy of Drugs in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly termed as motor neuron disease (MND) in UK, is a chronically lethal disorder among the neurodegenerative diseases, meanwhile. ALS is basically irreversible and progressive deterioration of upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex, brain stem and medulla spinalis. Riluzole, used for the treatment of ALS, was demonstrated to slightly delay the initiation of respiratory dysfunction and extend the median survival of patients by a few months. In this study, the key biochemical defects were discussed, such as: mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, mitochondrial protectants, and anti-excitotoxic/ anti-oxidative / antiinflammatory/ anti-apoptotic agents, so the related drug candidates that have been studied in ALS models would possibly be further used in ALS patients.","['Lu H', 'Le WD', 'Xie YY', 'Wang XP']",2016,14,4,Curr Neuropharmacol,"Lu H, et al.

26763608,Maturation and electrophysiological properties of human pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes.,"Rodent-based studies have shown that the membrane properties of oligodendrocytes play prominent roles in their physiology and shift markedly during their maturation from the oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) stage. However, the conservation of these properties and maturation processes in human oligodendrocytes remains unknown, despite their dysfunction being implicated in human neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we have defined the membrane properties of human oligodendrocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells as they mature from the OPC stage, and have identified strong conservation of maturation-specific physiological characteristics reported in rodent systems. We find that as human oligodendrocytes develop and express maturation markers, they exhibit a progressive decrease in voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels and a loss of tetrodotoxin-sensitive spiking activity. Concomitant with this is an increase in inwardly rectifying potassium channel activity, as well as a characteristic switch in AMPA receptor composition. All these steps mirror the developmental trajectory observed in rodent systems. Oligodendrocytes derived from mutant C9ORF72-carryng ALS patient induced pluripotent stem cells did not exhibit impairment to maturation and maintain viability with respect to control lines despite the presence of RNA foci, suggesting that maturation defects may not be a primary feature of this mutation. Thus, we have established that the development of human oligodendroglia membrane properties closely resemble those found in rodent cells and have generated a platform to enable the impact of human neurodegenerative disease-causing mutations on oligodendrocyte maturation to be studied.","['Livesey MR', 'Magnani D', 'Cleary EM', 'Vasistha NA', 'James OT', 'Selvaraj BT', 'Burr K', 'Story D', 'Shaw CE', 'Kind PC', 'Hardingham GE', 'Wyllie DJ', 'Chandran S']",2016,34,4,Stem Cells,"Livesey MR, et al.

26746186,A large-scale multicentre cerebral diffusion tensor imaging study in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Damage to the cerebral tissue structural connectivity associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which extends beyond the motor pathways, can be visualised by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The effective translation of DTI metrics as biomarker requires its application across multiple MRI scanners and patient cohorts. A multicentre study was undertaken to assess structural connectivity in ALS within a large sample size.
METHODS: 442 DTI data sets from patients with ALS (N=253) and controls (N=189) were collected for this retrospective study, from eight international ALS-specialist clinic sites. Equipment and DTI protocols varied across the centres. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of the control participants were used to establish correction matrices to pool data, and correction algorithms were applied to the FA maps of the control and ALS patient groups.
RESULTS: Analysis of data pooled from all centres, using whole-brain-based statistical analysis of FA maps, confirmed the most significant alterations in the corticospinal tracts, and captured additional significant white matter tract changes in the frontal lobe, brainstem and hippocampal regions of the ALS group that coincided with postmortem neuropathological stages. Stratification of the ALS group for disease severity (ALS functional rating scale) confirmed these findings.
INTERPRETATION: This large-scale study overcomes the challenges associated with processing and analysis of multiplatform, multicentre DTI data, and effectively demonstrates the anatomical fingerprint patterns of changes in a DTI metric that reflect distinct ALS disease stages. This success paves the way for the use of DTI-based metrics as read-out in natural history, prognostic stratification and multisite disease-modifying studies in ALS.","['Müller HP', 'Turner MR', 'Grosskreutz J', 'Abrahams S', 'Bede P', 'Govind V', 'Prudlo J', 'Ludolph AC', 'Filippi M', 'Kassubek J', 'Neuroimaging Society in ALS (NiSALS) DTI Study Group']",2016,87,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Müller HP, et al.

26703636,A Temporal Association between Accumulated Petrol (Gasoline) Lead Emissions and Motor Neuron Disease in Australia.,"BACKGROUND: The age standardised death rate from motor neuron disease (MND) has increased from 1.29 to 2.74 per 100,000, an increase of 112.4% between 1959 and 2013. It is clear that genetics could not have played a causal role in the increased rate of MND deaths over such a short time span. We postulate that environmental factors are responsible for this rate increase. We focus on lead additives in Australian petrol as a possible contributing environmental factor.
METHODS: The associations between historical petrol lead emissions and MND death trends in Australia between 1962 and 2013 were examined using linear regressions.
RESULTS: Regression results indicate best fit correlations between a 20 year lag of petrol lead emissions and age-standardised female death rate (R² = 0.86, p = 4.88 × 10(-23)), male age standardised death rate (R² = 0.86, p = 9.4 × 10(-23)) and percent all cause death attributed to MND (R² = 0.98, p = 2.6 × 10(-44)).
CONCLUSION: Legacy petrol lead emissions are associated with increased MND death trends in Australia. Further examination of the 20 year lag between exposure to petrol lead and the onset of MND is warranted.","['Laidlaw MA', 'Rowe DB', 'Ball AS', 'Mielke HW']",2015,12,12,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Laidlaw MA, et al.

26638977,Nanoemulsions for Intranasal Delivery of Riluzole to Improve Brain Bioavailability: Formulation Development and Pharmacokinetic Studies.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deterioration of both upper and lower motor neurons. Only one drug (riluzole) has been approved for the treatment of ALS. Riluzole is a BCS class II drug having 60% absolute bioavailability. It is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and BBB restricts its entry in brain.
OBJECTIVE: This investigation was aimed to develop O/W nanoemulsion system of riluzole to improve its brain bioavailability.
METHODS: Riluzole loaded nanoemulsion was prepared by phase titration method. It was consisting of 3% w/w Sefsol 218, 28.3% w/w Tween 80:Carbitol (1:1) and 68.7% w/w water. It was characterized for drop size, drop size distribution, transmittance, viscosity, pH, zeta potential, conductivity and nasal ciliotoxicity study. Thermodynamic stability and room temperature stability of prepared nanoemulsion formulation were evaluated. Pharmacokinetic and brain uptake study was carried out using albino rats (wistar) post intranasal and oral administration.
RESULTS: Riluzole loaded nanoemulsion was having a drop size of 23.92±0.52 nm. It was free from nasal ciliotoxicity and stable for three months. Brain uptake of riluzole post intranasal administration of riluzole loaded nanoemulsion was significantly (P <4.10 × 10-6) higher when it was compared with oral administration of riluzole loaded nanoemulsion.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that nanoemulsion of riluzole for intranasal administration could be a promising approach for the treatment of ALS to minimize the dose of riluzole in order to avoid dose related adverse events.","['Parikh RH', 'Patel RJ']",2016,13,7,Curr Drug Deliv,Parikh RH and Patel RJ.

26635722,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Functional MRI Investigation of Motor Neuron Disease.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in motor neuron disease (MND), a systematic review and voxelwise meta-analysis of studies comparing brain activity in patients with MND and in healthy controls was conducted to identify common findings across studies.
METHODS: A search for related papers published in English and Chinese was performed in Ovid Medline, Pubmed, and Embase database. Voxelwise meta-analysis was performed using signed differential mapping.
RESULTS: The findings from 55 fMRI studies on MND were tabulated, and some common findings were discussed in further details.
CONCLUSION: These findings are preliminary, sometimes even contradictory, and do not allow a complete understanding of the functional alterations in MND. However, we documented reliable findings that MND is not confined to the motor system, but is a multisystem disorder involving extra-motor cortex areas, causing cognitive dysfunction and deficits in socioemotional and sensory processing pathways.","['Shen D', 'Cui L', 'Cui B', 'Fang J', 'Li D', 'Ma J']",2015,6,,Front Neurol,"Shen D, et al.

26609553,Receiving the news of a diagnosis of motor neuron disease: What does it take to make it better?,"Our objectives were to identify the experiences of people with MND in receiving the diagnosis and to determine which aspects of breaking this bad news were associated with greater satisfaction with the way the diagnosis was delivered to them. An anonymous postal survey was facilitated by all MND associations in Australia, in 2014, and centred on the SPIKES protocol for communicating bad news. Of the patients (n = 248, response rate 29%), 36% were dissatisfied with the delivery of the diagnosis and gave low ratings on the ability/skills of their neurologists to deliver the diagnosis. It was evident that the longer the patients spent with their neurologists during breaking such bad news, the more they were satisfied and the higher they rated the neurologists' abilities/skills. The largest significant differences between neurologists rated as having high or low skills in delivering the diagnosis were in four domains: 1) responding empathically to the feelings of patient/family; 2) sharing the information and suggesting realistic goals; 3) exploring what patient/family are expecting or hoping for; and 4) making a plan and following through. In conclusion, with over one-third of patients dissatisfied with their experience, there is room for improvement in the practice of neurologists in specified areas that could form the basis for changing practice, and the development of standards and protocols likely to have implications at the international level.","['Aoun SM', 'Breen LJ', 'Howting D', 'Edis R', 'Oliver D', 'Henderson R', ""O'Connor M"", 'Harris R', 'Birks C']",2016,17,3-4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Aoun SM, et al.

26604769,Frequency and risk factor analysis of cognitive and anxiety-depressive disorders in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the frequency and risk factors of cognitive and anxiety-depressive disorders in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND).
METHODS: This was an observational study of 100 ALS/MND patients treated at our hospital outpatient and inpatient departments between January 2009 and April 2010 and 100 matched healthy controls. Subjects were surveyed using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Patient neurological status was graded by the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS). Multivariate linear regression was used to identify factors associated with the MMSE, SAS, SDS, and ALSFRS scores.
RESULTS: Patients had significantly lower MMSE scores than controls (P<0.05). MMSE score did not differ by sex or age (<50/≥50 years) (P>0.05). Patients with higher educational level (college and above), shorter disease course (<2 years), and lower ALSFRS score (<20) had significantly higher MMSE scores (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that higher education, shorter disease course, and lower ALSFRS score were independent predictors of better cognitive function (higher MMSE score). Patients had significantly higher mean SAS and SDS total scores than controls (both P<0.05), indicating higher subjective anxiety and depression. Female patients, patients with higher education, and those with higher ALSFRS scores had significantly higher SAS and SDS scores (all P<0.05). Age, occupation, diagnostic classification, disease duration, and disease awareness did not influence SAS or SDS scores. Multivariate analysis indicated that lower education and lower ALSFRS were protective factors against anxiety and depression.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of anxiety-depressive disorders was high among patients with ALS/MND. High educational level, short course of disease, and lower ALSFRS were associated with preserved cognitive function. Female sex, higher education, and lower ALSFRS score conferred a greater risk of anxiety and depression. Tailored pharmacotherapy and psychological interventions may help in reducing anxiety and depression in these patients.","['Cui F', 'Zhu W', 'Zhou Z', 'Ren Y', 'Li Y', 'Li M', 'Huo Y', 'Huang X']",2015,11,,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,"Cui F, et al.

BACKGROUND: There have been rare case reports of paraneoplastic MND that have prompted many physicians to test for paraneoplastic autoantibodies in patients with MND. Our study is the first to determine the utility of such testing.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients with MND from a tertiary referral center from 2007 to 2014.
RESULTS: Of 316 patients with MND reviewed, 44% (n = 138) were evaluated by a Mayo Clinic paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. Of note, 73% of these patients (n = 101) were diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, fulfilling possible, probable, or definite revised El Escorial criteria. Of note, 9% of patients (13/138) of those who had paraneoplastic antibody testing performed were positive for at least 1 paraneoplastic antibody. Three patients had negative testing for malignancy. None had a different disease course than expected.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing for paraneoplastic antibodies does not seem to change the diagnosis, management, or outcome in the setting of MND and is therefore of limited value.","['Al-Bustani N', 'Simonson W', 'Marshall DA', 'Vetrovs J', 'Wener MH', 'Weiss MD', 'Wang LH']",2015,17,2,J Clin Neuromuscul Dis,"Al-Bustani N, et al.

The pathogenesis of ALS is a topic of fascinating speculation and experimentation, with theories revolving around intracellular protein inclusions, mitochondrial structural issues, glutamate excitotoxicity and free radical formation. This review explores the rationale for the involvement of a novel protein, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11b (Bcl11b) in ALS. Bcl11b is a multifunctional zinc finger protein transcription factor. It functions as both a transactivator and genetic suppressor, acting both directly, binding to promoter regions, and indirectly, binding to promoter-bound transcription factors. It has essential roles in the differentiation and growth of various cells in the central nervous system, immune system, integumentary system and cardiovascular system, to the extent that Bcl11b knockout mice are incompatible with extra-uterine life. It also has various roles in pathology including the suppression of latent retroviruses, thymic tumourigenesis and neurodegeneration. In particular its functions in neurodevelopment, viral latency and T-cell development suggest potential roles in ALS pathology.","['Lennon MJ', 'Jones SP', 'Lovelace MD', 'Guillemin GJ', 'Brew BJ']",2016,29,2,Neurotox Res,"Lennon MJ, et al.

We studied novel parameters, UES admittance (inverse of nadir impedance), and 0.2-s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP), in patients with cricopharyngeal bar (CPB) and motor neuron disease (MND), as predictors of UES dysfunction.
METHODS: Sixty-six healthy subjects (n = 50 controls 20-80 years; n = 16 elderly >80 years), 11 patients with CPB (51-83 years) and 16 with MND (58-91 years) were studied using pharyngeal high-resolution impedance manometry. Subjects received 5 × 5 mL liquid (L) and viscous (V) boluses. Admittance and IRP were compared by age and between groups. A p < 0.05 was considered significant.
KEY RESULTS: In healthy subjects, admittance was reduced (L: p = 0.005 and V: p = 0.04) and the IRP higher with liquids (p = 0.02) in older age. Admittance was reduced in MND compared to both healthy groups (Young: p < 0.0001 for both, Elderly L: p < 0.0001 and V: p = 0.009) and CPB with liquid (p = 0.001). Only liquid showed a higher IRP in MND patients compared to controls (p = 0.03), but was similar to healthy elderly and CPB patients. Only admittance differentiated younger controls from CPB (L: p = 0.0002 and V: p < 0.0001), with no differences in either parameter between CPB and elderly subjects.
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: The effects of aging and pathology were better discriminated by UES maximum admittance, demonstrating greater statistical confidence across bolus consistencies as compared to 0.2-s IRP. Maximum admittance may be a clinically useful determinate of UES dysfunction.","['Cock C', 'Besanko L', 'Kritas S', 'Burgstad CM', 'Thompson A', 'Heddle R', 'Fraser RJ', 'Omari TI']",2016,28,2,Neurogastroenterol Motil,"Cock C, et al.

26538301,Neurodegeneration in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor neurone disease associated with expansions in C9orf72 is linked to TDP-43 pathology and not associated with aggregated forms of dipeptide repeat proteins.,"AIMS: A hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72 is the major genetic cause of inherited behavioural variant Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and motor neurone disease (MND), although the pathological mechanism(s) underlying disease remains uncertain.
METHODS: Using antibodies to poly-GA, poly-GP, poly-GR, poly-AP and poly-PR proteins, we examined sections of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum and spinal cord, from 20 patients with bvFTD and/or MND bearing an expansion in C9orf72 for aggregated deposits of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR).
RESULTS: Antibodies to poly-GA, poly-GP and poly-GR detected numerous rounded cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) within granule cells of hippocampal dentate gyrus and those of the cerebellum, as well as 'star-burst' shaped NCI in pyramidal neurones of CA3/4 region of hippocampus. NCI were uncommon in Purkinje cells, and only very rarely seen in anterior horn cells. Poly-PA antibody detected occasional NCI within CA3/4 neurones alone, whereas poly-PR antibody did not identify any NCI but immunostained the nucleus of anterior horn cells, CA3/4 neurones and Purkinje cells, in patients with or without expansion in C9orf72, as well as in normal controls. Poly-GA antibody generally detected more DPR than poly-GP, which in turn was greater than poly-GR. All patients with bvFTD + MND or MND showed plentiful p62/TDP-43 positive inclusions in remaining anterior horn cells.
CONCLUSION: Degeneration and loss of anterior horn cells associated with expansions in C9orf72 occurs in the absence of DPR, and implies that changes involving loss of nuclear staining for and a cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 are more likely to be the cause of this.","['Davidson Y', 'Robinson AC', 'Liu X', 'Wu D', 'Troakes C', 'Rollinson S', 'Masuda-Suzukake M', 'Suzuki G', 'Nonaka T', 'Shi J', 'Tian J', 'Hamdalla H', 'Ealing J', 'Richardson A', 'Jones M', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Snowden JS', 'Hasegawa M', 'Mann DM']",2016,42,3,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Davidson Y, et al.

26521757,Motor neurone disease in Lancashire and South Cumbria in North West England and an 8 year experience with enteral nutrition.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of unknown aetiology. Malnutrition is a common occurrence and an independent risk factor for worse prognosis. However, it remains unclear whether provision of enteral nutrition (EN) through a gastrostomy tube offers any survival advantage. Our aim was to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of MND in Lancashire and South Cumbria in North West England and the impact of EN on survival in the 8 year period of 2005-2012. Four hundred and seven patients with MND were identified through the Preston MND care and research centre registry giving a crude incidence rate of 3.15/100,000. Three hundred and forty patients with adequate information were included in the final analysis of whom 53.2% were male. The presentation was limb/spinal in 62.1% and bulbar in 37.9% of patients, bulbar onset being more common in elderly females. Mean age of onset was 67.28 years (standard deviation 11.06; range 22.78-93.06). Median survival was 1.98 years (range 1.18-3.05). Ninety-one patients received EN of whom 67% had bulbar onset disease. EN was not associated with a statistically significant survival advantage except for the subgroup who received EN more than 500 days after symptom onset. In conclusion, the early requirement for EN may indicate a prognostically less favourable subgroup.","['Chhetri SK', 'Bradley BF', 'Majeed T', 'Lea RW']",2016,24,,J Clin Neurosci,"Chhetri SK, et al.

26462880,Advance care planning in motor neuron disease: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Motor neuron disease (MND) is an incurable progressive illness, characterized by incessant deterioration of neuromuscular function. Timely commencement of advance care planning (ACP) may enable patients to participate in future care choices. The present systematic review aimed to summarize what is known about the prevalence, content, patient/caregiver benefits, healthcare professional (HCP) awareness/support, and healthcare outcomes associated with ACP in the MND setting.
METHOD: Quantitative and qualitative studies were identified through database searches and eligibility assessed by one author and verified by her coauthor. Data extraction and quality assessments against standardized criteria were completed by the two authors.
RESULTS: Of the 422 studies identified, 16 were included. The research methods generally lacked rigor. Advance directive (AD) prevalence varied considerably across studies. Disease progression was the strongest predictor of AD completion. ACP processes may clarify patients' wishes and promote communication. HCP attitudes or lack of awareness may limit ACP processes. Varying patient preferences may make flexible approaches and timing necessary.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Important benefits may be associated with ACP in the context of a motor neuron disease (e.g., feelings of control/relief and refusal of unwanted treatments). However, further evidence is required to verify findings and identify optimal streamlined approaches (e.g., use of decision aids) consistent with patients' (and caregivers') needs over time.","['Murray L', 'Butow PN']",2016,14,4,Palliat Support Care,Murray L and Butow PN.

26401819,Screening for C9orf72 Expansion Mutation in Serbian Patients with Early-Onset Dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia (EOD), characterized by behavioral changes (behavioral variant; bvFTD) or language deficits. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a noncoding region of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) has been proved to be a major cause of both familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or FTD, with or without concomitant motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of the C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion in a cohort of 117 Serbian patients with EOD and to report phenotypic features of identified carriers.
RESULTS: We identified 4 of 117 (3.4%) patients with EOD to have C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansions. All patients were classified in the FTD disease spectrum group (8.2%): 3 patients fulfilled the criteria for bvFTD, and 1 patient had FTD-MND. None of the patients with the C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for language variants of FTD, FTD-progressive supranuclear palsy overlap syndrome, dementia with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer's dementia.
CONCLUSION: In a cohort of consecutive patients with EOD, 3.4% had the C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion with clinical phenotypes of bvFTD or an overlap of bvFTD and MND.","['Mandic-Stojmenovic G', 'Stefanova E', 'Dobricic V', 'Novakovic I', 'Stojkovic T', 'Jesic A', 'Kostic V']",2015,40,5-6,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,"Mandic-Stojmenovic G, et al.

26388768,Phenotypic Heterogeneity of Monogenic Frontotemporal Dementia.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a genetically and pathologically heterogeneous disorder characterized by personality changes, language impairment, and deficits of executive functions associated with frontal and temporal lobe degeneration. Different phenotypes have been defined on the basis of presenting clinical symptoms, i.e., the behavioral variant of FTD, the agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia, and the semantic variant of PPA. Some patients have an associated movement disorder, either parkinsonism, as in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome, or motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). A family history of dementia is found in 40% of cases of FTD and about 10% have a clear autosomal-dominant inheritance. Genetic studies have identified several genes associated with monogenic FTD: microtubule-associated protein tau, progranulin, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, valosin-containing protein, charged multivesicular body protein 2B, fused in sarcoma, and the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72. Patients often present with an extensive phenotypic variability, even among different members of the same kindred carrying an identical disease mutation. The objective of the present work is to review and evaluate available literature data in order to highlight recent advances in clinical, biological, and neuroimaging features of monogenic frontotemporal lobar degeneration and try to identify different mechanisms underlying the extreme phenotypic heterogeneity that characterizes this disease.","['Benussi A', 'Padovani A', 'Borroni B']",2015,7,,Front Aging Neurosci,"Benussi A, et al.

26374446,Quantitative analysis and clinico-pathological correlations of different dipeptide repeat protein pathologies in C9ORF72 mutation carriers.,"Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease. One consequence of the mutation is the formation of different potentially toxic polypeptides composed of dipeptide repeats (DPR) (poly-GA, -GP, -GR, -PA, -PR) generated by repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. While previous studies focusing on poly-GA pathology have failed to detect any clinico-pathological correlations in C9ORF72 mutation cases, recent data from animal and cell culture models suggested that it may be only specific DPR species that are toxic and only when accumulated in certain intracellular compartments. Therefore, we performed a systematic clinico-pathological correlative analysis with counting of actual numbers of distinct types of inclusion (neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions, dystrophic neurites) for each DPR protein in relevant brain regions (premotor cortex, lower motor neurons) in a cohort of 35 C9ORF72 mutation cases covering the clinical spectrum from those with pure MND, mixed FTD/MND and pure FTD. While each DPR protein pathology had a similar pattern of anatomical distribution, the total amount of inclusions for each DPR protein varied remarkably (poly-GA > GP > GR > PR/PA), indicating that RAN translation seems to be more effective from sense than from antisense transcripts. Importantly, with the exception of moderate associations for the amount of poly-GA-positive dystrophic neurites with degeneration in the frontal cortex and total burden of poly-GA pathology with disease onset, no relationship was identified for any other DPR protein pathology with degeneration or phenotype. Biochemical analysis revealed a close correlation between insoluble DPR protein species and numbers of visible inclusions, while we did not find any evidence for the presence of soluble DPR protein species. Thus, overall our findings strongly argue against a role of DPR protein aggregation as major and exclusive pathomechanism in C9ORF72 pathogenesis. However, this does not exclude that DPR protein formation might be essential in C9ORF72 pathogenesis in interplay with other consequences associated with the C9ORF72 repeat expansion.","['Mackenzie IR', 'Frick P', 'Grässer FA', 'Gendron TF', 'Petrucelli L', 'Cashman NR', 'Edbauer D', 'Kremmer E', 'Prudlo J', 'Troost D', 'Neumann M']",2015,130,6,Acta Neuropathol,"Mackenzie IR, et al.

26362794,Withdrawal of ventilation at the patient's request in MND: a retrospective exploration of the ethical and legal issues that have arisen for doctors in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: Ventilatory support has benefits including prolonging survival for respiratory failure in motor neurone disease (MND). At some point some patients may wish to stop the intervention. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends research is needed on ventilation withdrawal. There is little literature focusing on the issues doctors encounter when withdrawing ventilation at the request of a patient.
AIM: To identify and explore with doctors the ethical and legal issues that they had encountered in the withdrawal of ventilation at the request of a patient with MND.
METHOD: A retrospective thematic analysis of interviews of 24 doctors (including palliative care, respiratory, neurology and general practice) regarding their experiences with withdrawal of ventilation support from patients with MND.
RESULTS: Respondents found withdrawal of ventilation at the request of patients with MND to pose legal, ethical and moral challenges in five themes: ethical and legal rights to withdrawal from treatment; discussions with family; discussions with colleagues; experiences of legal advice; issues contributing to ethical complexity. Though clear about the legality of withdrawal of treatment in theory, the practice led to ethical and moral uncertainty and mixed feelings. Many respondents had experienced negative reactions from other healthcare professionals when these colleagues were unclear of the distinction between palliation of symptoms, withdrawal of treatment and assisted death.
CONCLUSIONS: Legal, ethical and practical guidance is needed for professionals who support a patient with MND who wishes to withdraw from ventilation. Open discussion of the ethical challenges is needed as well as education and support for professionals.","['Phelps K', 'Regen E', 'Oliver D', 'McDermott C', 'Faull C']",2017,7,2,BMJ Support Palliat Care,"Phelps K, et al.

26350237,Cerebellar c9RAN proteins associate with clinical and neuropathological characteristics of C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers.,"Clinical and neuropathological characteristics associated with G4C2 repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72), the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, are highly variable. To gain insight on the molecular basis for the heterogeneity among C9ORF72 mutation carriers, we evaluated associations between features of disease and levels of two abundantly expressed ""c9RAN proteins"" produced by repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation of the expanded repeat. For these studies, we took a departure from traditional immunohistochemical approaches and instead employed immunoassays to quantitatively measure poly(GP) and poly(GA) levels in cerebellum, frontal cortex, motor cortex, and/or hippocampus from 55 C9ORF72 mutation carriers [12 patients with ALS, 24 with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and 19 with FTLD with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND)]. We additionally investigated associations between levels of poly(GP) or poly(GA) and cognitive impairment in 15 C9ORF72 ALS patients for whom neuropsychological data were available. Among the neuroanatomical regions investigated, poly(GP) levels were highest in the cerebellum. In this same region, associations between poly(GP) and both neuropathological and clinical features were detected. Specifically, cerebellar poly(GP) levels were significantly lower in patients with ALS compared to patients with FTLD or FTLD-MND. Furthermore, cerebellar poly(GP) associated with cognitive score in our cohort of 15 patients. In the cerebellum, poly(GA) levels similarly trended lower in the ALS subgroup compared to FTLD or FTLD-MND subgroups, but no association between cerebellar poly(GA) and cognitive score was detected. Both cerebellar poly(GP) and poly(GA) associated with C9ORF72 variant 3 mRNA expression, but not variant 1 expression, repeat size, disease onset, or survival after onset. Overall, these data indicate that cerebellar abnormalities, as evidenced by poly(GP) accumulation, associate with neuropathological and clinical phenotypes, in particular cognitive impairment, of C9ORF72 mutation carriers.","['Gendron TF', 'van Blitterswijk M', 'Bieniek KF', 'Daughrity LM', 'Jiang J', 'Rush BK', 'Pedraza O', 'Lucas JA', 'Murray ME', 'Desaro P', 'Robertson A', 'Overstreet K', 'Thomas CS', 'Crook JE', 'Castanedes-Casey M', 'Rousseau L', 'Josephs KA', 'Parisi JE', 'Knopman DS', 'Petersen RC', 'Boeve BF', 'Graff-Radford NR', 'Rademakers R', 'Lagier-Tourenne C', 'Edbauer D', 'Cleveland DW', 'Dickson DW', 'Petrucelli L', 'Boylan KB']",2015,130,4,Acta Neuropathol,"Gendron TF, et al.

26347879,Motor Neuron Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Need for More Population-Based Studies.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are devastating neurological diseases that are characterised by gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. Major types of MNDs include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). These diseases are incurable, with limited disease-modifying treatment options. In order to improve MND-based biomedical research, drug development, and clinical care, population-based studies will be important. These studies, especially among less-studied populations, might identify novel factors controlling disease susceptibility and resistance. To evaluate progress in MND research in Africa, we examined the published literature on MNDs in Sub-Saharan Africa to identify disease prevalence, genetic factors, and other risk factors. Our findings indicate that the amount of research evidence on MNDs in Sub-Saharan Africa is scanty; molecular and genetics-based studies are particularly lacking. While only a few genetic studies were identified, these studies strongly suggest that there appear to be population-specific causes of MNDs among Africans. MND genetic underpinnings vary among different African populations and also between African and non-African populations. Further studies, especially molecular, genetic and genomic studies, will be required to advance our understanding of MND biology among African populations. Insights from these studies would help to improve the timeliness and accuracy of clinical diagnosis and treatment.","['Quansah E', 'Karikari TK']",2015,2015,,Biomed Res Int,Quansah E and Karikari TK.

26315075,Behavioral Symptoms in Motor Neuron Disease and Their Negative Impact on Caregiver Burden.,"BACKGROUND: The spectrum of abnormal behaviors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) has been described, but its practical meaning, namely its impact on caregiver burden, has not been clearly documented in Chinese population. This study aimed to assess the distribution of abnormal behaviors in Chinese population, and to analyze the relationship between behavior changes and caregiver burden.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients with ALS/MND have been consecutively enrolled into registry platform of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. An investigation was performed to these patients and their caregivers using the revised ALS function rating scale, Frontal Behavioral Inventory-ALS version, the Frontal Assessment Battery, and the Caregiver Burden Inventory.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight (43.1%) patients displayed abnormal behaviors of varying degrees, with one fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of frontotemporal lobe degeneration. Irritability, logopenia, and inflexibility ranked top 3 of abnormal behavior list. Correlation analysis revealed that the degree of behavioral change and frontal cognitive status were significantly associated with caregiver burden, with more extensive impact from disinhibitive behaviors. Analysis of covariance analysis showed that after associated factors were corrected, caregivers of patients with moderate to severe behavior change reported significantly heavier developmental burden, physical burden, and total burden than those with no behavioral change.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurobehavioral symptoms could present in around 40% of Chinese patients with ALS/MND, and the distribution of these behaviors was also unique. Besides, abnormal behaviors were highly related to caregivers' burden.","['Cui B', 'Cui LY', 'Liu MS', 'Li XG', 'Ma JF', 'Fang J', 'Ding QY']",2015,128,17,Chin Med J (Engl),"Cui B, et al.

26296871,Neurofilaments in the diagnosis of motoneuron diseases: a prospective study on 455 patients.,"OBJECTIVES: Biomarkers for the diagnosis of motoneuron diseases (MND) are urgently needed to improve the diagnostic pathway, patient stratification and monitoring. The aim of this study was to validate candidate markers for MND in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and specify cut-offs based on large patient cohorts by especially considering patients who were seen under the initial differential diagnosis (MND mimics).
METHODS: In a prospective study, we investigated CSF of 455 patients for neurofilament light chain (NfL), phosphorylated heavy chain (pNfH), tau protein (Tau) and phospho-tau protein (pTau). Analysed cohorts included patients with apparently sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) (MND, n=253), MND mimics (n=85) and neurological control groups. Cut-off values were specified, and diagnostic performance and correlation with progression were analysed.
RESULTS: Nfs were significantly higher in the MND group compared to the control groups, whereas Tau and pTau did not differ. At a cut-off level of 2200 pg/mL for NfL, a 77% diagnostic sensitivity (CI 71% to 82%), 85% specificity (CI 79% to 90%) and 87% positive predictive value (PPV) (CI 81% to 91%) were achieved. For pNfH, we calculated 83% sensitivity (CI 78% to 88%), 77% specificity (CI 71% to 83%) and 82% PPV (CI 77% to 86%) at 560 pg/mL. There were no significant differences between sporadic and genetic ALS or PLS. Nf levels were elevated at early disease stage, and correlated moderately with MND progression and duration.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurofilaments in CSF have a high relevance for the differential diagnosis of MNDs and should be included in the diagnostic work-up of patients. Their value as prognostic markers should be investigated further.","['Steinacker P', 'Feneberg E', 'Weishaupt J', 'Brettschneider J', 'Tumani H', 'Andersen PM', 'von Arnim CA', 'Böhm S', 'Kassubek J', 'Kubisch C', 'Lulé D', 'Müller HP', 'Muche R', 'Pinkhardt E', 'Oeckl P', 'Rosenbohm A', 'Anderl-Straub S', 'Volk AE', 'Weydt P', 'Ludolph AC', 'Otto M']",2016,87,1,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Steinacker P, et al.

26295823,GSTP1 Polymorphisms and their Association with Glutathione Transferase and Peroxidase Activities in Patients with Motor Neuron Disease.,"Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) is a crucial enzyme in detoxification of electrophilic compounds and organic peroxides. Together with Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GSHPx) it protects cells against oxidative stress which may be a primary factor implicated in motor neuron disease (MND) pathogenesis. We investigated GSTP1 polymorphisms and their relationship with GST and Se-GSTPx activities in a cohort of Polish patients with MND. Results were correlated with clinical phenotypes. The frequency of genetic variants for GSTP1 exon 5 (I105V) and exon 6 (A114V) was studied in 104 patients and 100 healthy controls using real-time polymerase chain reaction. GST transferase activity was determined in serum with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, its peroxidase activity with cumene hydroperoxide, and Se-GSHPx activity with hydrogen peroxide. There were no differences in the prevalence of GSTP1 polymorphism I105V and A114V between MND and controls, however the occurrence of CT variant in codon 114 was associated with a higher risk for MND. GSTP1 polymorphisms were less frequent in classic ALS than in progressive bulbar palsy. In classic ALS C* (heterozygous I /V and A /V) all studied activities were significantly lower than in classic ALS A* (homozygous I /I and A/A). GST peroxidase activity and Se-GSHPx activity were lower in classic ALS C* than in control C*, but in classic ALS A* Se-GSHPx activity was significantly higher than in control A*. It can be concluded that the presence of GSTP1 A114V but not I105V variant increases the risk of MND, and combined GSTP1 polymorphisms in codon 105 and 114 may result in lower protection of MND patients against the toxicity of electrophilic compounds, organic and inorganic hydroperoxides.","['Gajewska B', 'Kaźmierczak B', 'Kuźma-Kozakiewicz M', 'Jamrozik Z', 'Barańczyk-Kuźma A']",2015,14,10,CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets,"Gajewska B, et al.

26239255,Designing an Internationally Accessible Web-Based Questionnaire to Discover Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Case-Control Study.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with a typical survival of three to five years. Epidemiological studies using paper-based questionnaires in individual countries or continents have failed to find widely accepted risk factors for the disease. The advantages of online versus paper-based questionnaires have been extensively reviewed, but few online epidemiological studies into human neurodegenerative diseases have so far been undertaken.
OBJECTIVE: To design a Web-based questionnaire to identify environmental risk factors for ALS and enable international comparisons of these risk factors.
METHODS: A Web-based epidemiological questionnaire for ALS has been developed based on experience gained from administering a previous continent-wide paper-based questionnaire for this disease. New and modified questions have been added from our previous paper-based questionnaire, from literature searches, and from validated ALS questionnaires supplied by other investigators. New criteria to allow the separation of familial and sporadic ALS cases have been included. The questionnaire addresses many risk factors that have already been proposed for ALS, as well as a number that have not yet been rigorously examined. To encourage participation, responses are collected anonymously and no personally identifiable information is requested. The survey is being translated into a number of languages which will allow many people around the world to read and answer it in their own language.
RESULTS: After the questionnaire had been online for 4 months, it had 379 respondents compared to only 46 respondents for the same initial period using a paper-based questionnaire. The average age of the first 379 web questionnaire respondents was 54 years compared to the average age of 60 years for the first 379 paper questionnaire respondents. The questionnaire is soon to be promoted in a number of countries through ALS associations and disease registries.
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based questionnaires are a time- and resource-efficient method for performing large epidemiological studies of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS. The ability to compare risk factors between different countries using the same analysis tool will be of particular value for finding robust risk factors that underlie ALS.","['Parkin Kullmann JA', 'Hayes S', 'Wang MX', 'Pamphlett R']",2015,4,3,JMIR Res Protoc,"Parkin Kullmann JA, et al.

Autosomal recessively inherited MND is less common and is most often caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. In 2010, autosomal recessively inherited mutations in the optineurin (OPTN) gene were found in 1% of Japanese patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Autosomal dominantly inherited OPTN mutations have been described as a cause of primary open-angle glaucoma in the Netherlands and were also found in two Dutch sporadic MND patients. We report the first Dutch family with autosomal recessively inherited MND caused by mutations in the OPTN gene.","['Beeldman E', 'van der Kooi AJ', 'de Visser M', 'van Maarle MC', 'van Ruissen F', 'Baas F']",2015,16,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Beeldman E, et al.

26203157,Multidimensional apathy in ALS: validation of the Dimensional Apathy Scale.,"AIM: Apathy is a prominent symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but measurement is confounded by physical disability. Furthermore, it has been traditionally measured as a unidimensional symptom despite research demonstrating a multifaceted construct. The new Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) has been specifically designed for patients with motor disability to measure 3 neurologically based subtypes of apathy: Executive, Emotional and Initiation. We aimed to explore this behavioural symptom by examining the substructure of apathy in ALS and to determine the reliability and validity of the DAS in patients and their carers.
METHOD: Patients and carers were recruited through the national Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Register and were asked to complete the DAS, the standardised Apathy Evaluation Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. 83 patients with ALS, 75 carers and 83 sex-matched, age-matched and education-matched controls participated.
RESULTS: When compared with healthy controls, patients showed a significant increase in apathy on the Initiation subscale, and were significantly less apathetic on the Emotional subscale. Scores on the DAS patient and carer versions did not significantly differ. Internal consistency reliability, convergent and discriminant validity were found to be good for the DAS subscales. There was no association between the DAS and functional disability using the ALS Functional Rating Scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Apathy in ALS is characterised by a specific profile of increased initiation apathy and reduced emotional apathy. The DAS is a reliable and valid measure for the assessment of multidimensional apathy in ALS.","['Radakovic R', 'Stephenson L', 'Colville S', 'Swingler R', 'Chandran S', 'Abrahams S']",2016,87,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Radakovic R, et al.

26146826,The Phenotype of the C9ORF72 Expansion Carriers According to Revised Criteria for bvFTD.,"BACKGROUND: The C9ORF72 expansion is one of the most common genetic etiologies observed with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Revised diagnostic criteria for bvFTD (FTDC) were recently introduced but only a few studies have evaluated the accuracy of these criteria.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the applicability of the FTDC criteria and assess the psychiatric history of these patients.
METHODS: The study examined 36 patients carrying the C9ORF72 expansion and suffering from bvFTD (N = 32) or from bvFTD with motor neuron disease (bvFTD-MND, N = 4). Neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, structural brain imaging and PET/SPECT data were evaluated.
RESULTS: We found 0.75 sensitivity (SD 0.44, 95%CI 0.57-0.87) for possible bvFTD and 0.64 (SD 0.44, 95%CI 0.57-0.87) for probable bvFTD. The sensitivity was even higher in bvFTD patients without MND, i.e., 0.81 for possible bvFTD and 0.69 for probable bvFTD. PET/SPECT was normal in 17.6% of scanned patients with bvFTD. A history of psychiatric symptoms (psychotic and/or mood symptoms) was detected in 61% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The FTDC possible and probable bvFTD criteria seem to identify the majority of the C9ORF72 expansion carriers with bvFTD, even though they exhibit only a limited number of behavioral criteria but a significant amount of psychiatric symptoms. The presence of a normal PET/SPECT does not exclude the possibility the C9ORF72 associated bvFTD.","['Solje E', 'Aaltokallio H', 'Koivumaa-Honkanen H', 'Suhonen NM', 'Moilanen V', 'Kiviharju A', 'Traynor B', 'Tienari PJ', 'Hartikainen P', 'Remes AM']",2015,10,7,PLoS One,"Solje E, et al.

We present details of a 31-year-old woman who had suffered from progressive paraparesis with right-side predominance. Conventional MRI of brain and spinal cord and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies showed Hyperintense lesions in the upper part of the cervical spinal cord at the level C1 in lateral funicules, in the medulla oblongata at the pyramidal decussation and in the midbrain. Brain DTI revealed changes along the corticospinal tracts on fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. MRI of the thoracic spinal cord showed in T2-weighted images hyperintensive regions in the course of the lateral corticospinal tracts.

26107548,Assisting patients with motor neurone disease to make decisions about their care.,"Motor neurone disease (MND), is a progressive terminal illness affecting the central nervous system, causing paralysis of the muscles affecting limb movement, breathing and bulbar function, with an average life expectancy of 2-4 years. Patients are presented with repeated loss and the constant need to make adjustments to their lifestyle and expectations. Within palliative care there has been a move to formalise planning by undertaking advance care planning, giving the patient the opportunity to plan whether they would consider medical interventions and how they would like their care and death to be managed. There are now a multitude of forms and documents to complete if the patient is willing to do so. Advance care planning may not be something all patients wish to embrace, and this poses the question of whether there are cases where the repeated demand to think forward to a time when further losses are experienced is serving the agenda of the health professional at the expense of the patient. Nevertheless, health professionals might be concerned that a delay in decision making could impact on the patient's future care. There is potential for conflict between the wish of the patient--to remain focused on the positive--and the health professional's perception of the benefits of completing an advance care plan or discussing interventions which, if persued, might lead to a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship. A more flexible approach, focusing on the agenda set by the patient, underpinned by a therapeutic and trusting relationship, can avoid distress for the patient, while ensuring good care and the best outcome for the patient.",['Gale C'],2015,21,5,Int J Palliat Nurs,Gale C.

26085200,Distribution of dipeptide repeat proteins in cellular models and C9orf72 mutation cases suggests link to transcriptional silencing.,"A massive expansion of a GGGGCC repeat upstream of the C9orf72 coding region is the most common known cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Despite its intronic localization and lack of a canonical start codon, both strands are translated into aggregating dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins: poly-GA, poly-GP, poly-GR, poly-PR and poly-PA. To address conflicting findings on the predominant toxicity of the different DPR species in model systems, we compared the expression pattern of the DPR proteins in rat primary neurons and postmortem brain and spinal cord of C9orf72 mutation patients. Only poly-GA overexpression closely mimicked the p62-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions commonly observed for all DPR proteins in patients. In contrast, overexpressed poly-GR and poly-PR formed nucleolar p62-negative inclusions. In patients, most of the less common neuronal intranuclear DPR inclusions were para-nucleolar and p62 positive. Neuronal nucleoli in C9orf72 cases showed normal size and morphology regardless of the presence of poly-GR and poly-PR inclusions arguing against widespread nucleolar stress, reported in cellular models. Colocalization of para-nucleolar DPR inclusions with heterochromatin and a marker of transcriptional repression (H3K9me2) indicates a link to gene transcription. In contrast, we detected numerous intranuclear DPR inclusions not associated with nucleolar structures in ependymal and subependymal cells. In patients, neuronal inclusions of poly-GR, poly-GP and the poly-GA interacting protein Unc119 were less abundant than poly-GA inclusions, but showed similar regional and subcellular distribution. Regardless of neurodegeneration, all inclusions were most abundant in neocortex, hippocampus and thalamus, with few inclusions in brain stem and spinal cord. In the granular cell layer of the cerebellum, poly-GA and Unc119 inclusions were significantly more abundant in cases with FTLD than in cases with MND and FTLD/MND. Poly-PR inclusions were rare throughout the brain but significantly more abundant in the CA3/4 region of FTLD cases than in MND cases. Thus, although DPR distribution is not correlated with neurodegeneration spatially, it correlates with neuropathological subtypes.","['Schludi MH', 'May S', 'Grässer FA', 'Rentzsch K', 'Kremmer E', 'Küpper C', 'Klopstock T', 'German Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration', 'Bavarian Brain Banking Alliance', 'Arzberger T', 'Edbauer D']",2015,130,4,Acta Neuropathol,"Schludi MH, et al.

An association between motor neurone disease (MND) and LPDs has previously been described, but there is a lack of recommendations available to guide management of such patients. This report aims to describe suitable management of BL in a patient with MND.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old woman with a history of MND affecting her limbs was diagnosed with bulky, extranodal, high-risk gastric BL. Standard chemotherapy is with multiple non-cross-resistant cytotoxic agents. To avoid exacerbation of neuropathy, six cycles of a modified regimen was planned, aiming to minimize exposure to the most neurotoxic agents. A PET-FDG-negative remission was obtained at 12 months, without the signs of central neurotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy or muscle weakness.

26063467,"Lived-through past, experienced present, anticipated future: Understanding ""existential loss"" in the context of life-limiting illness.","OBJECTIVE: Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a rare, devastating neurodegenerative disease of middle/later life, usually presenting in the sixth and seventh decades (McDermot & Shaw, 2008). People have to wait many months to receive a diagnosis of MND (Donaghy et al., 2008), and during this period they have already experienced the degenerative nature that characterizes MND (Bolmsjö, 2001). However, information on the meaning of life with MND through time is limited. The aim of the present research was to answer the research question ""What does it mean to be a person living through the illness trajectory of MND?"" and to research the phenomenon of existence when given a diagnosis of MND and in the context of receiving healthcare.
METHOD: Hermeneutic phenomenology, inspired by the philosophers Heidegger and Gadamer, informed the methodological approach employed, which asked people to tell their story from when they first thought something untoward was happening to them. The hermeneutic analysis involved a five-stage process in order to understand (interpret) the lifeworld 1 of four people diagnosed with MND, and a lifeworld perspective helped to make sense of the meaning of existence when given a terminal diagnosis of MND.
RESULTS: The concept of ""existential loss"" identified in relation to MND was the loss of past ways of being-in-the-world, and the loss of embodiment, spatiality, and the future.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The concept of existential loss requires closer attention by healthcare professionals from the time of diagnosis and on through the illness trajectory. The study findings are conceptualized into a framework, which when used as a clinical tool may prompt healthcare professionals to focus on their patients' existential loss and existential concerns.

Despite its well-defined clinical characteristics, its neuropsychological profile has remained poorly understood, considering the consensus of cognitive and behavioral impairment reached in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation of Chinese PMA patients with a series of comprehensive batteries emphasizing the executive and attention function, and covering other domains of memory, language, visuospatial function, calculation and behavior as well. Their performances were compared with those of age- and education-matched ALS and healthy controls (HC).
RESULTS: 21 patients newly diagnosed with PMA were consecutively enrolled into our ALS and other MND registry platform, accounting for 14.7% of all the incident MND cases registered during the same period. 20 patients who completed the neuropsychological batteries were included into analysis. Compared with HC, PMA performed significantly worse in maintenance function of attention, while they exhibited quantitative similarity to ALS in all behavioral inventories and neuropsychological tests except the time for Stroop interference effect.
CONCLUSION: PMA could display mild cognitive dysfunction in the same frontal-mediated territory of ALS but in a lesser degree, whereas they did not differ from ALS behaviorally.","['Cui B', 'Cui L', 'Liu M', 'Li X', 'Ma J', 'Fang J', 'Ding Q']",2015,10,6,PLoS One,"Cui B, et al.

26029142,Patients experiences of maintaining mental well-being and hope within motor neuron disease: a thematic synthesis.,"Research is required that can synthesize the experiences of patients with Motor Neuron Disease (MND). One value of being able to do this is to understand the psychological experiences and processes involved in maintaining mental well-being and hope. A qualitative thematic synthesis of studies was undertaken. Studies were electronically searched from inception until June 2014. Twenty-nine studies with 342 (175 male) unique individuals with MND were identified. Five themes were identified: (1)The effects of the disease on interactions, relationships, roles and meaningful activities, (2) Responses that relate to the expression of hope, (3) Factors which disable hope, (4) Factors which enable hope, and (5) Cognitive and Practical adaptation that enabled hope, control and coping. Finally, a model of hope enablement was identified that considers the psychological pathways undertaken by a patient which influence mental well-being and hope. Within this review article evidence is provided which illustrates the central importance of relationships and social support for individuals with MND. Further, it has been identified that periods of coping are possible and are likely associated with greater mental well-being for patients with MND.","['Soundy A', 'Condon N']",2015,6,,Front Psychol,Soundy A and Condon N.

26012503,Identifying fasciculation potentials in motor neuron disease: A matter of probability.,"INTRODUCTION: Fasciculations, the spontaneous activity of single motor units (MUs) are characteristic, but nonspecific for motor neuron disease (MND). We aimed to identify MU discharge properties to optimally differentiate MND patients from healthy controls.
METHODS: High-density surface electromyography recordings were performed in the thenar muscles during 10 min of rest. MU discharges were classified as ""isolated"" when the interspike intervals (ISIs) before and after were > 250 ms, ""continual"" when both ISIs were ≤ 250 ms, or as ""other"".
RESULTS: In patients (n = 30) compared with controls (n = 14), more MUs were active (9 vs. 3, P < 0.001) and generated relatively more isolated discharges (35% vs. 10%, P = 0.01). Two or more MUs with isolated discharges occurred more frequently in patients compared with controls (24% vs. <1% of 10-s windows, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: More frequent occurrence of multiple MUs showing isolated discharges may improve identification of patients with MND.","['Sleutjes BT', 'Gligorijević I', 'Montfoort I', 'van Doorn PA', 'Visser GH', 'Blok JH']",2016,53,2,Muscle Nerve,"Sleutjes BT, et al.

26004503,Connectivity-based fixel enhancement: Whole-brain statistical analysis of diffusion MRI measures in the presence of crossing fibres.,"In brain regions containing crossing fibre bundles, voxel-average diffusion MRI measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA) are difficult to interpret, and lack within-voxel single fibre population specificity. Recent work has focused on the development of more interpretable quantitative measures that can be associated with a specific fibre population within a voxel containing crossing fibres (herein we use fixel to refer to a specific fibre population within a single voxel). Unfortunately, traditional 3D methods for smoothing and cluster-based statistical inference cannot be used for voxel-based analysis of these measures, since the local neighbourhood for smoothing and cluster formation can be ambiguous when adjacent voxels may have different numbers of fixels, or ill-defined when they belong to different tracts. Here we introduce a novel statistical method to perform whole-brain fixel-based analysis called connectivity-based fixel enhancement (CFE). CFE uses probabilistic tractography to identify structurally connected fixels that are likely to share underlying anatomy and pathology. Probabilistic connectivity information is then used for tract-specific smoothing (prior to the statistical analysis) and enhancement of the statistical map (using a threshold-free cluster enhancement-like approach). To investigate the characteristics of the CFE method, we assessed sensitivity and specificity using a large number of combinations of CFE enhancement parameters and smoothing extents, using simulated pathology generated with a range of test-statistic signal-to-noise ratios in five different white matter regions (chosen to cover a broad range of fibre bundle features). The results suggest that CFE input parameters are relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the simulated pathology. We therefore recommend a single set of CFE parameters that should give near optimal results in future studies where the group effect is unknown. We then demonstrate the proposed method by comparing apparent fibre density between motor neurone disease (MND) patients with control subjects. The MND results illustrate the benefit of fixel-specific statistical inference in white matter regions that contain crossing fibres.","['Raffelt DA', 'Smith RE', 'Ridgway GR', 'Tournier JD', 'Vaughan DN', 'Rose S', 'Henderson R', 'Connelly A']",2015,117,,Neuroimage,"Raffelt DA, et al.

Thirty cases have been reported to date. We summarise six new cases, highlighting the key clinical aspects of FOSMN and how to differentiate it from motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Typically, patients present with slowly evolving numbness of the face followed by bulbar and proximal (neck and arm) weakness. However, one of our patients presented with a motor syndrome and his abnormal blink reflex studies provided a useful diagnostic clue. This extends the spectrum of the syndrome and emphasises that FOSMN should be considered in the differential diagnosis of motor neurone disease.

25960086,Whole genome analyses reveal no pathogenetic single nucleotide or structural differences between monozygotic twins discordant for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the pathogenesis of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains unclear. To investigate the genetic component of the disease, we performed whole genome sequencing on ALS discordant monozygotic twins. Illumina whole genome sequencing on white blood cell DNA of five ALS-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (10 samples in total) yielded ∼30x coverage per individual. All single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants (copy number variants, inversions and translocations) were called and evaluated for functional consequence, evolutionary conservation, population frequency and overlap with known ALS associated variants and genes. Results showed that no validated discordant coding or regulatory single nucleotide variants or indels were found, and nor were any genome-wide discordant structural variants detected. Concordant variants of particular interest were: 1) two rare, highly-conserved heterozygous non-synonymous variants in SYT9 and EWSR1, genes previously associated with ALS (out of 2044 rare heterozygous variants detected); 2) three rare homozygous missense variants; and 3) three novel copy number deletions that overlapped genes. In conclusion, no convincing coding or regulatory nucleotide or genome-wide structural differences were found between ALS discordant monozygotic twins. The results suggest that more work is needed to elucidate possible environmental, epigenetic, oligogenic and somatic genetic factors that could underlie susceptibility to sporadic ALS.","['Meltz Steinberg K', 'Nicholas TJ', 'Koboldt DC', 'Yu B', 'Mardis E', 'Pamphlett R']",2015,16,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Meltz Steinberg K, et al.

METHODS: Stimulated high-density surface electromyographic (HDsEMG) recordings were performed in thenar muscles. Data were collected from 31 MND patients. MDs from the HDsEMG recordings were determined at baseline. ALSFRS-R scores were obtained at baseline and at a maximum of 16 weeks follow-up.
RESULTS: The presence of MDs was associated with progressive deterioration of ALSFRS-R score (P = 0.02) and fine motor function (FMF) (P < 0.001). Patients who had a higher number of motor units that generated MDs (r = 0.61, P < 0.001) and patients who had a higher number of MDs (as percentage of applied stimuli) (r = 0.59, P = 0.001) had a more severe decline in FMF.

25934855,Neurofilament light chain: A prognostic biomarker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To test blood and CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in relation to disease progression and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHODS: Using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, NfL levels were measured in samples from 2 cohorts of patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls, recruited in London (ALS/control, plasma: n = 103/42) and Oxford (ALS/control, serum: n = 64/36; paired CSF: n = 38/20). NfL levels in patients were measured at regular intervals for up to 3 years. Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised score was used to assess disease progression. Survival was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: CSF, serum, and plasma NfL discriminated patients with ALS from healthy controls with high sensitivity (97%, 89%, 90%, respectively) and specificity (95%, 75%, 71%, respectively). CSF NfL was highly correlated with serum levels (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001). Blood NfL levels were approximately 4 times as high in patients with ALS compared with controls in both cohorts, and maintained a relatively constant expression during follow-up. Blood NfL levels at recruitment were strong, independent predictors of survival. The highest tertile of blood NfL at baseline had a mortality hazard ratio of 3.91 (95% confidence interval 1.98-7.94, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Blood-derived NfL level is an easily accessible biomarker with prognostic value in ALS. The individually relatively stable levels longitudinally offer potential for NfL as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in future therapeutic trials.

25921732,The effect of mild traumatic brain injury on peripheral nervous system pathology in wild-type mice and the G93A mutant mouse model of motor neuron disease.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a risk of neurodegenerative disease. Some suggest a link between TBI and motor neuron disease (MND), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To investigate the potential mechanisms linking TBI to MND, we measured motor function and neuropathology following mild-TBI in wild-type and a transgenic model of ALS, G93A mutant mice. Mild-TBI did not alter the lifespan of G93A mice or age of onset; however, rotarod performance was impaired in G93A verses wild-type mice. Grip strength was reduced only in G93A mice after mild-TBI. Increased electromyography (EMG) abnormalities and markers of denervation (AchR, Runx1) indicate that mild-TBI may result in peripheral effects that are exaggerated in G93A mice. Markers of inflammation (cell edema, astrogliosis and microgliosis) were detected at 24 and 72h in the brain and spinal cord in wild-type and G93A mice. Levels of F2-isoprostanes, a marker of oxidative stress, were increased in the spinal cord 24h post mild-TBI in wild-type mice but were not affected by TBI in G93A mice. In summary, our data demonstrate that mild-TBI induces inflammation and oxidative stress and negatively impacts muscle denervation and motor performance, suggesting mild-TBI can potentiate motor neuron pathology and influence the development of MND in mice.","['Evans TM', 'Jaramillo CA', 'Sataranatarajan K', 'Watts L', 'Sabia M', 'Qi W', 'Van Remmen H']",2015,298,,Neuroscience,"Evans TM, et al.

25884318,"Clinical associations between gout and multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and motor neuron disease: record-linkage studies.","BACKGROUND: Uric acid has antioxidant effects on neurons. Abnormally high levels of uric acid are, however, associated with gout. Previous studies have suggested that high levels of uric acid (and the presence of gout) may exert a protective effect against the risk of developing some neurological diseases. We aimed to investigate this hypothesis in a large database of hospital admissions in England.
METHODS: We analysed a database of linked statistical records of hospital admissions and death registrations in England (1999-2012). A cohort of people with gout was constructed and followed for development of multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD) or motor neuron disease (MND). Then, conversely, cohorts of all people in the database with MS, PD or MND were constructed and followed for subsequent gout. Rate ratios (RRs) were determined, comparing these cohorts with people in a reference cohort.
RESULTS: In the gout cohort, we observed a modest elevation of the overall risk of subsequent MS, PD and MND (respectively, RR = 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.03-1.55), 1.11 (1.05-1.17) and 1.28 (1.11-1.48) which was largely attributable to an increased risk observed in the early years after hospitalisation for gout. The increased risk of neurological disease did not remain after 5 years. In the cohorts of people with MS or PD, there was a significantly reduced risk of subsequent gout admission (RR = 0.79 (0.69-0.89) and 0.83 (0.79-0.87), respectively). This inverse association was sustained over time. There was also a reduced risk of MND following gout which only emerged more than five years following initial gout admission (RR at 5+ years 0.35 (0.15-0.68)).
CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the epidemiological evidence for a protective role of high serum concentration of uric acid, for which we used gout as a proxy, in the aetiology of MS, PD or MND. Our observations do not support this hypothesis. However, when the order was reversed, and we retrospectively followed up patients with MS, PD and MND for a number of years, we found a statistically significant deficit of gout. This suggests that there is relationship between some aspects of these neurodegenerative diseases and metabolism of uric acid.","['Pakpoor J', 'Seminog OO', 'Ramagopalan SV', 'Goldacre MJ']",2015,15,,BMC Neurol,"Pakpoor J, et al.

METHODS: The clinical and histopathological features of 4 cases with MND confirmed by autopsy were summarized; anti-ubiquitin (Ub) and anti-TDP-43 immunohistochemical staining were carried out on tissue of brains and spinal cords from 4 cases with MND and 3 control cases without history of neurological disorders.
RESULTS: These 4 cases presented with typical clinical and histologic features of MND. Ub-positive inclusions were observed in brain and spinal cord from 3 cases with the Ub-positive inclusions of skein- round- and lewy body- like structures. Strong TDP-43 pathological staining in brain and spinal cord was identified in 2 cases with MND presented as neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions with various shapes. The TDP-43 positive inclusions were widely distributed in the motor cortex of brain and the anterior horn of spinal cord. TDP-43 weak staining in the spinal cord tissue was observed in 1 case with MND. No Ub- and TDP-43 positive inclusions were found in 3 control cases.
CONCLUSION: There is widespread pathological TDP-43 expression in the central nervous system of MND. TDP-43 positive inclusions in MND have relatively high specificity.

25857659,Identifying who will benefit from non-invasive ventilation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease in a clinical cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure is associated with significant morbidity and is the predominant cause of death in motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS). This study aimed to determine the effect of non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support on survival and pulmonary function decline across MND/ALS phenotypes.
METHODS: Cohort recruited via a specialist, multidisciplinary clinic. Patients were categorised into four clinical phenotypes (ALS, flail arm, flail leg and primary lateral sclerosis) according to site of presenting symptom and the pattern of upper versus lower motor neurone involvement. NIV was initiated according to current consensus practice guidelines.
RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2011, 1198 patients diagnosed with ALS/MND were registered. 929 patients (77.5%) fulfilled the selection criteria and their data were analysed. Median tracheostomy free survival from symptom onset was 28 months in NIV-treated patients compared to 15 months in untreated (Univariate Cox regression HR=0.61 (0.51 to 0.73), p<0.001). The positive survival effect of NIV persisted when the model was adjusted for age, gender, riluzole and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use (HR=0.72 (0.60 to 0.88, p=0.001). In contrast with the only randomised controlled trial, NIV statistically significantly increased survival by 19 months in those with ALS-bulbar onset (Univariate HR=0.50 (0.36 to 0.70), multivariate HR=0.59 (0.41 to 0.83)). These data confirm that NIV improves survival in MND/ALS. The overall magnitude of benefit is 13 months and was largest in those with ALS-bulbar disease. Future research should explore the optimal timing of NIV initiation within phenotypes in order to optimise respiratory function, quality of life and survival.","['Berlowitz DJ', 'Howard ME', 'Fiore JF', 'Vander Hoorn S', ""O'Donoghue FJ"", 'Westlake J', 'Smith A', 'Beer F', 'Mathers S', 'Talman P']",2016,87,3,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Berlowitz DJ, et al.

When faced with incurable illness, patients often become more philosophical about their life; many seek comfort in spiritual or religious philosophies. Our intention was to understand how personal spirituality and religious faith might help those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) cope with their impending death.
METHOD: Unsolicited narratives (internet and print-published) written by individuals diagnosed with the terminal condition of ALS/MND were analyzed thematically. Narratives from 161 individuals diagnosed with ALS/MND written over a period of 37 years (from 1968 to 2005) were included.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal that religious faith sustains and helps people to avoid despair, and personal spirituality helps them make sense of what is happening to them.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The use of personal narratives by people with ALS/MND has provided a vehicle for sharing their deepest spiritual and religious thoughts with others. The place of spirituality and religious faith within ALS/MND care should not be underestimated.

25821176,MRI signatures of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration continuum.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify overlapping and unique grey (GM) and white matter (WM) signatures within the frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) continuum, and discriminate likely FTLD-TAU and FTLD-TDP patients using structural and diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: T1-weighted and DT MRI were collected from 121 subjects: 35 motor neuron disease (MND), 14 behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, 12 semantic and 11 nonfluent primary progressive aphasia, 21 progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome patients, and 28 healthy controls. Patterns of GM atrophy were established using voxel-based morphometry. Tract-based spatial statistics was used to perform a WM voxelwise analysis of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy.
RESULTS: In all clinical FTLD phenotypes, the pattern of WM damage was more distributed than that of GM atrophy. All patient groups, with the exception of MND cases with a pure motor syndrome, shared a focal GM atrophy centered around the dorsolateral and medial frontal cortex and a largely overlapping pattern of WM damage involving the genu and body of the corpus callosum and ventral frontotemporal and dorsal frontoparietal WM pathways. Surrounding this common area, phenotype (symptom)-specific GM and WM regions of damage were found in each group.
CONCLUSIONS: In the FTLD spectrum, WM disruption is more severe than GM damage. Frontal cortex and WM pathways represent the common target of neurodegeneration in these conditions. The topographic pattern of damage supports a ""prion-like"" protein propagation through WM connections as underlying mechanism of the stereotyped progression of FTLD.","['Agosta F', 'Galantucci S', 'Magnani G', 'Marcone A', 'Martinelli D', 'Antonietta Volontè M', 'Riva N', 'Iannaccone S', 'Ferraro PM', 'Caso F', 'Chiò A', 'Comi G', 'Falini A', 'Filippi M']",2015,36,7,Hum Brain Mapp,"Agosta F, et al.

Rare and potentially damaging compound heterozygous variants were found in 27% of ALS patients, homozygous recessive variants in 14% and coding de novo variants in 27%. In 20% of patients more than one of the above variants was present. Genes with recessive variants were enriched in nucleotide binding capacity, ATPase activity, and the dynein heavy chain. Genes with de novo variants were enriched in transcription regulation and cell cycle processes. This trio study indicates that rare private recessive variants could be a mechanism underlying some case of sporadic ALS, and that de novo mutations are also likely to play a part in the disease.","['Steinberg KM', 'Yu B', 'Koboldt DC', 'Mardis ER', 'Pamphlett R']",2015,5,,Sci Rep,"Steinberg KM, et al.

25734219,Psychological and psychotherapeutic approaches for people with motor neuron disease: A qualitative study.,"The aim of the study was to review current psychological and psychotherapeutic approaches for people with MND used by therapists in Ireland and to gain an insight into approaches used elsewhere. We used a qualitative study collecting data from eight therapists in Ireland and two therapists in the UK and Italy using semi-structured interviews and analysed the results using principles of grounded theory. Therapists' approaches included supporting the person in the 'here and now' by providing a 'fine focus' on what they can still do, re-affirming the person in their ability to have an active role in their life and supporting the person in exploring their emotions. The desired outcome was to provide the person with space to talk, express feelings and be able to self-direct. In conclusion, there is no consensus about a specific approach, due to the complexity of the disease and the variety of presentations. Different approaches may be required during disease progression. The findings indicate that therapists would benefit from having experience of MND, the limitations in mobility, communication and cognitive processing.","['Rabbitte M', 'Bates U', 'Keane M']",2015,16,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Rabbitte M, et al.

25725227,Unwinding the role of senataxin in neurodegeneration.,"Interest in senataxin biology began in 2004 when mutations were first identified in what was then a novel protein. Dominantly inherited mutations were documented in rare juvenile-onset, motor neuron disease pedigrees in a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS4), while recessive mutations were found to cause a severe early-onset ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA2) that is actually the second most common recessive ataxia after Freidreich's ataxia. From earlier studies of sen1p, the yeast ortholog of senataxin, a range of important RNA processing functions have been attributed to this protein. Like sen1p, senataxin contains a helicase domain to interact with RNA and an amino-terminal domain for critical protein interactions. Senataxin also joins a group of important proteins responsible for maintaining RNA transcriptome homeostasis, including FUS, TDP-43, and SMN that can all cause familial forms of motor neuron disease (MND). Independent of this association, senataxin is gaining attention for its role in maintaining genomic stability. Senataxin has been shown to resolve R-Loop structures, which form when nascent RNA hybridizes to DNA, displacing the non-transcribed strand. But in cycling cells, senataxin is also found at nuclear foci during the S/G2 cell-cycle phase, and may function at sites of specific collision between components of the replisome and transcription machinery. Which of these important processes is most critical to prevent neurodegeneration remains unknown, but our evolving understanding of these processes will be crucial not only for understanding senataxin's role in neurological disease, but also in a number of fundamentally important cellular functions.","['Bennett CL', 'La Spada AR']",2015,19,103,Discov Med,Bennett CL and La Spada AR.

25721959,Motor neurone disease in the greater Wellington region: an observational study.,"AIMS: This study investigated the demographic and disease characteristics of motor neurone disease (MND), as well as specific aspects of healthcare provision for MND patients in the greater Wellington region.
METHODS: Data was collected from clinical records of all known patients with a diagnosis of Motor Neurone Disease MND in the Capital and Coast and Hutt Valley district health board catchment zones over a 12-month period. Survival data was collected at 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 40 patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 66.2 years (SD of 13.2). Thirty patients (75%) were New Zealand European. Predominantly limb signs were present in 12 (30%), and 11 (27.5%) had bulbar signs, while 14 (35%) had a mixed pattern and a further 3 (7.5%) had respiratory muscle weakness. At 2-year follow-up, the median survival time following symptom onset in the 32 deceased patients was 29 months (range 6-126 months).
CONCLUSIONS: The demographics and disease characteristics of MND in this cohort of patients from the Wellington region is similar to those found in overseas studies. The majority of patients received care in accordance with established guidelines, although certain aspects of healthcare delivery could be further improved.","['Dayal V', 'Rosemergy I', 'Turnbull J']",2015,128,1409,N Z Med J,"Dayal V, et al.

25715475,[Experimental approach to the gene therapy of motor neuron disease with the use of genes hypoxia-inducible factors].,"Motor neuron disease (MND), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and the brain. Several angiogenic and neurogenic growth factors, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiogenin (ANG), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and others, have been shown to promote survival of the spinal motor neurons during ischemia. We constructed recombinant vectors using human adenovirus 5 (Ad5) carrying the VEGF, ANG or IGF genes under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. As a model for MND, we employed a transgenic mice strain, B6SJL-Tg (SOD1*G93A)d11 Gur/J that develops a progressive degeneration of the spinal motor neurons caused by the expression of a mutated Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene SOD1. Delivery of the therapeutic genes to the spinal motor neurons was done using the effect of the retrograde axonal transport after multiple injections of the Ad5-VEGF, Ad5-ANG and Ad5-IGF vectors and their combinations into the limbs and back muscles of the SOD1(G93A) mice. Viral transgene expression in the spinal cord motor neurons was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and RT-RCR. We assessed the neurological status, motor activity and lifespan of experimental and control animal groups. We discovered that SOD1(G93A) mice injected with the Ad5-VEGF + Ad5-ANG combination showed a 2-3 week delay in manifestation of the disease, higher motor activity at the advanced stages of the disease, and at least a 10% increase in the lifespan compared to the control and other experimental groups. These results support the safety and therapeutic efficacy of the tested recombinant treatment. We propose that the developed experimental MND treatment based on viral delivery of VEGF + ANG can be used as a basis for gene therapy drug development and testing in the preclinical and clinical trials of the MND.","['Ismailov ShM', 'Barykova IuA', 'Shmarov MM', 'Tarantul VZ', 'Barskov IV', 'Kucherianu VG', 'Brylev LV', 'Logunov DIu', 'Tutykhina IL', 'Bocharov EV', 'Zakharova MN', 'Naroditskiĭ BS', 'Illarioshkin SN']",2014,50,5,Genetika,"Ismailov ShM, et al.

25683471,Cortical excitability changes distinguish the motor neuron disease phenotypes from hereditary spastic paraplegia.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cortical hyperexcitability has been identified as an important pathogenic mechanism in motor neuron disease (MND). The issue as to whether cortical hyperexcitability is a common process across the MND phenotypes, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), remains unresolved. Separately, the clinical distinction between PLS and 'mimic disorders' such as hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) may be difficult, potentially delaying diagnosis. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to determine the nature and spectrum of cortical excitability changes across the MND phenotypes, and to determine whether the presence of cortical dysfunction distinguishes PLS from HSP.
METHODS: Cortical excitability studies were undertaken on a cohort of 14 PLS, 82 ALS and 13 HSP patients with mutations in the spastin gene.
RESULTS: Cortical hyperexcitability, as heralded by reduction of short interval intracortical inhibition (PLS 0.26%, -3.8% to 1.4%; ALS -0.15%, -3.6% to 7.0%; P < 0.01) and cortical silent period duration (CSPPLS 172.2 ± 5.4 ms; CSPALS 178.1 ± 5.1 ms; P < 0.001), along with an increase in intracortical facilitation was evident in ALS and PLS phenotypes, although appeared more frequently in ALS. Inexcitability of the motor cortex was more frequent in PLS (PLS 71%, ALS 24%, P < 0.0001). Cortical excitability was preserved in HSP.
CONCLUSIONS: Cortical dysfunction appears to be an intrinsic process across the MND phenotypes, with cortical inexcitability predominating in PLS and cortical hyperexcitability predominating in ALS. Importantly, cortical excitability was preserved in HSP, thereby suggesting that the presence of cortical dysfunction could help differentiate PLS from HSP in a clinical setting.","['Geevasinga N', 'Menon P', 'Sue CM', 'Kumar KR', 'Ng K', 'Yiannikas C', 'Kiernan MC', 'Vucic S']",2015,22,5,Eur J Neurol,"Geevasinga N, et al.

25621016,"Expression of one important chaperone protein, heat shock protein 27, in neurodegenerative diseases.","INTRODUCTION: Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by accumulations of misfolded proteins that can colocalise with chaperone proteins (for example, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27)), which might act as modulators of protein aggregation.
METHODS: The role of HSP27 in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and motor neuron disease (MND) was investigated. We used immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis to determine the distribution and amount of this protein in the frontal and temporal cortices of diseased and control subjects.
RESULTS: HSP27 immunostaining presented as accumulations of granules within neuronal and glial cell perikarya. Patients with AD and FTLD were affected more often, and showed greater immunostaining for HSP27, than patients with MND and controls. In FTLD, there was no association between HSP27 and histological type. The neuropathological changes of FTLD, AD and MND were not immunoreactive to HSP27. Western blot analysis revealed higher HSP27 expression in FTLD than in controls, but without qualitative differences in banding patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of HSP27 immunostaining observed may reflect the extent of ongoing neurodegeneration in affected brain areas and is not specific to FTLD, AD or MND. It may represent an accumulation of misfolded, damaged or unwanted proteins, awaiting or undergoing degradation.","['Zhang X', 'Shi J', 'Tian J', 'Robinson AC', 'Davidson YS', 'Mann DM']",2014,6,9,Alzheimers Res Ther,"Zhang X, et al.

25604222,[A study of autonomic dysfunction and sympathetic skin response in motor neuron disease].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the symptoms of autonomic dysfunction and sympathetic skin response (SSR) abnormality in patients of motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: The clinical features of autonomic dysfunction were collected as follows: dermal numbness or pruritus, parahidrosis, xerostomia, salivation, abnormal skin temperature, orthostatic hypotension, mydriasis, ptosis or abnormal pupillary light reflex, constipation, voiding dysfunction and sexual dysfunction. SSR was performed and the results were judged according to the normal range of our laboratory. Abnormality rate in MND patients was calculated. The relationship between clinical symptoms and SSR parameters were analyzed statistically.
RESULTS: Among a total of 142 MND patients, the symptom incidences of autonomic dysfunction were as follows: dermal numbness (53.5%), dermal pruritus (15.5%), parahidrosis (10.6%), xerostomia (9.1%), salivation (2.1%), abnormal skin temperature (14.8%), orthostatic hypotension (2.1%), constipation (16.2%), voiding dysfunction (9.9%) and sexual dysfunction (1.4%). Abnormal SSR was found in 51/142 (35.9%) patients, including 12(8.5%) in palmar and 47(33.1%) in plantar. The features of abnormal SSR included delayed latency of palmar (P < 0.05) and decreased amplitudes of both palmar and plantar compared with normal ranges (P < 0.01 respectively). The group of patients with lumbosacral onset had a higher abnormal rate of SSR than those of other onset sites. There was no significant correlation between clinical symptoms and abnormal SSR parameters.
CONCLUSION: The patients of MND exhibit autonomic dysfunctions of skin, gland secretion, cardiovascular system and sphincters. Some of them show abnormal SSR with prolonged latency and decreased amplitude. The abnormalities of SSR are not related to clinical features of autonomic dysfunction. Those with an onset of lower limbs have a higher rate of abnormal SSR.","['Wang X', 'Cui L', 'Liu M', 'Guan Y', 'Li B', 'Du H']",2014,94,41,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,"Wang X, et al.

25601066,Unstable terminality: negotiating the meaning of chronicity and terminality in motor neurone disease.,"This paper explores the meaning of chronicity and terminality in motor neurone disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). There is no known cause or cure for MND, and expected survival is 2-5 years, but several interventions may improve or prolong life. This study draws on qualitative interview data with health professionals in hospitals and primary care, and family carers, in Norway. The actors emphasised chronic and terminal aspects in subtly different ways along the entire illness trajectory, also when recounting the trajectory in retrospect. As a consequence of improved health services and medical technology the distinction between chronicity and terminality has become more vague and sometimes ambiguous. We suggest the concept unstable terminality to describe this ambiguity. While MND is a fatal diagnosis; it may be contested, as contingencies and interventions create an indefinite time scope. The instability creates challenges for primary care which is dependent on prognostic information to organise their effort; hospitals tackle the instability by pre-scheduled consultations allowing for avoidance of an explicit prognosis. Some carers experienced what we understand as a disruption within the disruption, living with chronic and terminal illness simultaneously, which made the limbo phase more challenging to overcome.","['Lerum SV', 'Solbraekke KN', 'Holmøy T', 'Frich JC']",2015,37,1,Sociol Health Illn,"Lerum SV, et al.

EIM has yet to be evaluated in the tongue musculature in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), who often show clinical bulbar signs.
METHODS: The lingual musculature of 19 subjects with motor neuron disease and 21 normal participants was assessed using EIM, strength and endurance testing, and clinical assessment.
RESULTS: Tongue musculature in the ALS group was characterized by significantly smaller phase (Ph) and greater resistance (R) when compared with the healthy cohort. Ph and tongue endurance were correlated in the ALS group.
CONCLUSIONS: EIM of tongue musculature could distinguish those with ALS from healthy controls. The demonstrated relationship between tongue function and Ph supports further testing of EIM of the tongue as a potential biomarker in ALS.","['Shellikeri S', 'Yunusova Y', 'Green JR', 'Pattee GL', 'Berry JD', 'Rutkove SB', 'Zinman L']",2015,52,4,Muscle Nerve,"Shellikeri S, et al.

Presence of monoclonal gammopathy may indicate specific pathogenic pathways and may facilitate the development of novel treatment strategies. The objective of this large case-control study was to determine the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy in motor neuron diseases (MND) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). Monoclonal gammopathy was determined by immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation in serum from 445 patients with ALS, 158 patients with progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), 60 patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), 88 patients with MMN and in 430 matched healthy controls. Anti-ganglioside antibody titers were determined in sera from patients with MMN and PMA, and in ALS and PLS patients with monoclonal gammopathy. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations of monoclonal gammopathy with motor neuron diseases and clinical characteristics. Neither ALS nor PLS was associated with monoclonal gammopathy. IgM monoclonal gammopathy was more frequent in patients with PMA (8 %) (OR = 4.2; p = 0.001) and MMN (7 %) (OR = 5.8; p = 0.002) than in controls (2 %). High titers of anti-GM1 IgM antibodies were present in 43 % of MMN patients and 7 % of PMA patients. Patients with PMA and IgM monoclonal gammopathy or anti-GM1 antibodies had a higher age at onset, more often weakness of upper legs and more severe outcome than patients with MMN. PMA and MMN, but not ALS and PLS, are significantly associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy and anti-GM1 antibodies. These results may indicate that a subset of patients presenting with PMA share pathogenic mechanisms with MMN.","['Vlam L', 'Piepers S', 'Sutedja NA', 'Jacobs BC', 'Tio-Gillen AP', 'Stam M', 'Franssen H', 'Veldink JH', 'Cats EA', 'Notermans NC', 'Bloem AC', 'Wadman RI', 'van der Pol WL', 'van den Berg LH']",2015,262,3,J Neurol,"Vlam L, et al.

The mutation 9185T>C in ATP6 gene, associated with Leigh syndrome, was reported in only few families. Motor neuron disease (MND), both clinically and electrophysiologically, was not previously described in association with this mutation. Case Report. 33-year-old male, with family history of mitochondrial disease, presented with cognitive impairment, exercise intolerance, and progressive muscle weakness. Examination revealed global hypotonia, and proximal tetraparesis, without atrophy or fasciculation, pyramidal signs, or sensory symptoms. The laboratory findings revealed an increase of lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio; electromyogram showed chronic neurogenic compromise; muscle biopsy was suggestive of spinal muscular atrophy and mitochondriopathy; genetic study of SMN1 was negative but detected a homoplasmic mutation 9185T>C in ATP6 gene. His younger sister, with the same mutation, had cognitive impairment, ataxia, and muscle weakness. EMG showed axonal peripheral neuropathy. Conclusion. This case is unique because of the benignity and the coexistence of clinical, neurophysiological, and pathological findings suggestive of MND that, although described in mitochondrial disease, have not yet been reported in association with 9185T>C mutation. The present case contributes to the expansion of the phenotypic expressions of this particular mutation.","['Brum M', 'Semedo C', 'Guerreiro R', 'Pinto Marques J']",2014,2014,,Case Rep Neurol Med,"Brum M, et al.

25540246,Diagnostic accuracy of electrically elicited multiplet discharges in patients with motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of electrically elicited multiplet discharges (MDs) and fasciculation potentials (FPs) in motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: Patients were eligible when they had MND in their differential diagnosis and were referred for electromyogram (EMG). Stimulated high-density surface EMG of the thenar muscles was performed on the same day as standard EMG examination. High-density recordings were analysed for presence of MDs and needle EMG of any muscle investigated in the cervical region for presence of FPs.
RESULTS: Of the 61 patients enrolled in this diagnostic study, 24 patients were clinically diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 11 patients with progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). Another diagnosis was made in 26 patients. Sixteen patients in whom MDs were detected were diagnosed with either ALS (n = 11) or PMA (n = 5; sensitivity = 47.1%, PPV = 94.1%). MDs were detected in only one patient initially diagnosed with PMA, but in whom later on, multifocal motor neuropathy could not be excluded (specificity = 96.2%). Electrically elicited MDs had a higher specificity than FPs (96.2% vs 53.9%, p < 0.001, n = 26) and lower sensitivity (47.1% vs 85.3%, p = 0.002, n = 34). When considering presence of MDs in MND as neurogenic EMG abnormality, lower motor neuron involvement of ≥ 1 EMG region increased from 50% to 73.5% (p = 0.008, n = 34).
CONCLUSIONS: Electrically evoked MDs are highly specific for ALS and PMA and are an early sign of lower motor neuron dysfunction.","['Sleutjes BT', 'Montfoort I', 'van Doorn PA', 'Visser GH', 'Blok JH']",2015,86,11,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Sleutjes BT, et al.

The pathogenesis of the diseases is still unclear and clinical diagnosis of FTLD is hampered by overlapping symptoms within the FTLD subtypes and with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Intracellular protein aggregates in the brain are a major hallmark of FTLD and implicate alterations in protein metabolism or function in the disease's pathogenesis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which surrounds the brain can be used to study changes in neurodegenerative diseases and to identify disease-related mechanisms or neurochemical biomarkers for diagnosis. In the present review, we will give an overview of the current literature on proteomic studies in CSF of FTLD patients. Reports of targeted and unbiased proteomic approaches are included and the results are discussed in regard of their informative value about disease pathology and the suitability to be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, we will give some future perspectives on CSF proteomics and a list of candidate biomarkers which might be interesting for validation in further studies.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the insights of bereaved family carers about the most appropriate time to be involved in a research interview about the end of life and death of their family member.
METHODS: This qualitative study used a social constructionist framework. Twenty-two bereaved family carers of people with motor neurone disease (MND) and cancer were interviewed in Western Australia.
RESULTS: Most family carers (86%) feel comfortable being interviewed about the death of their family member within the first 5 months of bereavement, with 43% reporting they could be interviewed within weeks after death. Family carers reported that recall would be better earlier in bereavement and felt it may be helpful to them to talk about their experiences earlier. They said bereaved people should be allowed to decide for themselves when to be involved in an interview.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that interviews with the bereaved may be most fruitful for researchers and beneficial to family carers when they are allowed to make the choice about timing for themselves, beginning weeks after the death of their family member.","['Bentley B', ""O'Connor M""]",2015,18,3,J Palliat Med,Bentley B and O'Connor M.

25482030,The El Escorial criteria: strengths and weaknesses.,"The El Escorial criteria for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were established 20 years ago and have been used as inclusion criteria for clinical trials. However, concerns have been raised concerning their use as diagnostic criteria in clinical practice. Moreover, as modern genetics have shed new light on the heterogeneity of ALS and the close relationship between ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) recognized, the World Federation of Neurology Research Group on ALS/MND has initiated discussions to amend and update the criteria, while preserving the essential components for clinical trial enrolment purposes.","['Agosta F', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Filippi M', 'Hardiman O', 'Kaji R', 'Meininger V', 'Nakano I', 'Shaw P', 'Shefner J', 'van den Berg LH', 'Ludolph A', 'WFN Research Group on ALS/MND']",2015,16,1-2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Agosta F, et al.

25468238,Increased supernormality in patients with multiplet discharges: Evidence for a common pathophysiological mechanism behind multiplets and fasciculations.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a relation between electrically evoked multiplet discharges (MDs) and motor axonal excitability properties. We hypothesized that electrically evoked MDs share their underlying pathophysiological mechanism with fasciculations.
METHODS: High-density surface EMG and motor nerve excitability recordings of the thenar muscles were performed in 22 patients with motor neuron disease (MND) in their differential diagnosis and who were referred for EMG examination.
RESULTS: Supernormality (hyperexcitable phase following the refractory period) was significantly increased in patients with MDs (n=10) compared to patients without MDs (n=12) (25.5% vs 17.0%; p=0.02). Depolarizing threshold electrotonus differed significantly between both groups as well (TEdpeak, 76.6% vs 66.6%, p<0.01; TEd90-100ms, 51.7% vs 44.3%, p<0.01) CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that the same pathophysiological excitability changes are involved in generating MDs and fasciculations. Yet, MDs may be quantified more easily, and may be more specific for abnormal distal excitability than fasciculations, because fasciculations may originate along the motor axon as well as in the neuron cell body.
SIGNIFICANCE: MDs are potentially useful as objective measure of increased distal axonal excitability at individual motor unit level and might complement clinical studies in MND.","['Sleutjes BT', 'Montfoort I', 'van Doorn PA', 'Visser GH', 'Blok JH']",2015,126,7,Clin Neurophysiol,"Sleutjes BT, et al.

25414620,Upper extremity orthoses use in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease: three case reports.,"BACKGROUND: Central to the armamentarium of a hand therapist is evaluation for successful orthotic use. Orthoses can have a profound effect on quality of life in persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND). The purposes of orthoses are to decrease the effects of muscle imbalance, provide assistance in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs), prevent joint contracture, and relieve pain. There are few published accounts on the usefulness of orthoses and ALS. The purpose of this paper is to expand the body of literature by describing three successful cases.
METHODS: Three cases illustrate effects on weakened proximal muscles, wrist extensors, thenar musculature, and intrinsic muscles. The primary outcome measure is patient report, but functional rating scales, goniometry, quality of life scores, and pinch strength when obtainable are described.
RESULTS: Due to the progressive nature of the disease, outcome measures can be inconclusive. Patient report of increased life satisfaction and ability to participate in daily life is the critical outcome in these case examples. In all cases, satisfaction increased. Some of the stated changes include the following: ability to manipulate objects, grip, eat, wipe face, hold phone, use iPad®, and adjust hat.
CONCLUSIONS: Upper extremity orthotic use can be a beneficial adjunct contributing to the quality of life for individuals with ALS/MND. We have observed positive responses in pain control, contracture management, functional positioning, and increased independence with the use of orthoses. Designing appropriate means of studying effects of orthosis intervention is deficient in the current scientific literature.","['Ivy CC', 'Smith SM', 'Materi MM']",2014,9,4,Hand (N Y),"Ivy CC, et al.

25314244,Dignity therapy for people with motor neuron disease and their family caregivers: a feasibility study.,"BACKGROUND: There are calls to explore psychological interventions to reduce distress in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and their family caregivers. Dignity therapy is a short-term psychotherapy intervention shown to alleviate distress for people with life-limiting illnesses.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of dignity therapy to reduce distress in people with MND and their family caregivers.
METHODS: The study used a repeated-measures design pre- and post-intervention. Acceptability and feasibility were assessed using participants' ratings of the helpfulness of the intervention across several domains and time and resources required. Effectiveness measures for patients included: dignity-related distress, hopefulness, and spiritual well-being; and those for family caregivers included burden, hopefulness, anxiety, and depression.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients and 18 family caregivers completed the intervention. Dignity therapy was well accepted, including those patients who required assisted communication devices. The feasibility may be limited in small or not well-resourced services. There were no significant differences in all outcome measures for both groups. However, the high satisfaction and endorsement of dignity therapy by patients suggests it has influenced various important aspects of end-of-life experience. Family caregivers overwhelmingly agreed that the dignity therapy document is and will continue to be a source of comfort to them and they would recommend dignity therapy to others in the same situation.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first dignity therapy study to focus on MND and on home-based caregiving. RESULTS established the importance of narrative and generativity for patients with MND and may open the door for other neurodegenerative conditions.","['Aoun SM', 'Chochinov HM', 'Kristjanson LJ']",2015,18,1,J Palliat Med,"Aoun SM, et al.

25300936,Analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as a multistep process: a population-based modelling study.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis shares characteristics with some cancers, such as onset being more common in later life, progression usually being rapid, the disease affecting a particular cell type, and showing complex inheritance. We used a model originally applied to cancer epidemiology to investigate the hypothesis that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a multistep process.
METHODS: We generated incidence data by age and sex from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population registers in Ireland (registration dates 1995-2012), the Netherlands (2006-12), Italy (1995-2004), Scotland (1989-98), and England (2002-09), and calculated age and sex-adjusted incidences for each register. We regressed the log of age-specific incidence against the log of age with least squares regression. We did the analyses within each register, and also did a combined analysis, adjusting for register.
FINDINGS: We identified 6274 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from a catchment population of about 34 million people. We noted a linear relationship between log incidence and log age in all five registers: England r(2)=0·95, Ireland r(2)=0·99, Italy r(2)=0·95, the Netherlands r(2)=0·99, and Scotland r(2)=0·97; overall r(2)=0·99. All five registers gave similar estimates of the linear slope ranging from 4·5 to 5·1, with overlapping confidence intervals. The combination of all five registers gave an overall slope of 4·8 (95% CI 4·5-5·0), with similar estimates for men (4·6, 4·3-4·9) and women (5·0, 4·5-5·5).
INTERPRETATION: A linear relationship between the log incidence and log age of onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is consistent with a multistage model of disease. The slope estimate suggests that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a six-step process. Identification of these steps could lead to preventive and therapeutic avenues.

25262000,Experimental transmissibility of mutant SOD1 motor neuron disease.,"By unknown mechanisms, the symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) seem to spread along neuroanatomical pathways to engulf the motor nervous system. The rate at which symptoms spread is one of the primary drivers of disease progression. One mechanism by which ALS symptoms could spread is by a prion-like propagation of a toxic misfolded protein from cell to cell along neuroanatomic pathways. Proteins that can transmit toxic conformations between cells often can also experimentally transmit disease between individual organisms. To survey the ease with which motor neuron disease (MND) can be transmitted, we injected spinal cord homogenates prepared from paralyzed mice expressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1-G93A and G37R) into the spinal cords of genetically vulnerable SOD1 transgenic mice. From the various models we tested, one emerged as showing high vulnerability. Tissue homogenates from paralyzed G93A mice induced MND in 6 of 10 mice expressing low levels of G85R-SOD1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (G85R-YFP mice) by 3-11 months, and produced widespread spinal inclusion pathology. Importantly, second passage of homogenates from G93A → G85R-YFP mice back into newborn G85R-YFP mice induced disease in 4 of 4 mice by 3 months of age. Homogenates from paralyzed mice expressing the G37R variant were among those that transmitted poorly regardless of the strain of recipient transgenic animal injected, a finding suggestive of strain-like properties that manifest as differing abilities to transmit MND. Together, our data provide a working model for MND transmission to study the pathogenesis of ALS.","['Ayers JI', 'Fromholt S', 'Koch M', 'DeBosier A', 'McMahon B', 'Xu G', 'Borchelt DR']",2014,128,6,Acta Neuropathol,"Ayers JI, et al.

25239657,Genetic modifiers in carriers of repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene.,"BACKGROUND: Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) are causative for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron disease (MND). Substantial phenotypic heterogeneity has been described in patients with these expansions. We set out to identify genetic modifiers of disease risk, age at onset, and survival after onset that may contribute to this clinical variability.
RESULTS: We examined a cohort of 330 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 374 controls. In these individuals, we assessed variants previously implicated in FTD and/or MND; 36 variants were included in our analysis. After adjustment for multiple testing, our analysis revealed three variants significantly associated with age at onset (rs7018487 [UBAP1; p-value = 0.003], rs6052771 [PRNP; p-value = 0.003], and rs7403881 [MT-Ie; p-value = 0.003]), and six variants significantly associated with survival after onset (rs5848 [GRN; p-value = 0.001], rs7403881 [MT-Ie; p-value = 0.001], rs13268953 [ELP3; p-value = 0.003], the epsilon 4 allele [APOE; p-value = 0.004], rs12608932 [UNC13A; p-value = 0.003], and rs1800435 [ALAD; p-value = 0.003]).
CONCLUSIONS: Variants identified through this study were previously reported to be involved in FTD and/or MND, but we are the first to describe their effects as potential disease modifiers in the presence of a clear pathogenic mutation (i.e. C9ORF72 repeat expansion). Although validation of our findings is necessary, these variants highlight the importance of protein degradation, antioxidant defense and RNA-processing pathways, and additionally, they are promising targets for the development of therapeutic strategies and prognostic tests.","['van Blitterswijk M', 'Mullen B', 'Wojtas A', 'Heckman MG', 'Diehl NN', 'Baker MC', 'DeJesus-Hernandez M', 'Brown PH', 'Murray ME', 'Hsiung GY', 'Stewart H', 'Karydas AM', 'Finger E', 'Kertesz A', 'Bigio EH', 'Weintraub S', 'Mesulam M', 'Hatanpaa KJ', 'White CL', 'Neumann M', 'Strong MJ', 'Beach TG', 'Wszolek ZK', 'Lippa C', 'Caselli R', 'Petrucelli L', 'Josephs KA', 'Parisi JE', 'Knopman DS', 'Petersen RC', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Seeley WW', 'Grinberg LT', 'Miller BL', 'Boylan KB', 'Graff-Radford NR', 'Boeve BF', 'Dickson DW', 'Rademakers R']",2014,9,,Mol Neurodegener,"van Blitterswijk M, et al.

25228014,Grey matter damage in progressive multiple sclerosis versus amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a voxel-based morphometry MRI study.,"Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) seem to share some clinical and pathological features. MRI studies revealed the presence of grey matter (GM) atrophy in both diseases, but no comparative data are available. The objective was to compare the regional patterns of GM tissue loss in PPMS and ALS with voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Eighteen PPMS patients, 20 ALS patients, and 31 healthy controls (HC) were studied with a 1.5 Tesla scanner. VBM was performed to assess volumetric GM differences with age and sex as covariates. Threshold-free cluster enhancement analysis was used to obtain significant clusters. Group comparisons were tested with family-wise error correction for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05) except for HC versus MND which was tested at a level of p < 0.001 uncorrected and a cluster threshold of 20 contiguous voxels. Compared to HC, ALS patients showed GM tissue reduction in selected frontal and temporal areas, while PPMS patients showed a widespread bilateral GM volume decrease, involving both deep and cortical regions. Compared to ALS, PPMS patients showed tissue volume reductions in both deep and cortical GM areas. This preliminary study confirms that PPMS is characterized by a more diffuse cortical and subcortical GM atrophy than ALS and that, in the latter condition, brain damage is present outside the motor system. These results suggest that PPMS and ALS may share pathological features leading to GM tissue loss.","['Tavazzi E', 'Laganà MM', 'Bergsland N', 'Tortorella P', 'Pinardi G', 'Lunetta C', 'Corbo M', 'Rovaris M']",2015,36,3,Neurol Sci,"Tavazzi E, et al.

25225845,Developing an outcome measure for excessive saliva management in MND and an evaluation of saliva burden in Sheffield.,"There are few studies providing evidence to guide the management of oropharyngeal secretion problems in motor neuron disease (MND). There is a lack of a suitable outcome measure for evaluating management strategies. We applied several potential outcome measures for assessing excessive secretions to patients with MND who attended the Sheffield Care and Research Centre for Motor Neurone Disease between 21 November 2012 and 15 May 2013. These measures were the CSS-MND, a symptom rating scale, and the Drool and Wipe quotient, which were designed to semi-objectively measure patients' drooling. Of the 143 patients seen in clinic during the study period, 58 had symptoms of excessive secretions, and of whom 50 agreed to participate in the study. Semi-objective measures failed to effectively identify patients complaining of secretion problems. The CSS-MND had a relatively low internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.539; n = 50); however, analysis of the inter-item correlations suggested the appearance of low internal consistency was because the scale was measuring a variety of saliva related symptoms that did not necessarily influence each other. The scale correlated well with patient reported symptom impact (r = 0.673, n = 50). In conclusion, the CSS-MND would be a useful outcome measure in studies assessing the management of oropharyngeal secretion problems.","['McGeachan AJ', 'Hobson EV', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ']",2015,16,1-2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"McGeachan AJ, et al.

METHODS: A total of 200 consecutive patients with FTD recruited from 16 neurological clinics in Korea were evaluated by cognitive and functional assessments, a screening test for aphasia, behavioral questionnaires, motor assessments, and brain MRI or PET.
RESULTS: In our registry, 78 patients were classified as having been diagnosed with behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD), 70 with semantic dementia (SD), 33 with progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and 8 with motor neuron disease plus syndrome (MND-plus). The patients with language variants of dementia were older than those with bvFTD. There were no differences in sex ratio, duration of illness, or level of education among the four subgroups. Overall, the patients with bvFTD showed a significantly better performance in cognitive tests. A higher frequency of motor symptoms and a lower frequency of behavioral symptoms were found in PNFA than in bvFTD and SD. The Global Language Index was significantly lower in SD than in bvFTD and PNFA. The MND-plus group had a poorer performance than all the others in all cognitive domains.
CONCLUSION: The neuropsychological, behavioral, motor, and language characteristics of the four subtypes are comparable with those from other series. However, the proportion of SD (37.0%), which was similar to that of bvFTD (41.3%), was higher in our registry than in other series.","['Kim EJ', 'Park KW', 'Lee JH', 'Choi S', 'Jeong JH', 'Yoon SJ', 'Kim BC', 'Kwon JC', 'Ku BD', 'Kim SH', 'Choi BO', 'Na DL']",2014,4,2,Dement Geriatr Cogn Dis Extra,"Kim EJ, et al.

25115500,Vitamin D deficiency in patients with primary immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies.,"PURPOSE: T cells are important in the immunopathology of immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies (PNP) and activated vitamin D regulates the immune response through increasing the amount of regulatory T cells. An association between vitamin D deficiency and polyneuropathy has been stipulated; hence we assessed whether patients with primary immune-mediated PNP have low vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels.
METHODS: Plasma levels of 25(OH)D were analyzed in 26 patients with primary immune-mediated PNP, 50 healthy matched blood donors and 24 patients with motor neuron disease (MND). INCAT score was assessed in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. ALSFRS-R score was applied to MND patients and the modified Rankin (mRankin) scale compared disability among patient groups.
RESULTS: Mean 25(OH)D value in PNP patients was 40 ± 16 nmol/l, compared to 69 ± 21 nmol/l in healthy blood donors (p<0.001). MND patients had a higher mean 25(OH)D than PNP patients (59 ± 26 nmol/L; p=0.006) and comparable levels to healthy blood donors (p=0.15). Mean 25(OH)D value was not higher in PNP patients with pre-existing vitamin D3 supplementation of 800 IU/day (N=6; 35 ± 18 nmol/L) than in unsupplemented PNP patients (42 ± 16 nmol). INCAT score ranged from 0 to 10 (mean 3.5) and ALSFRS-R ranged from 11 to 44 (mean 31). mRankin score was more severe in MND patients (mean 3.5) compared to PNP patients (mean 2.1).
CONCLUSIONS: All patients with primary immune-mediated PNP were diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency and they had significantly lower 25(OH)D values than healthy control persons and MND patients. We suggest monitoring of vitamin D status in patients with autoimmune PNP, since immune cells are responsive to the ameliorative effects of vitamin D.","['Elf K', 'Askmark H', 'Nygren I', 'Punga AR']",2014,345,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Elf K, et al.

25090287,Breathlessness in motor neurone disease: a review of the current strategies and gaps in the evidence.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review on breathlessness and motor neurone disease (MND) is important, as palliative care teams are increasingly becoming involved in the complex care of these patients at an earlier stage in their illness. Subtle cognitive and behavioural changes with MND may make management more challenging. Breathlessness is a distressing symptom, impacting on both patients and carers. Assessment and expectant management of breathlessness improves the quality of life (QoL) and may minimize hospital admission.
RECENT FINDINGS: Low-dose opioids improve the sensation of breathlessness, with minimal side-effects. It is well established that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) improves survival in patients with MND and also improves health-related QoL of patients with minimal or no bulbar symptoms. Preparation of advance care plans is essential to the provision of care in the final stages of illness in patients with MND and NIV use.
SUMMARY: Assessment of breathlessness and its successful management improves the QoL of patients with MND. Opioids in titrated doses may play a role in this. NIV improves survival in patients with respiratory failure with minimal or no bulbar symptoms and should be offered when appropriate. Preemptive education improves the uptake and understanding of the role of NIV.",['Allcroft P'],2014,8,3,Curr Opin Support Palliat Care,Allcroft P.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of adults who presented over 12 years with muscle weakness, atrophy, or fasciculations, but without hyperreflexia or sensory involvement.
RESULTS: In 119 patients, 52% had a motor neuron disease (MND), 13% had immune neuropathies, 11% had genetic neuronopathies, 10% had residual or post-polio syndrome, 5% had benign fasciculation, 1% had an infectious etiology, and 8% were not given a final diagnosis. Only MND patients had cognitive dysfunction or frontal release signs. Bulbar and respiratory symptoms virtually excluded consideration of immune neuropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Only half of the patients were diagnosed with MND. A significant minority have treatable conditions. Cognitive involvement, frontal release signs, and bulbar or respiratory symptoms are strongly suggestive of MND.","['Sanderson AB', 'Arnold WD', 'Elsheikh B', 'Kissel JT']",2015,51,3,Muscle Nerve,"Sanderson AB, et al.

25037590,Associations between laryngeal and cough dysfunction in motor neuron disease with bulbar involvement.,"True vocal fold (TVF) dysfunction may lead to cough ineffectiveness. In individuals with motor neuron disease (MND), cough impairment in the context of dysphagia increases risk for aspiration and respiratory failure. This study characterizes differences and associations between TVF kinematics and airflow during cough in individuals with bulbar MND. Sequential glottal angles associated with TVF movements during volitional cough were analyzed from laryngeal video endoscopy examinations of adults with bulbar MND (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 12) and compared with simultaneously collected cough-related airflow measures. Significant group differences were observed with airflow and TVF measures: volume acceleration (p ≤ 0.001) and post-compression abduction TVF angle average velocity (p = 0.002) were lower and expiratory phase rise time (p = 0.001) was higher in the MND group. Reductions in maximum TVF angle during post-compression abduction in the MND group approached significance (p = 0.09). All subjects demonstrated complete TVF and supraglottic closure during the compression phase of cough, except for incomplete supraglottic closure in 2/12 MND participants. A strong positive relationship between post-compression maximum TVF abduction angle and peak expiratory cough flow was observed in the MND group, though it was not statistically significant (r = 0.55; p = 0.098). Reductions in the speed and extent of TVF abduction are seen during the expulsion phase of cough in individuals with MND. This may contribute to cough impairment and morbidity.","['Britton D', 'Benditt JO', 'Merati AL', 'Miller RM', 'Stepp CE', 'Boitano L', 'Hu A', 'Ciol MA', 'Yorkston KM']",2014,29,6,Dysphagia,"Britton D, et al.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 136 clinically heterogeneous patients with ALS and 104 healthy and neurological controls was extended to include a prospective analysis of 74 of these ALS cases, with samplings at approximately 3-month intervals in a follow-up period of up to 3 years. We analysed the correlation between longitudinal NfH-phosphoform levels and disease progression. Temporal patterns of NfH changes were evaluated using multilevel linear regression.
RESULTS: Baseline plasma NfH levels were higher than controls only in patients with ALS with short disease duration to baseline sampling. Compared with controls, fast-progressing patients with ALS, particularly those with a short diagnostic latency and disease duration, had higher plasma NfH levels at an early stage and lower levels closer to end-stage disease. Lower NfH levels between visits were associated with rapid functional deterioration. We also detected antibodies against NfH, NfH aggregates and NfH cleavage products.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease progression in ALS involves defined trajectories of plasma NfH levels, reflecting speed of neurological decline and survival. Intervisit plasma NfH changes are also indicative of disease progression. This study confirms that longitudinal measurements of NfH plasma levels are more informative than cross-sectional studies, where the time of sampling may represent a bias in the interpretation of the results. Autoantibodies against NfH aggregates and NfH cleavage products may explain the variable expression of plasma NfH with disease progression.

24973750,Fishing for causes and cures of motor neuron disorders.,"Motor neuron disorders (MNDs) are a clinically heterogeneous group of neurological diseases characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, and share some common pathological pathways. Despite remarkable advances in our understanding of these diseases, no curative treatment for MNDs exists. To better understand the pathogenesis of MNDs and to help develop new treatments, the establishment of animal models that can be studied efficiently and thoroughly is paramount. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly becoming a valuable model for studying human diseases and in screening for potential therapeutics. In this Review, we highlight recent progress in using zebrafish to study the pathology of the most common MNDs: spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). These studies indicate the power of zebrafish as a model to study the consequences of disease-related genes, because zebrafish homologues of human genes have conserved functions with respect to the aetiology of MNDs. Zebrafish also complement other animal models for the study of pathological mechanisms of MNDs and are particularly advantageous for the screening of compounds with therapeutic potential. We present an overview of their potential usefulness in MND drug discovery, which is just beginning and holds much promise for future therapeutic development.","['Patten SA', 'Armstrong GA', 'Lissouba A', 'Kabashi E', 'Parker JA', 'Drapeau P']",2014,7,7,Dis Model Mech,"Patten SA, et al.

24950788,Brain distribution of dipeptide repeat proteins in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor neurone disease associated with expansions in C9ORF72.,"A hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) expansion in C9ORF72 gene is the most common genetic change seen in familial Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) and familial Motor Neurone Disease (MND). Pathologically, expansion bearers show characteristic p62 positive, TDP-43 negative inclusion bodies within cerebellar and hippocampal neurons which also contain dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR) formed from sense and antisense RAN (repeat associated non ATG-initiated) translation of the expanded repeat region itself. 'Inappropriate' formation, and aggregation, of DPR might therefore confer neurotoxicity and influence clinical phenotype. Consequently, we compared the topographic brain distribution of DPR in 8 patients with Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 6 with FTD + MND and 7 with MND alone (all 21 patients bearing expansions in C9ORF72) using a polyclonal antibody to poly-GA, and related this to the extent of TDP-43 pathology in key regions of cerebral cortex and hippocampus. There were no significant differences in either the pattern or severity of brain distribution of DPR between FTD, FTD + MND and MND groups, nor was there any relationship between the distribution of DPR and TDP-43 pathologies in expansion bearers. Likewise, there were no significant differences in the extent of TDP-43 pathology between FTLD patients bearing an expansion in C9ORF72 and non-bearers of the expansion. There were no association between the extent of DPR pathology and TMEM106B or APOE genotypes. However, there was a negative correlation between the extent of DPR pathology and age at onset. Present findings therefore suggest that although the presence and topographic distribution of DPR may be of diagnostic relevance in patients bearing expansion in C9ORF72 this has no bearing on the determination of clinical phenotype. Because TDP-43 pathologies are similar in bearers and non-bearers of the expansion, the expansion may act as a major genetic risk factor for FTLD and MND by rendering the brain highly vulnerable to those very same factors which generate FTLD and MND in sporadic disease.","['Davidson YS', 'Barker H', 'Robinson AC', 'Thompson JC', 'Harris J', 'Troakes C', 'Smith B', 'Al-Saraj S', 'Shaw C', 'Rollinson S', 'Masuda-Suzukake M', 'Hasegawa M', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Snowden JS', 'Mann DM']",2014,2,,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Davidson YS, et al.

24943344,Frontotemporal dementia and its subtypes: a genome-wide association study.,"BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a complex disorder characterised by a broad range of clinical manifestations, differential pathological signatures, and genetic variability. Mutations in three genes-MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72--have been associated with FTD. We sought to identify novel genetic risk loci associated with the disorder.
METHODS: We did a two-stage genome-wide association study on clinical FTD, analysing samples from 3526 patients with FTD and 9402 healthy controls. To reduce genetic heterogeneity, all participants were of European ancestry. In the discovery phase (samples from 2154 patients with FTD and 4308 controls), we did separate association analyses for each FTD subtype (behavioural variant FTD, semantic dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia, and FTD overlapping with motor neuron disease [FTD-MND]), followed by a meta-analysis of the entire dataset. We carried forward replication of the novel suggestive loci in an independent sample series (samples from 1372 patients and 5094 controls) and then did joint phase and brain expression and methylation quantitative trait loci analyses for the associated (p<5 × 10(-8)) single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
FINDINGS: We identified novel associations exceeding the genome-wide significance threshold (p<5 × 10(-8)). Combined (joint) analyses of discovery and replication phases showed genome-wide significant association at 6p21.3, HLA locus (immune system), for rs9268877 (p=1·05 × 10(-8); odds ratio=1·204 [95% CI 1·11-1·30]), rs9268856 (p=5·51 × 10(-9); 0·809 [0·76-0·86]) and rs1980493 (p value=1·57 × 10(-8), 0·775 [0·69-0·86]) in the entire cohort. We also identified a potential novel locus at 11q14, encompassing RAB38/CTSC (the transcripts of which are related to lysosomal biology), for the behavioural FTD subtype for which joint analyses showed suggestive association for rs302668 (p=2·44 × 10(-7); 0·814 [0·71-0·92]). Analysis of expression and methylation quantitative trait loci data suggested that these loci might affect expression and methylation in cis.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that immune system processes (link to 6p21.3) and possibly lysosomal and autophagy pathways (link to 11q14) are potentially involved in FTD. Our findings need to be replicated to better define the association of the newly identified loci with disease and to shed light on the pathomechanisms contributing to FTD.

24866401,Ataxin-2 as potential disease modifier in C9ORF72 expansion carriers.,"Repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) are an important cause of both motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Currently, little is known about factors that could account for the phenotypic heterogeneity detected in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. In this study, we investigated 4 genes that could represent genetic modifiers: ataxin-2 (ATXN2), non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1 (NIPA1), survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), and survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2). Assessment of these genes, in a unique cohort of 331 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 376 control subjects, revealed that intermediate repeat lengths in ATXN2 possibly act as disease modifier in C9ORF72 expansion carriers; no evidence was provided for a potential role of NIPA1, SMN1, or SMN2. The effects of intermediate ATXN2 repeats were most profound in probands with MND or FTD/MND (2.1% vs. 0% in control subjects, p = 0.013), whereas the frequency in probands with FTD was identical to control subjects. Though intermediate ATXN2 repeats were already known to be associated with MND risk, previous reports did not focus on individuals with clear pathogenic mutations, such as repeat expansions in C9ORF72. Based on our present findings, we postulate that intermediate ATXN2 repeat lengths may render C9ORF72 expansion carriers more susceptible to the development of MND; further studies are needed, however, to validate our findings.","['van Blitterswijk M', 'Mullen B', 'Heckman MG', 'Baker MC', 'DeJesus-Hernandez M', 'Brown PH', 'Murray ME', 'Hsiung GY', 'Stewart H', 'Karydas AM', 'Finger E', 'Kertesz A', 'Bigio EH', 'Weintraub S', 'Mesulam M', 'Hatanpaa KJ', 'White CL', 'Neumann M', 'Strong MJ', 'Beach TG', 'Wszolek ZK', 'Lippa C', 'Caselli R', 'Petrucelli L', 'Josephs KA', 'Parisi JE', 'Knopman DS', 'Petersen RC', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Seeley WW', 'Grinberg LT', 'Miller BL', 'Boylan KB', 'Graff-Radford NR', 'Boeve BF', 'Dickson DW', 'Rademakers R']",2014,35,10,Neurobiol Aging,"van Blitterswijk M, et al.

24863345,Muscle ultrasonography for detecting fasciculations in frontotemporal dementia.,"Ultrasound detection of muscle fasciculations was recently proposed for assessing lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction in ALS patients. Given the continuum between ALS and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), the aim of the present study was to evaluate muscle ultrasound (MUS) in FTD both for feasibility and prevalence of fasciculations. Twenty-two FTD patients were examined (five muscles bilaterally: biceps brachii, first dorsalis interosseous, T10 paraspinalis, vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior) with a 7-MHz linear array transducer and a fasciculation score (FS) computed. Twenty-two matched cognitively-intact control subjects and six ALS patients were also included. Results showed that MUS was feasible, reliable and well tolerated in all subjects. Two FTD/MND patients displayed very high FS values, similar to those in ALS patients. The remaining 20 FTD patients displayed a mean FS value significantly higher than the control group with six patients (30%) having FS values out of the range of controls. Disease progression rate correlated with the FS. In conclusion, MUS can be easily applied to FTD patients and represents a non-invasive technique for defining LMN involvement in these patients. LMN dysfunction is a frequent condition in FTD and might identify a subset of patients with a different clinical course.","['Tremolizzo L', 'Susani E', 'Aliprandi A', 'Salmaggi A', 'Ferrarese C', 'Appollonio I']",2014,15,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Tremolizzo L, et al.

24862096,Oral health and dental treatment needs of people with motor neurone disease.,"BACKGROUND: People with motor neurone disease (MND) may present with physical limitations impacting on oral health and access to oral health care. This study aimed to assess the oral health status and treatment needs of people with MND in Victoria, Australia.
METHODS: Patients with advanced MND attending a multidisciplinary MND clinic in Melbourne were recruited. Data collection included self-reporting questionnaires on previous dental experience, current oral hygiene practices and current dietary habits, a medical questionnaire, and a clinical examination charting participants' dentition, restorations, caries and periodontal status, plaque and gingival indices, and assessment of oral health.
RESULTS: Thirty-three participants took part in the study with eight self-reporting regular dental visits. No participant exhibited probing depths of more than 3 mm. Ten out of 27 dentate participants required extractions and restorations for retained roots and caries, while three presented with non-carious cavities, lost restorations and fractured cusps. Oral health status was not affected by MND presentation in these participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The study found that oral health was not affected by advanced MND. Participants' and clinical teams' motivation towards oral health care may have contributed to oral health. The dental profession should be involved as part of the multidisciplinary effort towards ongoing care.","['Tay CM', 'Howe J', 'Borromeo GI']",2014,59,3,Aust Dent J,"Tay CM, et al.

24861427,No interaction between tau and TDP-43 pathologies in either frontotemporal lobar degeneration or motor neurone disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is classified mainly into FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP according to the protein present within inclusion bodies. While such a classification implies only a single type of protein should be present, recent studies have demonstrated dual tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy can occur, particularly in inherited FTLD.
METHODS: We therefore investigated 33 patients with FTLD-tau (including 9 with MAPT mutation) for TDP-43 pathological changes, and 45 patients with FTLD-TDP (including 12 with hexanucleotide expansion in C9ORF72 and 12 with GRN mutation), and 23 patients with motor neurone disease (3 with hexanucleotide expansion in C9ORF72), for tauopathy.
RESULTS: TDP-43 pathological changes, of the kind seen in many elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease, were seen in only two FTLD-tau cases--a 70-year-old male with exon 10 + 13 mutation in MAPT, and a 73-year-old female with corticobasal degeneration. Such changes were considered to be secondary and probably reflective of advanced age. Conversely, there was generally only scant tau pathology, usually only within hippocampus and/or entorhinal cortex, in most patients with FTLD-TDP or MND. The extent of tau pathology in FTLD-TDP and MND, as with amyloid β protein, may relate to increased age and possession of Apolipoprotein ε4 allele.
CONCLUSION: We find no predilection or predisposition towards an accompanying TDP-43 pathology in patients with FTLD-tau, irrespective of presence or absence of MAPT mutation, or that genetic changes associated with FTLD-TDP predispose towards excessive tauopathy. Where the two processes coexist, this is limited and probably causatively independent of each other.","['Robinson AC', 'Thompson JC', 'Weedon L', 'Rollinson S', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Snowden JS', 'Davidson YS', 'Mann DM']",2014,40,7,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Robinson AC, et al.

24848262,The impact of gastrostomy in motor neurone disease: challenges and benefits from a patient and carer perspective.,"OBJECTIVES: This study explores the experience of gastrostomy insertion from the perspective of the patients and their informal carers. Gastrostomy feeding is commonly used to support motor neurone disease (MND) patients with dysphagia. However, there is lack of information describing patient and carer experiences following gastrostomy insertion. The effect of gastrostomy on quality of life for these patients and their family is currently not well understood.
METHODS: Retrospective qualitative exploration using semistructured interviews with patients and their informal carers to elicit in-depth descriptions of their experiences and views following gastrostomy.
RESULTS: 27 patients consented to the study; of these, 23 underwent a successful gastrostomy. 10 patients and 8 carers were interviewed, approximately 3 months following a successful gastrostomy. Participants described clinical complications, practical issues, time restrictions imposed by strict feeding regimens and psychological issues, which adversely impacted on quality of life. However, the establishment of a safe alternative route for feeding and medication, and the reduced worry over difficult meals and weight loss, were described by all as outweighing these negative impacts. Participants also described having received education/training on gastrostomy feeding both in hospital and in the community, which helped them to cope during the transition from oral to gastrostomy feeding.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the challenges and benefits of gastrostomy as well as the importance of education and information provision. Emphasis should be given to education before and after insertion along with support and care in the community. While the significant impact of gastrostomy on patients and carers should not be underestimated, the potential benefits were described as outweighing these concerns.","['Stavroulakis T', 'Baird WO', 'Baxter SK', 'Walsh T', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ']",2016,6,1,BMJ Support Palliat Care,"Stavroulakis T, et al.

24847964,The use of botulinum toxin injections to manage drooling in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease: a systematic review.,"Difficulty in managing oral secretions is commonly experienced by patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neurone disease (MND) and associated bulbar weakness including dysphagia. There are no definitive evidence-based treatment guidelines to manage the distressing symptom of drooling. We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injections to reduce saliva in ALS/MND. The search strategy was conducted in four stages: (1) electronic search of relevant databases, (2) hand searches of all international ALS/MND symposium journals, (3) email request to MND care centres in the UK and Ireland, and (4) hand searching of reference lists. All studies were critically appraised and relevant data extracted. Botulinum toxin type A and type B were analysed separately. Due to heterogeneity, it was not possible to calculate a pooled estimate of effect. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria (9 for type A and 3 for type B). Only two randomised controlled trials were identified. Study sample sizes were small with a mean of 12.5 subjects. The most frequently reported outcomes were weight of cotton rolls and number of tissues used. All studies claimed the intervention tested was effective, but only seven studies (4 for type A and 3 for type B) reported statistically significant differences. Although there is evidence to suggest that botulinum toxin B can reduce drooling, the evidence base is limited by a lack of randomized controlled trials. Evidence to support the use of botulinum toxin A is weaker. Larger trials will help remove the uncertainty practitioners face in treating this disabling symptom.","['Squires N', 'Humberstone M', 'Wills A', 'Arthur A']",2014,29,4,Dysphagia,"Squires N, et al.

Furthermore, HIV-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) syndrome differs from the classical ALS in some key aspects.. A 44-year-old male presented with a history of insidious onset and gradually progressive asymmetric weakness of lower limbs. He also complained of thinning in both legs, the left leg more than the right since 1 year along with spontaneous twitching of muscles in both the thighs. On neurological examination, the assessment of higher mental functions was normal. There were no cranial nerve deficits. Motor power was grade 5/5 (Medical Research Council scale) in both the upper limbs and 4+ at hips and knees bilaterally, 5 at right ankle, and 4+ at left ankle. All the deep tendon reflexes were brisk with extensor planter responses. There were no cerebellar signs or sensory deficits. HIV-1 was reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Electrophysiological studies were conducted per the MND protocol.None of the nerves studied showed an abnormal drop in compound muscle action potential amplitude with proximal stimulation. There was evidence of diffuse spontaneous activity, which manifests as fibrillation and fasciculation potentials in most muscles tested .

24816742,"Feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of dignity therapy for people with motor neurone disease.","BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) practice guidelines suggest developing interventions that will promote hope, meaning, and dignity to alleviate psychological distress, but very little research has been done. This study begins to address this need by exploring the use of dignity therapy with people with MND. Dignity therapy is a brief psychotherapy that promotes hope, meaning and dignity, and enhances the end of life for people with advanced cancer. The aims of this study are to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of dignity therapy for people with MND.
METHODS/DESIGN: This cross-sectional feasibility study used a one-group pre-test post-test design with 29 people diagnosed with MND. Study participants completed the following self-report questionnaires: Herth Hope Index, FACIT-sp, Patient Dignity Inventory, ALS Assessment Questionnaire, ALS Cognitive Behavioural Screen, and a demographic and health history questionnaire. Acceptability was measured with a 25-item feedback questionnaire. Feasibility was assessed by examining the length of time taken to complete dignity therapy and how symptoms common in MND affected the intervention. Generalised linear mixed models and reliable change scores were used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: There were no significant pre-test post-test changes for hopefulness, spirituality or dignity on the group level, but there were changes in hopefulness on the individual level. The results of the feedback questionnaire indicates dignity therapy is highly acceptable to people with MND, who report benefits similar to those in the international randomised controlled trial on dignity therapy, a population who primarily had end-stage cancer. Benefits include better family relationships, improved sense of self and greater acceptance. Dignity therapy with people with MND is feasible if the therapist can overcome time and communication difficulties.
CONCLUSIONS: Dignity therapy for people with MND is feasible and acceptable. Further research is warranted to explore its ability to diminish distress.

She developed memory impairment at the age of 68 years. Atrophy of her hand muscles was noted at the age of 71 years. She was not aware of her memory impairment or muscle weakness, and was loquacious and euphoric. She was clinically diagnosed as having Alzheimer disease (AD) complicated by ALS with dementia/frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (ALS-D/FTLD-MND). A neuropathological study confirmed the presence of features of sporadic ALS. Furthermore, severe neuronal loss involving the subiculum and the rostral portion of the medial side of the temporal pole cortex was detected, and TAR DNA-binding protein-43-positive-neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were identified in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. These findings were compatible with the pathological features of ALS-D/FTLD-MND. Although many pretangles, neuropil threads and senile plaques were revealed in the degenerated areas, there were few neurofibrillary tangles and typical plaques (Braak stage III, C). Further discussion is required to determine whether AD with ALS-D/FTLD-MND is different from typical AD.

24796270,Why don't they accept non-invasive ventilation?: insight into the interpersonal perspectives of patients with motor neurone disease.,"OBJECTIVES: Although non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can benefit survival and quality of life, it is rejected by a substantial proportion of people with motor neurone disease (MND). The aim of this study was to understand why some MND patients decline or withdraw from NIV.
METHOD: Nine patients with MND (male = 7, mean age = 67 years) participated in this study. These patients, from a cohort of 35 patients who were offered NIV treatment to support respiratory muscle weakness, did not participate in NIV treatment when it was clinically appropriate. Semi-structured interviews and interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) were employed to explore these patient's experience of MND and their thoughts and understanding of NIV treatment.
RESULTS: Using IPA, four themes were identified: preservation of the self, negative perceptions of NIV, negative experience with health care services, and not needing NIV. Further analysis identified the fundamental issue to be the maintenance of perceived self, which was interpreted to consist of the sense of autonomy, dignity, and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate psychological reasons for disengagement with NIV. The threat to the self, the sense of loss of control, and negative views of NIV resulting from anxiety were more important to these patients than prolonging life in its current form. These findings suggest the importance of understanding the psychological dimension involved in decision-making regarding uptake of NIV and a need for sensitive holistic evaluation if NIV is declined. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Non-invasive ventilation is widely used as an effective symptomatic therapy in MND, yet about a third of patients decline the treatment. Psychological disturbance generated by NIV use leads to negative experiences of the treatment. Decision-making about treatment potentials is complex and unique to each individual affected by perceived impact of disease. What does this study add? A decision concerning NIV uptake was influenced by perceived impact on individuals' sense of self. Sense of self was influenced by the maintenance of autonomy, dignity, and quality of life. Individuals' sense of self was identified to have been challenged by the disease, NIV, and their experience of health care service.","['Ando H', 'Williams C', 'Angus RM', 'Thornton EW', 'Chakrabarti B', 'Cousins R', 'Piggin LH', 'Young CA']",2015,20,2,Br J Health Psychol,"Ando H, et al.

24759627,Family history of frontotemporal lobar degeneration in Asia--an international multi-center research.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies in western countries have shown that about 30%-50% of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) have a positive family history, whereas the few epidemiological studies on FTLD done in Asia reported much lower frequencies. It is not clear the reason why the frequencies of FTLD with positive family history were lower in Asia. Furthermore, these findings were not from studies focused on family history. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further studies on the family history of FTLD in Asia. This international multi-center research aims to investigate the family histories in patients with FTLD and related neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and motor neuron diseases in a larger Asian cohort.
METHODS: Participants were collected from five countries: India, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, and Philippines. All patients were diagnosed with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD), progressive non-fluent aphasia (PA), frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease (FTD/MND), PSP, and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) according to international consensus criteria. Family histories of FTLD and related neurodegenerative diseases were investigated in each patient.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were included in this study. Forty-two patients were diagnosed to have bvFTD, two patients had FTD/MND, 22 had SD, 15 had PA, one had PA/CBS, five had CBS and four patients had PSP. Family history of any FTLD spectrum disorder was reported in 9.5% in bvFTD patients but in none of the SD or PA.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to patients of the western countries, few Asian FTLD patients have positive family histories of dementia.","['Fukuhara R', 'Ghosh A', 'Fuh JL', 'Dominguez J', 'Ong PA', 'Dutt A', 'Liu YC', 'Tanaka H', 'Ikeda M']",2014,26,12,Int Psychogeriatr,"Fukuhara R, et al.

24749678,A permanent emergency: a longitudinal study on families coping with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that has a strong impact on the lives of the people affected and on their close relatives, who have to tackle the demanding duties of caring for and assisting them. Family life can be profoundly influenced by this disease, and evaluating how the relevant parameters of family functioning relate to the markers of psychological adjustment of patients and caregivers is an important research objective, with implications for clinical practice. We examined the associations of family cohesion and adaptability (FACES III) with patients' coping strategies (MND Coping Scale) and caregivers' burden (CBI) in a longitudinal study with a sample of 19 pairs of patients with ALS and primary caregivers. The results showed a tendency toward patterns of extreme family functioning, with increasing levels of cohesion and adaptability, especially in the ideal versions of family functioning. Such high levels of cohesion and adaptability were correlated with positive markers of adjustment, especially in terms of the adaptive coping strategies of patients. Increasing and extreme levels of both cohesion and adaptability seem to be expected and even adaptive in the case of a progressive and impairing disease like ALS. Methodological concerns regarding the operationalization of family functioning constructs are also discussed.","['Tramonti F', 'Barsanti I', 'Bongioanni P', 'Bogliolo C', 'Rossi B']",2014,32,3,Fam Syst Health,"Tramonti F, et al.

24705136,Zebrafish models of human motor neuron diseases: advantages and limitations.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are an etiologically heterogeneous group of disorders of neurodegenerative origin, which result in degeneration of lower (LMNs) and/or upper motor neurons (UMNs). Neurodegenerative MNDs include pure hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), which involves specific degeneration of UMNs, leading to progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. In contrast, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) involves the specific degeneration of LMNs, with symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult-onset MND, is characterized by the degeneration of both UMNs and LMNs, leading to progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and spasticity. A review of the comparative neuroanatomy of the human and zebrafish motor systems showed that, while the zebrafish was a homologous model for LMN disorders, such as SMA, it was only partially relevant in the case of UMN disorders, due to the absence of corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts in its central nervous system. Even considering the limitation of this model to fully reproduce the human UMN disorders, zebrafish offer an excellent alternative vertebrate model for the molecular and genetic dissection of MND mechanisms. Its advantages include the conservation of genome and physiological processes and applicable in vivo tools, including easy imaging, loss or gain of function methods, behavioral tests to examine changes in motor activity, and the ease of simultaneous chemical/drug testing on large numbers of animals. This facilitates the assessment of the environmental origin of MNDs, alone or in combination with genetic traits and putative modifier genes. Positive hits obtained by phenotype-based small-molecule screening using zebrafish may potentially be effective drugs for treatment of human MNDs.","['Babin PJ', 'Goizet C', 'Raldúa D']",2014,118,,Prog Neurobiol,"Babin PJ, et al.

24698287,Diagnostic utility of cortical excitability studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) relies on identification of a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs. In order to improve the diagnostic sensitivity for ALS, Awaji criteria were developed, in part to better incorporate neurophysiological measures, although assessment of upper motor neuron dysfunction remained clinically based. Given that cortical hyperexcitability appears to be an early feature in ALS, the present study assessed the diagnostic utility of a threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation technique as an aid to the research-based Awaji criteria in establishing an earlier diagnosis of ALS.
METHODS: Prospective studies were undertaken on a cohort of 82 patients with suspected ALS and results were compared with 34 healthy controls.
RESULTS: Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was significantly reduced in ALS patients (P < 0.0001), with a comparable reduction evident in the Awaji groups (SICIAWAJI POSSIBLE 1.3% ± 1.3%; SICIAWAJI PROBABLE/DEFINITE 1.4% ±1.7%). Central motor conduction time was significantly prolonged (P < 0.001), whereas the motor evoked potential amplitude (P < 0.05) and intracortical facilitation (P < 0.05) were increased. The frequency of transcranial magnetic stimulation abnormalities was similar across Awaji subgroups, and addition of transcranial magnetic stimulation abnormalities as a diagnostic category enabled reclassification of 88% of Awaji possible patients to Awaji probable/definite.
CONCLUSIONS: Cortical excitability studies potentially facilitate an earlier diagnosis of ALS when combined with clinical and conventional neurophysiological findings, albeit in a research setting.","['Geevasinga N', 'Menon P', 'Yiannikas C', 'Kiernan MC', 'Vucic S']",2014,21,12,Eur J Neurol,"Geevasinga N, et al.

24689740,Epidemiological characteristics of motor neuron disease in Chinese patients.,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of motor neuron disease (MND) in Chinese patients are ill known.
METHODS: A registered study of 461 MND patients was conducted across 10 facilities in 7 Chinese cities from February 2009 to March 2010.
RESULTS: Patients were classified as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (84.4%), progressive bulbar palsy (PBP) (4.1%), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) (10.4%), or primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) (0.9%). MND was predominant in men (men/women; 1.6:1.0). Mean onset age was 52.6 years, with the highest incidence being observed between 51 and 60 years. Notably, 26.0% of MND patients were employed in forestry, fishery, or animal husbandry industries. Ten cases (2.7%) reported family history of MND, and 54.2% exhibited cervical onset. MND was also associated with head/neck trauma. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was the most common supportive therapy.
CONCLUSION: As a novel comprehensive report of a Chinese population, this study reveals that epidemiological characteristics of MND patients were similar to those observed in international populations. MND is age-related, male gender predominant, and may be associated with both environmental and genetic risk factors.","['Cui F', 'Liu M', 'Chen Y', 'Huang X', 'Cui L', 'Fan D', 'Pu C', 'Lu J', 'Zhou D', 'Zhang C', 'Yan C', 'Li C', 'Ding X', 'Liu Y', 'Li X', 'Jiang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Shang H', 'Yao X', 'Ding Y', 'Niu Q', 'Wang L']",2014,130,2,Acta Neurol Scand,"Cui F, et al.

24684800,Pattern of neurological disease seen among patients admitted in tertiary care hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Neurologic disorders are not uncommon at in patient departments of different hospitals. We have conducted the study to see the pattern and burden of neurologic disorders at different inpatient departments of a tertiary care centre.
METHODOLOGY: This retrospective observational study was carried out from the records and referral notes of neurology department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) from July 2011 to June 2012. A total 335 patients were evaluated by consultant neurologists during this period.
RESULT: Majority of the patients (59.7%) presented after the age of forty years. The mean age at presentation was 45.11 ± 17.3 years with a male predominance (63.3%). Stroke was the most common condition (47.5%) observed at referral, followed by seizure (9.3%), disease of spinal cord (7.8%) and encephalopathy (6.3%). Even after consultation, 30 patients remained undiagnosed and 6 were diagnosed as functional disorder. Department of Medicine (231, 69%) and Cardiology (61, 18.2%) made most of the calls. More than half (56%) of the stroke patients were referred from medicine and one third (35.2%) from cardiology. Seizure (67.7%), problem in spinal cord (92.3%), coma (50%), encephalopathy (57.1%), motor neuron disease (MND) (72.7%) were common reasons for referral from department of Medicine. Whereas patients with cord disease (7.3%), CNS tumor (40%), seizure disorder (6.5%) and stroke (3.8%) were referred from surgery. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology sought help for stroke (2.5%), seizure (12.9%), MND (27.3%), coma (16.7%) and encephalopathy (9.5%). Hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, dyslipidaemia and respiratory problem were significantly associated co-morbid conditions in stroke patients (at 95% CI, p value is <0.001, <0.01, <0.001, <0.05, <0.05 respectively). Hematological disorders were common association among patients with cord problem (<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Wide ranges of neurological problems are often managed by physicians and surgeons, especially those from medicine and cardiology. Where ever available consultation from neurologists can help in diagnosing and managing these cases.","['Chowdhury RN', 'Hasan AT', 'Ur Rahman Y', 'Khan SI', 'Hussain AR', 'Ahsan S']",2014,7,,BMC Res Notes,"Chowdhury RN, et al.

24646211,"Feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of dignity therapy for family carers of people with motor neurone disease.","BACKGROUND: Dignity therapy is a brief psychotherapy that has been shown to enhance the end of life experience. Dignity therapy often involves family carers to support patients weakened by illness and family carers are also the usual recipients of the legacy documents created. No research to date has examined the impact of dignity therapy on family carers at the time of the intervention. This study examined the effects of dignity therapy on family carers of people with motor neurone disease (MND).
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study utilizing a one-group pre-test post-test design with 18 family carers of people diagnosed with MND. Outcomes measured caregiver burden, anxiety, depression, and hopefulness. Acceptability was measured with a questionnaire. Feasibility was assessed by examining family carers' involvement in the therapy sessions, time taken to conduct sessions, and any special accommodations or deviations from the dignity therapy protocol.
RESULTS: There were no significant pre-test post-test changes on the group level, but there were decreases in anxiety and depression on the individual level. Baseline measures indicate that 50% of family carers had moderate to severe scores for anxiety prior to dignity therapy. MND family carers saw benefits to the person with MND and to themselves after bereavement, but acceptability of dignity therapy at the time of the intervention was mixed with some family carers indicating it was helpful, some indicating it was harmful, and many expressing ambivalence. Dignity therapy involving MND family carers is feasible and the involvement of family carers has minimal impact on the therapy.
CONCLUSION: Dignity therapy is not likely to alleviate caregiver burden in MND family carers, but it may have the ability to decrease or moderate anxiety and depression in distressed MND family carers. Dignity therapy is feasible and generally acceptable to MND family carers. Dignity therapists may provide a better experience for family carers when they are aware of acceptance levels and the quality of partner relationships.

24644771,Experience of long-term use of non-invasive ventilation in motor neuron disease: an interpretative phenomenological analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Although non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can promote quality of life in motor neuron disease (MND), previous studies have disregarded the impact of progression of illness. This study explored how patients' perceptions of NIV treatment evolve over time and how this was reflected in their adherence to NIV.
METHODS: Five patients with MND (male=4, mean age=59 years), from a bigger cohort who were prospectively followed, had multiple post-NIV semistructured interviews, covering more than 12 months, along with ventilator interaction data. The transcribed phenomenological data were analysed using qualitative methodology.
RESULTS: Three themes emerged: experience of NIV, influence on attitudes and perceived impact of NIV on prognosis. The ventilator interaction data identified regular use of NIV by four participants who each gave positive account of their experience of NIV treatment, and irregular use by one participant who at interview revealed a negative attitude to NIV treatment and in whom MND induced feelings of hopelessness.
CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study suggests that a positive coping style, adaptation and hope are key factors for psychological well-being and better adherence to NIV. More studies are needed to determine these relationships.","['Ando H', 'Chakrabarti B', 'Angus RM', 'Cousins R', 'Thornton EW', 'Young CA']",2014,4,1,BMJ Support Palliat Care,"Ando H, et al.

24644770,Issues for palliative medicine doctors surrounding the withdrawal of non-invasive ventilation at the request of a patient with motor neurone disease: a scoping study.,"BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is beneficial for respiratory failure in motor neurone disease (MND) but some patients may wish to stop the intervention. Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that research is needed on NIV withdrawal. There is little in the literature focusing on the issues doctors face when withdrawing NIV in this group.
AIM: To identify issues and challenges that palliative medicine doctors encounter in relation to the withdrawal of NIV in MND patients.
METHOD: An electronic questionnaire was sent to members of the Association of Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland. Participants rated how practically, emotionally and ethically challenging they found the process of NIV withdrawal.
RESULTS: 76 doctors responding had been directly involved in withdrawal of NIV at the request of a patient with MND. A high percentage rated the practical, ethical and emotional challenges as 7 or more on a 0-10 scale. Thematic analysis of the free text revealed some common difficulties. Lack of guidance on practical aspects of withdrawal, poor advance care planning and the need to support all involved to prevent conflict were recurrent themes. Statements relating to the emotional burden were diverse but suggest many palliative care doctors feel significant personal impact.
CONCLUSIONS: The withdrawal of NIV in patients with MND appears to pose considerable challenges to palliative medicine doctors; emotionally, practically and to a lesser extent ethically. Development of guidelines and a clear ethical statement of conduct may help but emotional issues appear more complex.","['Faull C', 'Rowe Haynes C', 'Oliver D']",2014,4,1,BMJ Support Palliat Care,"Faull C, et al.

24644769,Staying just one step ahead: providing care for patients with motor neurone disease.,"INTRODUCTION: There is limited information about the experiences and educational needs of health professionals who may be required to provide care for people with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) especially in the later stages of the disease. The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of, and need for, education of these health professionals.
METHODS: Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 31 health professionals with some experience in providing palliative care for people with MND. Thematic content analysis was used to identify common themes.
RESULTS: A key theme, Just One Step Ahead, emerged, that describes the central capability health professionals identified as necessary to help individuals plan and prepare for disease and lifestyle changes just before they arise. Two subthemes also emerged: Expertise in MND and Bespoke Communication. Expertise in MND described the required understanding of the disease and the particular individual's version of the disease to allow the health professional to plan, advise, support and anticipate the needs of the person living with MND. Bespoke Communication was the facility to tailor care messages sensitively and effectively to the range of people involved in care (patients, family, healthcare team members).
CONCLUSIONS: Care of people with MND requires up-to-date expertise about the disease and skilled communication abilities to manage complexity and change. Timely and focused education and specialist MND support for care providers are essential to tailored and responsive care and a widely available education programme has been developed to address these needs.","['McConigley R', 'Kristjanson LJ', 'Aoun SM', 'Oldham L', 'Currow DC', ""O'Connor M"", 'Holloway K']",2014,4,1,BMJ Support Palliat Care,"McConigley R, et al.

24641576,Record linkage between hospital discharges and mortality registries for motor neuron disease case ascertainment for the Spanish National Rare Diseases Registry.,"Our objective was to analyse the coverage of hospital discharge data and the mortality registry (MR) of La Rioja to ascertain motor neuron disease (MND) cases to be included in the Spanish National Rare Diseases Registry. MND cases that occurred in La Rioja during the period 1996-2011 were selected from hospital discharge data and the MR by means of the International Classification of Diseases. Review of the medical histories was carried out to confirm the causes of death reported. Characteristics of the population with MND were analysed. A total of 133 patients with MND were detected in La Rioja during the period 1996-2011; 30.1% were only recorded in the hospital discharges data, 12.0% only in the MR, and 57.9% were recorded by both databases. Medical records revealed a miscoding of patients who had been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy but were recorded in the MR with an MND code. In conclusion, the hospital discharges data and the MR appear to be complementary and are valuable databases for the Spanish National Rare Diseases Registry when MNDs are properly codified. Nevertheless, it would be advisable to corroborate the validity of the MR as data source since the miscoding of progressive supranuclear palsy has been corrected.","['Ruiz E', 'Ramalle-Gómara E', 'Quiñones C', 'Spain RDR Working Group']",2014,15,3-4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Ruiz E, et al.

24587475,Untargeted 1H-NMR metabolomics in CSF: toward a diagnostic biomarker for motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a CSF metabolomics signature for motor neuron disease (MND) using (1)H-NMR spectroscopy and to evaluate the predictive value of the profile in a separate cohort.
METHODS: We collected CSF from patients with MND and controls and analyzed the samples using (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. We divided the total patient sample in a 4:1 ratio into a training cohort and a test cohort. First, a metabolomics signature was created by statistical modeling in the training cohort, and then the analyses tested the predictive value of the signature in the test cohort. We conducted 10 independent trials for each step. Finally, we identified the compounds that contributed most consistently to the metabolome profile.
RESULTS: Analysis of CSF from 95 patients and 86 controls identified a diagnostic profile for MND (R(2)X > 22%, R(2)Y > 93%, Q(2) > 66%). The best model selected the correct diagnosis with mean probability of 99.31% in the training cohort. The profile discriminated between diagnostic groups with 78.9% sensitivity and 76.5% specificity in the test cohort. Metabolites linked to pathophysiologic pathways in MND (i.e., threonine, histidine, and molecules related to the metabolism of branched amino acids) were among the discriminant compounds.
CONCLUSION: CSF metabolomics using (1)H-NMR spectroscopy can detect a reproducible metabolic signature for MND with reasonable performance. To our knowledge, this is the first metabolomics study that shows that a validation in separate cohorts is feasible. These data should be considered in future biomarker studies.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that CSF metabolomics accurately distinguishes MNDs from other neurologic diseases.","['Blasco H', 'Nadal-Desbarats L', 'Pradat PF', 'Gordon PH', 'Antar C', 'Veyrat-Durebex C', 'Moreau C', 'Devos D', 'Mavel S', 'Emond P', 'Andres CR', 'Corcia P']",2014,82,13,Neurology,"Blasco H, et al.

NIV implementation historically occurred during a multi-day inpatient admission at this institution; however, increased demand led to prolonged waiting times. The aim of this study was to evaluate the introduction of an ambulatory model of NIV implementation. A prospective cohort study was performed. Inclusion criteria were referral for NIV implementation six months pre- or post-commencement of the Day Admission model. This model involved a 4-h stay to commence ventilation with follow-up in-laboratory polysomnography titration and outpatient attendance. Outcome measures included waiting time, hospital length of stay, adverse events and polysomnography data. Results indicated that after changing to the Day Admission model the median waiting time fell from 30 to 13.5 days (p < 0.04) and adverse events declined (4/17 pre- (three deaths, one acute admission) vs. 0/12 post-). Survival was also prolonged (median (IQR) 278 (51-512) days pre- vs 580 (306-1355) days post-introduction of the Day Admission model; hazard ratio 0.41, p = 0.04). Daytime PaCO2 was no different. In conclusion, reduced waiting time to commence ventilation and improved survival were observed following introduction of an ambulatory model of NIV implementation in people with MND, with no change in the effectiveness of ventilation.","['Sheers N', 'Berlowitz DJ', 'Rautela L', 'Batchelder I', 'Hopkinson K', 'Howard ME']",2014,15,3-4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Sheers N, et al.

24475283,The extracellular domain of neurotrophin receptor p75 as a candidate biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,Objective biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would facilitate the discovery of new treatments. The common neurotrophin receptor p75 is up regulated and the extracellular domain cleaved from injured neurons and peripheral glia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We have tested the hypothesis that urinary levels of extracellular neurotrophin receptor p75 serve as a biomarker for both human motor amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of the disease. The extracellular domain of neurotrophin receptor p75 was identified in the urine of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients by an immuno-precipitation/western blot procedure and confirmed by mass spectrometry. An ELISA was established to measure urinary extracellular neurotrophin receptor p75. The mean value for urinary extracellular neurotrophin receptor p75 from 28 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients measured by ELISA was 7.9±0.5 ng/mg creatinine and this was significantly higher (p<0.001) than 12 controls (2.6±0.2 ng/mg creatinine) and 19 patients with other neurological disease (Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis; 4.1±0.2 ng/mg creatinine). Pilot data of disease progression rates in 14 MND patients indicates that p75NTR(ECD) levels were significantly higher (p = 0.0041) in 7 rapidly progressing patients as compared to 7 with slowly progressing disease. Extracellular neurotrophin receptor p75 was also readily detected in SOD1(G93A) mice by immuno-precipitation/western blot before the onset of clinical symptoms. These findings indicate a significant relation between urinary extracellular neurotrophin receptor p75 levels and disease progression and suggests that it may be a useful marker of disease activity and progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"['Shepheard SR', 'Chataway T', 'Schultz DW', 'Rush RA', 'Rogers ML']",2014,9,1,PLoS One,"Shepheard SR, et al.

24463480,Use of clinical staging in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for phase 3 clinical trials.,"OBJECTIVES: The use of clinical staging in the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would have value in optimising future therapeutic trials. We aimed to use previous clinical trial data to determine the length of time patients spend in each of four proposed stages, its range and transition patterns to subsequent stages.
METHODS: Using databases from two multicentre clinical trials, patients were retrospectively staged through the trial course. At each stage we assessed whether patients then progressed to an earlier, consecutive or later stage or death. Duration spent in each stage before progression to a later stage was calculated.
RESULTS: There were 725 patients. No patients moved to an earlier stage. More patients at stages 1, 2 and 3 progressed to the consecutive stage rather than skipping a stage. 59.3% of patients at Stage 1 progressed to Stage 2, 54.0% of patients at Stage 2 progressed to Stage 3, 42.3% of patients at Stage 3 progressed to Stage 4 and 47.0% of Stage 4 patients progressed to death. Transition times between stages had a median duration of 3 to 7 months for stages 2 to 4.
DISCUSSION: We have shown using trial data that transition times between stages are short. Use of stage duration as an endpoint might allow a shorter trial duration. We have shown face validity in this system as most patients progress through consecutive stages, and none revert to earlier stages. Furthermore, we have shown the system is reliable across populations and therefore has content validity.","['Balendra R', 'Jones A', 'Jivraj N', 'Steen IN', 'Young CA', 'Shaw PJ', 'Turner MR', 'Leigh PN', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'UK-MND LiCALS Study Group, Mito Target ALS Study Group']",2015,86,1,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Balendra R, et al.

24444358,Two cases of multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumour.,"An unusual multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumour (MVNT) has been described in the cerebral hemispheres of ten patients with adult-onset seizures. We report the findings in two cases with similar features, a surgical resection and the other an autopsy specimen.Case 1, a 34-year-old female, underwent surgical resection for a multinodular non-enhancing frontal white matter lesion causing intractable epilepsy. Case 2, presented with motor neurone disease (MND) at the age of 71 and MRI scanning revealed extensive multinodular non-enhancing white matter lesions in the temporal lobe. There was no history of epilepsy and post mortem histology confirmed MND.Macroscopically multiple small grey well-formed, discrete and coalescent nodules were seen in the deep cortex and subcortical white matter. On histology, mature-looking neurons with large cytoplasmic vacuoles were distributed in a fibrillary background, where vacuoles were also noted. In the resected tumour scattered oligodendroglia-like cells were present. No ganglion cells were seen. The vacuolated cells exhibited immunopositivity for synaptophysin, HuC/HuD and p62 but were negative for NeuN, neurofilament, GFAP, IDH1, nestin and CD34. Electron microscopy showed non-membrane bound cytoplasmic vacuoles in the neurons and in some neuronal processes. The seizures recurred in Case 1.Some clinicopathological features of this lesion suggest a possible relationship with dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNT) although the morphological features are not typical of DNT. Case 2 demonstrates that MVNT may remain asymptomatic.","['Bodi I', 'Curran O', 'Selway R', 'Elwes R', 'Burrone J', 'Laxton R', 'Al-Sarraj S', 'Honavar M']",2014,2,,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Bodi I, et al.

24399773,Advances in motor neurone disease.,"Motor neurone disease (MND), the commonest clinical presentation of which is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is regarded as the most devastating of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. The last decade has seen major improvements in patient care, but also rapid scientific advances, so that rational therapies based on key pathogenic mechanisms now seem plausible. ALS is strikingly heterogeneous in both its presentation, with an average one-year delay from first symptoms to diagnosis, and subsequent rate of clinical progression. Although half of patients succumb within 3-4 years of symptom onset, typically through respiratory failure, a significant minority survives into a second decade. Although an apparently sporadic disorder for most patients, without clear environmental triggers, recent genetic studies have identified disease-causing mutations in genes in several seemingly disparate functional pathways, so that motor neuron degeneration may need to be understood as a common final pathway with a number of upstream causes. This apparent aetiological and clinical heterogeneity suggests that therapeutic studies should include detailed biomarker profiling, and consider genetic as well as clinical stratification. The most common mutation, accounting for 10% of all Western hemisphere ALS, is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72. This and several other genes implicate altered RNA processing and protein degradation pathways in the core of ALS pathogenesis. A major gap remains in understanding how such fundamental processes appear to function without obvious deficit in the decades prior to symptom emergence, and the study of pre-symptomatic gene carriers is an important new initiative.","['Bäumer D', 'Talbot K', 'Turner MR']",2014,107,1,J R Soc Med,"Bäumer D, et al.

24385136,TMEM106B protects C9ORF72 expansion carriers against frontotemporal dementia.,"Variants in transmembrane protein 106 B (TMEM106B) modify the disease penetrance of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in carriers of progranulin (GRN) mutations. We investigated whether TMEM106B is also a genetic modifier of disease in carriers of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) expansions. We assessed the genotype of 325 C9ORF72 expansion carriers (cohort 1), 586 FTD patients lacking C9ORF72 expansions [with or without motor neuron disease (MND); cohort 2], and a total of 1,302 controls for TMEM106B variants (rs3173615 and rs1990622) using MassArray iPLEX and Taqman genotyping assays. For our primary analysis, we focused on functional variant rs3173615, and employed a recessive genotypic model. In cohort 1, patients with C9ORF72 expansions showed a significantly reduced frequency of carriers homozygous for the minor allele as compared to controls [11.9 vs. 19.1 %, odds ratio (OR) 0.57, p = 0.014; same direction as carriers of GRN mutations]. The strongest evidence was provided by FTD patients (OR 0.33, p = 0.009) followed by FTD/MND patients (OR 0.38, p = 0.017), whereas no significant difference was observed in MND patients (OR 0.85, p = 0.55). In cohort 2, the frequency of carriers homozygous for the minor allele was not significantly reduced in patients as compared to controls (OR 0.77, p = 0.079); however, a significant reduction was observed when focusing on those patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP; OR 0.26, p < 0.001). Our study identifies TMEM106B as the first genetic factor modifying disease presentation in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Homozygosity for the minor allele protects carriers from developing FTD, but not from developing MND; similar effects are seen in FTLD-TDP patients with yet unknown genetic causes. These new findings show that the protective effects of TMEM106B are not confined to carriers of GRN mutations and might be relevant for prognostic testing, and as a promising therapeutic target for the entire spectrum of FTLD-TDP.","['van Blitterswijk M', 'Mullen B', 'Nicholson AM', 'Bieniek KF', 'Heckman MG', 'Baker MC', 'DeJesus-Hernandez M', 'Finch NA', 'Brown PH', 'Murray ME', 'Hsiung GY', 'Stewart H', 'Karydas AM', 'Finger E', 'Kertesz A', 'Bigio EH', 'Weintraub S', 'Mesulam M', 'Hatanpaa KJ', 'White CL', 'Strong MJ', 'Beach TG', 'Wszolek ZK', 'Lippa C', 'Caselli R', 'Petrucelli L', 'Josephs KA', 'Parisi JE', 'Knopman DS', 'Petersen RC', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Seeley WW', 'Grinberg LT', 'Miller BL', 'Boylan KB', 'Graff-Radford NR', 'Boeve BF', 'Dickson DW', 'Rademakers R']",2014,127,3,Acta Neuropathol,"van Blitterswijk M, et al.

Herein, we describe a case of hypercalcaemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism confused as MND and subsequently cured with parathyroid surgery.
LEARNING POINTS: Any patient with neurological disorder should have a screening of all the common electrolytes including calcium as electrolyte imbalance can present with paralysis (e.g. hypokalaemia) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (e.g. hypercalcaemia).No patient should be stamped as having MND without having a proper work-up of all its differentials as there might be a treatable condition masquerading as MND.","['Ghosh M', 'Bhattacharya A', 'Ghosh K', 'Chatterjee A', 'Chakraborty S', 'Jatua SK']",2014,2014,,Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,"Ghosh M, et al.

26237595,iPSC-Based Models to Unravel Key Pathogenetic Processes Underlying Motor Neuron Disease Development.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are neuromuscular disorders affecting rather exclusively upper motor neurons (UMNs) and/or lower motor neurons (LMNs). The clinical phenotype is characterized by muscular weakness and atrophy leading to paralysis and almost invariably death due to respiratory failure. Adult MNDs include sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS-fALS), while the most common infantile MND is represented by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). No effective treatment is ccurrently available for MNDs, as for the vast majority of neurodegenerative disorders, and cures are limited to supportive care and symptom relief. The lack of a deep understanding of MND pathogenesis accounts for the difficulties in finding a cure, together with the scarcity of reliable in vitro models. Recent progresses in stem cell field, in particular in the generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) has made possible for the first time obtaining substantial amounts of human cells to recapitulate in vitro some of the key pathogenetic processes underlying MNDs. In the present review, recently published studies involving the use of iPSCs to unravel aspects of ALS and SMA pathogenesis are discussed with an overview of their implications in the process of finding a cure for these still orphan disorders.","['Faravelli I', 'Frattini E', 'Ramirez A', 'Stuppia G', 'Nizzardo M', 'Corti S']",2014,3,4,J Clin Med,"Faravelli I, et al. iPSC-Based Models to Unravel Key Pathogenetic Processes Underlying Motor Neuron Disease Development. iPSC-Based Models to Unravel Key Pathogenetic Processes Underlying Motor Neuron Disease Development. 2014; 3:1124-45. doi: 10.3390/jcm3041124",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26237595/
24366527,The neuropathology of sport.,"The benefits of regular exercise, physical fitness and sports participation on cardiovascular and brain health are undeniable. Physical activity reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and stroke, and produces beneficial effects on cholesterol levels, antioxidant systems, inflammation, and vascular function. Exercise also enhances psychological health, reduces age-related loss of brain volume, improves cognition, reduces the risk of developing dementia, and impedes neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, the play of sports is associated with risks, including a risk for mild TBI (mTBI) and, rarely, catastrophic traumatic injury and death. There is also growing awareness that repetitive mTBIs, such as concussion and subconcussion, can occasionally produce persistent cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric problems as well as lead to the development of a neurodegeneration, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In this review, we summarize the beneficial aspects of sports participation on psychological, emotional, physical and cognitive health, and specifically analyze some of the less common adverse neuropathological outcomes, including concussion, second-impact syndrome, juvenile head trauma syndrome, catastrophic sudden death, and CTE. CTE is a latent neurodegeneration clinically associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction and cognitive impairments, and pathologically characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atrophy, neuronal and axonal loss, and abnormal deposits of paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and 43 kDa TAR deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-binding protein (TDP-43). CTE often occurs as a sole diagnosis, but may be associated with other neurodegenerative disorders, including motor neuron disease (CTE-MND). Although the incidence and prevalence of CTE are not known, CTE has been reported most frequently in American football players and boxers. Other sports associated with CTE include ice hockey, professional wrestling, soccer, rugby, and baseball.","['McKee AC', 'Daneshvar DH', 'Alvarez VE', 'Stein TD']",2014,127,1,Acta Neuropathol,"McKee AC, et al.

24330485,Heavy metals in locus ceruleus and motor neurons in motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: The causes of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS) and other types of motor neuron disease (MND) remain largely unknown. Heavy metals have long been implicated in MND, and it has recently been shown that inorganic mercury selectively enters human locus ceruleus (LC) and motor neurons. We therefore used silver nitrate autometallography (AMG) to look for AMG-stainable heavy metals (inorganic mercury and bismuth) in LC and motor neurons of 24 patients with MND (18 with SALS and 6 with familial MND) and in the LC of 24 controls.
RESULTS: Heavy metals in neurons were found in significantly more MND patients than in controls when comparing: (1) the presence of any versus no heavy metal-containing LC neurons (MND 88%, controls 42%), (2) the median percentage of heavy metal-containing LC neurons (MND 9.5%, control 0.0%), and (3) numbers of individuals with heavy metal-containing LC neurons in the upper half of the percentage range (MND 75%, controls 25%). In MND patients, 67% of remaining spinal motor neurons contained heavy metals; smaller percentages were found in hypoglossal, nucleus ambiguus and oculomotor neurons, but none in cortical motor neurons. The majority of MND patients had heavy metals in both LC and spinal motor neurons. No glia or other neurons, including neuromelanin-containing neurons of the substantia nigra, contained stainable heavy metals.
CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of heavy metals by LC and lower motor neurons appears to be fairly common in humans, though heavy metal staining in the LC, most likely due to inorganic mercury, was seen significantly more often in MND patients than in controls. The LC innervates many cell types that are affected in MND, and it is possible that MND is triggered by toxicant-induced interactions between LC and motor neurons.","['Pamphlett R', 'Kum Jew S']",2013,1,,Acta Neuropathol Commun,Pamphlett R and Kum Jew S.

24315469,Systematic review of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for chronic respiratory failure.,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review examined the effect of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and survival for individuals with or at risk of chronic respiratory failure (CRF).
METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non-randomised studies in those treated with NIPPV for CRF were identified from electronic databases, reference lists and grey literature. Diagnostic groups included in the review were amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), restrictive thoracic disease (RTD) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS).
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included and overall study quality was weak. Those with ALS/MND had improved somnolence and fatigue as well as prolonged survival with NIPPV. For OHS, improvements in somnolence and fatigue, dyspnoea and sleep quality were demonstrated, while for RTD, measures of dyspnoea, sleep quality, physical function and health, mental and emotional health and social function improved. There was insufficient evidence to form conclusions regarding the effect of NIPPV for those with DMD.
CONCLUSIONS: This review has demonstrated that NIPPV influences PROs differently depending on the underlying cause of CRF. These findings may provide assistance to patients and clinicians to determine the relative costs and benefits of NIPPV therapy and also highlight areas in need of further research.","['Hannan LM', 'Dominelli GS', 'Chen YW', 'Darlene Reid W', 'Road J']",2014,108,2,Respir Med,"Hannan LM, et al.

24296360,Association of a paraneoplastic motor neuron disease with anti-Ri antibodies and a novel SOD1 I18del mutation.,"INTRODUCTION: Whether motor neuron diseases (MNDs) can be considered in some cases of paraneoplastic syndromes is controversial. We report a case of rapidly progressive motor neuronopathy following a diagnosis of breast carcinoma, with a presence of anti-Ri antibodies, and a novel SOD1 gene mutation.
OBSERVATION: An 80-year-old woman with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the left breast for 4 years developed sub-acute quadriparesis. Myography revealed chronic denervation signs. The patient had serum anti-Ri onconeural antibodies. The diagnosis of paraneoplastic MND was established. Because of a familial history of ALS, a genetic analysis for familial ALS was performed. We identified a novel heterozygous mutation in SOD1 gene, SOD I18del. This mutation may reflect a genetic predisposition to develop a MND, inducing fragility of motor neurons. Neurological improvement was observed after three months of both intravenous gamma globulin and corticosteroids.
CONCLUSION: The present observation supports the idea that MND can be considered as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A combination of anti-Ri onconeural antibodies and a particular SOD1 gene mutation, consisting in risk factor, might be in cause in the process of motor neuron death. When in doubt, paraneoplastic cause should be suspected in the differential diagnosis of MND. Immunotherapy treatment may lead to a favorable outcome.","['Diard-Detoeuf C', 'Dangoumau A', 'Limousin N', 'Biberon J', ""Vourc'h P"", 'Andres CR', 'de Toffol B', 'Praline J']",2014,337,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Diard-Detoeuf C, et al.

24291927,[History of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with proximal dominant involvement (HMSN-P)].,"We established a new disease autosomal dominant hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with proximal dominant involvement (HMSNP) in 1997, in Okinawa, Japan. This disease is characterized by proximal dominant neurogenic atrophy with fasciculations, painful muscle cramp, obvious sensory nerve involvement, areflexia, high incidence of elevated creatine kinase levels, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. (MIM %604484). HMSNP is so called or HMSNO (HMSN OKINAWA type),. These clinical features resembled those of Kennedy-Alter-Sung syndrome. Most HMSNP patients have severe muscle atrophy and finally the tracheostomy and artificial ventilation are required. Therefore, we initially thought to classify HMSNP into a subtype of motor neuron disease (MND) like familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) or spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, the general consensus for MND was no sensory involvement. Therefore, as the disease showed severe sensory involvement, we categorized HMSNP in subtype of HMSN at that time. We also reported the pathology of HMSNP, showing severely decreased anterior horn cells, decreased posterior horn cells, and loss of posterior funiculus in the spinal cord.",['Takashima H'],2013,23,11,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,Takashima H.

24286448,Touching moments: phenomenological sociology and the haptic dimension in the lived experience of motor neurone disease.,"Currently, there is a relative research lacuna in phenomenological research into the lived experience of motor neurone disease. Based on a sociological research project in the UK, involving 42 participants diagnosed with MND, this article explores the potential of a phenomenological sociology for analysing experiences of this drastically life-limiting neurological disorder. Calls have been made for sociological researchers to analyse more fully and deeply the sensory dimension of the lived body, and this article also contributes to this newly developing body of literature. While the social sciences have been accused of a high degree of ocularcentrism, here we take forward the literature by specifically focusing upon the haptic dimension, given that touch - and particularly the loss of key elements of the haptic dimension- emerged as salient in MND patients' accounts. To illustrate the potential of our phenomenologically inspired theoretical perspective, we consider two specific haptic themes: (i) being out of touch: the loss of certain forms of touch within MND and (ii) unwelcome touch by medical staff.","['Allen-Collinson J', 'Pavey A']",2014,36,6,Sociol Health Illn,Allen-Collinson J and Pavey A.

24256260,The intriguing case of motor neuron disease: ALS and SMA come closer.,"MNDs (motor neuron diseases) form a heterogeneous group of pathologies characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons. More and more genetic factors associated with MND encode proteins that have a function in RNA metabolism, suggesting that disturbed RNA metabolism could be a common underlying problem in several, perhaps all, forms of MND. In the present paper we review recent developments showing a functional link between SMN (survival of motor neuron), the causative factor of SMA (spinal muscular atrophy), and FUS (fused in sarcoma), a genetic factor in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). SMN is long known to have a crucial role in the biogenesis and localization of the spliceosomal snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins), which are essential assembly modules of the splicing machinery. Now we know that FUS interacts with SMN and pathogenic FUS mutations have a significant effect on snRNP localization. Together with other recently published evidence, this finding potentially links ALS pathogenesis to disturbances in the splicing machinery, and implies that pre-mRNA splicing may be the common weak point in MND, although other steps in mRNA metabolism could also play a role. Certainly, further comparison of the RNA metabolism in different MND will greatly help our understanding of the molecular causes of these devastating diseases.","['Achsel T', 'Barabino S', 'Cozzolino M', 'Carrì MT']",2013,41,6,Biochem Soc Trans,"Achsel T, et al.

24252649,Simulated surgical-type cerebral biopsies from post-mortem brains allows accurate neuropathological diagnoses in the majority of neurodegenerative disease groups.,"BACKGROUND: In theory, cerebral biopsies could provide the diagnosis in a significant proportion of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, however, there are considerable ethical barriers. Previous series of cerebral biopsies have shown variable diagnostic accuracy but have understandably suffered because of lack of post-mortem tissue with which to compare the diagnosis. To determine the accuracy of such biopsies in neurodegenerative disease we took small biopsy-sized samples of predominantly fresh post-mortem brain tissue from frontal and temporal lobes in 62 cases. These were processed as for a biopsy and stained for H&E, p62, tau, Aβ, α-synuclein, and TDP-43. The sections were assessed blind by 3 neuropathologists and the results compared with the final post-mortem diagnosis.
RESULTS: The agreement and sensitivity in most cases was good especially: controls; Alzheimer's disease (AD); multiple system atrophy (MSA); frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 positive inclusions and/or motor neurone disease (FTLD-TDP/MND); Huntington's disease (HD); corticobasal degeneration (CBD) / microtubular associated protein tau mutation cases with CBD-like features (CBD/MAPT); and combined AD- Dementia with Lewy Bodies (AD-DLB) where the sensitivity on assessing both brain regions varied between 75-100%. There was poor sensitivity for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (both 0%), but moderate sensitivity for pure DLB (60%). The temporal lobe assessment was marginally more accurate than the frontal lobe but these were only slightly worse than both combined.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that with certain caveats the cerebral biopsy in life should be a viable method of accurately diagnosing many neurodegenerative diseases.","['King A', 'Maekawa S', 'Bodi I', 'Troakes C', 'Curran O', 'Ashkan K', 'Al-Sarraj S']",2013,1,,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"King A, et al.

24252525,Dipeptide repeat proteins are present in the p62 positive inclusions in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor neurone disease associated with expansions in C9ORF72.,"BACKGROUND: Cases of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) and Motor Neurone Disease (MND) associated with expansions in C9ORF72 gene are characterised pathologically by the presence of TDP-43 negative, but p62 positive, inclusions in granule cells of the cerebellum and in cells of dentate gyrus and area CA4 of the hippocampus.
RESULTS: We screened 84 cases of pathologically confirmed FTLD and 23 cases of MND for the presence of p62 positive inclusions in these three brain regions, and identified 13 positive cases of FTLD and 3 of MND. All cases demonstrated expansions in C9ORF72 by Southern blotting where frozen tissues were available. The p62 positive inclusions in both cerebellum and hippocampus were immunostained by antibodies to dipeptide repeat proteins (DPR), poly Gly-Ala (poly-GA), poly Gly-Pro (poly-GP) and poly Gly-Arg (poly-GR), these arising from a putative non-ATG initiated (RAN) sense translation of the GGGGCC expansion. There was also some slight, but variable, immunostaining with poly-AP antibody implying some antisense translation might also occur, though the relative paucity of immunostaining could reflect poor antigen avidity on the part of the antisense antibodies. Of the FTLD cases with DPR, 6 showed TDP-43 type A and 6 had TDP-43 type B histology; one had FTLD-tau with the pathology of corticobasal degeneration. There were no qualitative or quantitative differences in the pattern of immunostaining with antibodies to DPR, or p62, proteins between TDP-43 type A and type B cases. Ratings for frequency of inclusions immunostained by these poly-GA, poly-GP and poly-GR antibodies broadly correlated with those for immunolabelled by p62 antibody in all three regions.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that DPR are a major component of p62 positive inclusions in FTLD and MND.","['Mann DM', 'Rollinson S', 'Robinson A', 'Bennion Callister J', 'Thompson JC', 'Snowden JS', 'Gendron T', 'Petrucelli L', 'Masuda-Suzukake M', 'Hasegawa M', 'Davidson Y', 'Pickering-Brown S']",2013,1,,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Mann DM, et al.

24236958,The impact on the family carer of motor neurone disease and intervention with noninvasive ventilation.,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of motor neurone disease (MND) has a profound effect on the functioning and well-being of both the patient and their family, with studies describing an increase in carer burden and depression as the disease progresses.
AIM: This study aimed to assess whether patient use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) impacted on their family carer, and to explore other sources of carer burden.
DESIGN: The study used qualitative interviews and scaled measures of carer health and well-being completed at three monthly intervals until patient end of life.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen family carers were followed up over a period ranging from one month to two years.
RESULTS: NIV was perceived as having little impact on carer burden. The data however highlighted a range of sources of other burdens relating to the physical strain of caring. The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36 Health Survey) Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores were considerably below that of the Mental Component Summary (MCS) score at baseline and at all following time points. Carers described the physical effort associated with patient care and role change; the challenge inherent in having time away; and problems relating to the timing of equipment and service delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: NIV can be recommended to patients without concerns regarding increasing carer burden. The predominant source of burden described related to the physical impact of caring for a patient with MND. Services face challenges if this physical burden is to be reduced by providing equipment at an optimal time and successfully coordinating their input.","['Baxter SK', 'Baird WO', 'Thompson S', 'Bianchi SM', 'Walters SJ', 'Lee E', 'Ahmedzai SH', 'Proctor A', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ']",2013,16,12,J Palliat Med,"Baxter SK, et al.

24211396,"Traditional usage, phytochemistry and pharmacology of the South African medicinal plant Boophone disticha (L.f.) Herb. (Amaryllidaceae).","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Boophone disticha is the most common member of the South African Amaryllidaceae used extensively in traditional medicine of the various indigenous population groups, including the Sotho, Xhosa and Zulu as well as the San. This survey was carried out to identify and highlight areas relevant to the traditional usage of Boophone disticha. Pharmacological aspects were examined with the purpose of reconciling these with the traditional usage of the plant. In relation to phytochemical make-up, particular attention was paid on how its alkaloid constitution might corroborate the various biological effects manifested by the plant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information gathering involved the use of four different database platforms, including Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SciFinder(®) and Scopus. Arrangement and detailing of this information is as reflected in the various sections of the paper.
RESULTS: Sixteen categories were identified under which Boophone disticha finds use in traditional medicine. These were shown to include general usage purposes, such as 'cultural and dietary', 'well-being', 'personal injury', 'divinatory purposes', 'psychoactive properties' and 'veterinary uses'. Furthermore, traditional usage was seen to involve six body systems, including functions pertaining to the circulatory, gastrointestinal, muscular, neurological, respiratory and urinary systems. The four remaining categories relate to use for inflammatory conditions, cancer, malaria and tuberculosis. Overall, three areas were discernible in which Boophone disticha finds most usage, which are (i) ailments pertaining to the CNS, (ii) wounds and infections, and (iii) inflammatory conditions. In addition, several aspects pertaining to the toxic properties of the plant are discussed, including genotoxicity, mutagenicity and neurotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: The widespread ethnic usage of Boophone disticha has justified its standing as a flagship for the Amaryllidaceae and its relevance to South African traditional medicine. Furthermore, its promising pharmacological and phytochemical profiles have stimulated significant interest in the clinical realm, especially in the areas of cancer and motor neuron disease chemotherapy. These collective properties should prove useful in steering the progress of the plant towards a wider audience.","['Nair JJ', 'Van Staden J']",2014,151,1,J Ethnopharmacol,"Nair JJ and Van Staden J.

24171950,Moving forward in clinical trials for ALS: motor neurons lead the way please.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most complex motor neuron diseases. Even though scientific discoveries are accelerating with an unprecedented pace, to date more than 30 clinical trials have ended with failure and staggering frustration. There are too many compounds that increase life span in mice, but too little evidence that they will improve human condition. Increasing the chances of success for future clinical trials requires advancement of preclinical tests. Recent developments, which enable the visualization of diseased motor neurons, have the potential to bring novel insight. As we change our focus from mice to motor neurons, it is possible to foster a new vision that translates into effective and long-term treatment strategies in ALS and related motor neuron disorders (MND).","['Genç B', 'Özdinler PH']",2014,19,4,Drug Discov Today,Genç B and Özdinler PH.

24141020,"Neuroprotective effects of the Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist PRE-084, in a mouse model of motor neuron disease not linked to SOD1 mutation.","The identification of novel molecular targets crucially involved in motor neuron degeneration/survival is a necessary step for the development of hopefully more effective therapeutic strategies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. In this view, S1R, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident receptor with chaperone-like activity, has recently attracted great interest. S1R is involved in several processes leading to acute and chronic neurodegeneration, including ALS pathology. Treatment with the S1R agonist PRE-084 improves locomotor function and motor neuron survival in presymptomatic and early symptomatic mutant SOD1-G93A ALS mice. Here, we tested the efficacy of PRE-084 in a model of spontaneous motor neuron degeneration, the wobbler mouse (wr) as a proof of concept that S1R may be regarded as a key therapeutic target also for ALS cases not linked to SOD1 mutation. Increased staining for S1R was detectable in morphologically spared cervical spinal cord motor neurons of wr mice both at early (6th week) and late (12th week) phases of clinical progression. S1R signal was also detectable in hypertrophic astrocytes and reactive microglia of wr mice. Chronic treatment with PRE-084 (three times a week, for 8weeks), starting at symptom onset, significantly increased the levels of BDNF in the gray matter, improved motor neuron survival and ameliorated paw abnormality and grip strength performance. In addition, the treatment significantly reduced the number of reactive astrocytes whereas, that of CD11b+ microglial cells was increased. A deeper evaluation of microglial markers revealed significant increased number of cells positive for the pan-macrophage marker CD68 and of CD206+ cells, involved in tissue restoration, in the white matter of PRE-084-treated mice. The mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were not affected by PRE-084 treatment. Thus, our results support pharmacological manipulation of S1R as a promising strategy to cure ALS and point to increased availability of growth factors and modulation of astrocytosis and of macrophage/microglia as part of the mechanisms involved in S1R-mediated neuroprotection.","['Peviani M', 'Salvaneschi E', 'Bontempi L', 'Petese A', 'Manzo A', 'Rossi D', 'Salmona M', 'Collina S', 'Bigini P', 'Curti D']",2014,62,,Neurobiol Dis,"Peviani M, et al.

24139842,Madras motor neuron disease (MMND) is distinct from the riboflavin transporter genetic defects that cause Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Madras motor neuron disease (MMND), MMND variant (MMNDV) and Familial MMND (FMMND) have a unique geographic distribution predominantly reported from Southern India. The characteristic features are onset in young, weakness and wasting of limbs, multiple lower cranial nerve palsies and sensorineural hearing loss. There is a considerable overlap in the phenotype of MMND with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVL) Boltshauser syndrome, Nathalie syndrome and Fazio-Londe syndrome. Recently a number of BVVL cases and families have been described with mutations in two riboflavin transporter genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 (solute carrier family 52, riboflavin transporter, member 2 and 3 respectively).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe six families and four sporadic MMND cases that have been clinically characterized in detail with history, examination, imaging and electrophysiological investigations. We sequenced the SLC52A1, SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 in affected probands and sporadic individuals from the MMND series as well as the C9ORF72 expansion. No genetic defects were identified and the C9ORF72 repeats were all less than 10.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that MMND is a distinct clinical subgroup of childhood onset MND patients where the known genetic defects are so far negative. The clinico-genetic features of MMND in comparison with the BVVL group of childhood motor neuron diseases suggest that these diseases are likely to share a common defective biological pathway that may be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.","['Nalini A', 'Pandraud A', 'Mok K', 'Houlden H']",2013,334,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Nalini A, et al.

24092880,A new zebrafish model produced by TILLING of SOD1-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis replicates key features of the disease and represents a tool for in vivo therapeutic screening.,"Mutations in the superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) are one cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS; also known as motor neuron disease (MND)] in humans. ALS is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disease and, to date, there are no neuroprotective therapies with significant impact on the disease course. Current transgenic murine models of the disease, which overexpress mutant SOD1, have so far been ineffective in the identification of new therapies beneficial in the human disease. Because the human and the zebrafish (Danio rerio) SOD1 protein share 76% identity, TILLING ('targeting induced local lesions in genomes') was carried out in collaboration with the Sanger Institute in order to identify mutations in the zebrafish sod1 gene. A T70I mutant zebrafish line was characterised using oxidative stress assays, neuromuscular junction (NMJ) analysis and motor function studies. The T70I sod1 zebrafish model offers the advantage over current murine models of expressing the mutant Sod1 protein at a physiological level, as occurs in humans with ALS. The T70I sod1 zebrafish demonstrates key features of ALS: an early NMJ phenotype, susceptibility to oxidative stress and an adult-onset motor neuron disease phenotype. We have demonstrated that the susceptibility of T70I sod1 embryos to oxidative stress can be used in a drug screening assay, to identify compounds that merit further investigation as potential therapies for ALS.","['Da Costa MM', 'Allen CE', 'Higginbottom A', 'Ramesh T', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ']",2014,7,1,Dis Model Mech,"Da Costa MM, et al.

24067242,Racial differences in motor neuron disease.,"Our objective was to compare and contrast clinical features of black and white patients seen in the UAMS ALS/Motor Neuron Disease (MND) clinic from January 2001 to December 2010. Death certificate information was reviewed to determine race of Arkansans who died of ALS/MND between 1999 and 2006. We used a retrospective chart review of patients with ALS/MND seen at least once in our clinic and reviewed state death certificate data. Results showed that from 1999 to 2006, 466 Arkansas deaths were attributed (immediate or contributory) to ALS/MND; 17 (3.6%) were black, four (0.9%) other, and 445 (95.5%) white. During this period, the proportion of black Arkansans was 17%. From 2001 to 2010, we saw 330 patients with ALS/MND: 30 (9.1%) black, six (1.8%) other, 294 (89.1%) white. Average onset age for whites was 58.1 + 12.4 years, for blacks 52.8 + 13.0 (p = 0.038). Gender, onset site, time from symptom onset to first clinic visit and initial vital capacity were similar between the groups. Initial ALSFRS-R was 37.5 + 7.2 for whites and 30.8 + 8.5 (p = 0.004) for blacks. A first or second degree relative with ALS/MND was reported by 8.1% of whites and by none of the black patients (p = 0.15). Riluzole, PEG and non-invasive ventilation use was similar between the groups. Median tracheostomy-free survival was 36 months for white and 40 months for black patients (p = 0.475). In conclusion, although blacks appear relatively spared from ALS/MND, they present at an earlier age and are functionally worse at their first visit. Investigating the genetic make-up of blacks with the disease may help identify genes that modify risk of developing ALS/MND.","['Gundogdu B', 'Al-Lahham T', 'Kadlubar F', 'Spencer H', 'Rudnicki SA']",2014,15,1-2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Gundogdu B, et al.

24011653,Association between repeat sizes and clinical and pathological characteristics in carriers of C9ORF72 repeat expansions (Xpansize-72): a cross-sectional cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) are the most common known genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron disease (MND). We assessed whether expansion size is associated with disease severity or phenotype.
METHODS: We did a cross-sectional Southern blot characterisation study (Xpansize-72) in a cohort of individuals with FTD, MND, both these diseases, or no clinical phenotype. All participants had GGGGCC repeat expansions in C9ORF72, and high quality DNA was available from one or more of the frontal cortex, cerebellum, or blood. We used Southern blotting techniques and densitometry to estimate the repeat size of the most abundant expansion species. We compared repeat sizes between different tissues using Wilcoxon rank sum and Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and between disease subgroups using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. We assessed the association of repeat size with age at onset and age at collection using a Spearman's test of correlation, and assessed the association between repeat size and survival after disease onset using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
FINDINGS: We included 84 individuals with C9ORF72 expansions: 35 had FTD, 16 had FTD and MND, 30 had MND, and three had no clinical phenotype. We focused our analysis on three major tissue subgroups: frontal cortex (available from 41 patients [21 with FTD, 11 with FTD and MND, and nine with MND]), cerebellum (40 patients [20 with FTD, 12 with FTD and MND, and eight with MND]), and blood (47 patients [15 with FTD, nine with FTD and MND, and 23 with MND] and three carriers who had no clinical phenotype). Repeat lengths in the cerebellum were smaller (median 12·3 kb [about 1667 repeat units], IQR 11·1-14·3) than those in the frontal cortex (33·8 kb [about 5250 repeat units], 23·5-44·9; p<0·0001) and those in blood (18·6 kb [about 2717 repeat units], 13·9-28·1; p=0·0002). Within these tissues, we detected no difference in repeat length between disease subgroups (cerebellum p=0·96, frontal cortex p=0·27, blood p=0·10). In the frontal cortex of patients with FTD, repeat length correlated with age at onset (r=0·63; p=0·003) and age at sample collection (r=0·58; p=0·006); we did not detect such a correlation in samples from the cerebellum or blood. When assessing cerebellum samples from the overall cohort, survival after disease onset was 4·8 years (IQR 3·0-7·4) in the group with expansions greater than 1467 repeat units (the 25th percentile of repeat lengths) versus 7·4 years (6·3-10·9) in the group with smaller expansions (HR 3·27, 95% CI 1·34-7·95; p=0·009).
INTERPRETATION: We detected substantial variation in repeat sizes between samples from the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and blood, and longer repeat sizes in the cerebellum seem to be associated with a survival disadvantage. Our findings indicate that expansion size does affect disease severity, which--if replicated in other cohorts--could be relevant for genetic counselling.

24011605,Assessing social isolation in motor neurone disease: a Rasch analysis of the MND Social Withdrawal Scale.,"OBJECTIVE: Social withdrawal is described as the condition in which an individual experiences a desire to make social contact, but is unable to satisfy that desire. It is an important issue for patients with motor neurone disease who are likely to experience severe physical impairment. This study aims to reassess the psychometric and scaling properties of the MND Social Withdrawal Scale (MND-SWS) domains and examine the feasibility of a summary scale, by applying scale data to the Rasch model.
METHODS: The MND Social Withdrawal Scale was administered to 298 patients with a diagnosis of MND, alongside the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The factor structure of the MND Social Withdrawal Scale was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. Model fit, category threshold analysis, differential item functioning (DIF), dimensionality and local dependency were evaluated.
RESULTS: Factor analysis confirmed the suitability of the four-factor solution suggested by the original authors. Mokken scale analysis suggested the removal of item five. Rasch analysis removed a further three items; from the Community (one item) and Emotional (two items) withdrawal subscales. Following item reduction, each scale exhibited excellent fit to the Rasch model. A 14-item Summary scale was shown to fit the Rasch model after subtesting the items into three subtests corresponding to the Community, Family and Emotional subscales, indicating that items from these three subscales could be summed together to create a total measure for social withdrawal.
CONCLUSION: Removal of four items from the Social Withdrawal Scale led to a four factor solution with a 14-item hierarchical Summary scale that were all unidimensional, free for DIF and well fitted to the Rasch model. The scale is reliable and allows clinicians and researchers to measure social withdrawal in MND along a unidimensional construct.","['Gibbons CJ', 'Thornton EW', 'Ealing J', 'Shaw PJ', 'Talbot K', 'Tennant A', 'Young CA', 'UKMND-QoL Group']",2013,334,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Gibbons CJ, et al.

23884016,Use of intrathecal baclofen for treatment of severe spasticity in selected patients with motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy for severe spasticity in patients with upper-motor neuron predominant motor neuron disease (U-MND).
METHODS: A total of 44 patients with U-MND were referred for discussion of ITB therapy. Baseline and outcomes data were extracted on 35 patients from a clinical spasticity registry at a tertiary referral center. Patients choosing to initiate ITB (n = 20) were compared with those choosing conservative therapy (n = 15).
RESULTS: At baseline, lower average pain score in the non-ITB group was the only significant difference between the 2 groups. A significant reduction in pain scores, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Spasm Frequency Scale, and requirement for oral spasticity medications was observed within the ITB group at early and late follow-up. Within the non-ITB group, there was a significant increase in MAS scores between baseline and late follow-up. A statistically significant difference favoring the ITB group was observed for change in MAS score (P < .0001), Numerical Rating Scale pain score (P = .04), dose of oral baclofen (P = .002) and tizanidine (P = .003), and number of oral medications for spasticity (P = .002). There was no difference between the 2 groups in the progression of hip flexor weakness or in the proportion of patients who became nonambulatory.

23800348,Carer quality of life and experiences of health services: a cross-sectional survey across three neurological conditions.,"BACKGROUND: Neurological conditions have a substantial impact on carers, with carer well-being having been shown to be influenced by a number of demographic, patient and caregiving factors. Support given to carers can lead to better coping. This study investigated the relationship between carer well-being and experiences with health and social services.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of 1910 (37.4%) of carers of 5109 people with motor neuron disease (MND) (n=434, 54.9%), multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=721, 30.7%) and Parkinson's disease (PD) (n=755, 38.2%). Carers completed a generic health status measure (SF-12), a carer strain measure (Carer Strain Index- CSI) and a newly developed questionnaire on health and social care experiences. Data were analysed by analysis of variance with p set at <0.05.
RESULTS: Carer well-being was found to be compromised and differed significantly between the three conditions. Furthermore, a considerable number of carers experienced problems with aspects of health and social care, although there was no clear pattern according to the condition that was cared for. The total number of problems reported did not differ significantly between conditions but was significantly (all p<0.001) associated with carer quality of life (both physical and mental health) and strain, even when other influencing factors (demographic and caregiving variables) were corrected for. The association was particularly strong for carer strain, and less strong (but still significant) for quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that carer well-being is compromised, in line with previous studies. Furthermore, the link of carer well-being to the number of problems reported suggests that minimizing problems experienced could improve carer well-being. This stresses the importance of health and social services appropriately supporting carers.","['Peters M', 'Jenkinson C', 'Doll H', 'Playford ED', 'Fitzpatrick R']",2013,11,,Health Qual Life Outcomes,"Peters M, et al.

23798570,Endogenous progesterone levels and frontotemporal dementia: modulation of TDP-43 and Tau levels in vitro and treatment of the A315T TARDBP mouse model.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is associated with motor neurone disease (FTD-MND), corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS). Together, this group of disorders constitutes a major cause of young-onset dementia. One of the three clinical variants of FTD is progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), which is focused on in this study. The steroid hormone progesterone (PROG) is known to have an important role as a neurosteroid with potent neuroprotective and promyelination properties. In a case-control study of serum samples (39 FTD, 91 controls), low serum PROG was associated with FTD overall. In subgroup analysis, low PROG levels were significantly associated with FTD-MND and CBS, but not with PSPS or PNFA. PROG levels of >195 pg/ml were significantly correlated with lower disease severity (frontotemporal dementia rating scale) for individuals with CBS. In the human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cell line, exogenous PROG (9300-93,000 pg/ml) had a significant effect on overall Tau and nuclear TDP-43 levels, reducing total Tau levels by ∼1.5-fold and increasing nuclear TDP-43 by 1.7- to 2.0-fold. Finally, elevation of plasma PROG to a mean concentration of 5870 pg/ml in an Ala315Thr (A315T) TARDBP transgenic mouse model significantly reduced the rate of loss of locomotor control in PROG-treated, compared with placebo, mice. The PROG treatment did not significantly increase survival of the mice, which might be due to the limitation of the transgenic mouse to accurately model TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration. Together, our clinical, cellular and animal data provide strong evidence that PROG could be a valid therapy for specific related disorders of FTD.","['Dang TN', 'Dobson-Stone C', 'Glaros EN', 'Kim WS', 'Hallupp M', 'Bartley L', 'Piguet O', 'Hodges JR', 'Halliday GM', 'Double KL', 'Schofield PR', 'Crouch PJ', 'Kwok JB']",2013,6,5,Dis Model Mech,"Dang TN, et al.

23797033,Clinical perspective on oxidative stress in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most devastating neurological diseases; most patients die within 3 to 4 years after symptom onset. Oxidative stress is a disturbance in the pro-oxidative/antioxidative balance favoring the pro-oxidative state. Autopsy and laboratory studies in ALS indicate that oxidative stress plays a major role in motor neuron degeneration and astrocyte dysfunction. Oxidative stress biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine are elevated, suggesting that abnormal oxidative stress is generated outside of the central nervous system. Our review indicates that agricultural chemicals, heavy metals, military service, professional sports, excessive physical exertion, chronic head trauma, and certain foods might be modestly associated with ALS risk, with a stronger association between risk and smoking. At the cellular level, these factors are all involved in generating oxidative stress. Experimental studies indicate that a combination of insults that induce modest oxidative stress can exert additive deleterious effects on motor neurons, suggesting that multiple exposures in real-world environments are important. As the disease progresses, nutritional deficiency, cachexia, psychological stress, and impending respiratory failure may further increase oxidative stress. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that ALS is possibly a systemic disease. Laboratory, pathologic, and epidemiologic evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress is central in the pathogenic process, particularly in genetically susceptive individuals. If we are to improve ALS treatment, well-designed biochemical and genetic epidemiological studies, combined with a multidisciplinary research approach, are needed and will provide knowledge crucial to our understanding of ALS etiology, pathophysiology, and prognosis.","[""D'Amico E"", 'Factor-Litvak P', 'Santella RM', 'Mitsumoto H']",2013,65,,Free Radic Biol Med,"D'Amico E, et al.

23746533,The utilization of hospice care among patients with motor neuron diseases: the experience in Taiwan from 2005 to 2010.,"BACKGROUND: The nature and extent of how patients with motor neuron diseases (MNDs) utilize hospice care in Taiwan remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the use of hospice care in Taiwan by patients with MND, and those factors that affect the extent, the cost, and the quality of their hospice treatment and care.
METHODS: We analyzed data from hospice care inpatient claims of MNDs, using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan during 2005-2010.
RESULTS: Thirty patients and 58 related discharges were enrolled into our study, which consisted of 13 males and 17 females, with a mean age 58.3 years. Of that total, 27 of them (90%) had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and four (13.3%) had comorbid cancers; 17 died during hospice care. Acute low respiratory conditions (31.0%) accounted for the most common acute comorbidity. Noninvasive ventilation care was performed in only 13 (22.4%) of the discharges. In contrast to nasogastric intubation (40 discharges, 69.0%), no gastrostomy/jejunostomy was noted. These procedures bore no relationship to results observed in the discharges. Family physicians provided most inpatient hospice services (74.1%). Respiratory problems were the major causes of death (70.6% of decedents). The mean inpatient costs of hospice care were noticeably reduced from previously established nationwide mean costs.
CONCLUSION: Hospice care can save costs for patients with terminal MNDs, and family physicians play a valuable role in caring for these patients. However, respiratory and feeding problems are prevalent, yet there are proven benefits when noninvasive ventilation care and gastrostomy/jejunostomy are promoted.","['Kang SC', 'Hwang SJ', 'Wu PY', 'Tsai CP']",2013,76,7,J Chin Med Assoc,"Kang SC, et al.

Although primarily characterized by variably abundant pathological inclusions of TDP-43 protein, the lesion load was extended to TDP-43-negative, p62-positive neuronal and glial inclusions in extended regions of the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in cerebellum, where they may be characteristic of a C9orf72 repeat expansion. Disease mechanisms associated with repeat expansion disorders, including haploinsufficiency, RNA toxicity, and abnormal translation of expanded repeat sequences, are beginning to emerge. We review genetic, clinical, and pathological highlights and discuss current insights into the biology of this novel type of repeat expansion disease.","['Cruts M', 'Gijselinck I', 'Van Langenhove T', 'van der Zee J', 'Van Broeckhoven C']",2013,36,8,Trends Neurosci,"Cruts M, et al.

23740607,Drug therapy for pain in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of the motor system in adults. Pain in ALS is a frequent symptom especially in the later stages of disease and can have a pronounced influence on quality of life and suffering. Treatment of pain therefore should be recognised as an important aspect of palliative care in ALS. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence for the efficacy of drug therapy in relieving pain in ALS. We also aimed to evaluate possible adverse effects associated with the different drugs and their influence on survival and quality of life.
SEARCH METHODS: On 2 July 2012, we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (2 July 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 6 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2012), CINAHL (January 1982 to June 2012), AMED (January 1985 to June 2012) and LILACS (January 1982 to June 2012). We checked the bibliographies of trials identified and contacted other disease experts to identify further published and unpublished trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials on drug therapy for pain in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We collected data using a specially designed form and analysed them using the Cochrane Review Manager software.
MAIN RESULTS: We found no randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials on drug therapy for pain in ALS or MND.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials about the management of pain in ALS. Further research on this important aspect of palliative care in ALS is needed. Randomised controlled trials should be initiated to determine the effectiveness of different analgesics for treatment of pain in ALS.","['Brettschneider J', 'Kurent J', 'Ludolph A']",2013,2013,6,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Brettschneider J, et al.

23728676,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive neurodegenerative disease without effective therapies. Several studies have suggested that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may have positive benefit in ALS. However, the efficacy and safety of this therapy remain uncertain. This is the first update of a review published in 2011.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rTMS for treating ALS.
SEARCH METHODS: On 30 July 2012, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2012, issue 7 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2012), EMBASE (1980 to July 2012), CINAHL (1937 to July 2012), Science Citation Index Expanded (January 1945 to July 2012), AMED (January 1985 to July 2012). We searched the Chinese Biomedical Database (1979 to August 2012). We also searched for ongoing studies on clinicaltrials.gov (August 2012).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of rTMS for patients with a clinical diagnosis of ALS.Comparisons eligible for inclusion were:1. rTMS versus no intervention;2. rTMS versus sham rTMS;3. rTMS versus physiotherapy;4. rTMS versus medications;5. rTMS + other therapies or drugs versus sham rTMS + the same therapies or drugs;6. different methods of application of rTMS such as high-frequency (> 1Hz) compared to low-frequency (≤ 1Hz) rTMS.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected papers, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We resolved disagreements through discussion. We contacted study authors for additional information.
MAIN RESULTS: Three randomised, placebo-controlled trials with a total of 50 participants were included in the review. All three trials compared rTMS with sham TMS. All the trials were of poor methodological quality and were insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results. Moreover, the high rate of attrition further increased the risk of bias. None of the trials provided detailed data on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores at six months follow-up which was pre-assigned as our primary outcome. One trial contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis of our secondary outcomes. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham rTMS using the ALSFRS-R scores and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores at 12 months follow-up in this trial. Additionally, none of the trials reported any adverse events associated with the use of rTMS. However, in view of the small sample size, the methodological limitations and incomplete outcome data, treatment with rTMS cannot be judged as completely safe.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of ALS. Further studies may be helpful if their potential benefit is weighed against the impact of participation in a randomised controlled trial on people with ALS.","['Fang J', 'Zhou M', 'Yang M', 'Zhu C', 'He L']",2013,2013,5,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Fang J, et al.

23728653,Therapeutic exercise for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the high incidence of muscle weakness in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND), the effects of exercise in this population are not well understood. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review randomised and quasi-randomised studies of exercise for people with ALS or MND.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (2 July 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 6 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2012), AMED (January 1985 to June 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1938 to June 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to June 2012), Ovid HealthSTAR (January 1975 to December 2012). We also searched ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I (2007 to 2012), inspected the reference lists of all papers selected for review and contacted authors with expertise in the field.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of people with a diagnosis of definite, probable, probable with laboratory support, or possible ALS, as defined by the El Escorial criteria. We included progressive resistance or strengthening exercise, and endurance or aerobic exercise. The control condition was no exercise or standard rehabilitation management. Our primary outcome measure was improvement in functional ability, decrease in disability or reduction in rate of decline as measured by a validated outcome tool at three months. Our secondary outcome measures were improvement in psychological status or quality of life, decrease in fatigue, increase in, or reduction in rate of decline of muscle strength (strengthening or resistance studies), increase in, or reduction in rate of decline of aerobic endurance (aerobic or endurance studies) at three months and frequency of adverse effects. We did not exclude studies on the basis of measurement of outcomes.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data. We collected adverse event data from included trials. The review authors contacted the authors of the included studies to obtain information not available in the published articles.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified two randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria, and we found no new trials when we updated the searches in 2012. The first, a study with overall unclear risk of bias, examined the effects of a twice-daily exercise program of moderate load endurance exercise versus ""usual activities"" in 25 people with ALS. The second, a study with overall low risk of bias, examined the effects of thrice weekly moderate load and moderate intensity resistance exercises compared to usual care (stretching exercises) in 27 people with ALS. After three months, when the results of the two trials were combined (43 participants), there was a significant mean improvement in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) measure of function in favour of the exercise groups (mean difference 3.21, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 5.96). No statistically significant differences in quality of life, fatigue or muscle strength were found. In both trials adverse effects, investigators reported no adverse effects such as increased muscle cramping, muscle soreness or fatigue
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The included studies were too small to determine to what extent strengthening exercises for people with ALS are beneficial, or whether exercise is harmful. There is a complete lack of randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials examining aerobic exercise in this population.

23725553,The impact of fatigue and psychosocial variables on quality of life for patients with motor neuron disease.,"Our objective was to evaluate the direct and indirect relationships between psychosocial variables, fatigue and quality of life for patients with motor neuron disease (MND). A cross-sectional sample of 147 MND patients was recruited from five neurological care centres in England. Variables included anxiety, coping, depression, fatigue, functional status, social withdrawal and quality of life. Direct and indirect relationships between study variables were assessed using structural equation modelling (SEM), using linear values derived from Rasch analyses of study questionnaires. Following some modification, Rasch analysis confirmed the suitability of all measures for use in this population. The final SEM model consisting of anxiety, coping, depression, fatigue, social withdrawal and quality of life showed excellent fit to the data. The model accounted for 59% of the variance in quality of life and 50% of the variance in depression. In conclusion, our data support a model that explains a large degree of the variance in quality of life for MND patients. Coping was most strongly related to quality of life, with the largest proportion of its influence mediated by anxiety and depression. Significant direct effects upon quality of life were exhibited by depression, fatigue and social withdrawal.","['Gibbons C', 'Thornton E', 'Ealing J', 'Shaw P', 'Talbot K', 'Tennant A', 'Young C']",2013,14,7-8,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Gibbons C, et al.

23647474,Management of sialorrhoea in motor neuron disease: a survey of current UK practice.,"Our objective was to better understand UK-wide practice in managing sialorrhoea in motor neuron disease among specialist clinicians. We used a survey of neurologists in the UK with a special interest in motor neuron disease designed to establish clinicians' attitudes towards treatment options and resources for sialorrhoea management. Twenty-three clinicians replied, representing 21 centres. Sixteen centres were specialist MND Care Centres. Clinicians estimated seeing a total of 1391 newly diagnosed patients with MND in 2011. One hundred and ninety-three patients were described. Forty-two percent of patients reviewed in clinicians' last clinic had sialorrhoea and 46% of those with sialorrhoea had uncontrolled symptoms. Clinicians' preferred drugs were hyoscine patches, amitriptyline, carbocisteine and botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin was used in 14 centres. Risk of dysphagia and staff skills were identified as the main barriers to botulinum toxin use. This survey suggests that there may be as many as 1700 patients with MND in the UK who have symptoms of sialorrhoea and that symptoms may be poorly controlled in nearly half. Treatment strategies varied, reflecting the lack of evidence based guidelines. The use of specialist treatments was influenced by local infrastructure.

23635965,Motor neuron involvement in multisystem proteinopathy: implications for ALS.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the putative connection between inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease, frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: Clinical, genetic, and EMG characterization of 17 patients from 8 IBMPFD families.
RESULTS: Limb weakness was the most common clinical manifestation (present in 15 patients, median onset age 38 years, range 25-52), with unequivocal evidence of upper motor neuron dysfunction in 3. EMG, abnormal in all 17, was purely neurogenic in 4, purely myopathic in 6, and mixed neurogenic/myopathic in 7. Cognitive/behavioral impairment was detected in at least 8. Mutations in VCP (R155H, R159G, R155C) were identified in 6 families, and in hnRNPA2B1 (D290V) in another family. The genetic cause in the eighth family has not yet been identified.
CONCLUSION: Mutations in at least 4 genes may cause IBMPFD, and its phenotypic spectrum extends beyond IBM, Paget disease, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Weakness, the most common and disabling manifestation, may be caused by muscle disease or MND. The acronym IBMPFD is, therefore, insufficient to describe disorders due to VCP mutations or other recently identified IBMPFD-associated genes. Instead, we favor the descriptor multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), which encompasses both the extended clinical phenotype and the previously described prominent pathologic feature of protein aggregation in affected tissues. The nomenclature MSP1, MSP2, and MSP3 may be used for VCP-, HNRNPA2B1-, and HNRNPA1-associated disease, respectively. Genetic defects in MSP implicate a range of biological mechanisms including RNA processing and protein homeostasis, both with potential relevance to the pathobiology of more common MNDs such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and providing an additional link between ALS and FTD.","['Benatar M', 'Wuu J', 'Fernandez C', 'Weihl CC', 'Katzen H', 'Steele J', 'Oskarsson B', 'Taylor JP']",2013,80,20,Neurology,"Benatar M, et al.

23634874,"Adult-onset Alexander disease, associated with a mutation in an alternative GFAP transcript, may be phenotypically modulated by a non-neutral HDAC6 variant.","BACKGROUND: We studied a family including two half-siblings, sharing the same mother, affected by slowly progressive, adult-onset neurological syndromes. In spite of the diversity of the clinical features, characterized by a mild movement disorder with cognitive impairment in the elder patient, and severe motor-neuron disease (MND) in her half-brother, the brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features were compatible with adult-onset Alexander's disease (AOAD), suggesting different expression of the same, genetically determined, condition.
METHODS: Since mutations in the alpha isoform of glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP-α, the only cause so far known of AOAD, were excluded, we applied exome Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify gene variants, which were then functionally validated by molecular characterization of recombinant and patient-derived cells.
RESULTS: Exome-NGS revealed a mutation in a previously neglected GFAP isoform, GFAP-ϵ, which disrupts the GFAP-associated filamentous cytoskeletal meshwork of astrocytoma cells. To shed light on the different clinical features in the two patients, we sought for variants in other genes. The male patient had a mutation, absent in his half-sister, in X-linked histone deacetylase 6, a candidate MND susceptibility gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Exome-NGS is an unbiased approach that not only helps identify new disease genes, but may also contribute to elucidate phenotypic expression.","['Melchionda L', 'Fang M', 'Wang H', 'Fugnanesi V', 'Morbin M', 'Liu X', 'Li W', 'Ceccherini I', 'Farina L', 'Savoiardo M', ""D'Adamo P"", 'Zhang J', 'Costa A', 'Ravaglia S', 'Ghezzi D', 'Zeviani M']",2013,8,,Orphanet J Rare Dis,"Melchionda L, et al.

PLS and ALS patients showed a distributed pattern of abnormalities of the motor system, including the corticospinal tracts and corpus callosum (CC). PLS versus ALS patients showed a more severe damage to the motor CC fibers and subcortical white matter (WM) underlying the primary motor cortices. Both patient groups showed an extra-motor damage, which was more severe in PLS. This did not appear to be driven by longer disease duration in PLS. In PLS patients, damage to the CC mid-body correlated with the severity of upper motor neuron clinical burden. CC fractional anisotropy values had the highest accuracy in distinguishing PLS from controls and ALS. PLS and ALS share an overlapped pattern of WM abnormalities. This underscores that PLS, despite its distinct clinical phenotype and long survival, still lies within the wider MND spectrum. Whether CC diffusivity may be a novel marker to increase confidence in an early diagnostic separation of PLS from ALS still needs to be investigated.","['Agosta F', 'Galantucci S', 'Riva N', 'Chiò A', 'Messina S', 'Iannaccone S', 'Calvo A', 'Silani V', 'Copetti M', 'Falini A', 'Comi G', 'Filippi M']",2014,35,4,Hum Brain Mapp,"Agosta F, et al.

23621426,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease deaths in the United States, 1999-2009.","Our objective was to examine trends and epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) associated deaths in the United States. ALS/MND associated death rates and trends in the United States for 1999-2009 were examined using the multiple cause-of-death mortality data. Age-specific and age-adjusted death rates were calculated. For 1999-2009, the average annual age-adjusted death rate was 2.17/100,000 persons. The age-specific rate increased with age until 75-79 years. Males experienced a higher death rate than females. There was no definitive trend in the annual ALS/MND associated death rate, although analyses suggested a possible decrease (p = 0.05); however, the rate increased for persons 20-49 years of age and declined for persons ≥ 65 years of age. The annual rate for males decreased whereas the rate for females showed no change. In conclusion, the suggested decreasing annual ALS/MND associated death rate for 1999-2009 contrasts with earlier reports indicating that the incidence and death rate of ALS were increasing. While the ALS/MND associated death rate slightly increased among adults 20-49 years of age, rates declined among two subpopulations at higher risk for ALS/MND--males and persons ≥ 65 years of age. Continued monitoring of ALS/MND mortality data and additional epidemiological studies will be important to further elucidate these epidemiological trends.","['Mehal JM', 'Holman RC', 'Schonberger LB', 'Sejvar JJ']",2013,14,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Mehal JM, et al.

23616620,Mimics and chameleons in motor neurone disease.,"The progression of motor neurone disease (MND) is currently irreversible, and the grave implications of diagnosis naturally fuels concern among neurologists over missing a potential mimic disorder. There is no diagnostic test for MND but in reality there are few plausible mimics in routine clinical practice. In the presence of a progressive pure motor disorder, signs such as florid fasciculations, bilateral tongue wasting, the 'split hand', head drop, emotionality, and cognitive or behavioural impairment carry high positive predictive value. MND is clinically heterogeneous, however, with some important chameleon-like presentations and considerable variation in clinical course. Lack of confidence about the scope of such variation, or an approach to diagnosis emphasising investigations over clinical common sense, has the potential to exacerbate diagnostic delay in MND and impede timely planning of the care which is essential to maximising quality of life.","['Turner MR', 'Talbot K']",2013,13,3,Pract Neurol,Turner MR and Talbot K.

FTLD is pathologically characterized by the frontal and temporal lobar atrophy. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) clinically presents with abnormalities of behavior and personality and language impairments variants. The clinical spectrum of FTD encompasses distinct canonical syndromes: behavioural variant of FTD (bvFTD) and primary progressive aphasia. The later includes nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (nfvPPA or PNFA), semantic variant PPA (svPPA or SD) and logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA). In addition, there is also overlap of FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND or FTD-ALS), as well as the parkinsonian syndromes, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The FTLD spectrum disorders are based upon the predominant neuropathological proteins (containing inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau or ubiquitin protein, e.g transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) and fusedin-sarcoma protein in neurons and glial cells) into three main categories: (1) microtubule-associated protein tau (FTLD-Tau); (2) TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (FTLD-TDP); and (3) fused in sarcoma protein (FTLD-FUS). There are five main genes mutations leading clinical and pathological variants in FTLD that identified by molecular genetic studies, which are chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene, granulin (GRN) gene, microtubule associated protein tau gene (MAPT), the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP) and the charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B).

23569452,Orofacial apraxia in motor neuron disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Cognitive and behavioral impairments are considered to occur frequently in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (MND). Rarely, apraxia has been reported in MND. Orofacial, or buccofacial, apraxia is characterized by a loss of voluntary control of facial, lingual, pharyngeal and masticatory muscles in the presence of preserved reflexive and automatic functions of the same muscles.
METHODS: We report a patient with MND who presented with spastic dysarthria and asymmetric orofacial apraxia. She progressed to frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
RESULTS: Clinical and neurophysiological examinations were suggestive of bulbar-onset MND-FTD. Tractography showed a reduction of fractional anisotropy in the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, corticomedullary pathway and inferior aspect of the medulla; the changes were more severe on the left side. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an asymmetric presentation of an apraxic syndrome in MND-FTD.","['Lobo PP', 'Pinto S', 'Rocha L', 'Reimão S', 'de Carvalho M']",2013,5,1,Case Rep Neurol,"Lobo PP, et al.

23543531,Mechanical ventilation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Neuromuscular respiratory failure is the commonest cause of death, usually within two to five years of the disease onset. Supporting respiratory function with mechanical ventilation may improve survival and quality of life. This is the first update of a review first published in 2009.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the review is to examine the efficacy of mechanical ventilation (tracheostomy and non-invasive ventilation) in improving survival in ALS. The secondary objectives are to examine the effect of mechanical ventilation on functional measures of disease progression and quality of life in people with ALS; and assess adverse events related to the intervention.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (1 May 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to April 2012), and AMED (January 1985 to April 2012). We also searched for ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving non-invasive or tracheostomy assisted ventilation in participants with a clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, independent of the reported outcomes. We planned to include comparisons with no intervention or the best standard care.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For the original review, four authors independently selected studies for assessment and two authors reviewed searches for this update. All authors extracted data independently from the full text of selected studies and assessed the risk of bias in studies that met the inclusion criteria. We attempted to obtain missing data where possible. We planned to collect adverse event data from included studies.
MAIN RESULTS: For the original Cochrane review, the review authors identified and included two randomised controlled trials involving 54 participants with ALS receiving non-invasive ventilation. There were no new randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials at this first update.Incomplete data were published for one study and we contacted the trial authors who were not able to provide the missing data. Therefore, the results of the review were based on a single study of 41 participants that compared non-invasive ventilation with standard care. It was a well conducted study with low risk of bias.The study showed that the overall median survival was significantly different between the group treated with non-invasive ventilation and the standard care group. The median survival in the non-invasive ventilation group was 48 days longer (219 days compared to 171 days for the standard care group (estimated 95% CI 12 to 91 days, P = 0.0062)). This survival benefit was accompanied by an enhanced quality of life. On subgroup analysis, the survival and quality of life benefit was much more in the subgroup with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function (20 participants); median survival was 205 days longer (216 days in NIV group versus 11 days in the standard care group, P = 0.0059). Non-invasive ventilation did not prolong survival in participants with poor bulbar function (21 participants), although it showed significant improvement in the mean symptoms domain of the Sleep Apnoea Quality of Life Index but not in the Short Form-36 Health Survey Mental Component Summary score. Neither trial reported clinical data on intervention related adverse effects.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from a single randomised trial of non-invasive ventilation in 41 participants suggests that it significantly prolongs survival and improves or maintains quality of life in people with ALS. Survival and some measures of quality of life were significantly improved in the subgroup of people with better bulbar function, but not in those with severe bulbar impairment. Future studies should examine the health economics of NIV and factors influencing access to NIV. We need to understand the factors, personal and socioeconomic, that determine access to NIV.","['Radunovic A', 'Annane D', 'Rafiq MK', 'Mustfa N']",2013,,3,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Radunovic A, et al.

Handwriting has previously been described as a viable and practical means of augmentative and alternative communication, particularly for adults with acquired progressive dysarthria and intact upper limb control. To date, however, there is extremely limited evidence documenting how handwriting is used within a conversational context. The analysis in this paper features data from two people with ALS/MND in conversation at home with their spouses.

Currently, little is known about the experiences of people after they have received this diagnosis and the effect of this on their sense of self and identity. In this study, interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to explore both the personal and lived experiences of people with MND. Seven people diagnosed with MND within the previous six months were recruited. The three themes constructed from the participants' accounts were 'Then they dropped the bomb shell'; Receiving a diagnosis of MND; 'Getting on with it'; Learning to live with MND; and 'A lot of normal life is lost'; Experiencing progressive loss. Participants described receiving a diagnosis as a devastating experience but most participants were able to accept their diagnosis and employ adaptive strategies to cope with increasing levels of functional decline. However, in spite of this, the participants experienced functional changes that affected their identity, social status and social relationships.","['Mistry K', 'Simpson J']",2013,28,8,Psychol Health,Mistry K and Simpson J.

23448465,Histone acetylation as a potential therapeutic target in motor neuron degenerative diseases.,"Among hereditary diseases, the group of motor neuron diseases (MNDs) includes some of the most devastating and rapidly progressive lethal conditions. Although degeneration of motor neurons is common to all of them, the phenotypic spectrum of MNDs is relatively broad and ranges from perinatal conditions like spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) to adult-onset diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While the understanding of the pathology of the diseases is constantly growing, the development of therapeutic approaches lags behind. In fact, there is no approved therapy for MNDs available at the moment. Recent findings demonstrated the existence of some patterns that are shared by several MNDs such as transcriptional dysregulation. In addition, conditions like SMA or certain types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease provide some defined targets which may be amenable to therapeutic approaches. Consequently, counteracting this dysregulation may be a valuable therapeutic option and ameliorate disease progression in MND patients. The feasibility of such an approach has been proven during the past years by the epigenetic treatment of various neoplastic entities with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). On these grounds, also epigenetic therapy of MNDs has become a promising option. So far, several HDACi have been tested in vitro and in animal models and some proceeded further and were evaluated in clinical trials. This review will summarize the advances of HDACi in MNDs and will give a perspective where the road will lead us.","['Garbes L', 'Riessland M', 'Wirth B']",2013,19,28,Curr Pharm Des,"Garbes L, et al.

23435409,Novel evidence of phenotypical variability in the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in chromosome 9.,"C9ORF72 repeat expansion is currently considered as a major genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and, in particular, of combined frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disorder (FTD-MND) pedigrees. Studies of large series of patients have indicated that various phenotypic presentations may be observed even in the same family. Here, we describe four patients carrying a C9ORF72 mutation with heterogeneous clinical presentation sharing a rapid disease course. Cases #1 and #2 presented with predominant semantic deficits, accompanied in one patient by clinical signs of ALS. Case #3 showed a phenotype compatible with a diagnosis of behavioral variant of FTD. Case #4 presented with memory impairments, apathy, and social withdrawal, and had negative cerebrospinal fluid markers for Alzheimer's disease. Two patients showed a positive familiar history of MND and dementia (at least one first-degree family member affected). The two other patients were apparently sporadic cases. Our data provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of phenotypes associated with the C9ORF72 mutation and indicate its association with a fluent progressive aphasia phenotype. The present findings confirm the importance of screening for the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in chromosome 9 in the case not only of familial, but also of sporadic FTD, and in the presence of atypical cognitive disorders.","['Cerami C', 'Marcone A', 'Galimberti D', 'Zamboni M', 'Fenoglio C', 'Serpente M', 'Scarpini E', 'Cappa SF']",2013,35,3,J Alzheimers Dis,"Cerami C, et al.

23393039,Patients' experiences of health and social care in long-term neurological conditions in England: a cross-sectional survey.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate patients' experiences of health and social care services in long-term neurological conditions in England.
METHOD: Cross-sectional survey of 5209 patient members of the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MND, n = 890), Multiple Sclerosis Society (MS, n = 2345) or Parkinson's UK (PD, n = 1974). A questionnaire on patient experiences of health and social care was completed by 2563 (49%) (505 MND, 1157 MS and 901 PD).
RESULTS: A mixed picture of experiences of health and social care in MND, MS or PD was found with few problems reported for some aspects of services such as obtaining information about medication (n = 117, 6.1%). In contrast, problems with planning and integration of care were reported frequently, with 78.0% of patients not having a care plan and 61.9% reporting that services do not collaborate well in planning care. Other problems included delays with diagnosis, information about medication side effects, and management of conditions whilst in hospital. Significant differences between the three conditions were found for most aspects of care, with MND patients generally reporting fewer problems. The findings highlight which areas of health and social care need to be improved and monitored. While a larger sample size was obtained than in other studies, possible limitations include the sampling frame and the 49% response rate.
CONCLUSION: Planning and integration of care are key areas that require improvement.","['Peters M', 'Fitzpatrick R', 'Doll H', 'Playford ED', 'Jenkinson C']",2013,18,1,J Health Serv Res Policy,"Peters M, et al.

Results differ between studies using proxy exposure based on occupational titles and estimated MF levels. We conducted a meta-analysis of occupational MF NDD, primarily Alzheimer disease (AD), and motor neuron diseases (MNDs) studies.
METHODS: We identified 42 peer-reviewed publications and focused our analysis on study characteristics, exposure metrics, and publication bias.
RESULTS: We found weak associations for occupational MF exposure proxies with AD and MND. Motor neuron disease risk was associated with occupational titles, whereas AD risk was associated with estimated MF levels. Results varied in study design, with dissimilar variation across diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support MF as the explanation for observed associations between occupational titles and MND.

A population based study has been performed focusing on ALS survival, with particular attention to prognostic factors and therapeutic intervention. All patients diagnosed with ALS between 2000 and 2009 and residing in Modena, Italy, have been registered. A centre for motor neuron disease (MND) has been active in our province since 2000, in addition to a prospective registry collecting all incident cases. One hundred and ninety-three incident cases have been collected during the 10 years of the study. Results demonstrated that median survival was 41 months (the overall three-year and five-year survival rates being 54.36% and 28.81%, respectively). Based on univariate analysis, factors related to survival were: age at diagnosis, gender, site of onset, phenotype, riluzole treatment and tracheostomy. In the Cox multivariable model, the factors independently related to a longer survival were age (p < 0.01), site of onset (p = 0.02) and riluzole treatment (p < 0.01), with a median gain in survival of 29 months (patients aged < 55 years compared with patients ≥ 55 years), 20 months (spinal versus bulbar onset), and 12 months (riluzole, yes vs. no), respectively. In conclusion, the study has confirmed the prognostic role of clinical features, but has surprisingly demonstrated that riluzole prolonged life significantly longer than NIV and EN. This observational study described the effects of ALS management in a setting that may approximate routine clinical practice more closely than randomized controlled trial (RCT); effects of uncontrolled potential confounders, however, cannot be excluded.","['Georgoulopoulou E', 'Fini N', 'Vinceti M', 'Monelli M', 'Vacondio P', 'Bianconi G', 'Sola P', 'Nichelli P', 'Mandrioli J']",2013,14,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Georgoulopoulou E, et al.

23336121,Experiences of living with motor neurone disease: a review of qualitative research.,"PURPOSE: This review sought to answer the question ""what is known about people's experiences of living with MND?"".
METHODS: The review followed the guidelines of the Centre of Reviews and Dissemination. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria and their results were analysed thematically. Data were managed and coded using the software package NVIVO and the analysis was performed in two stages, with the first stage aiming to develop descriptive themes offering an overview of the included data. During the second stage, analytical themes were developed with the explicit aim to answer the review question.
RESULTS: The themes that emerged point to the following: (a) people with motor neurone disease (MND) develop experiential knowledge that helps them to live with the disease and (b) while people with MND believe they do not have any control over the disease, they try to have control over their lives through active choices, e.g. how and when to use adaptive equipment.
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the decision-making and knowledge generating processes used by people with MND. Further research is required to explore these processes and their implications for the care of people with MND.
IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Decision-making process by MND patients regarding their care is complex and takes into account the social elements of the disease as well as the medical.

23329412,"The product of C9orf72, a gene strongly implicated in neurodegeneration, is structurally related to DENN Rab-GEFs.","MOTIVATION: Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called motor neuron disease, MND) are severe neurodegenerative diseases that show considerable overlap at the clinical and cellular level. The most common single mutation in families with FTD or ALS has recently been mapped to a non-coding repeat expansion in the uncharacterized gene C9ORF72. Although a plausible mechanism for disease is that aberrant C9ORF72 mRNA poisons splicing, it is important to determine the cellular function of C9ORF72, about which nothing is known.
RESULTS: Sensitive homology searches showed that C9ORF72 is a full-length distant homologue of proteins related to Differentially Expressed in Normal and Neoplasia (DENN), which is a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rab-GTPases.

23323138,Current status of the diagnosis and management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Korea: a multi-center cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently published, evidence-based guidelines should alter the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND). However, the newest recommendations for ALS/MND therapy are not reflected in actual clinical practice. We sought to evaluate the current status of the diagnosis and management of ALS in Korea.
METHODS: The Korean ALS/MND research group was organized in 2010, involving more than 50 neurologists from neuromuscular centers in Korea. Participating centers collected data from April to September 2010 on the diagnosis and management of patients with ALS. Data forms from the ALS patient care database, which is a component of the ALS clinical assessment, research, and education program (http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/ALS/), were modified and used for data collection.
RESULTS: In total, 373 sporadic ALS cases from 35 centers were enrolled. The demographic features and clinical findings were similar to those in previous reports from other countries. The mean age at onset was 50-60 years, and a slight male predominance was observed. The enrolled patients predominantly showed focal onset of cervical or lumbosacral symptoms. Only about one-half of the indicated patients (31.4%) received a physician's recommendation for a parenteral gastrostomy, and 18.1% underwent the procedure. Noninvasive ventilation was recommended in 23% of patients, but applied in only 9.5% of them. Tracheostomy was performed in 12.7% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The demographic and clinical features of the diagnosis and management of ALS in Korea are similar to those reported in other countries; however, supportive management, as recommended in evidence-based guidelines, are not yet widely recommended or performed for patients with ALS in Korea.","['Bae JS', 'Hong YH', 'Baek W', 'Sohn EH', 'Cho JY', 'Kim BJ', 'Kim SH', 'Korean ALS/MND Research Group']",2012,8,4,J Clin Neurol,"Bae JS, et al.

23281774,Widespread aggregation of mutant VAPB associated with ALS does not cause motor neuron degeneration or modulate mutant SOD1 aggregation and toxicity in mice.,"BACKGROUND: A proline-to-serine substitution at position-56 (P56S) of vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB) causes a form of dominantly inherited motor neuron disease (MND), including typical and atypical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a mild late-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). VAPB is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including ER stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR) and Ca2+ homeostasis. However, it is unclear how the P56S mutation leads to neurodegeneration and muscle atrophy in patients. The formation of abnormal VAPB-positive inclusions by mutant VAPB suggests a possible toxic gain of function as an underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the amount of VAPB protein is reported to be reduced in sporadic ALS patients and mutant SOD1G93A mice, leading to the hypothesis that wild type VAPB plays a role in the pathogenesis of ALS without VAPB mutations.
RESULTS: To investigate the pathogenic mechanism in vivo, we generated human wild type (wtVAPB) and mutant VAPB (muVAPB) transgenic mice that expressed the transgenes broadly in the CNS. We observed robust VAPB-positive aggregates in the spinal cord of muVAPB transgenic mice. However, we failed to find an impairment of motor function and motor neuron degeneration. We also did not detect any change in the endogenous VAPB level or evidence for induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and coaggregation of VAPA with muVAPB. Furthermore, we crossed these VAPB transgenic mice with mice that express mutant SOD1G93A and develop motor neuron degeneration. Overexpression of neither wtVAPB nor muVAPB modulated the protein aggregation and disease progression in the SOD1G93A mice.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of VAPBP56S mutant to approximately two-fold of the endogenous VAPB in mouse spinal cord produced abundant VAPB aggregates but was not sufficient to cause motor dysfunction or motor neuron degeneration. Furthermore, overexpression of either muVAPB or wtVAPB does not modulate the course of ALS in SOD1G93A mice. These results suggest that changes in wild type VAPB do not play a significant role in ALS cases that are not caused by VAPB mutations. Furthermore, these results suggest that muVAPB aggregates are innocuous and do not cause motor neuron degeneration by a gain-of-toxicity, and therefore, a loss of function may be the underlying mechanism.","['Qiu L', 'Qiao T', 'Beers M', 'Tan W', 'Wang H', 'Yang B', 'Xu Z']",2013,8,,Mol Neurodegener,"Qiu L, et al.

24639657,The patient experience of fatigue in motor neurone disease.,"AIMS: This paper is a qualitative investigation that aims to investigate the lived experience of fatigue in patients with motor neurone disease-a progressive and fatal neurological condition.
BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a disabling symptom in motor neurone disease (MND) that affects a large number of patients. However, the term ""fatigue"" is in itself imprecise, as it remains a phenomenon without a widely accepted medical definition. This study sought to investigate the phenomenon of fatigue from the perspective of the MND patient.
METHODS: Ten patients with MND participated in semi-structured recorded interviews at a regional neuroscience center in Liverpool, UK. Transcripts analysis was broadly informed by the principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA).
FINDINGS: Fatigue was unanimously explained to be disabling and progressive phenomenon. Participants described two forms of fatigue: whole-body tiredness or use-dependent reversible muscle weakness related to exertion of limb and bulbar muscles. Both weakness and whole-body tiredness could be experienced simultaneously, and patients used the terms ""fatigue"" and ""tiredness"" interchangeably. Alongside descriptions of fatigue themes of Adaptation, Motivation, Avoidance, Frustration and Stress were revealed. Fatigue could be defined as ""reversible motor weakness and whole-body tiredness that was predominantly brought on by muscular exertion and was partially relieved by rest.""
CONCLUSION: The results of this study support a multi-dimensional model of fatigue for patients with MND. Fatigue appears to be experienced and explained in two ways, both as an inability to sustain motor function and as a pervasive tiredness. Fatigue was only partially relieved by rest and tended to worsen throughout the day. It is crucial that MND care practitioners and researchers appreciate the semantic dichotomy within fatigue.","['Gibbons CJ', 'Thornton EW', 'Young CA']",2013,4,,Front Psychol,"Gibbons CJ, et al.

This study aimed to quantify the views of a range of healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the provision of these interventions in the United Kingdom. A total of 177 HCPs participated in an online survey. Significant differences were found between medical and allied HCPs' views on: whether HCPs adhere to policy and accept legal constraints when it comes to making gastrostomy available to people with ALS; the impressions that HCPs receive of the way patients and caregivers understand the effects of gastrostomy and NIV on symptoms and quality of life; and the challenges HCPs face when caring for patients who have refused gastrostomy.

23235621,Creatine for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Creatine, a naturally-occurring nitrogenous organic acid involved in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, has been shown to increase survival in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND). Results from human trials, however, have been mixed. Given conflicting results regarding the efficacy of creatine, we conducted a systematic review, which was updated in 2012.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically examine the efficacy of creatine efficacy in prolonging ALS survival and in slowing ALS disease progression.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (16 July 2012), CENTRAL (2012, issue 7 in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012) for any trial involving creatine in the treatment of ALS. We also contacted experts in the field for any additional studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials of treatment with creatine or placebo in patients diagnosed with ALS. Our primary outcome was tracheostomy-free survival time; secondary outcomes were ALS progression as measured by changes in ALS functional rating revised scores (ALSFRS-R) and per cent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) over time.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We obtained and analyzed individual participant data from each study.
MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials involving 386 participants randomized to either creatine 5 to 10 g per day or placebo. When we updated the searches in 2012 we found no additional trials. Creatine was reportedly well-tolerated in all three included studies, with no evidence of renal failure or serious adverse events specifically attributable to creatine. Using a pooled log-rank statistical test, we found no statistical difference in survival between the placebo and creatine groups across all three studies (Chi(2) = 0.09, P = 0.76). In addition, we found no statistical difference in ALSFRS-R slopes between the two groups across all three studies using a pooled linear mixed-effects model (slope difference of +0.03 ALSFRS-R/month in the creatine group; P = 0.76). Interestingly, there was a trend towards slightly worsened FVC slope in the creatine group (slope difference of -0.63 FVC/month in the creatine group) using a pooled linear mixed-effects model across the two studies which included FVC as an outcome, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.054).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In patients already diagnosed with clinically probable or definite ALS, creatine at doses ranging from 5 to 10 g per day did not have a statistically significant effect on survival, ALSFRS-R progression or percent predicted FVC progression.","['Pastula DM', 'Moore DH', 'Bedlack RS']",2012,12,,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Pastula DM, et al.

23220002,Neuropathy target esterase (NTE): overview and future.,"Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) was discovered by M.K. Johnson in his quest for the entity responsible for the striking and mysterious paralysis brought about by certain organophosphorus (OP) esters. His pioneering work on OP neuropathy led to the view that the biochemical lesion consisted of NTE that had undergone OP inhibition and aging. Indeed, nonaging NTE inhibitors failed to produce disease but protected against neuropathy from subsequently administered aging inhibitors. Thus, inhibition of NTE activity was not the culprit; rather, formation of an abnormal protein was the agent of the disorder. More recently, however, Paul Glynn and colleagues showed that whereas conventional knockout of the NTE gene was embryonic lethal, conditional knockout of central nervous system NTE produced neurodegeneration, suggesting to these authors that the absence of NTE rather than its presence in some altered form caused disease. We now know that NTE is the 6th member of a 9-protein family called patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing proteins, PNPLA1-9. Mutations in the catalytic domain of NTE (PNPLA6) are associated with a slowly developing disease akin to OP neuropathy and hereditary spastic paraplegia called NTE-related motor neuron disorder (NTE-MND). Furthermore, the NTE protein from affected individuals has altered enzymological characteristics. Moreover, closely related PNPLA7 is regulated by insulin and glucose. These seemingly disparate findings are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but we need to reconcile recent genetic findings with the historical body of toxicological data indicating that inhibition and aging of NTE are both necessary in order to produce neuropathy from exposure to certain OP compounds. Solving this mystery will be satisfying in itself, but it is also an enterprise likely to pay dividends by enhancing our understanding of the physiological and pathogenic roles of the PNPLA family of proteins in neurological health and disease, including a potential role for NTE in diabetic neuropathy.","['Richardson RJ', 'Hein ND', 'Wijeyesakere SJ', 'Fink JK', 'Makhaeva GF']",2013,203,1,Chem Biol Interact,"Richardson RJ, et al.

23197892,Nutritional support teams increase percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy uptake in motor neuron disease.,"AIM: To examine factors influencing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) uptake and outcomes in motor neuron disease (MND) in a tertiary care centre.
METHODS: Case notes from all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MND who had attended the clinic at the Repatriation General Hospital between January 2007 and January 2011 and who had since died, were audited. Data were extracted for demographics (age and gender), disease characteristics (date of onset, bulbar or peripheral predominance, complications), date and nature of discussion of gastrostomy insertion, nutritional status [weight measurements, body mass index (BMI)], date of gastrostomy insertion and subsequent progress (duration of survival) and quality of life (QoL) [Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R)]. In addition, the type of clinician initiating the discussion regarding gastrostomy was recorded as Nutritional Support Team (involved in providing nutrition input viz Gastroenterologist, Speech Pathologist, Dietitian) and other (involved in non-nutritional aspects of patient care). Factors affecting placement and outcomes including length of survival, change in weight and QoL were determined.
RESULTS: Case records were available for all 86 patients (49 men, mean age at diagnosis 66.4 years). Thirty-eight patients had bulbar symptoms and 48 had peripheral disease as their presenting feature. Sixty-six patients reported dysphagia. Thirty-one patients had undergone gastrostomy insertion. The major indications for PEG placement were dysphagia and weight loss. Nine patients required immediate full feeding, whereas 17 patients initially used the gastrostomy to supplement oral intake, 4 for medication administration and 1 for hydration. Initially the PEG regime met 73% ± 31% of the estimated total energy requirements, increasing to 87% ± 32% prior to death. There was stabilization of weight in patients undergoing gastrostomy [BMI at 3 mo (22.6 ± 2.2 kg/m(2)) and 6 mo (22.5 ± 2.0 kg/m(2)) after PEG placement compared to weight at the time of the procedure (22.5 ± 3.0 kg/m(2))]. However, weight loss recurred in the terminal stages of the illness. There was a strong trend for longer survival from diagnosis among MND in PEG recipients with limb onset presentation compared to similar patients who did not undergo the procedure (P = 0.063). Initial discussions regarding PEG insertion occurred earlier after diagnosis when seen by nutrition support team (NST) clinicians compared to other clinicians. (5.4 ± 7.0 mo vs 11.9 ± 13.4 mo, P = 0.028). There was a significant increase in PEG uptake (56% vs 24%, P = 0.011) if PEG discussions were initiated by the NST staff compared to other clinicians. There was no change in the ALSFRS-R score in patients who underwent PEG (pre 34.1 ± 8.6 vs post 34.8 ± 7.4), although in non-PEG recipients there was a non-significant fall in this score (33.7 ± 7.9 vs 31.6 ± 8.8). Four patients died within one month of the procedure, 4 developed bacterial site infection requiring antibiotics and 1 required endoscopic therapy for gastric bleeding. Less serious complications attributed to the procedure included persistent gastrostomy site discomfort, poor appetite, altered bowel function and bloating.
CONCLUSION: Initial discussion with NST clinicians increases PEG uptake in MND. Gastrostomy stabilizes patient weight but weight loss recurs with advancing disease.","['Zhang L', 'Sanders L', 'Fraser RJ']",2012,18,44,World J Gastroenterol,"Zhang L, et al.

23176423,Association of oxidative stress with motor neuron disease in horses.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of oxidative stress in terms of antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation on the probability of motor neuron disease (MND) in horses.
ANIMALS: 88 horses with MND (cases) and 49 controls.
PROCEDURES: Blood samples were collected from all horses enrolled, and RBCs and plasma were harvested. Activity of the enzyme erythrocytic superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) was determined in the RBCs. Plasma concentrations of α-tocopherols and β-carotenes and activity of glutathione peroxidase were also evaluated. Degree of lipid peroxidation was measured by determining plasma concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides. Differences were evaluated between horse groups.
RESULTS: Cases had lower erythrocyte SOD1 activity than did controls, but the difference was not significant. On the other hand, plasma vitamin E concentrations differed significantly between groups, with the cases having lower concentrations. Neither plasma vitamin A concentration nor glutathione peroxidase activity differed between groups; however, cases had significantly higher concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides (18.53μM) than did controls (12.35μM).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Horses with MND differed from those without MND by having a lower plasma concentration of vitamin E and higher concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides. Results parallel the findings in humans with sporadic amyotrophic sclerosis and provide evidence supporting the involvement of oxidative stress in the 2 conditions.","['Mohammed HO', 'Divers TJ', 'Kwak J', 'Omar AH', 'White ME', 'de Lahunta A']",2012,73,12,Am J Vet Res,"Mohammed HO, et al.

23175812,An early onset progressive motor neuron disorder in Scyl1-deficient mice is associated with mislocalization of TDP-43.,"The molecular and cellular bases of motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are still poorly understood. The diseases are mostly sporadic, with ~10% of cases being familial. In most cases of familial motor neuronopathy, the disease is caused by either gain-of-adverse-effect mutations or partial loss-of-function mutations in ubiquitously expressed genes that serve essential cellular functions. Here we show that deletion of Scyl1, an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed gene encoding the COPI-associated protein pseudokinase SCYL1, causes an early onset progressive MND with characteristic features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Skeletal muscles of Scyl1(-/-) mice displayed neurogenic atrophy, fiber type switching, and disuse atrophy. Peripheral nerves showed axonal degeneration. Loss of lower motor neurons (LMNs) and large-caliber axons was conspicuous in Scyl1(-/-) animals. Signs of neuroinflammation were seen throughout the CNS, most notably in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Neural-specific, but not skeletal muscle-specific, deletion of Scyl1 was sufficient to cause motor dysfunction, indicating that SCYL1 acts in a neural cell-autonomous manner to prevent LMN degeneration and motor functions. Remarkably, deletion of Scyl1 resulted in the mislocalization and accumulation of TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa) and ubiquilin 2 into cytoplasmic inclusions within LMNs, features characteristic of most familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Together, our results identify SCYL1 as a key regulator of motor neuron survival, and Scyl1(-/-) mice share pathological features with many human neurodegenerative conditions.","['Pelletier S', 'Gingras S', 'Howell S', 'Vogel P', 'Ihle JN']",2012,32,47,J Neurosci,"Pelletier S, et al.

We know little about its early stages, but such knowledge would help to identify the mechanisms underlying PLS and ALS and determine why PLS patients seem to be protected against lower MND (LMND).
METHODS: We reviewed 622 MND cases during a 4-year period and identified 34 patients with PUMND (5.4%).
RESULTS: Among 23 cases with follow-up data/electromyograms (EMGs; 2 had only 1 EMG), 13 (57%) remained classified as PUMND, and 8 (35%) developed LMND (mean, 51.4 months after onset). Of these 8, LMND developed in 3 after 48 months from symptom onset. Patients with PUMND and LMND were more functionally impaired (P = 0.02). Separately, we identified 5 patients with PUMND who developed LMND long after 48 months (range, 50-127 months).

OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of rhIGF-I in affecting disease progression, impact on measures of functional health status, prolonging survival and delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival in ALS. Occurrence of adverse events was also reviewed.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (21 November 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2011) and sought information from the authors of randomised clinical trials and manufacturers of rhIGF-I.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered all randomised controlled clinical trials involving rhIGF-I treatment of adults with definite or probable ALS according to the El Escorial Criteria. The primary outcome measure was change in Appel Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Rating Scale (AALSRS) total score after nine months of treatment and secondary outcome measures were change in AALSRS at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 months, change in quality of life (Sickness Impact Profile scale), survival and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author independently graded the risk of bias in the included studies. The lead author extracted data and the other authors checked them. We generated some missing data by making ruler measurements of data in published graphs. We collected data about adverse events from the included trials.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of rhIGF-I, involving 779 participants, for inclusion in the analysis. In a European trial (183 participants) the mean difference (MD) in change in AALSRS total score after nine months was -3.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) -8.68 to 2.08). In a North American trial (266 participants), the MD after nine months was -6.00 (95% CI -10.99 to -1.01). The combined analysis from both RCTs showed a MD after nine months of -4.75 (95% CI -8.41 to -1.09), a significant difference in favour of the treated group. The secondary outcome measures showed non-significant trends favouring rhIGF-I. There was an increased risk of injection site reactions with rhIGF-I (risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.54). . A second North American trial (330 participants) used a novel primary end point involving manual muscle strength testing. No differences were demonstrated between the treated and placebo groups in this study. All three trials were at high risk of bias.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in favour of rhIGF-I treatment; however, the quality of the evidence from the two included trials was low.

23134509,The CMAP scan as a tool to monitor disease progression in ALS and PMA.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) are characterized by a loss of motor units (MUs), reinnervation and, eventually, muscle fibre loss. These three aspects are all reflected in the compound muscle action potential scan (CMAP scan, a high-detail stimulus response curve), which visualizes large MU potentials as 'steps'. We explored changes in the CMAP scan over time, combined the information on steps and CMAP amplitude into a CMAP scan-based progression score (CSPS), and correlated this score with motor unit number estimates (MUNE). Ten patients (three PMA, seven ALS; age 37-77 years) were included. CMAP scan and MUNE measurements were performed five times during a three-month period. Nine patients had additional measurements. The follow-up period was 3-24 months. Results demonstrated that abnormalities in steps preceded a decline in maximum CMAP amplitude during follow-up. Usually, both steps and maximum CMAP amplitude changed between recordings. The correlation between the CSPS and MUNE was -0.80 (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the CMAP scan can be used to visualize and quantify disease progression in a muscle affected by MND. The CSPS is a measure of MU loss that is quick and easy to obtain and that, in contrast to MUNE, has no sample bias.","['Maathuis EM', 'Drenthen J', 'van Doorn PA', 'Visser GH', 'Blok JH']",2013,14,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Maathuis EM, et al.

23094954,Acceptability and preferences of six different routes of drug application for acute breathlessness: a comparison study between the United Kingdom and Germany.,"BACKGROUND: Opioids are the drugs of choice for management of breathlessness in advanced disease, but acute episodic breathlessness remains difficult to manage. New routes of opioid applications with quicker onset of action seem attractive for the management of episodic breathlessness.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the acceptability and preference of different routes of opioid applications in patients suffering from breathlessness due to advanced disease.
DESIGN: The study consisted of structured face-to-face interviews with patients suffering from breathlessness due to lung cancer (LC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and motor neurone disease (MND). Images and explanation were used to illustrate six application forms (oral, inhaled, sublingual, intranasal, buccal, transmucosal).
RESULTS: Participants numbered 119 (UK n=48, Germany n=71), 60% male, mean age 67.7 years (SD 9.9); 50% suffered from COPD. Inhaled was the most accepted (87%) and preferred (68%) route of application, followed by sublingual (45%/13%) and intranasal (42%/8%). The oral was least accepted (24%) and least preferred (9%) although nearly all participants had previous experiences with it (97%). Ratings were similar in both countries but different for preferences of sublingual (UK>Germany) and intranasal (Germany>UK). In general, participants from the UK rated more often ""yes"" for acceptability of all routes compared to Germany.
CONCLUSION: Inhaled was the most accepted and preferred route of application, but no route seemed to be acceptable to all patients. Therefore, individual patient preferences should be explored before drug prescription to enhance compliance and convenience.","['Simon ST', 'Niemand AM', 'Benalia H', 'Voltz R', 'Higginson IJ', 'Bausewein C']",2012,15,12,J Palliat Med,"Simon ST, et al.

23042087,Diaphragm pacing and noninvasive respiratory management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Although it is known that continuous noninvasive ventilation (CNIV) can prolong life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND), in this study we explore similar claims for diaphragm pacing (DP).
METHODS: NIV and DP users' vital capacities (VCs) over time and duration of NIV and CNIV dependence were analyzed for 354 non-DP and 8 DP ALS/MND patients.
RESULTS: Patients had a higher rate of monthly VC decline before NIV use (5.1 ± 7.6%) than during NIV use (2.5 ± 3.6%) (P < 0.01, 95% CI 0.84-4.5); the decline for 4 DP users was 3.7-20%. Fifty-five ALS/MND patients used part-time NIV for 19.9 ± 27.6 months until tracheostomy/death, whereas 113 others used it for 10.9 ± 10.5 months until CNIV dependence for another 12.8 ± 16.2 months. After placement, 7 DP users were CNIV dependent in 8.0 ± 7.0 months, whereas 6 underwent tracheostomy/died in 18.2 ± 13.7 months.
CONCLUSIONS: CNIV prolonged the survival of 113 of the 354 non-DP and 6 DP ALS/MND patients by 12.8 and 10.2 months, respectively. DP provided no benefit on VC or mechanical ventilation-free survival.","['Mahajan KR', 'Bach JR', 'Saporito L', 'Perez N']",2012,46,6,Muscle Nerve,"Mahajan KR, et al.

22995100,Is dignity therapy feasible to enhance the end of life experience for people with motor neurone disease and their family carers?,"BACKGROUND: Development of interventions that address psychosocial and existential distress in people with motor neurone disease (MND) or that alleviate caregiver burden in MND family carers have often been suggested in the research literature. Dignity therapy, which was developed to reduce psychosocial and existential distress at the end of life, has been shown to benefit people dying of cancer and their families. These results may not be transferable to people with MND. The objectives of this study are to assess the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of dignity therapy to enhance the end of life experience for people with motor neurone disease and their family carers.
METHODS/DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study utilizing a single treatment group and a pre/post test design. The study population will comprise fifty people diagnosed with MND and their nominated family carers. Primarily quantitative outcomes will be gathered through measures assessed at baseline and at approximately one week after the intervention. Outcomes for participants include hopefulness, spirituality and dignity. Outcomes for family carers include perceived caregiver burden, hopefulness and anxiety/depression. Feedback and satisfaction with the intervention will be gathered through a questionnaire.
DISCUSSION: This detailed research will explore if dignity therapy has the potential to enhance the end of life experience for people with MND and their family carers, and fill a gap for professionals who are called on to address the spiritual, existential and psychosocial needs of their MND patients and families.

22992240,"Development, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new out-patient Breathlessness Support Service: study protocol of a phase III fast-track randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom affecting many patients with advanced disease both from malignant and non-malignant origin. A combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures is necessary to treat this symptom successfully. Breathlessness services in various compositions aim to provide comprehensive care for patients and their carers by a multiprofessional team but their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness have not yet been proven. The Breathlessness Support Service (BSS) is a newly created multiprofessional and interdisciplinary outpatient service at a large university hospital in South East London. The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of this multidisciplinary out-patient BSS for the palliation of breathlessness, in advanced malignant and non-malignant disease.
METHODS: The BSS was modelled based on the results of qualitative and quantitative studies, and systematic literature reviews. A randomised controlled fast track trial (RCT) comprising two groups: 1) intervention (immediate access to BSS in addition to standard care); 2) control group (standard best practice and access to BSS after a waiting time of six weeks). Patients are included if suffering from breathlessness on exertion or at rest due to advanced disease such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), interstitial lung disease (ILD) or motor neurone disease (MND) that is refractory to maximal optimised medical management. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes are assessed in face to-face interviews at baseline, after 6 and 12 weeks. The primary outcome is patients' improvement of mastery of breathlessness after six weeks assessed on the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ). Secondary outcomes for patients include breathlessness severity, symptom burden, palliative care needs, service use, and respiratory measures (spirometry). For analyses, the primary outcome, mastery of breathlessness after six weeks, will be analysed using ANCOVA. Selection of covariates will depend on baseline differences between the groups. Analyses of secondary outcomes will include patients' symptom burden other than breathlessness, physiological measures (lung function, six minute walk distance), and caregiver burden.
DISCUSSION: Breathlessness services aim to meet the needs of patients suffering from this complex and burdensome symptom and their carers. The newly created BSS is different to other current services as it is run in close collaboration of palliative medicine and respiratory medicine to optimise medical care of patients. It also involves professionals from various medical, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work background.

In this paper we review three main methods of gastrostomy insertion (PEG, RIG, PIG); conduct a meta-analysis of mortality data following gastrostomy; and present a survey of current practice. A review of the literature revealed a lack of high quality evidence to indicate the optimal method and timing for gastrostomy insertion in patients with MND. A survey of 20 MND clinics demonstrated a clinic-based variability of gastrostomy practices due to factors such as clinician preference, availability of method, and patient respiratory function. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the estimate of the absolute difference in mortality rates was 2.1% higher for PEG (- 6.3%, + 11.2%), suggesting that RIG and PIG methods may be safer than PEG. These results and observations highlight the need for more research to evaluate and compare the safety of the differerent gastrostomy insertion methods in MND care.","['Stavroulakis T', 'Walsh T', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ', 'Progas Study']",2013,14,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Stavroulakis T, et al.

We observed significant alterations in spartin expression in alsin knock-down conditions. We further found that both proteins colocalize in N2a cells and spartin isoform-a precipitates with alsin in the same protein complex.

This study aimed to provide an in-depth qualitative exploration of the experience of living with, and caring for, a partner with MND. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight individuals, and transcripts analysed from an interpretative phenomenological perspective. Two main themes were derived. 'Impact on life' included having concern for partner's safety, having social restrictions, being continually tired, struggling with anger and frustration, loss of intimacy and uncertainty around the future; while 'Adjusting to the situation' included trying to be strong, retaining a sense of normality, appreciation of specialist services, adopting a problem-solving approach, living day to day and ability to remain positive. In conclusion, experiences of stress and loss are illustrated in this sample of partners of those with MND, and it is suggested both these aspects should be integrated into understanding of carers' experiences. Carers appear to inhibit their grief in order to appear strong. Greater understanding of the consequences of this would help in providing appropriate emotional support.","['Oyebode JR', 'Smith HJ', 'Morrison K']",2013,14,1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Oyebode JR, et al.

22897892,Protocol for diaphragm pacing in patients with respiratory muscle weakness due to motor neurone disease (DiPALS): a randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a devastating illness which leads to muscle weakness and death, usually within 2-3 years of symptom onset. Respiratory insufficiency is a common cause of morbidity, particularly in later stages of MND and respiratory complications are the leading cause of mortality in MND patients. Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) is the current standard therapy to manage respiratory insufficiency. Some MND patients however do not tolerate NIV due to a number of issues including mask interface problems and claustrophobia. In those that do tolerate NIV, eventually respiratory muscle weakness will progress to a point at which intermittent/overnight NIV is ineffective. The NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing System was originally developed for patients with respiratory insufficiency and diaphragm paralysis secondary to stable high spinal cord injuries. The DiPALS study will assess the effect of diaphragm pacing (DP) when used to treat patients with MND and respiratory insufficiency.
METHOD/DESIGN: 108 patients will be recruited to the study at 5 sites in the UK. Patients will be randomised to either receive NIV (current standard care) or receive DP in addition to NIV. Study participants will be required to complete outcome measures at 5 follow up time points (2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months) plus an additional surgery and 1 week post operative visit for those in the DP group. 12 patients (and their carers) from the DP group will also be asked to complete 2 qualitative interviews.
DISCUSSION: The primary objective of this trial will be to evaluate the effect of Diaphragm Pacing (DP) on survival over the study duration in patients with MND with respiratory muscle weakness. The project is funded by the National Institute for Health Research, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (project number 09/55/33) and the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Henry Smith Charity.

22878865,Mechanisms of disease in frontotemporal lobar degeneration: gain of function versus loss of function effects.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogeneous. Three major proteins are implicated in its pathogenesis. About half of cases are characterized by depositions of the microtubule associated protein, tau (FTLD-tau). In most of the remaining cases, deposits of the transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein with Mw of 43 kDa, known as TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), are seen. Lastly, about 5-10 % of cases are characterized by abnormal accumulations of a third protein, fused in sarcoma (FTLD-FUS). Depending on the protein concerned, the signature accumulations can take the form of inclusion bodies (neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and neuronal intranuclear inclusions) or dystrophic neurites, in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and subcortex. In some instances, glial cells are also affected by inclusion body formation. In motor neurone disease (MND), TDP-43 or FUS inclusions can present within motor neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord. This present paper attempts to critically examine the role of such proteins in the pathogenesis of FTLD and MND as to whether they might exert a direct pathogenetic effect (gain of function), or simply act as relatively innocent witnesses to a more fundamental loss of function effect. We conclude that although there is strong evidence for both gain and loss of function effects in respect of each of the proteins concerned, in reality, it is likely that each is a single face of either side of the coin, and that both will play separate, though complementary, roles in driving the damage which ultimately leads to the downfall of neurons and clinical expression of disease.","['Halliday G', 'Bigio EH', 'Cairns NJ', 'Neumann M', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Mann DM']",2012,124,3,Acta Neuropathol,"Halliday G, et al.

22875087,Frontotemporal dementia due to C9ORF72 mutations: clinical and imaging features.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenotype of patients with C9FTD/ALS (C9ORF72) hexanucleotide repeat expansion.
METHODS: A total of 648 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-related clinical diagnoses and Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia were tested for C9ORF72 expansion and 31 carried expanded repeats (C9+). Clinical and neuroimaging data were compared between C9+ (15 behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD], 11 FTD-motor neuron disease [MND], 5 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS]) and sporadic noncarriers (48 bvFTD, 19 FTD-MND, 6 ALS).
RESULTS: All C9+ patients displayed clinical syndromes of bvFTD, ALS, or FTD-MND. At first evaluation, C9+ bvFTD patients had more delusions and greater impairment of working memory, but milder eating dysregulation compared to bvFTD noncarriers. C9+FTD-MND patients had a trend for longer survival and had an earlier age at onset than FTD-MND noncarriers. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated more thalamic atrophy in FTD and FTD-MND carriers than in noncarriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion develop bvFTD, ALS, or FTD-MND with similar clinical and imaging features to sporadic cases. Other FTD spectrum diagnoses and AD dementia appear rare or absent among C9+ individuals. Longer survival in C9+ FTD-MND suggests slower disease progression and thalamic atrophy represents a novel and unexpected feature.","['Sha SJ', 'Takada LT', 'Rankin KP', 'Yokoyama JS', 'Rutherford NJ', 'Fong JC', 'Khan B', 'Karydas A', 'Baker MC', 'DeJesus-Hernandez M', 'Pribadi M', 'Coppola G', 'Geschwind DH', 'Rademakers R', 'Lee SE', 'Seeley W', 'Miller BL', 'Boxer AL']",2012,79,10,Neurology,"Sha SJ, et al.

22868089,ATXN2 with intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats does not seem to be a risk factor in hereditary spastic paraplegia.,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) confines a group of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and lower limb weakness. Age of onset is highly variable even in familial cases with known mutations suggesting that the disease is modulated by other yet unknown parameters. Although progressive gait disturbances, lower limb spasticity and extensor plantar responses are hallmarks of HSP these characteristics are also found in other neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). HSP has been linked to ALS and frontotemporal degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), since TDP-43 positive inclusions have recently been found in an HSP subtype, and TDP-43 are found in abundance in pathological inclusions of both ALS and FTD-MND. Furthermore, ataxin-2 (encoded by the gene ATXN2), a polyglutamine containing protein elongated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, has been shown to be a modulator of TDP-43 induced toxicity in ALS animal and cell models. Finally, it has been shown that ATXN2 with non-pathogenic intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeat elongations (encoding the polyglutamine tract) is a genetic risk factor of ALS. Considering the similarities in the disease phenotype and the neuropathological link between ALS and HSP we hypothesized that intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 could be a modulator of HSP. We show that in a cohort of 181 HSP patients 4.9 % of the patients had intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 which was not significantly different from the frequencies in a Danish control cohort or in American and European control populations. However, the mean age of onset was significantly lower in HSP patients with intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 compared to patients with normal length repeats. Based on these results we conclude that ATXN2 is most likely not a risk factor of HSP, whereas it might serve as a modulator of age of onset.","['Nielsen TT', 'Svenstrup K', 'Budtz-Jørgensen E', 'Eiberg H', 'Hasholt L', 'Nielsen JE']",2012,321,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Nielsen TT, et al.

22819354,Balancing between autonomy and support: coping strategies by patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) makes a strong psychological impact, and the study of efforts by patients to cope with the course of the disease could be an important first step in the optimisation of care treatment. With this aim, in our study we assessed the coping strategies by a population of ALS patients, according to some clinical parameters and the worsening of the disease. We have administered the MND coping scale to 62 patients, firstly at the admission to our neurorehabilitation unit and secondly after 1year. Each factor score has been related to age and progression of the disease, and comparisons between males and females have also been made. The increasing relevance of seeking support from families and technological devices is probably the most interesting finding: such a result stimulates remarkable considerations about the proper balance between such support and patients' autonomy. As a whole, data confirm the importance of a proper and well-timed psychological intervention for patients and their families. In detail, improving adaptive coping strategies, together with sustaining those which tend to weaken along the progression of the disease, could be an important goal in psychological counselling for both patients and family members.","['Tramonti F', 'Bongioanni P', 'Fanciullacci C', 'Rossi B']",2012,320,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Tramonti F, et al.

22740043,Clinical and neuroimaging characteristics in neurodegenerative overlap syndrome.,"Neurodegenerative overlap syndrome has been considered as a wide spectrum of motor neuron disease (MND), parkinsonism, or dementia. Specially, clinically overt parkinsonism occurs more often than expected in patients with motor neuron disease (MND), and diverse clinical manifestations of concurrent parkinsonism have been reported. We aimed to clarify clinical and functional imaging characteristics in patients with combined MND and parkinsonism. Of 732 patients diagnosed with MND over 22 consecutive years, eight patients (all men; mean age 62.8 years) exhibited parkinsonism. According to their parkinsonian features and presence of other neurologic signs including dementia, extraocular movement abnormalities, and cerebellar or autonomic dysfunction, they were classified into two groups: MND-parkinsonism (MND-P, n = 5) and MND-parkinsonism-plus syndrome (MND-Plus, n = 3). In the MND-P group, parkinsonism was asymmetric, dominated by resting tremor, and responsive to levodopa. [(18)F] N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2β-carbon ethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) in two patients disclosed asymmetrically reduced uptakes in the dorsolateral putamen. In the MND-Plus group, parkinsonism was symmetric, with akinetic rigidity and postural instability dominance, and unresponsive to levodopa. [(18)F] FP-CIT PET scan in one patient showed decreased uptake in bilateral caudate nuclei and putamina. In conclusion, patients with MND and concurrent parkinsonism have heterogeneous clinical and imaging characteristics, which could be classified as features of PD and parkinsonism-plus syndrome. Patients with MND-P may have nigrostriatal dysfunction, and their parkinsonism may respond to levodopa treatment.","['Lim YM', 'Park HK', 'Kim JS', 'Lee CS', 'Chung SJ', 'Kim J', 'Kim KK']",2013,34,6,Neurol Sci,"Lim YM, et al.

22739338,Genetic analysis of SIGMAR1 as a cause of familial ALS with dementia.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron diseases (MND), while frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia. Many ALS families segregating FTLD have been reported, particularly over the last decade. Recently, mutations in TARDBP, FUS/TLS, and C9ORF72 have been identified in both ALS and FTLD patients, while mutations in VCP, a FTLD associated gene, have been found in ALS families. Distinct variants located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the SIGMAR1 gene were previously reported in three unrelated FTLD or FTLD-MND families. We directly sequenced the coding and UTR regions of the SIGMAR1 gene in a targeted cohort of 25 individual familial ALS cases of Caucasian origin with a history of cognitive impairments. This screening identified one variant in the 3'-UTR of the SIGMAR1 gene in one ALS patient, but the same variant was also observed in 1 out of 380 control chromosomes. Subsequently, we screened the same samples for a C9ORF72 repeat expansion: 52% of this cohort was found expanded, including the sample with the SIGMAR1 3'-UTR variant. Consequently, coding and noncoding variants located in the 3'-UTR region of the SIGMAR1 gene are not the cause of FTLD-MND in our cohort, and more than half of this targeted cohort is genetically explained by C9ORF72 repeat expansions.","['Belzil VV', 'Daoud H', 'Camu W', 'Strong MJ', 'Dion PA', 'Rouleau GA']",2013,21,2,Eur J Hum Genet,"Belzil VV, et al.

22731949,Motor neurone disease in molybdenum-deficient sheep fed the endogenous purine xanthosine: possible mechanism for Tribulus staggers.,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence of Tribulus terrestris motor neurone disease (MND) in sheep is linked with grazing Tribulus growing on cultivation paddocks. A previous survey found that the molybdenum (Mo) content of Tribulus growing on uncultivated soils in the Coonabarabran district of New South Wales was 3.03 ppm, but on cultivated soils it was <0.04 ppm. Tribulus contains the purine, xanthosine, which functions as a neuromodulator, and the catabolism of xanthosine is Mo-dependent.
DESIGN: To investigate the relationship between xanthosine ingestion and low Mo concentration, eight sheep were fed Mo-deficient lucerne chaff (<0.10 ppm), the Mo antagonist, sodium tungstate, and xanthosine (25 mg/kg/day) over 18 weeks and then returned to pasture.
RESULTS: Signs of MND developed in two sheep 30 months later and astrocyte degeneration occurred in all sheep.
CONCLUSION: The findings were similar to those observed in sheep with T. terrestris MND, suggesting that the combination of xanthosine ingestion and Mo deficiency may be the cause of this disorder.",['Bourke CA'],2012,90,7,Aust Vet J,Bourke CA.

22702520,Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy and chromosome 9p repeat expansion in C9ORF72: clinicopathologic correlation.,"Mutations in C9ORF72 resulting in expanded hexanucleotide repeats were recently reported to be the underlying genetic abnormality in chromosome 9p-linked frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43) proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). Several subsequent publications described the neuropathology as being similar to that of FTLD-TDP and ALS without C9ORF72 mutations, except that cases with mutations have p62 and ubiquitin positive, TDP-43 negative inclusions in cerebellum, hippocampus, neocortex, and basal ganglia. The identity of this protein is as yet unknown, and its significance is unclear. With the goal of potentially uncovering the significance of these inclusions, we compared the clinical, pathologic and genetic characteristics in cases with C9ORF72 mutations to those without. We confirmed the apparent specificity of p62 positive, TDP-43 negative inclusions to cases with C9ORF72 mutations. In hippocampus, these inclusions correlated with hippocampal atrophy. No additional correlations were uncovered. However, this is the first report to show that although most cases with C9ORF72 mutations were TDP type B, some of the pathologic characteristics in these cases were more similar to TDP types A and C than to type B cases. These include greater cortical and hippocampal atrophy, greater ventricular dilatation, more neuronal loss and gliosis in temporal lobe and striatum, and TDP-43 positive fine neuritic profiles in the hippocampus, implying that the C9ORF72 mutation modifies the pathologic phenotype of FTLD-TDP type B.","['Bigio EH', 'Weintraub S', 'Rademakers R', 'Baker M', 'Ahmadian SS', 'Rademaker A', 'Weitner BB', 'Mao Q', 'Lee KH', 'Mishra M', 'Ganti RA', 'Mesulam MM']",2013,33,2,Neuropathology,"Bigio EH, et al.

METHODS: The CSF pulsatile velocity anterior to the cervical cord at level C5 during one heart beat was determined non-invasively by phase-contrast electrocardiography-triggered magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: In MND, caudal CSF velocity peaked at 25% of the cardiac cycle after the R wave (UT(c)/RR), showing an increased delay in comparison to normal controls, while amplitude H(c) was significantly larger than that in CS.
DISCUSSION: We conclude that CSF flow dynamics of MND differ from those of controls and may thus facilitate differentiation of MND from CS.","['Sato K', 'Morimoto N', 'Matsuura T', 'Ohta Y', 'Tsunoda M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Abe K']",2012,34,5,Neurol Res,"Sato K, et al.

22649725,Handgrip maximal voluntary isometric contraction does not correlate with thenar motor unit number estimation.,"In slowly progressive conditions, such as motor neurone disease (MND), 50-80% of motor units may be lost before weakness becomes clinically apparent. Despite this, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) has been reported as a clinically useful, reliable, and reproducible measure for monitoring disease progression in MND. We performed a study on a group of asymptomatic subjects that showed a lack of correlation between isometric grip strength and thenar MUNE. Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) estimates the number of functioning lower motor neurones innervating a muscle or a group of muscles. We used the statistical electrophysiological technique of MUNE to estimate the number of motor units in thenar group of muscles in 69 subjects: 19 asymptomatic Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1) mutation carriers, 34 family controls, and 16 population controls. The Jamar hand dynamometer was used to measure isometric grip strength. This study suggests that MUNE is more sensitive for monitoring disease progression than maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), as MUNE correlates with the number of functional motor neurones. This supports the observation that patients with substantial chronic denervation can maintain normal muscle twitch tension until 50-80% of motor units are lost and weakness is detectable.",['Aggarwal A'],2012,2012,,Neurol Res Int,Aggarwal A.

22642305,The natural history of motor neuron disease: assessing the impact of specialist care.,"Many centres in the UK care for patients with motor neuron disease (MND) in a multidisciplinary clinic (MDC). It has been demonstrated that such care results in better prognosis for survival than care from a general neurology clinic (GNC). Whether this is due to higher use of disease-modifying interventions or an independent factor of attendance at a specialist clinic has not been established. Hence, we performed a retrospective review of hospital notes of patients with MND who were diagnosed and followed up in a GNC between 1998 and 2002 and in an MDC between 2006 and 2010. Overall, 162 patients attended a GNC, and 255 attended the MDC. The median survival from diagnosis was 19 months for patients who attended the MDC, compared to 11 months for those attending the GNC (hazard ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.41-0.64). The Cox hazards model identified attendance at an MDC as an independently positive prognostic factor (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37-2.72, p < 0.001). We concluded that care at an MDC improves survival. While this effect is augmented by the increased use of riluzole, NIV and PEG, the data suggest that coordinated care independently improves the prognosis of MND patients.","['Aridegbe T', 'Kandler R', 'Walters SJ', 'Walsh T', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ']",2013,14,1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,"Aridegbe T, et al.

22559076,Incidence of and risk factors for motor neurone disease in UK women: a prospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a severe neurodegenerative disease with largely unknown etiology. Most epidemiological studies are hampered by small sample sizes and/or the retrospective collection of information on behavioural and lifestyle factors.
METHODS: 1.3 million women from the UK Million Women Study, aged 56 years on average at recruitment, were followed up for incident and/or fatal MND using NHS hospital admission and mortality data. Adjusted relative risks were calculated using Cox regression models.
FINDINGS: During follow-up for an average of 9·2 years, 752 women had a new diagnosis of MND. Age-specific rates increased with age, from 1·9 (95% CI 1·3 - 2·7) to 12·5 (95% CI 10·2 - 15·3) per 100,000 women aged 50-54 to 70-74, respectively, giving a cumulative risk of diagnosis with the disease of 1·74 per 1000 women between the ages of 50 and 75 years. There was no significant variation in risk of MND with region of residence, socio-economic status, education, height, alcohol use, parity, use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Ever-smokers had about a 20% greater risk than never smokers (RR 1·19 95% CI 1·02 to 1·38, p = 0·03). There was a statistically significant reduction in risk of MND with increasing body mass index (p(for trend) = 0·009): obese women (body mass index, 30 kg/m(2) or more) had a 20% lower risk than women of normal body mass index (20 to <25 Kg/m(2))(RR 0·78 95% CI 0·65-0·94; p = 0·03). This effect persisted after exclusion of the first three years of follow-up.
INTERPRETATION: MND incidence in UK women rises rapidly with age, and an estimated 1 in 575 women are likely to be affected between the ages of 50 and 75 years. Smoking slightly increases the risk of MND, and adiposity in middle age is associated with a lower risk of the disease.","['Doyle P', 'Brown A', 'Beral V', 'Reeves G', 'Green J']",2012,12,,BMC Neurol,"Doyle P, et al.

22541253,The frontotemporal dementias in a tertiary referral center: classification and demographic characteristics in a series of 232 cases.,"BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) comprises of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) with its 3 main variants, namely nonfluent/agrammatic (naPPA), semantic (svPPA) and logopenic (lvPPA). Recently a clinical syndrome with predominant right temporal atrophy was recognized (rvFTD). FTLD often overlaps with parkinsonism plus syndromes such as corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), as well as with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). While FTLD syndromes were thought to be rare and difficult to diagnose ante mortem, revised diagnostic criteria as well as recent studies highlighted the plausibility of accurate clinical diagnosis.
METHODS: 232 FTLD patients were assessed from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2010 in the Neurology Department of a tertiary referral center. Patients were classified as bvFTD, naPPA, svPPA, lvPPA, CBD/PSP and rvFTD and their demographic characteristics were analyzed.
RESULTS: From the 232 patients, 111 (47.8%) were diagnosed with bvFTD, 56 (24.1%) with naPPA, 21 (9.1%) with svPPA, 6 (2.6%) with lvPPA, 20 (8.6%) with CBD or PSP and 18 (7.8%) with rvFTD. 44% of the patients were under 65 years old at onset of symptoms, while only 4.3% reported family history of dementia. FTLD subgroups did not differ with respect to demographic characteristics, but early onset cases had higher educational level.
DISCUSSION: FTLD represents a syndrome with different but clinically distinguishable phenotypes. Cultural, educational and socioeconomic status differences might regulate patients' access to medical care and therefore influence age of reported onset and prevalence of FTLD in clinical studies. High clinical alertness and sensitive neuropsychological tests could lead to timely clinical diagnosis in a common presenile type of dementia.","['Ioannidis P', 'Konstantinopoulou E', 'Maiovis P', 'Karacostas D']",2012,318,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Ioannidis P, et al.

22533463,Predictors of emergent feeding tubes and tracheostomies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).,"Predictable decline in ALS makes unplanned gastrostomy and tracheostomy avoidable. We determined whether gastrostomy or tracheostomy insertion during emergent hospitalization is associated with patient or hospital characteristics, changed Medicare policy in 2001, or proximity to specialized ALS care. We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalizations and procedures for ALS/MND patients in Pennsylvania between 1996 and 2009. We identified predictors of gastrostomy/tracheostomy during emergent hospitalization and trends over time. Patients underwent 1748 gastrostomies and 373 tracheostomies. Thirty-two percent of gastrostomies and 67% of tracheostomies were placed emergently. Emergent hospitalizations involving gastrostomy were more expensive with fewer home discharges. Black patients and Medicaid patients had higher odds of emergent gastrostomy placement. Conversely, academic hospital affiliation decreased odds of emergent gastrostomy or tracheostomy placement (AOR 0.49, AOR 0.37, p < 0.001). After Medicare policy changes, gastrostomy use increased, while emergent gastrostomies decreased. Surprisingly, proximity to specialized care was associated with increased emergent gastrostomy placement. In conclusion, black patients and Medicaid patients were more likely to undergo emergent gastrostomy insertion. Patients receiving gastrostomy during emergent admissions had fewer home discharges and higher costs. Academic hospital affiliation decreased odds of emergent gastrostomy or tracheostomy. After Medicare changes broadening access, while gastrostomy use increased, the proportion of emergent procedures decreased.","['Tsou AY', 'Karlawish J', 'McCluskey L', 'Xie SX', 'Long JA']",2012,13,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Tsou AY, et al.

Several characteristics of ALS among Africans or subjects of African origin were identified: (i) lower incidence rates among people of African origin living in western countries, (ii) higher incidence of classic ALS among men, (iii) presence of juvenile form, (iv) younger age at onset of classic ALS. We cannot draw firm conclusions about (i) the prognosis in African ALS patients, (ii) prognostic factors, (iii) genetic or behavioral factors affecting incidence or clinical phenotype.

22513921,Treatment for cramps in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Cramps are painful, involuntary muscle contractions. They commonly affect people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) at all stages of the disease. To date, the treatment of muscle cramps in ALS has been largely empirical without any evidence from randomised controlled trials.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically assess the effect of interventions on muscle cramps as a primary or secondary endpoint or adverse event in people with ALS/MND.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (14 February 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2011 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011) and reference lists of articles searched using the terms motor neuron disease, motor neurone disease, motoneuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We contacted authors of trials for further information.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials of oral medications in people with ALS which assessed cramps as a primary or secondary outcome measure or as an adverse event. We also included trials using subcutaneous or intravenous medications or physical therapy.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All authors applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality independently, and all authors performed independent data extraction.
MAIN RESULTS: Twenty studies including 4789 participants were identified. Only one trial, of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), assessed cramps as the primary endpoint. Thirteen studies assessed cramps as a secondary endpoint. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L-threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six studies assessed cramps as an adverse event. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine, and lithium. In all 20 studies no favourable effect for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND could be demonstrated, but many studies were underpowered to draw a definite conclusion. A meta-analysis of two small studies showed a statistically nonsignificant result for the amino acid L-threonine for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND. No study was identified using physical therapy as a therapeutic intervention for cramps.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support the use of any intervention for muscle cramps in ALS/MND. More and larger randomised controlled trials evaluating treatments for muscle cramps in ALS/MND are needed.","['Baldinger R', 'Katzberg HD', 'Weber M']",2012,,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Baldinger R, et al.

22512686,"Dying with motor neurone disease, what can we learn from family caregivers?","BACKGROUND: Increasingly, people with neurodegenerative illness are cared for at home until close to death. Yet, discussing the reality of dying remains a social taboo.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the ways, family caregivers of people living with motor neurone disease (MND) experienced the dying of their relative and to identify how health practitioners can better prepare families for end-of-life care.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis was undertaken on data sets generated from two longitudinal qualitative studies employing similar data collection and analysis methods. Combining data sets increased participant numbers in a low incidence disease group.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Primary studies were undertaken with family caregivers in England and Australia. Interview and observational data were collected mostly in home. Participants who discussed dying and death formed the sample for secondary analysis.
RESULTS: Combined data revealed four major themes: planning for end of life, unexpected dying, dignity in the dying body and positive end to MND. Despite short survival predictions, discussions among family members about dying were often sporadic and linked to loss of hope. Effective planning for death assisted caregivers to manage the final degenerative processes of dying. When plans were not effectively communicated or enacted, capacity to preserve personhood was reduced.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Returning death and dying to social discourse will raise the level of community awareness and normalize conversations about end-of-life care. Strategies for on-going, effective communication that facilitates advance care planning among patients, their families and practitioners are essential to improve dying and death for people with MND and their family caregivers.","['Ray RA', 'Brown J', 'Street AF']",2014,17,4,Health Expect,"Ray RA, et al.

Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), derived from the apoE ϵ4 allele, enhances brain atrophy in FTLD through unknown mechanisms. Here, we studied two siblings with C9ORF72-linked familial FTLD-MND, an apoE ϵ4 homozygote and an apoE ϵ3 homozygote. The apoE ϵ4 homozygote had more cognitive-behavioral symptoms, fronto-insulo-temporal atrophy, and apoE fragments and aggregates in the anterior cingulate cortex. ApoE formed complexes with TDP-43 that were more abundant in the apoE ϵ4 homozygote. Although differences seen in a sibling pair could arise due to chance, these findings raise the possibility that apoE4 exacerbates brain pathology in FTLD through formation of neurotoxic apoE fragments and interactions with TDP-43.","['Vossel KA', 'Bien-Ly N', 'Bernardo A', 'Rascovsky K', 'Karydas A', 'Rabinovici GD', 'Sidhu M', 'Huang EJ', 'Miller BL', 'Huang Y', 'Seeley WW']",2013,19,3,Neurocase,"Vossel KA, et al.

22435076,Neuroimaging of motor neuron diseases.,"It is agreed that conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine is one of the core elements in the differential diagnostic work up of patients with clinical signs of motor neuron diseases (MNDs), for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to exclude MND mimics. However, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI signs in these disorders are moderate to low and do not have an evidence level higher than class IV (good clinical practice point). Currently computerized MRI analyses in ALS and other MNDs are not techniques used for individual diagnosis. However, they have improved the anatomical understanding of pathomorphological alterations in gray and white matter in various MNDs and the changes in functional networks by quantitative comparisons between patients with MND and controls at group level. For multiparametric MRI protocols, including T1-weighted three-dimensional datasets, diffusion-weighted imaging and functional MRI, the potential as a 'dry' surrogate marker is a subject of investigation in natural history studies with well defined patients. The additional value of MRI with respect to early diagnosis at an individual level and for future disease-modifying multicentre trials remains to be defined. There is still the need for more longitudinal studies in the very early stages of disease or when there is clinical uncertainty and for better standardization in the acquisition and postprocessing of computer-based MRI data. These requirements are to be addressed by establishing quality-controlled multicentre neuroimaging databases.","['Kassubek J', 'Ludolph AC', 'Müller HP']",2012,5,2,Ther Adv Neurol Disord,"Kassubek J, et al.

The American Academy of Neurology evidence based method for classification of evidence for inferring causality and assigning level of conclusion was used. Twelve of 14 articles published since 1980 met the inclusion criteria. One class II article and three class III articles showed an association between a single instance of head trauma and ALS that did not exceed what might be seen due to chance alone. Eight class IV evidence articles could not inform conclusions. We concluded that evidence based analysis of the epidemiologic literature does not permit concluding that a single instance of head trauma is a risk factor for, or causes, ALS (Level U conclusion).","['Armon C', 'Nelson LM']",2012,13,4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,Armon C and Nelson LM.

22424127,A systematic review of behavioural changes in motor neuron disease.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) and the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are thought to be part of a disease spectrum. There is uncertainty about the frequency and characteristics of behavioural changes in MND, and similarly, about a relation between bvFTD and the site of onset of MND. Our aim was to perform a systematic review of the publications on behavioural changes in MND. An extensive search for articles on behavioural changes in MND patients was performed. First, cohort studies of MND patients were reviewed to summarize the prevalence of bvFTD and mild behavioural changes. Secondly, data on bvFTD symptoms (mostly from case reports) of individual MND-bvFTD patients were used to analyse characteristics and pooled prevalences of bvFTD symptoms. In addition, site of onset, survival and demographic variables of MND-bvFTD patients were analysed. Results showed that in cohorts, 8.1% (95% CI 5.6 - 11.5%) of MND patients had bvFTD. In 170 individual patients with MND-bvFTD, perseveration (40%), apathy (29%) and disinhibition (26%) were the most frequently reported behavioural changes; 43% had memory disturbances and bulbar onset was found in 48%. In conclusion, 8% of MND patients have bvFTD, with perseveration being reported most frequently. MND-bvFTD is often accompanied by memory disturbances and is related to bulbar onset.","['Raaphorst J', 'Beeldman E', 'De Visser M', 'De Haan RJ', 'Schmand B']",2012,13,6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Raaphorst J, et al.

22419278,Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND).,"BACKGROUND: Riluzole is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in most countries. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost and modest efficacy.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival, and to assess the effect of riluzole upon functional health.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (20 April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011) and made enquiries of authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: randomized controlled trials
TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One author performed data extraction and two other authors checked them. One author checked the data and entered them into the computer. The other authors verified the data entry. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible.
MAIN RESULTS: The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole-treated patients and 503 placebo-treated patients. No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P= 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P < 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P= 0.046). This represented a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49% in the placebo and 58% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.31).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","['Miller RG', 'Mitchell JD', 'Moore DH']",2012,2012,3,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Miller RG, et al.

22409361,Neuroanatomical patterns of cerebral white matter involvement in different motor neuron diseases as studied by diffusion tensor imaging analysis.,"This study was designed to investigate differences of white matter (WM) involvement patterns in various motor neuron disorders (MND) by use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).DTI was acquired in ALS (n = 20), primary lateral sclerosis (n = 20), pure hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) (n = 20), and complicated HSP (n = 12). The data analysis was performed by voxelwise comparison of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps at group level together with fibre tracking in regions of interest (ROI) accompanied by tractwise fractional anisotropy statistics. DTI analysis revealed widespread patterns of alterations with a predominant deterioration of the motor system. These alterations encompassed, as the key structures, not only the corticospinal tracts (CST) but also distinct areas of the corpus callosum (CC), in particular its motor segment III. In conclusion, whole brain-based and tract-based DTI analysis was able to define a distinct WM pathoanatomy of different MND. These results may serve as an additional guidance in the identification of MRI-based parameters by showing a consistent CST and CC involvement, with differences in the extent of pathology, across a range of clinically different disorders. For potential future developments in MRI diagnostics in MND, a (perhaps multiparametric) ROI-based approach should include CST and the CC motor segment.","['Müller HP', 'Unrath A', 'Huppertz HJ', 'Ludolph AC', 'Kassubek J']",2012,13,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Müller HP, et al.

22353375,Cognitive and affective impairments of a novel SCA/MND crossroad mutation Asidan.,"BACKGROUND: A variety of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) develops a broad spectrum of both ataxia and non-ataxia symptoms. Cognitive and affective changes are one such non-ataxia symptoms, but have been described only in hereditary SCAs with exonic CAG gene expansion.
METHODS: We newly found intronic hexanucleotide GGCCTG gene expansion in NOP56 gene as the causative mutation (=SCA36) in nine unrelated Japanese familial SCA originating from Asida river area in the western part of Japan, thus nicknamed Asidan for this mutation. These patients show unique clinical balance of cerebellar ataxia and motor neuron disease (MND), locating on the crossroad of these two diseases. In the nine families, 14 patients were clinically examined and genetically confirmed to Asidan. In the present study, we examined cognitive and affective analyses on 12 patients (seven men and five women) who agreed to join the examination with average age at onset of 53.1 ± 3.2 years, average duration of 12.1 ± 5.2 years, and current average age at 65.1 ± 6.2 years.
RESULTS: The 12 Asidan patients demonstrated a significant decrease in their frontal executive functions measured by frontal assessment battery (FAB) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) compared with age- and gender-matched controls, whilst mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Hasegawa dementia score-revised (HDS-R) were within normal range. The decline of frontal executive function was related to their disease duration and scale for the assessment and rating of ataxias (SARA). They also demonstrated mild depression and apathy. Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) analysis showed that these Asidan patients showed decline of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in a particular areas of cerebral cortices such as Brodmann areas 24 and 44-46.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the patients with Asidan mutation show unique cognitive and affective characteristics different from other hereditary SCAs with exonal CAG expansion or MND.","['Abe K', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kurata T', 'Ohta Y', 'Manabe Y', 'Okamoto M', 'Takamatsu K', 'Ohta T', 'Takao Y', 'Shiro Y', 'Shoji M', 'Kamiya T', 'Kobayashi H', 'Koizumi A']",2012,19,8,Eur J Neurol,"Abe K, et al.

22332970,Fulminant multifocal motor neuropathy: a report of two cases.,"Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) shows stepwise progression over decades. The multifocal weakness usually remains asymmetric, confined to distal limb muscles, while sparing cranial, phrenic, and sensory nerves. One electrophysiological hallmark is partial motor conduction block (CB) at sites not exposed to compression; whether CB is an essential feature remains debatable. High titer of anti-GM1 antibodies is found with figures usually between 40% and 50% of patients. Intravenous immuneglobulin (IVIg) is effective in almost 80%, but plasmapheresis and steroids are not. The condition is reported as lethal exceptionally, mimicking motor neuron diseases (MND). We have studied two patients who failed to respond to treatment and who died with respiratory failure; one of the two had high titer of IgM antibody to the ganglioside GM1. Our cases confirm that great attention should be paid in order to define the borderland between MMN and MND and the entity of their clinical and electrophysiological overlaps.","['Galassi G', 'Girolami F', 'Ariatti A', 'Monelli M', 'Sola P']",2012,122,7,Int J Neurosci,"Galassi G, et al.

22302912,Reviewing evidences on the management of patients with motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To review evidences on the management of patients with motor neuron disease.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed literature searches from January 1982 up to January 2011.
STUDY SELECTION: Key words for literature search were ""motor neuron disease review (MND)"". Only the articles which concentrated on the ventilation, nutrition, cognitive or multidisciplinary approaches for motor neuron disease were included. Case reports were not included in the review. In addition, publications were identified using the World Wide Web from references in these papers. Only articles in English were considered.
DATA EXTRACTION: A total of 782 articles were retrieved using the key word search, of which 72 concentrated on ventilation, nutrition, cognitive or multidisciplinary approaches. From these, 43 articles were eventually included and formed the basis of this review.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Motor neuron disease is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that leads to weakness of limb, bulbar, and respiratory muscles. It displays an ethnic variation in incidence; 90% of cases are sporadic and 10% are familial. New diagnostic criteria have been proposed to increase diagnostic sensitivity. Proper clinical studies, electrophysiology, and neuroimaging are necessary before reaching a diagnosis of motor neuron disease. Riluzole remains the only disease-modifying drug approved for this disease; it prolongs life by 3 to 4 months. Multidisciplinary care units are important in the management of motor neuron disease patients. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation prolongs life in motor neuron disease patients with respiratory failure. Enteral feeding is usually recommended for affected patients with malnutrition. Cognitive impairment is common in these patients, for whom a formal neuropsychiatric assessment is recommended. Appropriate palliative care is needed for these patients in order to improve their quality of dying.
CONCLUSION: Motor neuron disease is an incurable disease, for which a highly effective treatment is still pending. Symptomatic treatment remains the mainstay of management. A multidisciplinary approach embracing advances in non-invasive ventilation and gastrostomy can improve quality of life and extend the survival of motor neuron disease patients.",['Lee CN'],2012,18,1,Hong Kong Med J,Lee CN.

22292844,The impact of perceived lack of support provided by health and social care services to caregivers of people with motor neuron disease.,"Our objective was to investigate the relationship between support by health and social care services and caregiver well-being. A survey, including a generic health status measure (SF-12), a disease-specific measure for patients (ALSAQ-40), the Carer Strain Index (CSI) for caregivers and questions on experiences of health and social care services, was sent to patient members of the MND Association (UK) and their caregivers. A single 'problem score' was calculated from the experience questions and the relationship between the problem score with caregiver and patient well-being was analysed. Most caregivers reported at least one problem with support from services. The most common problems were services not valuing caregivers' experiences, and caregivers not feeling sufficiently involved in planning care. The problem score significantly increased with increasing caregiver strain and worsening mental health. The problem score was also increased as patient well-being decreased. The results suggest that caregiver strain was higher and mental health lower as the number of problems reported increased. A higher perceived lack of caregiver support was also related to a decrease in patient well-being, suggesting that caregivers' needs increase as the disease progresses. This emphasizes the importance of MND caregivers being appropriately supported by health and social care services in their caregiving role.","['Peters M', 'Fitzpatrick R', 'Doll H', 'Playford ED', 'Jenkinson C']",2012,13,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Peters M, et al.

22258985,Interventions for fatigue and weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness.,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue and unintentional weight loss are two of the commonest symptoms experienced by people with advanced progressive illness. Appropriate interventions may bring considerable improvements in function and quality of life to seriously ill people and their families, reducing physical, psychological and spiritual distress.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct an overview of the evidence available on the efficacy of interventions used in the management of fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness by reviewing the evidence contained within Cochrane reviews.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) for all systematic reviews evaluating any interventions for the management of fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 8). We reviewed titles of interest by abstract. Where the relevance of a review remained unclear we reached a consensus regarding the relevance of the participant group and the outcome measures to the overview. Two overview authors extracted the data independently using a data extraction form. We used the measurement tool AMSTAR (Assessment of Multiple SysTemAtic Reviews) to assess the methodological quality of each systematic review.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 27 systematic reviews (302 studies with 31,833 participants) in the overview. None of the included systematic reviews reported quantitative data on the efficacy of interventions to manage fatigue or weight loss specific to people with advanced progressive illness. All of the included reviews apart from one were deemed of high methodological quality. For the remaining review we were unable to ascertain the methodological quality of the research strategy as it was described. None of the systematic reviews adequately described whether conflict of interests were present within the included studies.Management of fatigue Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) - we identified one systematic review (two studies and 52 participants); the intervention was exercise.Cancer - we identified five systematic reviews (116 studies with 17,342 participants); the pharmacological interventions were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and any drug therapy for the management of cancer-related fatigue and the non pharmacological interventions were exercise, interventions by breast care nurses and psychosocial interventions.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - we identified three systematic reviews (59 studies and 4048 participants); the interventions were self management education programmes, nutritional support and pulmonary rehabilitation.Cystic fibrosis - we identified one systematic review (nine studies and 833 participants); the intervention was physical training.Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) - we identified two systematic reviews (21 studies and 748 participants); the interventions were progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise.Multiple sclerosis (MS) - we identified five systematic reviews (23 studies and 1502 participants); the pharmacological interventions were amantadine and carnitine. The non pharmacological interventions were diet, exercise and occupational therapy.Mixed conditions in advanced stages of illness - we identified one systematic review (five studies and 453 participants); the intervention was medically assisted hydration.Management of weight loss ALS/MND - we identified one systematic review but no studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review; the intervention was enteral tube feeding.Cancer - we identified three systematic reviews with a fourth systematic review also containing extractable data on cancer (66 studies and 5601 participants); the pharmacological interventions were megestrol acetate and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (this systematic review is also included in the cancer fatigue section above). The non pharmacological interventions were enteral tube feeding and non invasive interventions for patients with lung cancer.COPD - we identified one systematic review (59 studies and 4048 participants); the intervention was nutritional support. This systematic review is also included in the COPD fatigue section.Cystic fibrosis - we identified two systematic reviews (three studies and 131 participants); the interventions were enteral tube feeding and oral calorie supplements.HIV/AIDS - we identified four systematic reviews (42 studies and 2071 participants); the pharmacological intervention was anabolic steroids. The non pharmacological interventions were nutritional interventions, progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise. Both of the systematic reviews on exercise interventions were also included in the HIV/AIDS fatigue section.MS - we found no systematic reviews which considered interventions to manage unintentional weight loss for people with a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis at any stage of illness.Mixed conditions in advanced stages of illness - we identified two systematic reviews (32 studies and 4826 participants); the interventions were megestrol acetate and medically assisted nutrition.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of robust evidence for interventions to manage fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in the advanced stage of progressive illnesses such as advanced cancer, heart failure, lung failure, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia and AIDS. The evidence contained within this overview provides some insight into interventions which may prove of benefit within this population such as exercise, some pharmacological treatments and support for self management.Researchers could improve the methodological quality of future studies by blinding of outcome assessors. Adopting uniform reporting mechanisms for fatigue and weight loss outcome measures would also allow the opportunity for meta-analysis of small studies.Researchers could also improve the applicability of recommendations for interventions to manage fatigue and unintentional weight loss in advanced progressive illness by including subgroup analysis of this population within systematic reviews of applicable interventions.More research is required to ascertain the best interventions to manage fatigue and/or weight loss in advanced illness. There is a need for standardised reporting of these symptoms and agreement amongst researchers of the minimum duration of studies and minimum percentage change in symptom experience that proves the benefits of an intervention. There are, however, challenges in providing meaningful outcome measurements against a background of deteriorating health through disease progression. Interventions to manage these symptoms must also be mindful of the impact on quality of life and should be focused on patient-orientated rather than purely disease-orientated experiences for patients. Systematic reviews and primary intervention studies should include the impact of the interventions on standardised validated quality of life measures.","['Payne C', 'Wiffen PJ', 'Martin S']",2012,1,,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Payne C, et al.

22249015,Activities of daily living in motor neuron disease: role of behavioural and motor changes.,"Impairment in the activities of daily living (ADL) in motor neuron disease (MND) has been little investigated. The contributions of both behavioural and motor changes on functional performance have not been explored. A postal survey in New South Wales, Australia, included assessments of ADL, behavioural change (carer-based) and MND severity. Eighty-two patients were subdivided into groups according to onset presentation: bulbar (n=23) and limb (n=59). There were significant differences in ADL performance between limb and bulbar onset groups depending on ADL task. Disability was also dependent on disease severity as measured by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS - R) score. Importantly, variance in ADL scores was dependent on both motor and behavioural factors. This study confirms the progressive disabling nature of MND, which is dependent on disease severity and shows qualitative differences depending on onset presentation. A model combining motor and behavioural changes explained 57% of variance on ADL performance, with important implications for clinical intervention.","['Mioshi E', 'Lillo P', 'Kiernan M', 'Hodges J']",2012,19,4,J Clin Neurosci,"Mioshi E, et al.

22246890,Chorea-acanthocytosis presenting as motor neuron disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by involuntary movements, seizures, cognitive changes, myopathy, and axonal neuropathy.
METHODS: We report a patient who presented with gait impairment and dysarthria. Clinical and neurophysiological assessment disclosed upper and lower motor neuron signs suggestive of motor neuron disease (MND).
RESULTS: Later observation of involuntary movements prompted further investigation. Acanthocytes were identified, and the patient's chorein level was low. Genetic studies identified a novel double heterozygous mutation of the chorein gene involving an exon-stop mutation associated with another mutation that can affect the normal splicing of the RNA.
CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that this genetic mutation could cause the atypical presentation. ChAc should be included in the differential diagnosis of atypical MND.","['Neutel D', 'Miltenberger-Miltenyi G', 'Silva I', 'de Carvalho M']",2012,45,2,Muscle Nerve,"Neutel D, et al.

22214356,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia: A behavioural and cognitive continuum.,"Our objective was to compare the cognitive and behavioural profile of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and to explore the continuum between these disorders according to neuropsychological and behavioural performance using novel methods of testing and analysis. Twenty patients with ALS, 20 bvFTD patients and 20 healthy controls completed a neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment including cognitive screening, working memory, inhibitory control, decision making and emotion recognition. The resulting neuropsychological and behavioural data were analysed by Rasch analysis. ALS patients showed a similar profile to bvFTD patients on tests of working memory, inhibitory control and behavioural measures. Nine ALS patients (45%) had cognitive impairment and five (25%) met criteria for bvFTD. Even in a subset of MND patients with no impairment on the ACE-R, subtle impairment of inhibitory control together with moderate to severe apathy, were found. The Rasch analysis confirmed that all patients could be ranked on the same continuum, based on their neuropsychological performance and behaviour. Thus, the cognitive and behavioural profiles of ALS mirror those seen in bvFTD. Impaired inhibitory control and behavioural changes suggest subtle orbitofrontal dysfunction in ALS. The Rasch analysis revealed a clear overlap between bvFTD and ALS.","['Lillo P', 'Savage S', 'Mioshi E', 'Kiernan MC', 'Hodges JR']",2012,13,1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Lillo P, et al.

22181065,"An MND/ALS phenotype associated with C9orf72 repeat expansion: abundant p62-positive, TDP-43-negative inclusions in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum but without associated cognitive decline.","The transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) proteinopathies describe a clinico-pathological spectrum of multi-system neurodegeneration that spans motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). We have identified four male patients who presented with the clinical features of a pure MND/ALS phenotype (without dementia) but who had distinctive cortical and cerebellar pathology that was different from other TDP-43 proteinopathies. All patients initially presented with weakness of limbs and respiratory muscles and had a family history of MND/ALS. None had clinically identified cognitive decline or dementia during life and they died between 11 and 32 months after symptom onset. Neuropathological investigation revealed lower motor neuron involvement with TDP-43-positive inclusions typical of MND/ALS. In contrast, the cerebral pathology was atypical, with abundant star-shaped p62-immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and hippocampus, while TDP-43-positive inclusions were sparse. This pattern was also seen in the cerebellum where p62-positive, TDP-43-negative inclusions were frequent in granular cells. Western blots of cortical lysates, in contrast to those of sporadic MND/ALS and FTLD-TDP, showed high p62 levels and low TDP-43 levels with no high molecular weight smearing. MND/ALS-associated SOD1, FUS and TARDBP gene mutations were excluded; however, further investigations revealed that all four of the cases did show a repeat expansion of C9orf72, the recently reported cause of chromosome 9-linked MND/ALS and FTLD. We conclude that these chromosome 9-linked MND/ALS cases represent a pathological sub-group with abundant p62 pathology in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum but with no significant associated cognitive decline.","['Troakes C', 'Maekawa S', 'Wijesekera L', 'Rogelj B', 'Siklós L', 'Bell C', 'Smith B', 'Newhouse S', 'Vance C', 'Johnson L', 'Hortobágyi T', 'Shatunov A', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Leigh N', 'Shaw CE', 'King A', 'Al-Sarraj S']",2012,32,5,Neuropathology,"Troakes C, et al.

22137979,Value of muscle enzyme measurement in evaluating different neuromuscular diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Muscle enzymes sometimes can provide clues for many similar neuromuscular disorders. However literatures that described and compared the muscle enzyme levels among these diseases are few. We described their changes in a group of Chinese patients.
METHODS: We reviewed creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST) levels and CK/lDH in Chinese patients with Duchene/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), polymyositis (PM), lipid storage myopathy (LSM), motor neuron disease (MND) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The diagnosis of DMD/BMD, FSHD, LSM and SMA was confirmed by genetic analysis. Comparisons between groups were tested by One-Way ANOVA analysis and LSD test.
RESULTS: CK: DMD/BMD>PM>LGMD>LSM>FSHD>MND>SMA. LDH and AST: DMD/BMD>LSM>PM>LGMD>FSHD>SMA>MND. For MND, logCK in PMA is the highest. For SMA, logCK value in type III is the highest. LDH disproportionately elevates in LSM and SMA.
CONCLUSION: This investigation described muscle enzyme profiles in a large cohort of Chinese patients with neuromuscular diseases. Muscle enzyme values may have some implications for making decision when the diagnosis is hard.","['Zhang Y', 'Huang JJ', 'Wang ZQ', 'Wang N', 'Wu ZY']",2012,413,3-4,Clin Chim Acta,"Zhang Y, et al.

22133357,Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to model human neuromuscular connectivity: promise or reality?,"Motor neuron diseases (MND) such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy are devastating, progressive and ultimately fatal diseases for which there are no effective treatments. Recent evidence from systematic studies of animal models and human patients suggests that the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an important early target in MND, demonstrating functional and structural abnormalities in advance of pathological changes occurring in the motor neuron cell body. The ability to study pathological changes occurring at the NMJ in humans is therefore likely to be important for furthering our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and also for designing and testing new therapeutics. However, there are many practical and technical reasons why it is not possible to visualise or record from NMJs in pre- and early-symptomatic MND patients in vivo. Other approaches are therefore required. The development of stem cell technologies has opened up the possibility of creating human NMJs in vitro, using pluripotent cells generated from healthy individuals and patients with MND. This review covers historical attempts to develop mature and functional NMJs in vitro, using co-cultures of muscle and nerve from animals, and discusses how recent developments in the generation and specification of human induced pluripotent stem cells provides an opportunity to build on these previous successes to recapitulate human neuromuscular connectivity in vitro.","['Thomson SR', 'Wishart TM', 'Patani R', 'Chandran S', 'Gillingwater TH']",2012,220,2,J Anat,"Thomson SR, et al.

22125427,An overview of DNA repair in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is an adult onset neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the degeneration of cortical and spinal cord motor neurons, resulting in progressive muscular weakness and death. Increasing evidence supports mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative DNA damage in ALS motor neurons. Several DNA repair enzymes are activated following DNA damage to restore genome integrity, and impairments in DNA repair capabilities could contribute to motor neuron degeneration. After a brief description of the evidence of DNA damage in ALS, this paper focuses on the available data on DNA repair activity in ALS neuronal tissue and disease animal models. Moreover, biochemical and genetic data on DNA repair in ALS are discussed in light of similar findings in other neurodegenerative diseases.",['Coppedè F'],2011,11,,ScientificWorldJournal,Coppedè F.

This preliminary study aims to identify relevant personal factors affecting the experience of living with MND from the perspective of persons with MND (pwMND) in an Australian cohort. A prospective cross-sectional survey of pwMND (n = 44) using an open-ended questionnaire identified personal factors that were categorised thematically. Standardised questionnaires assessed disease severity: depression, anxiety, and stress and coping strategies. Personal factors identified included demographic factors (socioeconomic status), emotional states (depression, anxiety, and fear), coping strategies (problem-based coping and denial), personality, beliefs (religious and personal values), attitudes (of the patient), and others (such as perceived support). An understanding of personal factors by treating clinicians is essential in the provision of optimal care in MND. This study may assist in the development of personal factors within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health for improved consensus of care and communication amongst treating clinicians.","['Ng L', 'Khan F']",2011,2011,,Rehabil Res Pract,Ng L and Khan F.

22107756,Development of a patient reported outcome measure for fatigue in motor neurone disease: the Neurological Fatigue Index (NFI-MND).,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this research was to develop a disease-specific measure for fatigue in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) by generating data that would fit the Rasch measurement model. Fatigue was defined as reversible motor weakness and whole-body tiredness that was predominantly brought on by muscular exertion and was partially relieved by rest.
METHODS: Qualitative interviews were undertaken to confirm the suitability of a previously identified set of 52 neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. Patients were recruited from five U.K. MND clinics. Questionnaires were administered during clinic or by post. A sub-sample of patients completed the questionnaire again after 2-4 weeks to assess test-retest validity. Exploratory factor analyses and Rasch analysis were conducted on the item set.
RESULTS: Qualitative interviews with ten MND patients confirmed the suitability of 52 previously identified neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. 298 patients consented to completing the initial questionnaire including this item set, with an additional 78 patients completing the questionnaire a second time after 4-6 weeks. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified five potential subscales that could be conceptualised as representing: 'Energy', 'Reversible muscular weakness' (shortened to 'Weakness'), 'Concentration', 'Effects of heat' and 'Rest'. Of the original five factors, two factors 'Energy' and 'Weakness' met the expectations of the Rasch model. A higher order fatigue summary scale, consisting of items from the 'Energy' and 'Weakness' subscales, was found to fit the Rasch model and have acceptable unidimensionality. The two scales and the higher order summary scale were shown to fulfil model expectations, including assumptions of unidimensionality, local independency and an absence of differential item functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: The Neurological Fatigue Index for MND (NFI-MND) is a simple, easy-to-administer fatigue scale. It consists of an 8-item fatigue summary scale in addition to separate scales for measuring fatigue experienced as reversible muscular weakness and fatigue expressed as feelings of low energy and whole body tiredness. The underlying two factor structure supports the patient concept of fatigue derived from qualitative interviews in this population. All three scales were shown to be reliable and capable of interval level measurement.","['Gibbons CJ', 'Mills RJ', 'Thornton EW', 'Ealing J', 'Mitchell JD', 'Shaw PJ', 'Talbot K', 'Tennant A', 'Young CA']",2011,9,,Health Qual Life Outcomes,"Gibbons CJ, et al.

22101323,"p62 positive, TDP-43 negative, neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in the cerebellum and hippocampus define the pathology of C9orf72-linked FTLD and MND/ALS.","Neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) containing phosphorylated TDP-43 (p-TDP-43) are the pathological hallmarks of motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS) and FTLD-TDP. The vast majority of NCIs in the brain and spinal cord also label for ubiquitin and p62, however, we have previously reported a subset of TDP-43 proteinopathy patients who have unusual and abundant p62 positive, TDP-43 negative inclusions in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Here we sought to determine whether these cases carry the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72. Repeat primer PCR was performed in 36 MND/ALS, FTLD-MND/ALS and FTLD-TDP cases and four controls. Fourteen individuals with the repeat expansion were detected. In all the 14 expansion mutation cases there were abundant globular and star-shaped p62 positive NCIs in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, the vast majority of which were p-TDP-43 negative. p62 positive NCIs were also abundant in the cerebellar granular and molecular layers in all cases and in Purkinje cells in 12/14 cases but they were only positive for p-TDP-43 in the granular layer of one case. Abundant p62 positive, p-TDP-43 negative neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) were seen in 12/14 cases in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and in 6/14 cases in the cerebellar granular layer. This unusual combination of inclusions appears pathognomonic for C9orf72 repeat expansion positive MND/ALS and FTLD-TDP which we believe form a pathologically distinct subset of TDP-43 proteinopathies. Our results suggest that proteins other than TDP-43 are binding p62 and aggregating in response to the mutation which may play a mechanistic role in neurodegeneration.","['Al-Sarraj S', 'King A', 'Troakes C', 'Smith B', 'Maekawa S', 'Bodi I', 'Rogelj B', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Hortobágyi T', 'Shaw CE']",2011,122,6,Acta Neuropathol,"Al-Sarraj S, et al. p62 positive, TDP-43 negative, neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in the cerebellum and hippocampus define the pathology of C9orf72-linked FTLD and MND/ALS. p62 positive, TDP-43 negative, neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in the cerebellum and hippocampus define the pathology of C9orf72-linked FTLD and MND/ALS. 2011; 122:691-702. doi: 10.1007/s00401-011-0911-2",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22101323/
22087569,The need for support services for family carers of people with motor neurone disease (MND): views of current and former family caregivers a qualitative study.,"PURPOSE: Family carers provide the majority of home-based care for people with motor neurone disease (MND). Carers' need for, and use of, support services are not fully understood; this study aimed to explore, from a qualitative perspective, the views of current and former family carers of people with MND.
METHODS: A qualitative study was undertaken in Northwest England, using narrative interviews with current (18) and former (10) carers of a family member with MND. An optional longitudinal element involving diary completion was offered to the current carers. Data were analyzed using a thematic framework approach.
RESULTS: Carer's needs vary, but encompass the provision of information and training, availability of respite care, counselling, and access to trained paid-for carers.
CONCLUSIONS: There is need for a range of support services to be made available from which carers can select those most appropriate for them. Some support services are not always available for carers of this client group. There is a need for carers to access greater manual handling and training for physical care. Without sufficient support, carer burden can be overwhelming which may impact on the place of care of the patient and ultimately has implications for health and social care services.","[""O'Brien MR"", 'Whitehead B', 'Jack BA', 'Mitchell JD']",2012,34,3,Disabil Rehabil,"O'Brien MR, et al.

22083254,Clinical and neuropathologic heterogeneity of c9FTD/ALS associated with hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are part of a disease spectrum associated with TDP-43 pathology. Strong evidence supporting this is the existence of kindreds with family members affected by FTD, ALS or mixed features of FTD and ALS, referred to as FTD-MND. Some of these families have linkage to chromosome 9, with hexanucleotide expansion mutation in a noncoding region of C9ORF72. Discovery of the mutation defines c9FTD/ALS. Prior to discovery of mutations in C9ORF72, it was assumed that TDP-43 pathology in c9FTD/ALS was uniform. In this study, we examined the neuropathology and clinical features of 20 cases of c9FTD/ALS from a brain bank for neurodegenerative disorders. Included are six patients clinically diagnosed with ALS, eight FTD, one FTD-MND and four Alzheimer-type dementia. Clinical information was unavailable for one patient. Pathologically, the cases all had TDP-43 pathology, but there were three major pathologic groups: ALS, FTLD-MND and FTLD-TDP. The ALS cases were morphologically similar to typical sporadic ALS with almost no extramotor TDP-43 pathology; all had oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions. The FTLD-MND showed predominantly Mackenzie Type 3 TDP-43 pathology, and all had ALS-like pathology in motor neurons, but more extensive extramotor pathology, with oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions and infrequent hippocampal sclerosis. The FTLD-TDP cases had several features similar to FTLD-TDP due to mutations in the gene for progranulin, including Mackenzie Type 1 TDP-43 pathology with neuronal intranuclear inclusions and hippocampal sclerosis. FTLD-TDP patients were older and some were thought to have Alzheimer-type dementia. In addition to the FTD and ALS clinical presentations, the present study shows that c9FTD/ALS can have other presentations, possibly related to age of onset and the presence of hippocampal sclerosis. Moreover, there is pathologic heterogeneity not only between ALS and FTLD, but also within the FTLD group. Further studies are needed to address the molecular mechanism of clinical and pathological heterogeneity of c9FTD/ALS due to mutations in C9ORF72.","['Murray ME', 'DeJesus-Hernandez M', 'Rutherford NJ', 'Baker M', 'Duara R', 'Graff-Radford NR', 'Wszolek ZK', 'Ferman TJ', 'Josephs KA', 'Boylan KB', 'Rademakers R', 'Dickson DW']",2011,122,6,Acta Neuropathol,"Murray ME, et al.

Occupational exposure to magnetic fields was determined on the basis of a population-based job-exposure matrix. Age at entry, education, race, sex, and income were considered for inclusion as covariates
RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, and education, there were no increased risks of MND mortality in relation to potential magnetic field exposure, with hazard ratios around the null in all magnetic field exposure quartiles

22064045,Implementation and evaluation of an education program to guide palliative care for people with motor neurone disease.,"BACKGROUND: Despite a recognized need for a palliative approach to caring for people with motor neurone disease (MND), access to palliative care is often limited.
AIM: This project aimed to improve the knowledge of health professionals about a palliative approach to MND care.
DESIGN: A three-phase study was undertaken to develop, implement and evaluate an education program for health professionals that promoted a palliative approach to MND care. This paper discusses the second and third phases: the implementation and evaluation of the project. Education workshops were held for health professionals. Their knowledge of palliative care was measured before and after the workshops and one month later. Attitudes to providing MND care were also measured.
SETTING: Workshops were held in South Australia and Western Australia. Participants were health professionals working in the areas of MND care or palliative care. Some aged care and generalist health professionals were included if they had a role in providing care to people with MND.
RESULTS: The participants demonstrated an improvement in MND knowledge (χ(2) = 64.13(2), p = 0.000) and palliative care knowledge (χ(2) = 17.24(2), p = 0.000); both were sustained at one month. Attitudes to providing MND care also improved (χ(2) = 11.85(2), p = 0.003) and were maintained at the six-month follow-up. Participants indicated that the knowledge gained positively influenced their clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: A targeted education program for health professionals improved understanding about end-of-life care for people with MND.

22051030,Right temporal variant frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease.,"Patterns of atrophy in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) correlate with the clinical subtypes of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), semantic dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) and FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). Right temporal variant FTD is associated with behavioral dyscontrol and semantic impairment, with tau abnormalities more common in right temporal bvFTD and TDP-43 accumulation in right temporal semantic dementia. However, no clinical and anatomical correlation has been described for patients with predominant right temporal atrophy and FTD-MND. Therefore, we performed a database screen for all patients diagnosed with FTD-MND at Mayo Clinic and reviewed their MRI scans to identify those with striking, dominant, right temporal lobe atrophy. For cases with volumetric MRI we performed voxel based morphometry and for those with brain tissue we performed pathological examination. Of three such patients identified, each patient had different presenting behavioral and/or aphasic characteristics. MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging in one patient, and FDG positron emission tomography revealed striking and dominant right temporal lobe atrophy, right corticospinal tract degeneration, and right temporal hypometabolism. Archived brain tissue was available in two patients; both demonstrating TDP-43 type 3 pathology (Mackenzie scheme) with predominant neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. In one case, neurofibrillary tangles (Braak V) and neuritic plaques were also present in keeping with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. There appears to be an association between FTD-MND and severe right temporal lobe atrophy. Until further characterization of such cases are determined, they may be best classified as right temporal variant FTD-MND.","['Coon EA', 'Whitwell JL', 'Parisi JE', 'Dickson DW', 'Josephs KA']",2012,19,1,J Clin Neurosci,"Coon EA, et al.

22036682,Apparent Fibre Density: a novel measure for the analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images.,"This article proposes a new measure called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD) for the analysis of high angular resolution diffusion-weighted images using higher-order information provided by fibre orientation distributions (FODs) computed using spherical deconvolution. AFD has the potential to provide specific information regarding differences between populations by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist. In this work, analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to support the use of the FOD amplitude as a quantitative measure (i.e. AFD) for population and longitudinal analysis. To perform robust voxel-based analysis of AFD, we present and evaluate a novel method to modulate the FOD to account for changes in fibre bundle cross-sectional area that occur during spatial normalisation. We then describe a novel approach for statistical analysis of AFD that uses cluster-based inference of differences extended throughout space and orientation. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by performing voxel-based AFD comparisons between a group of Motor Neurone Disease patients and healthy control subjects. A significant decrease in AFD was detected along voxels and orientations corresponding to both the corticospinal tract and corpus callosal fibres that connect the primary motor cortices. In addition to corroborating previous findings in MND, this study demonstrates the clear advantage of using this type of analysis by identifying differences along single fibre bundles in regions containing multiple fibre populations.","['Raffelt D', 'Tournier JD', 'Rose S', 'Ridgway GR', 'Henderson R', 'Crozier S', 'Salvado O', 'Connelly A']",2012,59,4,Neuroimage,"Raffelt D, et al.

22035195,RNA dysregulation in diseases of motor neurons.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are neurodegenerative disorders that lead to paralysis and typically carry a dismal prognosis. In children, inherited spinal muscular atrophies are the predominant diseases that affect motor neurons, whereas in adults, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is inherited but mostly sporadic, is the most common MND. In recent years, we have witnessed a revolution in this field, sparked by the discovery of the genes that cause MNDs. Remarkably, at least 10 genes, whose products are either RNA-binding proteins or proteins that function in RNA processing and regulation, cause MNDs and place the dysregulation of RNA pathways at the center of motor neuron degeneration pathogenesis.","['Ibrahim F', 'Nakaya T', 'Mourelatos Z']",2012,7,,Annu Rev Pathol,"Ibrahim F, et al.

22032111,GPs have key role in managing motor neurone disease.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative condition. It affects people of all ages, but is more common with increasing age (especially over 50 years) and men are affected twice as often as women. The causes remain unknown, although around 5% of cases have a genetic basis. Survival is usually only three to five years from diagnosis. MND affects both upper and lower motor neurones, with variable contributions. The nerve involvement in MND usually has a focal onset, is asymmetrical, but tends to spread to adjacent regions of the body. If the affected region is in the legs, a common presenting feature is tripping, falls or foot drop. If it is in the arms there may be difficulty with fine tasks such as fastening buttons, or raising an arm, and if the cranial nerves are affected there may be slurring of speech, or difficulty swallowing. Key to the diagnosis is evidence of progression, and this may lead to some delay in considering and also confirming the diagnosis. When examining the patient, evidence of more widespread neuromuscular involvement should be looked for. In a patient with foot drop, and fasciculation of the tongue, MND would be a likely diagnosis. Upper motor neurone involvement may be readily determined by examining the reflexes. Brisk reflexes, in the arms, legs or jaw, in the context of features of lower motor neurone denervation are highly suggestive of MND. Suspicion of MND should lead to referral for a neurology opinion. The most useful investigation is likely to be EMG with nerve conduction studies, and probably MRI scan of relevant areas. Blood tests are arranged to screen for any other causative condition. Riluzole is a disease modifying drug licensed to extend the life of patients with MND. There is no treatment that will reverse, or halt, progression of the disease.",['Orrell RW'],2011,255,1743,Practitioner,"Orrell RW. GPs have key role in managing motor neurone disease.

22009125,Frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease: report of 3 cases in Taiwan and literature review.,"PURPOSE: Case reports and a review of literature of the coexistence of motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
CASE REPORT: All three patients demonstrated generalized lower motor neuron signs and very few upper motor neuron signs. In the level of patterns of cognitive impairments, neuropsychological studies do not distinguish between patients with onset of weakness from bulbar palsy and patients with onset of weakness from limbs. All patients of FTD had their onset of MND or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis symptoms within a two-year interval which is similar to previous reports. FTD combined with MND may shorten the survival to less than three years shorter than cases with FTD only. Respiratory failure occurred one to two years after onset of the behavioral symptoms in all patients.
CONCLUSION: We reported three patients of FTD with MND to remind clinicians that these two disorders may occur together on the same patient and that these two disorders may belong to one broad spectrum neurodegenerative disease.

21978082,Intracerebroventricular administration of human umbilical cord blood cells delays disease progression in two murine models of motor neuron degeneration.,"The lack of effective drug therapies for motor neuron diseases (MND), and in general for all the neurodegenerative disorders, has increased the interest toward the potential use of stem cells. Among the cell therapy approaches so far tested in MND animal models, systemic injection of human cord blood mononuclear cells (HuCB-MNCs) has proven to reproducibly increase, although modestly, the life span of SOD1G93A mice, a model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even if only few transplanted cells were found in the damaged areas. In attempt to improve the potential efficacy of these cells in the central nervous system, we examined the effect and distribution of Hoechst 33258-labeled HuCB-MNCs after a single bilateral intracerberoventricular injection in two models of motor neuron degeneration, the transgenic SOD1G93A and wobbler mice. HuCB-MNCs significantly ameliorated symptoms progression in both mouse models and prolonged survival in SOD1G93A mice. They were localized in the lateral ventricles, even 4 months after administration. However, HuCB-MNCs were not found in the spinal cord ventral horns. This evidence strengthens the hypothesis that the beneficial role of transplanted cells is not due to cell replacement but is rather associated with the production and release of circulating protective factors that may act both at the central and/or peripheral levels. In particular, we show that HuCB-MNCs release a series of cytokines and chemokines with antiinflammatory properties that could be responsible of the functional improvement of mouse models of motor neuron degenerative disorders.","['Bigini P', 'Veglianese P', 'Andriolo G', 'Cova L', 'Grignaschi G', 'Caron I', 'Daleno C', 'Barbera S', 'Ottolina A', 'Calzarossa C', 'Lazzari L', 'Mennini T', 'Bendotti C', 'Silani V']",2011,14,6,Rejuvenation Res,"Bigini P, et al.

However, the number of people receiving these interventions varies across the UK. This study has looked at the involvement and knowledge of consultants, within specialist palliative care services, with these procedures, to ascertain if there were differences in attitudes to their use. Twenty-two consultants took part in a telephone audit. There appeared to be great variation in their involvement in and knowledge of the use of these interventions. The majority of services were involved in the care of people with MND, but often only in the terminal stages. There appears to be a need for the wider application of guidelines on the use of PEG and NIV, as well as the development of a collaborative approach with other services, including neurology and rehabilitation services.","['Oliver D', 'Campbell C', 'Sykes N', 'Tallon C', 'Edwards A']",2011,27,3,J Palliat Care,"Oliver D, et al.

21955749,Rasch analysis of the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) for use in motor neurone disease.,"BACKGROUND: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is commonly used to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in motor neurone disease (MND). The measure has never been specifically validated for use within this population, despite questions raised about the scale's validity. This study seeks to analyse the construct validity of the HADS in MND by fitting its data to the Rasch model.
METHODS: The scale was administered to 298 patients with MND. Scale assessment included model fit, differential item functioning (DIF), unidimensionality, local dependency and category threshold analysis.
RESULTS: Rasch analyses were carried out on the HADS total score as well as depression and anxiety subscales (HADS-T, D and A respectively). After removing one item from both of the seven item scales, it was possible to produce modified HADS-A and HADS-D scales which fit the Rasch model. An 11-item higher-order HADS-T total scale was found to fit the Rasch model following the removal of one further item.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a modified HADS-A and HADS-D are unidimensional, free of DIF and have good fit to the Rasch model in this population. As such they are suitable for use in MND clinics or research. The use of the modified HADS-T as a higher-order measure of psychological distress was supported by our data. Revised cut-off points are given for the modified HADS-A and HADS-D subscales.","['Gibbons CJ', 'Mills RJ', 'Thornton EW', 'Ealing J', 'Mitchell JD', 'Shaw PJ', 'Talbot K', 'Tennant A', 'Young CA']",2011,9,,Health Qual Life Outcomes,"Gibbons CJ, et al.

21936930,Protocol for a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial of lithium carbonate in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (LiCALS) [Eudract number: 2008-006891-31].,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by loss of motor neurons leading to severe weakness and death from respiratory failure within 3-5 years. Riluzole prolongs survival in ALS. A published report has suggested a dramatic effect of lithium carbonate on survival. 44 patients were studied, with 16 randomly selected to take LiCO3 and riluzole and 28 allocated to take riluzole alone. In the group treated with lithium, no patients had died (i.e., 100% survival) at the end of the study (15 months from entry), compared to 71% surviving in the riluzole-only group. Although the trial can be criticised on several grounds, there is a substantial rationale from other laboratory studies that lithium is worth investigating therapeutically in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
METHODS/DESIGN: LiCALS is a multi-centre double-blind randomised parallel group controlled trial of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lithium carbonate (LiCO3) at doses to achieve stable 'therapeutic' plasma levels (0.4-0.8 mmol/L), plus standard treatment, versus matched placebo plus standard treatment, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study will be based in the UK, in partnership with the MND Association and DeNDRoN (the Dementias and Neurodegnerative Diseases Clinical Research Network). 220 patients will be recruited. All patients will be on the standard treatment for ALS of riluzole 100 mg daily. The primary outcome measure will be death from any cause at 18 months defined from the date of randomisation. Secondary outcome measures will be changes in three functional rating scales, the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, The EuroQOL (EQ-5D), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Eligible patients will have El Escorial Possible, Laboratory-supported Probable, Probable or Definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disease duration between 6 months and 36 months (inclusive), vital capacity ≥ 60% of predicted within 1 month prior to randomisation and age at least18 years.
DISCUSSION: Patient recruitment began in June 2009 and the last patient is expected to complete the trial protocol in November 2011.

21924711,"What wires together dies together: verbs, actions and neurodegeneration in motor neuron disease.","For more than a century the research on Motor Neuron Disease (MND) has been dominated by a tension between the concept of a selective, purely motor degeneration and a growing realisation of the high frequency and importance of cognitive symptoms that can culminate in dementia. The present paper aims at integrating these two, seemingly mutually exclusive interpretations of the disease. It is proposed that the cognitive and motor symptoms in MND are due to the same selective neurodegenerative process, spreading along the lines of functional connections in the nervous system. Accordingly, the most impaired aspects of cognitive function are those with the closest functional links to the motor system, a pattern explaining a disproportionate impairment of verb and action processing in this disease. The dementia associated with MND can be interpreted as the fifth major clinical presentation of MND, alongside bulbar, thoracic, upper and lower limb presentation. It follows the same rules of disease progression as other presentations, spreading contiguously from region to region, with a predominantly caudal direction. Accordingly, dementia tends to precede other presentations and is often followed by bulbar symptoms. We believe that the presented model contributes to a more accurate concept of MND, integrating cognitive and motor features within the same disease mechanism. At the same time it highlights the importance of MND for cognitive neuroscience and, in particular, for theories of embodied cognition.","['Bak TH', 'Chandran S']",2012,48,7,Cortex,"Bak TH and Chandran S.

21921552,[FTLD/ALS as TDP-43 proteinopathies].,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) often coexist in the same patients: FTLD/MND. However, it is unclear whether FTLD/MND can be distinguished from ALS or FTLD. TAR DNA binding protein 43 KDa (TDP-43) has been identified as the major component of the ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in ALS, FTLD, and FTLD/MND. On the basis of this finding, a new concept of neurodegenerative disorders, namely TDP-43 proteinopathy, has been proposed for these disorders. In ALS, more than 30 mutations of the TDP-43 gene have been identified. The clinical features and neuropathological findings of ALS with TDP-43 mutation are identical to those of sporadic ALS. Therefore, TDP-43 plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of ALS. In contrast, only few patients with FTLD phenotype have TDP-43 mutations. Therefore, we have speculated that TDP-43 does not play a primary role in the pathogenesis of FTLD. The analysis of distribution of TDP-43 inclusion bodies in ALS patients revealed that ALS has two subtypes: (1) limited in the motor neuron system and (2) extended into the frontotemporal lobe. Additionally, causative genes of familial FTLD/MND have not been mapped to TDP-43. These results suggest that FTLD/MND is a disease distinct from FTLD and ALS.","['Ishihara T', 'Ariizumi Y', 'Shiga A', 'Yokoseki A', 'Sato T', 'Toyoshima Y', 'Kakita A', 'Takahashi H', 'Nishizawa M', 'Onodera O']",2010,50,11,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Ishihara T, et al.

21921522,[Clinical and pathological characteristics of FUS/TLS-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)].,"FUS/TLS is identified as the causative gene of ALS6. FUS/TLS shares a role in nuclear protein as RNA editing with TDP43, and aggregates in basophilic inclusions (BIs) in ALS6 as well as juvenile ALS with BIs. FUS/TLS is also associated with atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration (aFTLD), neuronal intermediate inclusion body disease (NIBD) and basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD). Thus, FUS/TLS as well as TDP43 may provide clues to motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemoporal dementia (FTD). We have established consortium to study MND/FTD in collaboration with neurological, psychiatric and geriatric institutes. Two clinically sporadic ALS-FUS/TLS cases were selected from the consortium: a case of ALS6 without family history and a case of juvenile ALS with BIs. Both cases presented with BIs, which were immunoreactive for anti-FUS/TLS antibodies and ultrastructurally consisted of granulofilamentous profiles common to ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions. Two familial ALS6 cases were also studied in the consortium. Biochemical analysis showed no truncation, phosphorylation or ubiquitination of FUS in insoluble fraction, that shows clear difference from TDP43. The mechanism of FUSopathy is currently a challenging theme from the point of protein aggregation.",['Murayama S'],2010,50,11,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,Murayama S.

21921519,[Clinical and pathological spectrum of TDP-43 associated ALS].,"The molecular pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unclear. TAR DNA-binding proteins of 43 KDa (TDP-43) immunopositive cytoplasmic inclusions have been found in glia and neurons of ALS patients. The discovery of TDP-43 mutations in ALS patients indicates a direct role of TDP-43 in ALS. More than 30 mutations in the TDP-43 gene have been identified in patients with familial and sporadic ALS. ALS with a TDP-43 mutation is classified as ALS-10. The clinical features of ALS-10 are quite similar to those of sporadic ALS. Furthermore, the neuropathological findings for ALS-10, including TDP-43 immunopositive inclusions and Bunina bodies, are identical to those in sporadic ALS. Most of the mutations are located in the C-terminus of TDP-43, which may function as a binding domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration: FTLD and FTLD/MND (motor neuron disease) also have TDP-43 immunopositive inclusions. These disorders have been named as TDP-43 proteinopathy. However, patients with TDP-43 mutations rarely develop FTLD. Causative genes for familial FTLD and FTLD/MND are not linked to the TDP-43 gene. Thus, other factors may contribute to the TDP-43 pathology in these diseases. Further analysis is required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ALS-10 and TDP-43 proteinopathy.","['Onodera O', 'Yokoseki A', 'Tan CF', 'Ishihara T', 'Nishiira Y', 'Toyoshima Y', 'Kakita A', 'Nishizawa M', 'Takahashi H']",2010,50,11,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Onodera O, et al.

21901724,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a progressive neurodegenerative disease without effective therapies. Several studies have suggested that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may have positive benefit in ALS. However, the efficacy and safety of this therapy remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rTMS for treating ALS.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (July 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2010), EMBASE (1980 to July 2010), CINAHL (1937 to July 2010), Science Citation Index Expanded (January 1945 to June 2010), AMED (January 1985 to July 2010) and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1979 to September 2010). We also searched for ongoing studies on clinicaltrials.gov (September 2010).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of rTMS for patients with a clinical diagnosis of ALS.Comparisons eligible for inclusion were:1. rTMS versus no intervention;2. rTMS versus sham rTMS;3. rTMS versus physiotherapy;4. rTMS versus medications;5. rTMS + other therapies or drugs versus sham rTMS + the same therapies or drugs;6. different methods of application of rTMS such as high-frequency (> 1Hz) compared to low-frequency (≤ 1Hz) rTMS.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected papers, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We resolved disagreements through discussion. We contacted study authors for additional information.
MAIN RESULTS: Three randomised, placebo-controlled trials with a total of 50 participants were included in the review. All the trials were of poor methodological quality and were insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results. Moreover, the high rate of attrition further increased the risk of bias. None of the trials provided detailed data on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores at six months follow-up which was pre-assigned as our primary outcome. One trial contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis of our secondary outcomes. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham rTMS using the ALSFRS-R scores and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores at 12 months follow-up in this trial. Additionally, none of the trials reported any adverse events associated with the use of rTMS. However, in view of the small sample size, the methodological limitations and incomplete outcome data, treatment with rTMS cannot be judged as completely safe.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of ALS. Further studies may be helpful if their potential benefit is weighed against the impact of participation in a randomised controlled trial on people with ALS.","['Guo J', 'Zhou M', 'Yang M', 'Zhu C', 'He L']",2011,,9,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Guo J, et al.

21849339,Non-invasive ventilation in motor neuron disease: an update of current UK practice.,"BACKGROUND: In motor neurone disease (MND), respiratory muscle weakness causes substantial morbidity, and death is usually due to respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) improves symptoms, quality of life and survival, but previous surveys showed that few patients with MND received NIV.
METHODS: A postal survey was conducted of the clinical application of NIV in MND among consultant neurologists in the UK. The results were compared with those of a similar survey done in 2000.
FINDINGS: Over 12 months, 612 patients were referred for NIV of whom 444 were successfully established on treatment (72.5% success rate). 38% of responding neurologists assessed respiratory function at presentation and 20% routinely monitored respiratory function; 32% relied on symptoms as the only criterion for NIV referral and 43% used a combination of symptoms and physiological impairment. 75% of responding neurologists accessed specialist palliative care services for their patients towards the end of life and 69% at an earlier stage.
INTERPRETATION: Compared with 2000, there has been a marked increase in the number of patients referred for, and currently using, NIV (2.6 and 3.4-fold, respectively). The proportion successfully established on NIV has also increased, suggesting more appropriate selection and/or improvement in the methods of using NIV in this challenging group of patients. However, monitoring of respiratory function is suboptimal and uncontrolled oxygen is sometimes used inappropriately before the terminal phase.","[""O'Neill CL"", 'Williams TL', 'Peel ET', 'McDermott CJ', 'Shaw PJ', 'Gibson GJ', 'Bourke SC']",2012,83,4,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"O'Neill CL, et al.

21775409,"Motor Neurone Disease family carers' experiences of caring, palliative care and bereavement: an exploratory qualitative study.","BACKGROUND: Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a neurodegenerative disease with a sudden onset, a rapid progression, a profile of complex disabilities and fatal consequences. Caring for a person with MND is an unremitting commitment, yet little research has examined the experiences and needs of carers for palliative care and bereavement care.
AIM: This study explored the experiences of MND family carers, both during their time as carers and following bereavement. Particular attention was paid to the carers' prolonged grief status and to the implications for service delivery, including palliative care.
DESIGN: A qualitative approach consisted of interviews with 16 bereaved family carers. The Prolonged Grief tool (PG-13) measured the carers' prolonged grief.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: sixteen family carers participated in the study, between one and four years after the death of their spouse from MND in Western Australia.
RESULTS: The thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed five themes - the work of family carers, the change in relationship from spouse to family carer, family caring as a series of losses, coping mechanisms of family carers and supportive and palliative care experiences of family carers. The six participants who met the criteria for prolonged grief disorder accessed palliative care at a later stage in the disease trajectory.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provided a basis for more research into the role palliative care services has in supporting MND carers before and after the death of their spouse and in particular the provision of more tailored respite and bereavement support.","['Aoun SM', 'Connors SL', 'Priddis L', 'Breen LJ', 'Colyer S']",2012,26,6,Palliat Med,"Aoun SM, et al.

21773886,Globular glial tauopathies (GGT) presenting with motor neuron disease or frontotemporal dementia: an emerging group of 4-repeat tauopathies.,"A number of recent studies have described cases with tau-positive globular oligodendroglial inclusions (GOIs) and such cases have overlapping pathological features with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), but present with clinical features of motor neuron disease (MND) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These two clinical phenotypes have been published independently and as a result, have come to be considered as distinct disease entities. We describe the clinicopathological and biochemical features of two cases with GOIs: one with clinical symptoms suggestive of MND and the other with FTD. Histological changes in our two cases were consistent with their clinical symptoms; the MND case had severe neurodegeneration in the primary motor cortex and corticospinal tract, whereas the FTD case had severe involvement of the frontotemporal cortices and associated white matter. Immunohistochemistry in both cases revealed significant 4-repeat (4R) tau pathology primarily in the form of GOIs, but also in astrocytes and neurons. Astrocytic tau pathology was morphologically similar to that seen in PSP, but in contrast was consistently negative for Gallyas silver staining. Tau-specific western blotting revealed 68, 64 and 35 kDa bands, showing further overlap with PSP. The underlying neuropathological features of these two cases were similar, with the major difference relating to the regional distribution of pathology and resulting clinical symptoms and signs. The globular nature of glial inclusions and the non-fibrillar properties of tau in astrocytes are characteristic features that allow them to be distinguished from PSP and other tauopathies. We, therefore, propose the term globular glial tauopathy as an encompassing term to classify this emerging class of 4R tauopathy.","['Ahmed Z', 'Doherty KM', 'Silveira-Moriyama L', 'Bandopadhyay R', 'Lashley T', 'Mamais A', 'Hondhamuni G', 'Wray S', 'Newcombe J', ""O'Sullivan SS"", 'Wroe S', 'de Silva R', 'Holton JL', 'Lees AJ', 'Revesz T']",2011,122,4,Acta Neuropathol,"Ahmed Z, et al.

21764583,Assessment of spatio-temporal gait parameters using inertial measurement units in neurological populations.,"Laboratory based gait analysis techniques are expensive, time consuming and require technical expertise. Inertial measurement units can directly measure temporal parameters and in combination with gait models may provide a solution to obtain spatial gait measurements within daily clinical assessments. However it is not known if a model and standard correction factor determined by Zijlstra and Hof [8] to estimate step and stride length parameters in typically developed adults (TDA) can be accurately used in neurologically impaired gaits. This research estimated the stride length over two 10 m walks at self selected walking speed in people with neurological conditions, using a previously established model and correction factor for TDA. The relation of the correction factor to walking speed was explored. We recruited TDA (n=10) and participants with Parkinson's disease (PD; n=24), muscular dystrophy (MD; n=13), motor neuron disease (MND; n=7) and stroke survivors (n=18) for the study who twice walked 10 m at a self-selected pace. Stride length correction factors, for TDA (1.25±0.01), PD (1.25±0.03), and MD (1.21±0.08) (p=0.833 and p=0.242) were the same as previously reported in TDA (Zijlstra and Hof [8]). Correction factors for stroke (1.17±0.42) and MND (1.10±0.08) were different (p<0.01 and p=0.028 respectively). However there was a high level of variability for correction factors within groups, which did not relate to walking speed. Our findings support that correction factors should be determined for each individual to estimate average step/stride length in patients suffering from a neurological condition.","['Esser P', 'Dawes H', 'Collett J', 'Feltham MG', 'Howells K']",2011,34,4,Gait Posture,"Esser P, et al.

METHODS: a qualitative study using narrative interviews was used to elicit accounts from 24 people with MND and 18 current family carers and 10 former family carers.
RESULTS: the needs of patients and carers are not being adequately met in the final stages of MND and there appears a need for increased, co-ordinated support from palliative care services. The use of advance care planning tools is regarded as beneficial for patients and carers, but health professionals demonstrate a limited understanding of them. Anxiety and distress in patients, carers and bereaved carers is heightened during this period. Carer burden is excessive and may exacerbate patient distress and desire for hastening death.
CONCLUSION: this study has identified a number of issues people with MND and their carers face in the final stages of the illness, indicating some ways in which health, social and palliative care services could be improved or co-operate more effectively in order to better meet their needs.","['Whitehead B', ""O'Brien MR"", 'Jack BA', 'Mitchell D']",2012,26,4,Palliat Med,"Whitehead B, et al.

21705270,Decremental responses to repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) in motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To clarify the features of decremental responses following repetitive nerve stimulation in patients with motor neuron diseases (MNDs), in comparison with myasthenia gravis (MG).
METHODS: The subjects consisted of 48 MND, 39 generalized MG and 19 ocular MG patients. Six muscles, both proximal and distal muscles, were tested.
RESULTS: Significant decrements (>5%) in at least one muscle were observed in 83% of the MND patients, and 74% and 47% of the generalized MG and ocular MG patients, respectively. Decrements were more frequently observed in the proximal muscles both in MND and MG patients (deltoid 76% and 62%, and trapezius 71% and 51% for MND and generalized MG, respectively), suggesting lower safety factors in neuromuscular transmission in those muscles. Decrements in the nasalis were rare in MND (8%) in comparison with generalized MG (54%).
CONCLUSIONS: Decremental responses were frequently observed in MND patients. There were small differences between MND and MG regarding the distribution and other features of decrements, such as the degree of the U-shape or the responses to different stimulus frequencies and to brief exercise.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results imply that the underlying mechanism regulating the decrements is common to MND and MG.","['Iwanami T', 'Sonoo M', 'Hatanaka Y', 'Hokkoku K', 'Oishi C', 'Shimizu T']",2011,122,12,Clin Neurophysiol,"Iwanami T, et al.

21692041,Neural stem cell-mediated therapy for rare brain diseases: perspectives in the near future for LSDs and MNDs.,"Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are genetically inherited disorders affecting most patients in pediatric age and progressively lead to severe, even lethal, multiorgan dysfunction and brain neurodegeneration. Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)-related syndromes are neurodegenerative disorders occurring in the majority of cases sporadically and affect adult middle-aged patients. Despite being divergent in most pathological and physiological hallmarks, both MNDs and LSDs are characterized by tremendous clinical heterogeneity due to poor prognosis and variable onset of the symptoms. Moreover, both LSDs and MNDs are characterized by the concurrence of multiple pathogenetic processes, such as the development of inflammatory and excitotoxic environments. Furthermore, pharmacological, enzyme or genetic therapies have proven to be ineffective and no cure is currently available for the neurodegeneration in either LSD or ALS affected patients. Recent studies have identified non-neuronal cell types, such as astrocytes and microglia, as being involved in non cell-autonomous effects on MND or LSD progression. These findings have prompted the use of neural stem cells for the replacement of non-neuronal cells rather than neuronal cells, which may result in neuroprotection and immunomodulation. The choice of an appropriate tissue source and the establishment of standardized paradigms to culture human neural stem cells (hNSC) will allow their use for future clinical trials on both ALS and LSD affected patients and parallel drug screening studies with novel breakthroughs in the knowledge of neurodegenerative diseases.",['de Filippis L'],2011,26,8,Histol Histopathol,de Filippis L.

21674216,Changing mortality for motor neuron disease in France (1968-2007): an age-period-cohort analysis.,"The incidence and mortality of motor neuron disease (MND) increase with age and appear to have increased with time. The examination of period and cohort effects using age-period-cohort (APC) models can help characterize temporal trends. Our objective was to describe mortality from MND in France (1968-2007), and to examine the role of age, period of death, and birth-cohort on changes in mortality. The number of people who died from MND and population statistics (1968-2007) were extracted from French national records. Annual standardized (age/sex) mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed. Using Poisson regression, APC models examined the relationship between mortality rates and age, period of death, and birth-cohort in subjects aged 40-89 years. Deviance/degrees-of-freedom ratios evaluated model fit; ratios close to one indicated adequate fit. Between 1968 and 2007, 38,863 individuals died from MND (mortality rate = 1.74/100,000); 37,624 were aged 40-89 years. SMRs increased from 54 (95% CI = 49-59) in 1968 to 126 (120-132) in 2007. Male-to-female ratios declined from 1.80 in 1968 to 1.45 in 2007. Changing mortality rates were best explained by cohort effects (deviance/degrees-of-freedom = 1.09). The relative risk of dying from MND increased markedly for persons born between 1880 and 1920, and more slowly after 1920. In conclusion, mortality rates for MND increased between 1968 and 2007, and more rapidly in women than men. This increase was better explained by the birth-cohort of individuals than by period effects. Changing environmental exposures may be a possible explanation and these findings warrant the continued search for environmental risk factors for MND.","['Gordon PH', 'Artaud F', 'Aouba A', 'Laurent F', 'Meininger V', 'Elbaz A']",2011,26,9,Eur J Epidemiol,"Gordon PH, et al.

21626001,[Motor neuron diseases].,"Motor neuron diseases (MND) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders which are present in clinical, prognostic and genetic diversity. The most common MND are amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and various forms of hereditary and sporadic lower motor neuron syndromes including hereditary motor neuropathies (HMN). Familial and ""sporadic"" forms of ALS and lower motor neuron syndromes are known. The essential pathogenic findings in MND have emerged from molecular biological examinations of the hereditary forms of MND. In ALS, one consistent neuropathological feature is intraneuronal protein inclusions which arise from TDP-43, FUS, SOD1 or ataxin-2 aggregations. TDP-43, FUS, SOD1 and ataxin-2 are multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding proteins which are involved in transcription regulation. SMA and HMN are associated with different genes whose gene products may also be involved in RNA processing. A disturbance in the regulation of RNA possibly represents an overlapping pathophysiological characteristic in MND. The elucidation of common pathways in the cascade of motor neuron degeneration is an essential point of departure for molecular genetically defined treatment strategies both in ALS and in hereditary and sporadic lower motor neuron syndromes.","['Petri S', 'Meyer T']",2011,82,6,Nervenarzt,Petri S and Meyer T.

21624986,Predicting survival in frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical and demographic features are associated with prognosis in patients with frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease (FTD-MND).
METHODS: This was a case series of FTD-MND categorized according to behavioral- or language-dominant symptoms at presentation and throughout the disease course. Demographic, clinical, imaging, and survival data were analyzed with respect to dominant FTD-MND type. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess and compare regional patterns of atrophy in behavioral- and language-dominant FTD-MND types.
RESULTS: Of the 56 patients with FTD-MND who were identified, 31 had dominant behavioral symptoms and 25 had dominant language symptoms; 53 patients had died. A survival difference was present between types, with patients with behavioral-dominant symptoms surviving 506 days longer than patients with language-dominant symptoms (mean 1,397 vs 891 days; p = 0.002). There was also a difference in time from diagnosis to death (p = 0.02) between groups. Patients with language-dominant disease were more likely to have bulbar-onset than limb-onset motor neuron disease (MND) (p = 0.01). There was a similar pattern of frontal and temporal lobe atrophy in both types, although there was some evidence for the behavioral type to have more frontal atrophy and the language type to have more left temporal atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: In our series of patients with FTD-MND, language-dominant FTD-MND was associated with bulbar-onset MND and a shorter survival. There was also evidence that the dominant FTD-MND type is related to differences in brain atrophy patterns.","['Coon EA', 'Sorenson EJ', 'Whitwell JL', 'Knopman DS', 'Josephs KA']",2011,76,22,Neurology,"Coon EA, et al.

DESIGN: A meta-ethnography of studies of family members in multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and motor neuron disease (MND).
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic search in electronic databases; thematic synthesis guided by the principles of meta-ethnography, which is a method for thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.
RESULTS: Nine articles were included. The results of the synthesis identified two key themes. First, family members are intimately aware of changes in their relative's health and well-being. Sub-themes include family member awareness of different and progressive stages of the disease, noticing deterioration, noticing decline in functional abilities and recognizing that their relative will die. The second key theme is dilemmas of being involved in prognostication. Sub-themes include family member ambivalence toward hearing about prognostication, health professionals not being knowledgeable of the disease and family reluctance to receive palliative care.
CONCLUSIONS: Family members monitor and recognize changes in their relative with PD, MND and MS and in themselves. Thus, drawing on the expertise of family members may be a useful tool for prognostication.","['Hubbard G', 'McLachlan K', 'Forbat L', 'Munday D']",2012,26,2,Palliat Med,"Hubbard G, et al.

21569259,"FTLD-TDP with motor neuron disease, visuospatial impairment and a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome: broadening the clinical phenotype of TDP-43 proteinopathies. A report of three cases.","BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin and TDP-43 positive neuronal inclusions represents a novel entity (FTLD-TDP) that may be associated with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND); involvement of extrapyramidal and other systems has also been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present three cases with similar clinical symptoms, including Parkinsonism, supranuclear gaze palsy, visuospatial impairment and a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, associated with either clinically possible or definite MND. Neuropathological examination revealed hallmarks of FTLD-TDP with major involvement of subcortical and, in particular, mesencephalic structures. These cases differed in onset and progression of clinical manifestations as well as distribution of histopathological changes in the brain and spinal cord. Two cases were sporadic, whereas the third case had a pathological variation in the progranulin gene 102 delC.
CONCLUSIONS: Association of a ""progressive supranuclear palsy-like"" syndrome with marked visuospatial impairment, motor neuron disease and early behavioral disturbances may represent a clinically distinct phenotype of FTLD-TDP. Our observations further support the concept that TDP-43 proteinopathies represent a spectrum of disorders, where preferential localization of pathogenetic inclusions and neuronal cell loss defines clinical phenotypes ranging from frontotemporal dementia with or without motor neuron disease, to corticobasal syndrome and to a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome.","['Rusina R', 'Kovacs GG', 'Fiala J', 'Hort J', 'Ridzoň P', 'Holmerová I', 'Ströbel T', 'Matěj R']",2011,11,,BMC Neurol,"Rusina R, et al.

21563158,Treatment for sialorrhea (excessive saliva) in people with motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a progressive, neurodegenerative condition which may cause dysphagia, as well as limb weakness, dysarthria, emotional lability and respiratory failure. Since normal salivary production is 0.5 to 1.5 litres daily, loss of salivary clearance due to dysphagia leads to salivary pooling and sialorrhea, often resulting in distress and inconvenience to patients.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review evidence on treatment of sialorrhea in MND, including medications, radiotherapy and surgery.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (1 October 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials )(CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library issue 3, 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2010), AMED (1985 to September 2010) and CINAHL Plus (January 1937 September 2010). All bibliographies of the identified randomized trials were reviewed and authors contacted as needed. Known experts in the field were contacted to identify further published and unpublished papers.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomised controlled studies on any intervention for sialorrhea and related symptoms, in people with MND.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors summarised data independently in a customised data collection form and confirmed data presented in Cochrane Review Manager software.
MAIN RESULTS: Only one randomized controlled trial was identified. This was a well designed study of botulinum toxin B injected into parotid and submandibular glands of 20 patients, which showed positive results for four weeks (Jackson 2009). There was low risk of bias in the study and no significant adverse events reported.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence for use of botulinum toxin injections to salivary glands for the treatment of sialorrhea in MND. Further research is required on this important symptom. Data are needed on the problem of sialorrhea in MND and its measurement, both by patient self report measures and objective tests. These will allow the development of better randomized controlled trials.","['Young CA', 'Ellis C', 'Johnson J', 'Sathasivam S', 'Pih N']",2011,,5,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Young CA, et al.

21461951,A metabolomic comparison of mouse models of the Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses.,"The Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCL) are a group of fatal inherited neurodegenerative diseases in humans distinguished by a common clinical pathology, characterized by the accumulation of storage body material in cells and gross brain atrophy. In this study, metabolic changes in three NCL mouse models were examined looking for pathways correlated with neurodegeneration. Two mouse models; motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse and a variant model of late infantile NCL, termed the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (nclf) mouse were investigated experimentally. Both models exhibit a characteristic accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment in neuronal and non neuronal cells. The NMR profiles derived from extracts of the cortex and cerebellum from mnd and nclf mice were distinguished according to disease/wildtype status. In particular, a perturbation in glutamine and glutamate metabolism, and a decrease in γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the cerebellum and cortices of mnd (adolescent mice) and nclf mice relative to wildtype at all ages were detected. Our results were compared to the Cln3 mouse model of NCL. The metabolism of mnd mice resembled older (6 month) Cln3 mice, where the disease is relatively advanced, while the metabolism of nclf mice was more akin to younger (1-2 months) Cln3 mice, where the disease is in its early stages of progression. Overall, our results allowed the identification of metabolic traits common to all NCL subtypes for the three animal models.","['Salek RM', 'Pears MR', 'Cooper JD', 'Mitchison HM', 'Pearce DA', 'Mortishire-Smith RJ', 'Griffin JL']",2011,49,3-4,J Biomol NMR,"Salek RM, et al.

21453731,Loss of glial fibrillary acidic protein marginally accelerates disease progression in a SOD1(H46R) transgenic mouse model of ALS.,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate filament protein that is highly expressed in reactive astrocytes. Increased production of GFAP is a hallmark of astrogliosis in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the physiological and pathological roles of GFAP, particularly in chronic neurodegenerative conditions, remain unclear. To address this issue, we here investigate whether absence of GFAP affects the phenotypic expression of motor neuron disease (MND) using an H46R mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-expressing mouse model of ALS (SOD1(H46R)). GFAP deficient SOD1(H46R) mice showed a significant shorter lifespan than SOD1(H46R) littermates. Further, at the end stage of disease, loss of GFAP resulted in increased levels of Vim and Aif1 mRNAs, encoding vimentin and allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1), respectively, in the spinal cord, although no discernible differences in the levels and distribution of these proteins between SOD1(H46R) and GFAP-deficient SOD1(H46R) mice were observed. These results suggest that loss of GFAP in SOD1(H46R) mice marginally accelerates the disease progression by moderately enhancing glial cell activation. Our findings in a mouse model of ALS may have implication that GFAP is not necessary for the initiation of disease, but it rather plays some modulatory roles in the progression of ALS/MND.","['Yoshii Y', 'Otomo A', 'Pan L', 'Ohtsuka M', 'Hadano S']",2011,70,3,Neurosci Res,"Yoshii Y, et al.

21410794,Distinct pathogenic processes between Fig4-deficient motor and sensory neurons.,"Loss of function of the FIG4 gene causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT)-4J with many features also found in motor neuron disease (MND). Mechanisms for the degeneration are unknown. We investigated this using Fig4-deficient pale tremor (plt) mice, a mouse model of CMT4J. Ultrastructural studies in sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) confirmed abundant vacuoles with membrane disruption. The vacuoles became detectable as early as postnatal day 4 in the DRG. However, the vacuoles were absent or minimal in the spinal motor neurons or cortical neurons in 2- to 5-week-old plt mice. Instead, a large number of electron-dense organelles, reminiscent of those in lysosomal storage disorders, accumulated in the motor neurons, but not in the sensory neurons of DRG. This accumulation was associated with increased levels of lysosomal proteins, such as LAMP2 and NPC1, but not mannose-6-phosphate receptor, an endosomal protein that is usually excluded from the lysosomes. Our results suggest that Fig4 deficiency affects motor neurons differently from sensory neurons by mechanisms involving excessive retention of molecules in lysosomes or disruption of vacuolated organelles. These two distinct pathological changes may contribute to neuronal degeneration.","['Katona I', 'Zhang X', 'Bai Y', 'Shy ME', 'Guo J', 'Yan Q', 'Hatfield J', 'Kupsky WJ', 'Li J']",2011,33,8,Eur J Neurosci,"Katona I, et al.

This is the first study, which describes the disability profile and healthcare needs for persons with MND (pwMND) in an Australian sample from the perspective of the patients and caregivers to identify current gaps in the knowledge and service provision. A prospective cross-sectional community survey of pwMND (n=44) and their caregivers (n=37) was conducted, to determine symptoms and problems affecting daily living. Standardized assessments were carried out to determine the disease severity for stratification purposes, service needs and gaps. The mean age was 61 years with more men affected than women (3 : 2). The severity of disease was high (n=18; 41%) based on the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale. Despite the high level of disability, 11 (25%) solely relied on their families for all assistance. Caregivers were mostly partners (mean age: 57 years). PwMND reported more pain, emotional disturbance and spasticity/cramps/spasms. Caregivers focused more on psychosocial issues. Nineteen (43%) pwMND reported gaps in the service in rehabilitation therapy and respite. Significantly proportionally, more caregivers (n=19; 51%) reported gaps particularly in the area of psychosocial support. The gaps identified in the MND care should be prioritized for future service development using the 'neuropalliative rehabilitation' model of care. For improved consensus of care and communication among treating clinicians, the framework of International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health should be explored in this population.","['Ng L', 'Talman P', 'Khan F']",2011,34,2,Int J Rehabil Res,"Ng L, et al.

21383060,The preferred priorities for care document in motor neurone disease: views of bereaved relatives and carers.,"Increasing emphasis is being placed on the need for advanced care planning (ACP) at the end of life. The Preferred Priorities for Care (PPC) document is a patient-held record promoted by the End of Life Care Strategy as an ACP tool to promote discussion and communication amongst patients, family and health care providers. However, little research exists into evaluating its effectiveness or exploring patient and carer views, particularly in non-malignant disease. Because the majority of patients with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) lose verbal communication, early discussion of patients' wishes and preferences, a central aspect of ACP, is vital. This study examined MND patients' bereaved relatives' experiences of using the PPC document and their perceptions about its impact on end-of-life care using qualitative methods. Key findings adding to existing literature were that the PPC document was felt to have little impact on end-of-life care amongst this patient group and that there was a perceived lack of awareness of the document amongst health care professionals (HCPs), in particular hospital staff. This was felt to limit the effectiveness of the document. This has obvious implications for practice, looking at awareness amongst HCPs and ways to improve this situation, particularly in light of the current pressures to meet patient preferences at the end of life.","['Preston H', 'Fineberg IC', 'Callagher P', 'Mitchell DJ']",2012,26,2,Palliat Med,"Preston H, et al.

Narrative interviews with people with MND/ALS (N = 24) and family carers (N = 18) explored their perspectives on social services homecare. Quantitative analyses highlighted the role of increasing disease severity and age for social services homecare uptake. However, qualitative findings revealed a number of barriers delaying the uptake of such care. 'Internal' issues focused on retaining control and normality within the home. 'External' issues arose from limited understanding of the disease amongst service providers and lack of awareness of service entitlement amongst patients and carers. Multiple factors are implicated in the uptake of social services homecare.

By the late 20th century, the link between both diseases was firmly established, with the resulting condition often referred to as MND/FTD. Several strands of evidence support the notion of an MND/FTD overlap. First, a small but well-documented group of patients present with a full-blown FTD, associated with MND. Second, subtle but characteristic changes in frontal-executive functions and social cognition have been described in non-demented MND patients, often in association with frontal atrophy/hypoactivity on neuroimaging. Third, amyotrophic features have been documented in patients primarily diagnosed with FTD. Moreover, the same genetic defect can lead to FTD and MND phenotypes in different members of the same family. However, as the current research is moving toward a more fine-grained evaluation, an increasingly complex picture begins to emerge. Some features, such as psychotic symptoms or severe language deficits (particularly in comprehension and verb processing), seem to occur more often in MND/dementia than in the classical FTD. On the basis of the review of 100 years of literature as well as 10 years of clinical experience of longitudinal follow-up of MND/dementia patients, this review argues in favor of MND/dementia (or, more precisely, MND/dementia/aphasia) as a separate clinical entity, not sufficiently explained by a combination of MND and FTD.",['Bak TH'],2010,13,Suppl 2,Ann Indian Acad Neurol,"Bak TH.

21366496,Contrasting effects of cerebrospinal fluid from motor neuron disease patients on the survival of primary motor neurons cultured with or without glia.,"Motor neuronal (MN) degeneration in motor neuron disease (MND) often starts focally before spreading to neighbouring MN populations, suggesting soluble factors may contribute to disease propagation. Whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from MND patients contains such factors has been difficult to prove. We aimed to determine the effect of glia on the response of MNs to CSF from MND patients. Primary rat spinal MNs grown in mono-culture or cocultured with glia were exposed to CSF from patients (MND-CSF) or controls (Con-CSF) and survival measured by cell counting. In mono-culture both MND-CSF and Con-CSF reduced MN survival with MND-CSF reducing MN survival by less than Con-CSF. In coculture MN survival was unchanged by exposure to MND-CSF while exposure to Con-CSF improved MN survival. In separate experiments, murine MNs grown in mono-culture and stressed by growth factor withdrawal were partially rescued by the application of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a trophic factor previously found to be elevated in MND-CSF. Our results suggest that MND-CSF may contain factors harmful to MNs as well as factors protective of MNs, the interplay of which is altered by the presence of glial cells. These preliminary results further emphasize the importance of MN environment to MN health.","['Barber SC', 'Wood-Allum CA', 'Sargsyan SA', 'Walsh T', 'Cox LE', 'Monk PN', 'Shaw PJ']",2011,12,4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Barber SC, et al.

21344999,Monomelic amyotrophy is not always benign: a case report.,"Monomelic amyotrophy (MA) is a variant of motor neuron disease (MND), characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy restricted to one limb. We describe the case of a 56-year-old Italian patient who developed a segmental muscular atrophy limited to the lower left limb. After 11 years of clinical stability he developed progressive spread of the disease to all limbs and to bulbar and respiratory muscles. The patient died from respiratory failure 15 years after disease onset. This case demonstrates that monomelic amyotrophy may rarely evolve to a diffuse fatal MND, even after more than a decade of clinical stability. Our findings support the idea that MA is part of the clinical continuum of MND.","['Moglia C', 'Calvo A', 'Cammarosano S', 'Ilardi A', 'Canosa A', 'Gallo S', 'Bersano E', 'Chiò A']",2011,12,4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Moglia C, et al.

21317158,Absence of disturbed axonal transport in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), or Kennedy's disease, is a late-onset motor neuron disease (MND) caused by an abnormal expansion of the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene on the X-chromosome, encoding a polyglutamine (poly-Q) sequence in the protein product. Mutant poly-Q-expanded AR protein is widely expressed but leads to selective lower motoneuron death. Although the mechanisms that underlie SBMA remain unclear, defective axonal transport has been implicated in MND and other forms of poly-Q disease. Transcriptional dysregulation may also be involved in poly-Q repeat pathology. We therefore examined axonal transport in a mouse model of SBMA recapitulating many aspects of the human disease. We found no difference in the expression levels of motor and the microtubule-associated protein tau, in the spinal cord and sciatic nerve of wild-type (WT) and SBMA mice at various stages of disease progression. Furthermore, we found no alteration in binding properties of motor proteins and tau to microtubules. Moreover, analysis of axonal transport rates both in cultured primary motoneurons in vitro and in vivo in the sciatic nerve of adult WT and mutant SBMA mice demonstrated no overt axonal transport deficits in these systems. Our results therefore indicate that unlike other motoneuron and poly-Q diseases, axonal transport deficits do not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of SBMA.","['Malik B', 'Nirmalananthan N', 'Bilsland LG', 'La Spada AR', 'Hanna MG', 'Schiavo G', 'Gallo JM', 'Greensmith L']",2011,20,9,Hum Mol Genet,"Malik B, et al.

21301035,[Yuasa-Mitsuyama disease].,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinical entity that comprises at least two distinct diseases: Pick's disease with Pick bodies and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau-negative and ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). FTLD-U is now usually referred to as FTLD-TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). FTLD-TDP-43, but not Pick's disease with tau-positive Pick bodies, is often associated with motor neuron disease (MND). More than 200 cases of this combined form, i.e., FTD-MND, have been reported in Japan. The neuropathological characteristics of MND in patients with FTD are essentially similar to the MND in patients without dementia. However the other characteristics of the combination of FTD and MND are such that the author has considered this disease a unique clinicopathological entity. These characteristics are as follows: (1) frontotemporal lobe-type dementia with insidious onset, usually in the presenile period; (2) neurogenic muscular wasting during the course of the illness [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]-- or [spinal progressive muscular atrophy (SPMA)]-like symptoms); (3) duration from the onset of illness to death is 2-5 years (average duration, 30.6 months); (4) both extrapyramidal symptoms and definite sensory deficiency are less commonly observed; (5) no characteristic abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or on the electroencephalogram (EEG) in screening tests; (6) no known parental consanguinity or familial occurrence; and (7) nonspecific mild-to-slight degenerative changes in the frontotemporal cortex, hypoglossal nuclei, spinal cord, and frequently in the substantia nigra. FTD-MND is characterized by ubiquitin-immunoreactive intraneuronal inclusions in cortical layers II and III and the hippocampal dentate granule cells. The occurrence of ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative and ubiquitinated TDP-43 positive inclusions could be the key to determining the pathological background of this disease. Further studies are required clinicopathological differentiation between FTD-MND and ALS-dementia (ALS-D).",['Mitsuyama Y'],2011,63,2,Brain Nerve,Mitsuyama Y. [Yuasa-Mitsuyama disease].

21250942,Dysregulation of axonal transport and motorneuron diseases.,"MNDs (motorneuron diseases) are neurodegenerative disorders in which motorneurons located in the motor cortex, in the brainstem and in the spinal cord are affected. These diseases in their inherited or sporadic forms are mainly characterized by motor dysfunctions, occasionally associated with cognitive and behavioural alterations. Although these diseases show high variability in onset, progression and clinical symptoms, they share common pathological features, and motorneuronal loss invariably leads to muscle weakness and atrophy. One of the most relevant aspect of these disorders is the occurrence of defects in axonal transport, which have been postulated to be either a direct cause, or a consequence, of motorneuron degeneration. In fact, due to their peculiar morphology and high energetic metabolism, motorneurons deeply rely on efficient axonal transport processes. Dysfunction of axonal transport is known to adversely affect motorneuronal metabolism, inducing progressive degeneration and cell death. In this regard, the understanding of the fine mechanisms at the basis of the axonal transport process and of their possible alterations may help shed light on MND pathological processes. In the present review, we will summarize what is currently known about the alterations of axonal transport found to be either causative or a consequence of MNDs.","['Sau D', 'Rusmini P', 'Crippa V', 'Onesto E', 'Bolzoni E', 'Ratti A', 'Poletti A']",2011,103,2,Biol Cell,"Sau D, et al.

The first article on Alzheimer's disease (AD) outlines the major evidence available to date that links Aβ-amyloid peptide as a proximal cause of AD. The article also highlights how an initial finding of the protein content of the amyloid plaque seen in the brains of patients with AD has led to many very significant findings in the neuroscience field. The next section outlines the many and recent advances that have occurred in the field of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), including the most recent finding related to the fused sarcoma gene (FUS) and the newest nomenclature whereby the FTLD is subtyped according to the presence of specific proteins seen at a microscopic level. The section on Lewy bodies outlines the latest advances in the relationship between the anatomical distribution of Lewy bodies and disease phenotype. The following section includes an overview of current known genetic links with familial causes of motor neuron disease (MND) and an update on the areas being researched into the causes of sporadic MND. The presence of TDP-43 within inclusions and its new diagnostic role in MND are discussed. The final article on prion diseases gives an overview of human prion diseases, including the phenotypic spectrum, epidemiology and diagnostic investigations relevant to disease.","['Masters CL', 'Kril JJ', 'Halliday GM', 'Pamphlett R', 'Collins S', 'Hill AF', 'McLean C']",2011,43,2,Pathology,"Masters CL, et al.

21225272,Motor neuron disease clinically limited to the lower motor neuron is a diffuse TDP-43 proteinopathy.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) may present as an isolated lower motor neuron (LMN) disorder. Although the significance of pathological 43 kDa transactive responsive sequence DNA binding protein (TDP-43) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was appreciated only recently, the topographical distribution of TDP-43 pathology in MND clinically isolated to the LMN versus normal controls (COs) is only incompletely described. Therefore, we performed longitudinal clinical evaluation and retrospective chart review of autopsied patients diagnosed with isolated LMN disease. Cases with a disease duration over 4 years were designated as progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), and those with a more rapid course as MND/LMN. Immunohistochemistry was employed to identify neuronal and glial TDP-43 pathology in the central nervous system (CNS) in patients and COs. We examined 19 subjects including six patients (i.e., four with MND/LMN and two with PMA) and 13 COs. All patients showed significant TDP-43 linked degeneration of LMNs, and five cases showed a lesser degree of motor cortex degeneration. Additional brain areas were affected in varying degrees, ranging from predominantly brainstem pathology to significant involvement of the whole CNS including neocortical and limbic areas. Pathological TDP-43 was present only rarely in the CO group. We conclude that MND limited to the LMN and PMA is part of a disease continuum that includes ALS and FTLD-TDP, all of which are characterized by widespread TDP-43 pathology. Hence, we suggest that the next revision of the El Escorial criteria for the diagnosis of ALS include MND patients with disease clinically limited to the LMN and PMA as variants of ALS, which like classical ALS, are TDP-43 proteinopathies.","['Geser F', 'Stein B', 'Partain M', 'Elman LB', 'McCluskey LF', 'Xie SX', 'Van Deerlin VM', 'Kwong LK', 'Lee VM', 'Trojanowski JQ']",2011,121,4,Acta Neuropathol,"Geser F, et al.

We conducted a qualitative study with face-to-face interviews to capture experiences from 24 people with ALS/MND and 18 current family carers. Ten former family carers were also interviewed. The diagnostic experience was fraught with difficulties. There was failure to recognize the significance of some symptoms by patients, carers and primary and secondary care health professionals, which ultimately delayed diagnosis. Delivery of the diagnosis was frequently unsatisfactory despite international guidelines on the subject. Immediate post-diagnosis support often compared negatively to that provided for people with cancer. In conclusion, this study has identified a need for a more streamlined and empathetic diagnostic pathway for people with ALS/MND. Improvements to medical curricula are required to increase awareness of the condition and reduce the likelihood of diagnostic delays resulting from a failure to recognize the need for a neurological referral. Greater public awareness of the illness is also needed. Furthermore, delivery of the diagnosis should more closely adhere to established guidelines.","[""O'Brien MR"", 'Whitehead B', 'Jack BA', 'Mitchell JD']",2011,12,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"O'Brien MR, et al.

21198417,Increase in motor neuron disease mortality in Spain: temporal and geographical analysis (1990-2005).,"The aim of this study was to assess the trend of motor neuron disease mortality in Spain from 1990 to 2005, and to ascertain the existence of geographical differences in mortality rates. MND deaths are registered by the National Statistics Institute of Spain – International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes ICD9 335.2 (1990-1998) and ICD10 G12.2 (1999-2005). Annual sex- and age-specific rates, as well as rates adjusted for the standard European population were obtained. Provincial standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for the study period. Respective provincial SMRs were smoothed with data from adjacent provinces using a Poisson model. Results showed that MND mortality increased in Spain from 1990 to 2005. Geographical differences between provinces were evident throughout the study period. In general, risk of death due to MND was higher in regions lying to the north of Spain. In conclusion, the temporal and geographical variability observed might be explained by genetic factors, differences in environmental exposures and the possible influence of the type of medical care and treatment received. Mortality depends also on health service quality and diagnostic validity. All these factors may play a very important role in analysis of MND mortality in Spain, and the contribution of each of these will have to be examined in depth by ad hoc studies.","['Alonso V', 'Villaverde-Hueso A', 'Hens MJ', 'Morales-Piga A', 'Abaitua I', 'de la Paz MP']",2011,12,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Alonso V, et al.

21195356,Effects of gender in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is more common in men than in women and that gender influences the clinical features of the disease. The causes of this are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This review examines the gender differences that are found in ALS and postulates reasons for these differences.
METHODS: A literature review of PubMed (with no date limits) was performed to find information about gender differences in the incidence, prevalence, and clinical features of ALS, using the search terms ALS or MND and gender or sex, ALS prevalence, and SOD1 mice and gender. Articles were reviewed for information about gender differences, together with other articles that were already known to the authors.
RESULTS: The incidence and prevalence of ALS are greater in men than in women. This gender difference is seen in large studies that included all ALS patients (sporadic and familial), but is not seen when familial ALS is studied independently. Men predominate in the younger age groups of patients with ALS. Sporadic ALS has different clinical features in men and women, with men having a greater likelihood of onset in the spinal regions, and women tending to have onset in the bulbar region. Gender appears to have no clear effect on survival. In animals with superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1) mutations, sex does affect the clinical course of disease, with earlier onset in males. Possible reasons for the differences in ALS between men and women include different exposures to environmental toxins, different biological responses to exogenous toxins, and possibly underlying differences between the male and female nervous systems and different abilities to repair damage.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a complex interaction between gender and clinical phenotypes in ALS. Understanding the causes of the gender differences could give clues to processes that modify the disease.","['McCombe PA', 'Henderson RD']",2010,7,6,Gend Med,McCombe PA and Henderson RD.

21188408,Summary of cerebrospinal fluid routine parameters in neurodegenerative diseases.,"In neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) is predominantly performed to exclude inflammatory diseases and to perform a risk assessment in dementive disorders by measurement of tau proteins and amyloid beta peptides. However, large scale data on basic findings of CSF routine parameters are generally lacking. The objective of the study was to define a normal reference spectrum of routine CSF parameters in neurodegenerative diseases. Routine CSF parameters (white cell count, lactate and albumin concentrations, CSF/serum quotients of albumin (Q (alb)), IgG, IgA, IgM, and oligoclonal IgG bands (OCB)) were retrospectively analyzed in an academic research setting. A total of 765 patients (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), vascular dementia (VD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multisystem atrophy (MSA), motor neuron diseases (MND), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Huntington's disease (HD)) and non-demented control groups including a group of patients with muscular disorders (MD). The main outcome measures included statistical analyses of routine CSF parameters. Mildly elevated Q (alb) were found in a small percentage of nearly all subgroups and in a higher proportion of patients with PSP, MSA, VD, PDD, and MND. With the exception of 1 MND patient, no intrathecal Ig synthesis was observed. Isolated OCBs in CSF were sometimes found in patients with neurodegenerative diseases without elevated cell counts; lactate levels were always normal. A slightly elevated Q (alb) was observed in a subgroup of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and does not exclude the diagnosis. Extensive elevation of routine parameters is not characteristic and should encourage a re-evaluation of the clinical diagnosis.","['Jesse S', 'Brettschneider J', 'Süssmuth SD', 'Landwehrmeyer BG', 'von Arnim CA', 'Ludolph AC', 'Tumani H', 'Otto M']",2011,258,6,J Neurol,"Jesse S, et al.

We describe clinical, neurophysiologic, and neuroimaging features of affected subjects in the index families. NTE-MND subjects exhibited progressive lower extremity spastic weakness that began in childhood and was later associated with atrophy of distal leg and intrinsic hand muscles. NTE-MND resembles Troyer syndrome, except that short stature, cognitive impairment, and dysmorphic features, which often accompany Troyer syndrome, are not features of NTE-MND. Early onset, symmetry, and slow progression distinguish NTE-MND from typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. NTE is implicated in organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN). NTE-MND patients have upper and lower motor neuron deficits that are similar to OPIDN. Motor neuron degeneration in subjects with NTE mutations supports the role of NTE and its biochemical cascade in the molecular pathogenesis of OPIDN and possibly other degenerative neurologic disorders.","['Rainier S', 'Albers JW', 'Dyck PJ', 'Eldevik OP', 'Wilcock S', 'Richardson RJ', 'Fink JK']",2011,43,1,Muscle Nerve,"Rainier S, et al.

21118398,"Ubiquitinated, p62 immunopositive cerebellar cortical neuronal inclusions are evident across the spectrum of TDP-43 proteinopathies but are only rarely additionally immunopositive for phosphorylation-dependent TDP-43.","Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTLD-MND/ALS) and MND/ALS are thought to represent a clinicopathological spectrum of TDP-43 proteinopathies. The cerebellum has been little studied in these conditions, probably because of the lack of cerebellar signs in most cases. We examined p62 immunohistochemistry on cerebellar sections from 43 TDP-43 proteinopathies (including cases of FTLD-TDP, FTLD-MND/ALS and MND/ALS) together with 72 cases of other neurodegenerative diseases, seven controls and three other disease conditions. In 11 of the TDP-43 proteinopathies (26%) there were numerous p62-positive cerebellar inclusions, predominantly within the granular layer, but also the molecular and Purkinje cell layer. Furthermore, only one of the remaining 82 cases (a familial tauopathy) showed similar p62 positivity. Immunohistochemistry for ubiquitin was positive in the granular layer inclusions. The immunohistochemistry for phosphorylation-independent TDP-43, hyperphosphorylated tau, α-synuclein, fusion sarcoma protein (FUS), and neurofilament was negative. In only one case (a case of FTLD-TDP) were the inclusions positive for phosphorylation-dependent TDP43 (p-TDP-43). Those TDP-43 proteinopathy cases that showed the cerebellar inclusions also tended to display other common features, such as a notable excess of p62 pathology when compared to TDP-43 pathology, especially within the pyramidal neurones of the hippocampus but also in some cases within the neocortex. The results suggest that p62-positive inclusions within the cerebellum are seen in a proportion of cases across the range of the TDP-43 proteinopathy spectrum and they appear to be relatively specific for this group of diseases. The question as to whether these cerebellar-positive cases represent a distinct subgroup remains to be answered.

21094208,Different early ER-stress responses in the CLN8(mnd) mouse model of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.,"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by epilepsy, progressive motor and cognitive decline, blindness, and by the accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment. Late-infantile onset forms (LINCL) include those linked to mutations in CLN8 gene, encoding a transmembrane protein at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse model of the CLN8-LINCL (CLN8(mnd)), we carried out an analysis of ER stress-related molecules in CNS structures that exhibit a variable rate of disease progression (early retinal degeneration and delayed brain and motoneuron dysfunction). At the presymptomatic state of 1-month-old CLN8(mnd) mice, we found an upregulation of GRP78 and activation of the transcription factor-6 (ATF6) in all structures examined, an activation of a CHOP-dependent pathway in the cerebellum, hippocampus and retina, a caspase-12-dependent pathway in the retina and no activation of these two pathways in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord. An increased CHOP expression was detected in the cortex and spinal cord at the early symptomatic state (4 months). Caspase-3 cleavage occurred presymptomatically in the cerebellum, hippocampus and retina, and symptomatically in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord. We also monitored activation of NF-κB, which is engaged in the alarming phase of ER stress, together with increased levels of TRAF2, TNF-α and TNFR1, and no activation of ASK-1/JNK signalling pathway, all over mnd structures. The results suggest that early ER-stress responses distinctly combined and ER-stress pathways integrated with inflammatory responses may contribute to the progression of the CLN8(mnd) disease in CNS structures.","['Galizzi G', 'Russo D', 'Deidda I', 'Cascio C', 'Passantino R', 'Guarneri R', 'Bigini P', 'Mennini T', 'Drago G', 'Guarneri P']",2011,488,3,Neurosci Lett,"Galizzi G, et al.

21044073,Neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures are associated with changes in glial-neuronal interactions in the hippocampus of a mouse model of epilepsy with mental retardation.,"Hippocampal excitability and the metabolic glial-neuronal interactions were investigated in 22-week-old mice with motor neuron degeneration (mnd), a model of progressive epilepsy with mental retardation. Mnd mice developed spontaneous spikes in the hippocampus and were more susceptible to kainate-induced seizures compared with control mice. Neuronal hyperexcitability in their hippocampus was confirmed by the selective increase of c-Fos positive nuclei. Glial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines over-expression were observed in the hippocampus of mnd mice, even in the absence of marked hippocampal neurodegeneration, as suggested by unchanged amounts of neuroactive amino acids and N-acetyl aspartate. Concentration of other amino acids, including GABA and glutamate, was not changed as well. However, ex vivo(13) C magnetic resonance spectroscopy, after simultaneous injection of [1-(13) C]glucose and [1,2-(13) C]acetate, followed by decapitation, showed decreased [1,2-(13) C]GABA formation from hippocampal astrocytic precursors and a marked reduction in [4,5-(13) C]glutamate derived from glutamine. We suggest that astrocyte dysfunction plays a primary role in the pathology and that mnd mice are of value to investigate early pathogenetic mechanism of progressive epilepsy with mental retardation.","['Melø T', 'Bigini P', 'Sonnewald U', 'Balosso S', 'Cagnotto A', 'Barbera S', 'Uboldi S', 'Vezzani A', 'Mennini T']",2010,115,6,J Neurochem,"Melø T, et al.

METHOD: Studies on the relationship between aspects of control and demographic, clinical and psychological factors were collated and reviewed using a narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: Forty-four papers were found which examined different types of both disease and life control. PD studies had not examined self-efficacy or helplessness and only locus of control was used in MND studies. Age, gender and disease duration were not consistently related to control, but greater participant-rated physical impairment was associated with lower perception of some control concepts. The association between symptom control and psychological wellbeing was weak and may be disease dependent. Stronger positive relationships were found between psychosocial wellbeing and both global life control and self-efficacy for disease management and adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research, particularly longitudinal, is needed. Perceptions of control were not completely determined by disease stage/disability. Increased perception of certain types of control was associated with wellbeing and thus interventions should be developed to promote increased control. Although results were dominated by MS, they appear largely applicable to people with PD but more caution is needed for MND.","['Eccles FJ', 'Simpson J']",2011,33,13-14,Disabil Rehabil,"Eccles FJ and Simpson J.

21039118,Survival and prognostic factors of motor neuron disease in a multi-ethnic Asian population.,"Our objective was to determine the survival and prognostic factors of motor neuron disease (MND) in a multi-ethnic cohort of Malaysian patients. All patients seen at a university medical centre between January 2000 and December 2009 had their case records reviewed for demographic, clinical and follow-up data. Mortality data, if unavailable from records, were obtained by telephone interview of relatives or from the national mortality registry. Of the 73 patients, 64.4% were Chinese, 19.2% Malays and 16.4% Indians. Male: female ratio was 1.43: 1. Mean age at onset was 51.5 + 11.3 years. Onset was spinal in 75.3% and bulbar in 24.7% of the patients; 94.5% were ALS and 5.5% were progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). Overall median survival was 44.9 + 5.8 months. Ethnic Indians had shorter interval from symptom onset to diagnosis and shorter median survival compared to non-Indians. On Cox proportional hazards analysis, poor prognostic factors were bulbar onset, shorter interval from symptom onset to diagnosis and worse functional score at presentation. In conclusion, age of onset and median survival duration are similar to previous reports in Asians. Clinical features and prognostic factors are similar to other populations. In our cohort, ethnic Indians had more rapid disease course accounting for their shorter survival.","['Goh KJ', 'Tian S', 'Shahrizaila N', 'Ng CW', 'Tan CT']",2011,12,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Goh KJ, et al.

21031579,Sigma nonopioid intracellular receptor 1 mutations cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration-motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the most common cause of early-onset dementia. Pathological ubiquitinated inclusion bodies observed in FTLD and motor neuron disease (MND) comprise trans-activating response element (TAR) DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and/or fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein. Our objective was to identify the causative gene in an FTLD-MND pedigree with no mutations in known dementia genes.
METHODS: A mutation screen of candidate genes, luciferase assays, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to identify the biological role of the putative mutation. Neuropathological characterization of affected individuals and western blot studies of cell lines were performed to identify the pathological mechanism of the mutation.
RESULTS: We identified a nonpolymorphic mutation (c.672*51G>T) in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the Sigma nonopioid intracellular receptor 1 (SIGMAR1) gene in affected individuals from the FTLD-MND pedigree. The c.672*51G>T mutation increased gene expression by 1.4-fold, corresponding with a significant 1.5-fold to 2-fold change in the SIGMAR1 transcript or Sigma-1 protein in lymphocyte or brain tissue. Brains of SIGMAR1 mutation carriers displayed a unique pathology with cytoplasmic inclusions immunopositive for either TDP-43 or FUS but not Sigma-1. Overexpression of SIGMAR1 shunted TDP-43 and FUS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by 2.3-fold and 5.2-fold, respectively. Treatment of cells with Sigma-1 ligands significantly altered translocation of TDP-43 by up to 2-fold.
INTERPRETATION: SIGMAR1 is a causative gene for familial FTLD-MND with a unique neuropathology that differs from other FTLD and MND cases. Our findings also suggest Sigma-1 drugs as potential treatments for the TDP-43/FUS proteinopathies.","['Luty AA', 'Kwok JB', 'Dobson-Stone C', 'Loy CT', 'Coupland KG', 'Karlström H', 'Sobow T', 'Tchorzewska J', 'Maruszak A', 'Barcikowska M', 'Panegyres PK', 'Zekanowski C', 'Brooks WS', 'Williams KL', 'Blair IP', 'Mather KA', 'Sachdev PS', 'Halliday GM', 'Schofield PR']",2010,68,5,Ann Neurol,"Luty AA, et al.

20960930,[A case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal lobar degeneration with apraxia of eyelid opening].,"We report the case of a 76-year-old man with apraxia of eyelid opening (AEO) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia (ALS-D)/frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). The initial symptom was AEO. Neurological examination revealed mainly bulbar symptoms with a neurogenic pattern on needle electromyograms of the tongue muscles and the biceps muscles. Furthermore, he developed severe dementia with frontal lobe dysfunction and progressive non-fluent aphasia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe cerebral atrophy and leukoaraiosis in the bilateral frontal lobes and the anterior part of the bilateral temporal lobes; brain 99mTc ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon emission computed tomography (ECD SPECT) showed hypoperfusion in the same areas. The patient showed improvement in stereotyped behavior and AEO after treatment with 50 mg/day of fluvoxamine maleate (the initial dose was 25 mg/day). Because serotonin receptors are markedly reduced in the frontal and temporal cortexes of patients with FTLD, we considered that dysfunction of the serotonergic system in the frontotemporal lobe caused AEO. Considering the findings of this case along with those of previous reports, we propose that there is a relatively homogeneous development of ALS-D/FTLD-MND with AEO.","['Yajima R', 'Kasuga K', 'Sato T', 'Ikeuchi T', 'Nishizawa M']",2010,50,9,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Yajima R, et al.

We also studied search engine responses to questions about life expectancy and possible 'cure'. An internet search engine in relation to ALS currently lacks sensitivity, and results varied greatly with only minor differences in the search terms used. The prognostic information did not reflect the inherent heterogeneity. Results in relation to 'cure' were misleading and may promulgate false hopes.

20843169,Preparing for a U.S. National ALS Registry: Lessons from a pilot project in the State of Georgia.,"Our objective was to investigate the utility of existing data sources for identifying cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related motor neuron diseases (MND) in the State of Georgia. Data were acquired from Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Emory Healthcare, community neurologists, the ALS Association, and mortality records for ALS/MND patients residing in Georgia during 2001-2005. A neurologist used abstracted medical records to verify the diagnosis of ALS/MND. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an ICD code for a verified diagnosis of ALS was estimated. Simple 'rules' were developed to improve PPV. Results showed that a total of 2413 unique potential cases were identified in existing data sources. Medical records of 579 cases were available for review; the diagnosis of ALS (or a related MND) was confirmed in 486 (PPV = 84%) cases. Predictive rules, which permitted classification of ∼80% of the chart-reviewed population, improved PPV to 96-98%. In conclusion, existing data sources are useful for identifying cases of ALS/MND; most data sources contribute a substantial number of unique cases. Predictive algorithms may permit correct classification of a large proportion of cases without the need for verification based on medical record review.","['Benatar M', 'Wuu J', 'Usher S', 'Ward K']",2011,12,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Benatar M, et al.

20810131,Clinicopathological characteristics of FTLD-TDP showing corticospinal tract degeneration but lacking lower motor neuron loss.,"The presence of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) showing corticospinal tract (CST) degeneration but lacking lower motor neuron (LMN) loss has been reported, and the term primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is used to distinguish motor neuron disease (MND) of these cases from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To date, however, details of clinicopathological findings of FTLD-MND-PLS type (FTLD-MND-P) have not been reported. We evaluated medical records and histopathological findings of ten cases of FTLD-MND-P, in comparison with those of six FTLD-MND-ALS type (FTLD-MND-A) cases. The mean age at onset and disease duration of FTLD-MND-P cases were 54 and 12 years, respectively. The first symptoms were frontotemporal dementia showing behavioral abnormality and/or personality change in five cases, semantic dementia in three cases, progressive non-fluent aphasia in one case, and auditory hallucination in one case. Upper motor neuron signs were clinically identified in six of the ten cases. There were no LMN signs throughout the clinical course in any case. Histopathologically, there was no obvious LMN loss or Bunina bodies in the hypoglossal nucleus or spinal cord in any case, whereas the CST was involved in all cases. The cerebral cortex of the six cases showed type 1 of TDP-43 histology defined by Cairns et al., whereas three cases showed type 3 histology, and one case showed type 2 histology. In all cases, TDP-43 positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were absent or rare in the LMNs, while TDP-43 positive round structures were frequently identified in the neuropil of the spinal cord anterior horn in some cases.

20801763,MR spectroscopy findings in early stages of motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Upper motor neuron degeneration varies in different phenotypes of MND. We used single-voxel MR spectroscopy of the primary motor cortex to detect corticomotoneuron degeneration and glial hyperactivity in different phenotypes of MND with a relatively short disease duration, contributing to further delineation of the phenotypes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively included patients with ALS-B, ALS-L, and PMA and compared their data with those of patients with PLS and healthy controls. Each cohort consisted of 12 individuals. Disease duration was <1 year in ALS and PMA, but longer in PLS by definition. Follow-up examination was at 6 months. We measured ALSFRS-R, finger- and foot-tapping speed, and levels of the following: 1) NAAx, 2) mIns, and 3) Glx in the primary motor cortex.
RESULTS: At baseline, we found significantly decreased NAAx levels and increased mIns levels in PLS. Levels of NAAx and mIns in patients with ALS-L and ALS-B were not significantly different from those in controls, but NAAx levels were significantly lower compared with those in PMA. At follow-up, only in PMA was a decrease of NAAx demonstrated. Glx levels varied widely in all groups. Levels of NAAx and mIns correlated well with clinical variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolite changes suggest neuronal dysfunction and active glial involvement in PLS. The corticomotoneuron is affected in early ALS-B and ALS-L, but at a later stage also in PMA. MR spectroscopy data are useful to obtain insight into the disease process at the level of the upper motor neuron in various phenotypes of MND.","['van der Graaff MM', 'Lavini C', 'Akkerman EM', 'Majoie ChB', 'Nederveen AJ', 'Zwinderman AH', 'Brugman F', 'van den Berg LH', 'de Jong JM', 'de Visser M']",2010,31,10,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,"van der Graaff MM, et al.

20731208,[Phoniatric and laryngologic symptoms in motor neuron disease (MND)].,"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease is a progressive neurologic disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord.
THE AIM OF THIS STUDY: Was to present methods of therapy and rehabilitation in patients with MND and the role of phoniatrician and otolaryngologist in diagnostic and therapeutic process. MATERIAL AND METHOD, RESULTS: The material of present study consists of 3 patients in the age of 38 to 55 who were admitted to The Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing in Warsaw, Poland. Patients underwent laryngological, phoniatric and neurologopedics examinations. They were treated with phoniatric and logopedics rehabilitation strategy applying manual therapy of voice, speech exercises and courses of physiotherapy. As a result of therapeutical management, quality of speech and voice were improved.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. Disorders of voice and speech may be early symptoms of motor neuron disease; 2. Patients with motor neuron disease require multidisciplinary therapy, including otolaryngologists and phoniatricians; 3. Acoustic analysis of voice (MDVP) presents more often disorders in frequency range than amplitude changes; 4. Intensive and regular excercises are crucial for the improvement in speech communication.","['Miśkiewicz B', 'Szkiełkowska A', 'Ratyńska J', 'Skoczylas A', 'Skarzyński H']",2010,64,3,Otolaryngol Pol,"Miśkiewicz B, et al.

20726457,Motor neurone disease: a practical update on diagnosis and management.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease which leads inexorably via weakness of limb, bulbar and respiratory muscles to death from respiratory failure three to five years later. Most MND is sporadic but approximately 10% is inherited. In exciting recent breakthroughs two new MND genes have been identified. Diagnosis is clinical and sometimes difficult--treatable mimics must be excluded before the diagnosis is ascribed. Riluzole prolongs life by only three to four months and is only available for the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) form of MND. Management therefore properly focuses on symptom relief and the preservation of independence and quality of life. Malnutrition is a poor prognostic factor. In appropriate patients enteral feeding is recommended although its use has yet to be shown to improve survival. In ALS patients with respiratory failure and good or only moderately impaired bulbar function non-invasive positive pressure ventilation prolongs life and improves quality of life.","['Wood-Allum C', 'Shaw PJ']",2010,10,3,Clin Med (Lond),Wood-Allum C and Shaw PJ.

20719422,'All in the same boat'? Patient and carer attitudes to peer support and social comparison in Motor Neurone Disease (MND).,"This paper explores attitudes to peer support among people with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) and their family carers. It reports findings from a secondary analysis of data from two UK interview studies conducted by the authors. The process of secondary analysis is reported in detail. 48 people with MND and 22 carers were interviewed in 2005-2007. The authors identified narrative extracts on peer support from their own datasets and exchanged them for independent thematic analysis. Subsequent discussion, drawing on literature on support groups and social comparison, led to an exploration of two overarching themes: valuing camaraderie and comparison, and choosing isolation. Findings suggest that social comparison theory is a useful framework for analysing attitudes to MND support groups, but that on its own it is insufficient. 'Valuing camaraderie and comparison' explains how support groups offer practical and social support, as well as beneficial opportunities for social comparison. Seeing others coping well with the condition can provide hope, while downward comparison with those worse off can also make people feel better about their own situation. However, most people are also shocked and saddened by seeing others with the condition. Tension of identity can occur when group membership starts to define the individual as 'a person with MND, rather than the person I am that happens to have MND'. Choosing isolation can be a deliberate defensive strategy, to protect oneself from witnessing one's possible future. Levels of involvement may change over time as people struggle with their changing needs and fears.","['Locock L', 'Brown JB']",2010,71,8,Soc Sci Med,Locock L and Brown JB. 'All in the same boat'?

Brain magnetic resonance images demonstrated severe atrophy in the anterior temporal lobes from early clinical stage. The symptoms got rapidly worsened and the patient died of respiratory failure 1year 8months after the disease onset. A postmortem study revealed severe and circumscribed atrophy in the anterior temporal lobes, and histological examination disclosed marked neuronal loss with many neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions which were immunoreactive for ubiquitin antibodies and phosphorylated TAR DNA-binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43) antibodies in hippocampal dentate granule cells and amygdalae, as well as a few neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions without dystrophic neurites in the temporal neocortex.

20669307,Parkinsonism and motor neuron diseases: twenty-seven patients with diverse overlap syndromes.,"It has long been recognized that signs of motor neuron disease (MND) may accompany clinical evidence of parkinsonism in different neurodegenerative conditions. By using the Columbia University Division of Movement Disorders database, we reviewed data from 5,500 cases of parkinsonism and recorded the presence of upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction, lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction, or both. Among the 27 patients so identified, we counted those with autonomic dysfunction, cerebellar dysfunction, or dementia. Among the 27 cases, seven had UMN signs and LMN signs as well as parkinsonism and were diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-parkinsonism (Brait-Fahn disease). Three of the seven had dementia that was not deemed to be frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Six other patients had no LMN signs but had UMN signs and parkinsonism and were classified as having primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)-parkinsonism. Four patients had both UMN and LMN signs with parkinsonism as well as the characteristic dementia of FTD; they were diagnosed with FTD-parkinsonism-ALS. Seven patients had MND, parkinsonism, and autonomic or cerebellar dysfunction, a combination compatible with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Three patients had syndromes compatible with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). In sum, we found that MND occurs in association with diverse parkinsonian syndromes; some are heritable, others sporadic and causes are uncertain. Having MND may be a risk factor for parkinsonism. A prospective study may elucidate this possibility.","['Gilbert RM', 'Fahn S', 'Mitsumoto H', 'Rowland LP']",2010,25,12,Mov Disord,"Gilbert RM, et al.

20668908,Human motor neuron generation from embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons. There are currently no cures or efficacious treatments for these diseases. In recent years, significant developments in stem cell research have been applied to MNDs, particularly regarding neuroprotection and cell replacement. However, a consistent source of motor neurons for cell replacement is required. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) could provide an inexhaustible supply of differentiated cell types, including motor neurons that could be used for MND therapies. Recently, it has been demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells may serve as an alternative source of motor neurons, since they share ES characteristics, self-renewal, and the potential to differentiate into any somatic cell type. In this review, we discuss several reproducible methods by which hESCs or iPS cells are efficiently isolated and differentiated into functional motor neurons, and possible clinical applications.","['Nizzardo M', 'Simone C', 'Falcone M', 'Locatelli F', 'Riboldi G', 'Comi GP', 'Corti S']",2010,67,22,Cell Mol Life Sci,"Nizzardo M, et al.

Neither Bunina bodies nor inclusions positive for ubiquitin/phosphorylated TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kD (pTDP-43), such as skein-like or round inclusions, were observed. However, basophilic inclusions (BIs) were frequently observed in the remaining neurons of the anterior horns, facial nuclei, hypoglossal nuclei, vestibular nuclei, dentate nuclei and inferior olivary nuclei. In an immunohistochemical analysis, the BIs showed strong immunoreactivity with anti-FUS and anti-ubiquitin-binding protein p62 (p62) antibodies. The nuclear staining of FUS was preserved in some neurons with FUS-positive inclusions, and a few FUS-positive glial inclusions were found. FUS-positive inclusions were more common than p62-positive inclusions in some anatomical regions, and in some neurons, p62 immunoreactivity was observed in only parts of the BIs. These results suggest that BI formation and TDP-43 aggregation have different pathogenic mechanisms, and FUS may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MND with BIs. This patient has the oldest reported age of onset for MND with BIs, and clinical features observed in this patient were indistinguishable from those of classic sporadic MND. Therefore, we consider that the age of onset and clinical features of FUS-related disorders may be variable.","['Fujita Y', 'Fujita S', 'Takatama M', 'Ikeda M', 'Okamoto K']",2011,31,2,Neuropathology,"Fujita Y, et al.

20625272,Survival in frontotemporal lobar degeneration in a Korean population.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) can be subdivided into frontotemporal dementia (FTD), FTD combined with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), semantic dementia (SD), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). FTLD has been considered a rare disorder, and its' demographic and survival data have rarely been studied in Asian population. A survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was performed for 121 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed FTLD who attended the Memory Disorder Clinic at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Republic of Korea, between January 1995 and September 2006. The overall median survival from the onset of the first symptom was 9.6 years (95% CI=8.3-10.8 y). The survival was shortest in FTD-MND (3 y) and longest in SD (11.3 y). The median survival time of FTD (9.8 y) was shorter than that of SD and longer than that of FTD-MND and PNFA. The use of the Cox proportional-hazards model to examine the effect of demographics on survival revealed that only age at onset was associated with survival. In general, our data are comparable with those from the Western countries. However, the female proportion was greater across all subtypes of FTLD and the survival of patients with PNFA was shorter than those of other groups.","['Kang SJ', 'Cha KR', 'Seo SW', 'Kim EA', 'Cheong HK', 'Kim EJ', 'Na DL', 'Jeong JH']",2010,24,4,Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,"Kang SJ, et al.

20603202,Motor neuron disease due to neuropathy target esterase mutation: enzyme analysis of fibroblasts from human subjects yields insights into pathogenesis.,"Recently, we identified neuropathy target esterase (NTE) mutation as the cause of an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease (NTE-MND). Subsequently, we showed that NTE-MND mutations reduced specific activity (SA) and altered inhibitory kinetics of NTE catalytic domain constructs. Recent preliminary results showed that NTE is expressed in cultured human skin fibroblasts, and others have used mutant forms of neuronal proteins expressed in fibroblasts as biomarkers of neurogenetic diseases. Therefore, the present study was carried out to test the hypothesis that NTE in cultured skin fibroblasts from NTE-MND subjects also exhibit altered enzymological properties assessed by SA and IC(50) values of mipafox (MIP) and chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO). NTE SA was reduced to 65% of control (wild-type NTE from commercially obtained fibroblasts) in homozygous M1012V fibroblasts and 59-61% of control in compound heterozygous R890H/c2946_2947InsCAGC fibroblasts. MIP IC(50) values were unaffected by the NTE mutations, but the CPO IC(50) increased 4.5-fold in homozygous M1012V fibroblasts. Interestingly, markedly reduced NTE SAs (40-43% of control) were observed in fibroblasts from asymptomatic subjects heterozygous for NTE insertion c2946_2947InsCAGC. This insertion is predicted to produce truncated NTE missing the last 235 residues of its catalytic domain. These observations confirm that NTE-MND mutations reduce NTE SA in vitro. Moreover, to the extent observations made in cultured fibroblasts may be generalized to events in the nervous system, lack of correlation between reduced fibroblast NTE SA and the occurrence of NTE-MND in NTE insertion mutation heterozygotes indicates that reduction of NTE SA alone is insufficient to cause MND.","['Hein ND', 'Rainier SR', 'Richardson RJ', 'Fink JK']",2010,199,1,Toxicol Lett,"Hein ND, et al.

METHODS: Subjects included two 70-year-old women presenting with rapidly progressive severe postural instability, axial-predominant parkinsonism, oculomotor dysfunction and frontal-predominant dementia with language impairment and pseudobulbar palsy. One had diffuse weakness without signs of lower motor neuron disease. Post-mortem evaluations included immunohistochemistry with antiphospho-TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and genetic analysis of the TARDBP and PGRN genes.
RESULTS: Subjects died within 14 months from symptom onset. TDP-43-positive neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions were prominent in the primary motor cortex, granule cell layer of the hippocampus, and several cranial and spinal cord nuclei. TDP-43 globular glial inclusions (GGI) were identified in one case. There were no mutations in PGRN or TARDBP genes.
CONCLUSIONS: FTLD-MND due to TDP-43-proteinopathy should be considered in patients with rapidly progressive parkinsonism and dementia phenotype, especially when aphasia and/or weakness are also present.","['Espay AJ', 'Spina S', 'Houghton DJ', 'Murrell JR', 'de Courten-Myers GM', 'Ghetti B', 'Litvan I']",2011,82,7,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Espay AJ, et al.

Key diagnostic timelines (dates of first symptom, diagnosis and death) were reviewed for people diagnosed between 1989 and 2008. Patients evaluated through a fast-track diagnostic process and those investigated through traditional neurology clinics were compared. Typical causes of diagnostic delay were investigated. Results showed that diagnostic timelines have been surprisingly consistent over this 20-year period. Time from first symptom to diagnosis hovered around 12 months, with the diagnosis typically being made around the midpoint (50% of total disease duration elapsed) of the disease pathway. The introduction of a fast-track process has not to date affected overall performance but has shortened times from referral to diagnosis. Diagnostic delays appear to be associated with clinical complexity and delays in referral, both within primary and secondary care services. In conclusion, more widespread implementation of fast-track processes could potentially reduce diagnostic delays. Educational interventions among health care professionals both in primary and secondary care may also help shorten diagnostic pathways.","['Mitchell JD', 'Callagher P', 'Gardham J', 'Mitchell C', 'Dixon M', 'Addison-Jones R', 'Bennett W', ""O'Brien MR""]",2010,11,6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Mitchell JD, et al.

A retrospective study looked at the medication received by 62 patients with MND/ALS in the last 72 h of life in six hospices in the UK and Ireland. Medication is widely used in the last 24 h of life, and use of the parenteral route increases as death approaches. We found that the doses of opioids and other medication do not increase appreciably during this period. The mean dose of opioid in the last 24 h of life was 80 mg oral morphine equivalent/24 h. These results are further evidence that opioids can be used both effectively and safely to manage symptoms at the end of life for people with MND/ALS.","['Oliver DJ', 'Campbell C', ""O'brien T"", 'Sloan R', 'Sykes N', 'Tallon C', 'Taylor-Horan J', 'Udoma M']",2010,11,6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Oliver DJ, et al.

20558162,Increased neuronal Rab5 immunoreactive endosomes do not colocalize with TDP-43 in motor neuron disease.,"Sporadic motor neuron disease (MND) is characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons and intraneuronal cytoplasmic translocation and deposition of the nuclear protein TDP-43. There is a paucity of data on the subcellular mechanisms of the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of TDP-43, particularly about the precise role of the endosomal-lysosomal system (ELS). In the present study, using a neuron-specific morphometric approach, we examined the expression of the early endosomal marker Rab5 and lysosomal cathepsins B, D, F, and L as well as PAS-stained structures in the anterior horn cells in 11 individuals affected by sporadic MND and 5 age-matched controls. This was compared with the expression of ubiquitin, p62 and TDP-43 and its phosphorylated form. The principal finding was the increased expression of the endosomal marker Rab5 and lysosomal cathepsin D, and of PAS-positive structures in motor neurons of MND cases. Furthermore, the area-portion of Rab5 immunoreactivity correlated well with the intracellular accumulation of ubiquitin, p62 and (phosphorylated) TDP-43. However, double immunolabelling and immunogold electron microscopy excluded colocalization of phosphorylated TDP-43 with the ELS. These data contrast with observations on neuronal cytopathology in Alzheimer's or prion diseases where the disease-specific proteins are processed within endosomes, and suggest a distinct role of the ELS in MND.","['Matej R', 'Botond G', 'László L', 'Kopitar-Jerala N', 'Rusina R', 'Budka H', 'Kovacs GG']",2010,225,1,Exp Neurol,"Matej R, et al.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the most commonly used procedure in this context. Per-oral image guided gastrostomy (PIG) is a new hybrid technique used successfully in non-MND patients. We have modified the PIG technique to improve patient tolerability and have undertaken a pilot evaluation of PIG compared to PEG in MND patients. Nineteen PIG and 16 PEG procedures performed over a period of four years were evaluated. Pre-procedural forced vital capacity (FVC), procedural oxygen saturation, post-procedural complications and survival duration were recorded. Results showed that a gastrostomy tube was successfully placed in 95% of the PIG group and 80% of the PEG group. Rates of minor complications were comparable in both groups (21% in PIG, 23% in PEG). No life-threatening complications occurred in either group. Procedural mean oxygen saturations were higher in the PIG group compared to the PEG group (p < 0.001). No significant survival differences were observed. This study provides evidence for the use of the PIG procedure as a safe and well tolerated alternative to PEG in MND patients.","['Chavada G', 'El-Nayal A', 'Lee F', 'Webber SJ', 'McAlindon M', 'Walsh T', 'Hollinger H', 'McDermott CJ', 'Shaw PJ']",2010,11,6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Chavada G, et al.

20550486,The epidemiology of motor neuron disease in Northern Ireland using capture-recapture methodology.,"Capture-recapture analysis allows an investigator to estimate the number of unobserved cases in an epidemiological survey, although it has not been employed widely in published research to date. This study examines the usefulness of capture-recapture analysis in measuring the incidence and prevalence of motor neuron disease (MND) in Northern Ireland (NI). Cases were ascertained from the NI MND register to measure incidence and prevalence. The authors then employed capture-recapture analysis to estimate the number of missing cases. Less than one case was estimated to be missing from the prevalence study, providing a completeness of ascertainment of 99%. Prevalence was 3.3 per 100,000 population adjusted to the European standard population and was unchanged when adjusted for missing cases. Incidence was 1.4 per 100,000 person-years adjusted to the European standard population. Due to the lack of overlapping sources it was inferred that there were no missing cases and completeness of ascertainment was estimated at 100%. In conclusion, capture-recapture analysis is relatively simple to perform and provides an objective measure of case ascertainment in epidemiological studies. The authors feel that future investigators should consider employing capture-recapture methods, where possible, to validate their estimations of disease frequency in MND.","['Donaghy C', 'Clarke J', 'Patterson C', 'Kee F', 'Hardiman O', 'Patterson V']",2010,11,4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Donaghy C, et al.

The patient complained only of difficulties in recalling names of acquaintances and in writing kanji characters. After 1 year, he experienced difficulty in describing common objects. He developed two-way anomia only in some words, which varied from day to day. His anomia was not category-specific and was noted even with respect to words that describe color. In addition to experiencing difficulty in writing kanji characters, he experienced difficulty in writing kana characters. Muscle atrophy was observed, and he experienced weakness in his limbs, especially in the right upper limb; however, bulbar symptoms were not observed. At this point, he fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MND. In the next year, semantic memory impairment became apparent, and he was subsequently diagnosed with SD. Deterioration in his ability to name objects in all categories, except body parts, was noted. Further, the ability of writing both kana and kanji characters was increasingly impaired. He developed bulbar symptoms and experienced increased muscle weakness. The characteristics of this patient differed from those of SD patients without MND with regard to the difficulty in writing kana characters and naming colors even though the SD-MND was in the early stage. Further, the pattern of brain hypoperfusion was different from that observed for SD patients without MND. In the case of this patient, brain hypoperfusion was found not only in the left anterior temporal lobe but also in the frontal lobe. The characteristics of his language symptoms might be related to the specific pattern of brain hypoperfusion, which might be commonly observed in patients with dementia and MND.","['Kito Y', 'Kazui H', 'Yoshida T', 'Kubo Y', 'Takaya M', 'Tokunaga H', 'Takeda M']",2010,62,6,Brain Nerve,"Kito Y, et al.

20522872,An evaluation of neurophysiological criteria used in the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: New criteria for the neurophysiological diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) were recently proposed at an international symposium in Awaji-shima, Japan. They differ from the accepted revised El-Escorial criteria by considering fasciculation potentials to be evidence of acute denervation. In addition, when assessing diagnostic certainty, the Awaji-shima criteria equate electrodiagnostic evidence of lower motor neuron dysfunction with clinical examination findings.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 205 consecutive sets of notes was performed, from patients who underwent neurophysiological assessment for suspected MND. The clinical signs and neurophysiological findings were combined according to the two sets of criteria (revised El-Escorial and Awaji-shima), and the diagnoses reached were compared with the interval diagnosis, to establish the sensitivities and specificities of each protocol.
RESULTS: An interval diagnosis of MND was recorded in 107 patients. The sensitivity of the Awaji-shima criteria in reaching a diagnosis of MND was 60.7% and the revised El-Escorial 28%, with a specificity of 95.9% for both criteria. The Awaji-shima criteria increased the sensitivity of diagnosis without affecting the specificity.
CONCLUSION: Accepting EMG evidence of fasciculations as evidence of acute denervation increases the diagnostic certainty of MND, and the new criteria allow earlier diagnosis of MND without increasing the false-positive rate.","['Douglass CP', 'Kandler RH', 'Shaw PJ', 'McDermott CJ']",2010,81,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Douglass CP, et al.

20487174,Nutritional factors associated with survival following enteral tube feeding in patients with motor neurone disease.,"BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to limb weakness, wasting and respiratory failure. Prolonged poor nutritional intake causes fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Consequently, disease progression requires decisions to be made regarding enteral tube feeding. The present study aimed to investigate the survival, nutritional status and complications in patients with MND treated with enteral tube feeding.
METHODS: A retrospective case note review was performed to identify patients diagnosed with MND who were treated with enteral tube feeding. A total of 159 consecutive cases were identified suitable for analysis. Patients were treated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) or nasogastric feeding tube (NGT). Nutritional status was assessed by body mass index (BMI) and % weight loss (% WL). Serious complications arising from tube insertion and prescribed daily energy intake were both recorded.
RESULTS: Median survival from disease onset was 842 days [interquartile range (IQR) 573-1263]. Median time from disease onset to feeding tube was PEG 521 days (IQR 443-1032), RIG 633 days (IQR 496-1039) and NGT 427 days (IQR 77-781) (P = 0.28). Median survival from tube placement was PEG 200 (IQR 106-546) days, RIG 216 (IQR 83-383) days and NGT 28 (IQR 14-107) days. Survival between gastrostomy and NGT treated patients was significant (P < or = 0.001). Analysis of serious complications by nutritional status was BMI (P = 0.347) and % WL (P = 0.489).
CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional factors associated with reduced survival were weight loss, malnutrition and severe dysphagia. Serious complications were not related to nutritional status but to method of tube insertion. There was no difference in survival between PEG and RIG treated patients.","['Rio A', 'Ellis C', 'Shaw C', 'Willey E', 'Ampong MA', 'Wijesekera L', 'Rittman T', 'Nigel Leigh P', 'Sidhu PS', 'Al-Chalabi A']",2010,23,4,J Hum Nutr Diet,"Rio A, et al.

20392974,Weaning from prolonged invasive ventilation in motor neuron disease: analysis of outcomes and survival.,"INTRODUCTION: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) improves prognosis in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) in the absence of major bulbar involvement. However, some experience a rapid and unexpected decline in respiratory function and may undergo emergency tracheal intubation. Weaning from invasive ventilation can be difficult, and reported independence from invasive ventilation is uncommon with poor prognosis. The outcomes of patients with MND referred to a specialist weaning service following emergency tracheal intubation were examined and compared with MND patients electively initiating NIV.
METHODS: A case note review was performed on all patients with MND invasively ventilated and referred to a specialist weaning service between 1992 and 2007. Outcomes were compared with those electively commenced on NIV during the same period.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were referred for weaning from invasive ventilation which was started in 17 before MND was diagnosed. Fourteen patients (47%) were weaned from invasive ventilation but still required NIV, 13 failed to wean, and three died. Seventeen were discharged home from hospital. The median survival from tracheal intubation was 13.7 months (95% CI 0 to 30.8) for those previously diagnosed and 7.2 months (95% CI 5.1 to 9.4) for those not previously known to have MND. Comparison with patients initiated electively on NIV demonstrated similar survival estimates to that from emergency intubation (median 9.4 (95% CI 6.9 to 12.0) vs 7.8 (95% CI 2.6 to 12.9) months respectively).
CONCLUSION: The prognosis in MND following acute respiratory failure and intubation is not always complete ventilator dependence if patients are offered a comprehensive weaning programme.","['Chadwick R', 'Nadig V', 'Oscroft NS', 'Shneerson JM', 'Smith IE']",2011,82,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Chadwick R, et al.

20382209,Constructs of human neuropathy target esterase catalytic domain containing mutations related to motor neuron disease have altered enzymatic properties.,"Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is a phospholipase/lysophospholipase associated with organophosphorus (OP) compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN). Distal degeneration of motor axons occurs in both OPIDN and the hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs). Recently, mutations within the esterase domain of NTE were identified in patients with a novel type of HSP (SPG39) designated NTE-related motor neuron disease (NTE-MND). Two of these mutations, arginine 890 to histidine (R890H) and methionine 1012 to valine (M1012V), were created in human recombinant NTE catalytic domain (NEST) to measure possible changes in catalytic properties. These mutated enzymes had decreased specific activities for hydrolysis of the artificial substrate, phenyl valerate. In addition, the M1012V mutant exhibited a reduced bimolecular rate constant of inhibition (k(i)) for all three inhibitors tested: mipafox, diisopropylphosphorofluoridate, and chlorpyrifos oxon. Finally, while both mutated enzymes inhibited by OP compounds exhibited altered time-dependent loss of their ability to be reactivated by nucleophiles (aging), more pronounced effects were seen with the M1012V mutant. Taken together, the results from specific activity, inhibition, and aging experiments suggest that the mutations found in association with NTE-MND have functional correlates in altered enzymological properties of NTE.","['Hein ND', 'Stuckey JA', 'Rainier SR', 'Fink JK', 'Richardson RJ']",2010,196,2,Toxicol Lett,"Hein ND, et al.

20339559,Loss of ALS2/Alsin exacerbates motor dysfunction in a SOD1-expressing mouse ALS model by disturbing endolysosomal trafficking.,"BACKGROUND: ALS2/alsin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab5 and involved in macropinocytosis-associated endosome fusion and trafficking, and neurite outgrowth. ALS2 deficiency accounts for a number of juvenile recessive motor neuron diseases (MNDs). Recently, it has been shown that ALS2 plays a role in neuroprotection against MND-associated pathological insults, such as toxicity induced by mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). However, molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between ALS2-associated cellular function and its neuroprotective role remain unclear.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this issue, we investigated the molecular and pathological basis for the phenotypic modification of mutant SOD1-expressing mice by ALS2 loss. Genetic ablation of Als2 in SOD1(H46R), but not SOD1(G93A), transgenic mice aggravated the mutant SOD1-associated disease symptoms such as body weight loss and motor dysfunction, leading to the earlier death. Light and electron microscopic examinations revealed the presence of degenerating and/or swollen spinal axons accumulating granular aggregates and autophagosome-like vesicles in early- and even pre-symptomatic SOD1(H46R) mice. Further, enhanced accumulation of insoluble high molecular weight SOD1, poly-ubiquitinated proteins, and macroautophagy-associated proteins such as polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1 and a lipidated form of light chain 3 (LC3-II), emerged in ALS2-deficient SOD1(H46R) mice. Intriguingly, ALS2 was colocalized with LC3 and p62, and partly with SOD1 on autophagosome/endosome hybrid compartments, and loss of ALS2 significantly lowered the lysosome-dependent clearance of LC3 and p62 in cultured cells.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these observations, although molecular basis for the distinctive susceptibilities to ALS2 loss in different mutant SOD1-expressing ALS models is still elusive, disturbance of the endolysosomal system by ALS2 loss may exacerbate the SOD1(H46R)-mediated neurotoxicity by accelerating the accumulation of immature vesicles and misfolded proteins in the spinal cord. We propose that ALS2 is implicated in endolysosomal trafficking through the fusion between endosomes and autophagosomes, thereby regulating endolysosomal protein degradation in vivo.","['Hadano S', 'Otomo A', 'Kunita R', 'Suzuki-Utsunomiya K', 'Akatsuka A', 'Koike M', 'Aoki M', 'Uchiyama Y', 'Itoyama Y', 'Ikeda JE']",2010,5,3,PLoS One,"Hadano S, et al.

20333464,Hypercapnia is a possible determinant of the function of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum quotients of albumin (Q(Alb)) may occur in motor neuron diseases (MND) including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these alterations are unclear. Evidence from animal experiments suggests that the arterial carbon dioxide level might affect the Q(Alb), i.e. the function of the blood-CSF barrier (BCB). We therefore compared basic CSF parameters in different forms of MND (ALS, n = 105; lower motor neuron diseases, n = 12; and upper motor neuron diseases, n = 7) and investigated the relationship between elevated Q(Alb) and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in ALS where respiratory insufficiency leads to hypercapnia in the course of the disease. Pathologic elevations of Q(Alb) occurred in 32 of 124 MND patients. In ALS, Q(Alb) significantly correlated with the arterial pCO(2) (r = 0.454; P = 0.001; n = 45). These data indicate that BCB dysfunction is a frequent finding in different forms of MND and may reflect distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In ALS, an important underlying mechanism might be the influence of the arterial pCO(2) which may alter the CSF flow.","['Süssmuth SD', 'Sperfeld AD', 'Ludolph AC', 'Tumani H']",2010,35,7,Neurochem Res,"Süssmuth SD, et al.

20308682,CSF glial markers correlate with survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: In neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), CSF biomarkers are increasingly studied to evaluate their relevance for differential diagnosis, disease progression, and understanding of pathophysiologic processes.
OBJECTIVE: To identify a biomarker profile of neuronal and glial CSF proteins to discriminate ALS from other motor neuron diseases (MND) and to assess whether baseline levels of CSF measures in ALS are associated with the course of the disease.
METHODS: A total of 122 consecutive subjects with MND were included in this cross-sectional study (ALS, n = 75; lower motor neuron syndrome, n = 39; upper motor neuron diseases, n = 8). Clinical follow-up included 76 patients. We determined baseline levels of protein tau and astroglial S100beta in CSF and microglial sCD14 in CSF and serum in relation to diagnosis, duration of disease, and survival.
RESULTS: CSF tau was significantly elevated in ALS and upper motor neuron diseases as compared to lower motor neuron diseases and controls. CSF S100beta levels were significantly lower in lower motor neuron diseases as compared to other MND. CSF concentrations of S100beta and sCD14 correlated with the survival time in patients with ALS.
CONCLUSIONS: In motor neuron diseases, CSF tau elevation indicates the degeneration of upper motor neurons, while S100 beta and sCD14 may indicate the activation of CNS glial cells. Because S100beta and sCD14 concentrations correlate with survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we suppose that the combination of both markers may be useful to obtain prognostic information in patients with ALS.","['Süssmuth SD', 'Sperfeld AD', 'Hinz A', 'Brettschneider J', 'Endruhn S', 'Ludolph AC', 'Tumani H']",2010,74,12,Neurology,"Süssmuth SD, et al.

20202121,Review: neuromuscular synaptic vulnerability in motor neurone disease: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy.,"Amid the great diversity of neurodegenerative conditions, there is a growing body of evidence that non-somatic (that is, synaptic and distal axonal) compartments of neurones are early and important subcellular sites of pathological change. In this review we discuss experimental data from human patients, animal models and in vitro systems showing that neuromuscular synapses are targeted in different forms of motor neurone disease (MND), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. We highlight important developments revealing the heterogeneous nature of vulnerability in populations of lower motor units in MND and examine how progress in our understanding of the molecular pathways underlying MND may provide insights into the regulation of synaptic vulnerability and pathology. We conclude that future experiments developing therapeutic approaches specifically targeting neuromuscular synaptic vulnerability are likely to be required to prevent or delay disease onset and progression in human MND patients.","['Murray LM', 'Talbot K', 'Gillingwater TH']",2010,36,2,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Murray LM, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To assess for the first time the presence of TDP43 in a patient with motor neuron disease (MND) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: A 78-year-old woman developed poorly dopa-responsive parkinsonism without cognitive alteration. Three years later, MND appeared and led to death in less than a year. Neuropathologic examination was performed.
RESULTS: We observed the presence of PD and MND lesions with TDP43-positive cytoplasmic inclusions in the spinal cord and bulbar nuclei but not in the dentate gyrus and neocortex. The MND was characterized by a severe degeneration of bulbar and cervical lower motor neurons. Numerous senile plaques and topographically limited neurofibrillary tangles were also observed.
CONCLUSION: The mechanisms underlying the rare co-occurrence of PD and MND are still unclear. The assessment of an abnormal reactivity for TDP43 in our case might gain more insight into the pathophysiology of this association of two diseases. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to understand the role of TDP43 in neurodegenerative diseases.","['Chanson JB', 'Echaniz-Laguna A', 'Vogel T', 'Mohr M', 'Benoilid A', 'Kaltenbach G', 'Kiesmann M']",2010,7,4,Neurodegener Dis,"Chanson JB, et al.

However, translation of apparent therapeutic successes from in vivo to the human disease has proven difficult and a considerable amount of financial resources has been apparently wasted. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for preclinical animal research in ALS/MND are urgently required. Such SOPs will help to establish SOPs for translational research for other neurological diseases within the next few years. To identify the challenges and to improve the research methodology, the European ALS/MND group held a meeting in 2006 and published guidelines in 2007 (1).

20169775,Depression in Parkinson's disease.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine predictive factors associated with onset of depression among individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD).
BACKGROUND: Depression may precede or follow symptomatic parkinsonism in PD. It is frequently treatable but often overlooked.
METHODS: The clinical series comprised 685 individuals who were diagnosed with PD and followed by one neurologist (RJU) from 1994 to 2007. The primary outcome was time to depression following the onset of PD. Diagnosis of depression was based on clinical assessment of depressive symptoms from patients (and spouse/family/caregiver) and antidepressant usage. A number of demographic, historical and clinical predictive factors were examined, including gender, age at symptomatic onset, disease duration, onset characteristics, clinical ratings, antiparkinsonian medications, cognitive status, depression history, and familial history of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders.
RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients developed depression within ten years of symptomatic PD onset, and the mean time to depression was 7.9 years (median: 5.7 years). Factors associated with depression included longer PD duration, greater impairment in activities of daily living, and positive family history of motor neuron disease (MND).
CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of individuals with PD develop depressive symptoms during the course of the disease. Based on first clinic visit characteristics, most factors examined were not helpful in identifying individuals with an increased risk of depression. However, disease duration, functional limitations and family history of MND should lead clinicians to an increased vigilance for identifying depression.","['Jasinska-Myga B', 'Putzke JD', 'Wider C', 'Wszolek ZK', 'Uitti RJ']",2010,37,1,Can J Neurol Sci,"Jasinska-Myga B, et al.

20159132,"Power wheelchair prescription, utilization, satisfaction, and cost for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: preliminary data for evidence-based guidelines.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the features most frequently selected in a power wheelchair (PWC), level of satisfaction with the selections, and how often the PWC features are used by patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND).
DESIGN: Internally generated questionnaire.
SETTING: An ALS/Muscular Dystrophy Association center.
PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of current patients (N=45) of our clinic with ALS/MND who are PWC users (men, n=27; women, n=18; age range, 27-85 y).
INTERVENTION: Self-administered survey.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Thirty-two patients completed a 31-question survey investigating patients' patterns of selection, satisfaction, and frequency of PWC use; technical and psychometric influences; and other aspects of decision-making processes that patients experience before, during, and after acquiring a PWC.
RESULTS: Ninety percent of respondents received their evaluations at a multidisciplinary ALS clinic, 1 via the Department of Veterans Affairs, and 1 was unknown. Sixty-six percent of patients thought the chair evaluation was timed correctly, and 19% wished they had started sooner. Forty-five percent of people were able to walk a few steps, and 55% were able to stand when their chairs arrived. When they first received the chair, 79% were satisfied with the overall comfort of the chair, and 86% were satisfied with the ease of use; currently, 69% are satisfied with the overall comfort, and 72% are satisfied with ease of use. There was a statistically significant difference in how patients used their wheelchair features initially and currently in terms of seat elevate and attendant control, but not tilt, recline, and elevating leg rests. The average cost for the power chairs was $26,404 (range, $19,376-$34,311), and the average cost a month is $917. Overall, 88% of respondents said they would get the same type of chair with the same features again, and 81% felt that the chair was a good value for the cost.
CONCLUSIONS: We obtained first-hand knowledge from 32 patients with ALS/MND who are current PWC users on their use and satisfaction with their PWCs from initial to current use. Based on this survey, patients with ALS/MND seen for their wheelchair evaluation with experienced clinicians exhibit high use and satisfaction with their PWCs.","['Ward AL', 'Sanjak M', 'Duffy K', 'Bravver E', 'Williams N', 'Nichols M', 'Brooks BR']",2010,91,2,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,"Ward AL, et al.

20157854,Abnormal interaction of motor neuropathy-associated mutant HspB8 (Hsp22) forms with the RNA helicase Ddx20 (gemin3).,"A number of missense mutations in the two related small heat shock proteins HspB8 (Hsp22) and HspB1 (Hsp27) have been associated with the inherited motor neuron diseases (MND) distal hereditary motor neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. HspB8 and HspB1 interact with each other, suggesting that these two etiologic factors may act through a common biochemical mechanism. However, their role in neuron biology and in MND is not understood. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the DEAD box protein Ddx20 (gemin3, DP103) as interacting partner of HspB8. Using co-immunoprecipitation, chemical cross-linking, and in vivo quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we confirmed this interaction. We also show that the two disease-associated mutant HspB8 forms have abnormally increased binding to Ddx20. Ddx20 itself binds to the survival-of-motor-neurons protein (SMN protein), and mutations in the SMN1 gene cause spinal muscular atrophy, another MND and one of the most prevalent genetic causes of infant mortality. Thus, these protein interaction data have linked the three etiologic factors HspB8, HspB1, and SMN protein, and mutations in any of their genes cause the various forms of MND. Ddx20 and SMN protein are involved in spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA processing. RNase treatment affected the interaction of the mutant HspB8 with Ddx20 suggesting RNA involvement in this interaction and a potential role of HspB8 in ribonucleoprotein processing.","['Sun X', 'Fontaine JM', 'Hoppe AD', 'Carra S', 'DeGuzman C', 'Martin JL', 'Simon S', 'Vicart P', 'Welsh MJ', 'Landry J', 'Benndorf R']",2010,15,5,Cell Stress Chaperones,"Sun X, et al.

20151145,Validating population-based registers for ALS: how accurate is death certification?,"The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of death certification for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) as recorded by the Central Statistics Office in the Republic of Ireland, and to examine its utility in capture-recapture analysis. The database of the Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) was searched for death certificates of individuals over 15 years of age for whom ALS/MND (ICD9) was listed as a primary, secondary or tertiary cause of death from 2002 to 2006. This dataset was compared with mortality data from the Irish Register for ALS/MND for the same period. Three hundred ninety-eight cases with a diagnosis of ALS were identified through the CSO. The cause of death as identified by the CSO was 318 out of 398 (80%) cases known to the Register during the study period. ALS/MND was listed as a cause of death by the CSO in 79 (20%) cases that were unknown to the ALS/MND Register. Of these, ALS/MND was listed as a secondary/tertiary cause of death in 76, and 75% of all such deaths occurred in rural areas. Capture-recapture analysis using the CSO and ALS Register as independent datasets generated a likely over-estimation of the crude incidence of ALS from 2.1/100,000 to 3.45/100,000 in Ireland. Population-based registers are most accurate when ascertaining from a wide network of inter-dependent sources. Death certification for ALS/MND lacks both sensitivity and specificity. Capture-recapture exercises using such data sources are likely to over-estimate the true incidence of disease.","['Yeo L', 'Lynch C', 'Hardiman O']",2010,257,8,J Neurol,"Yeo L, et al.

20146069,Slow saccades in bulbar-onset motor neurone disease.,"Historical studies of eye movements in motor neurone disease (MND) have been conflicting although current findings suggest that eye movement abnormalities relate to frontal lobe impairment. Numerous case reports, however, describe slow saccades and supranuclear gaze palsies in patients with MND often associated with bulbar-onset disease. We performed a study of saccades and smooth pursuit in a large group of patients with MND to examine for any differences between bulbar-onset and spinal-onset patients. Forty-four patients (14 bulbar-onset and 30 spinal-onset patients) and 45 controls were recruited. Reflexive saccades, antisaccades and smooth pursuit were examined using infra-red oculography and all subjects then underwent neuropsychological evaluation. Reflexive saccades were found to be slower in bulbar-onset compared to spinal-onset patients and controls (p = 0.03, p = 0.05). Antisaccade latency (p = 0.01) and antisaccade type 1 errors (p = 0.03, p = 0.04) were increased in patients compared to controls. 'Proportion of time spent in smooth pursuit' and smooth pursuit 'velocity gain' were reduced in patients compared to controls (p = 0.000, p = 0.001). Antisaccade errors and velocity gain correlated with neuropsychological measures sensitive to lesions of the frontal lobes. This is the first study to highlight the presence of slow saccades in bulbar-onset MND. These findings suggest that slow saccades may be due to increased brainstem pathology in bulbar-onset disease that involves burst cell neurons. Furthermore these observations highlight the potential for overlap between bulbar-onset MND and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) as both can have a bulbar palsy and slowed saccades.","['Donaghy C', 'Pinnock R', 'Abrahams S', 'Cardwell C', 'Hardiman O', 'Patterson V', 'McGivern RC', 'Gibson JM']",2010,257,7,J Neurol,"Donaghy C, et al.

20136647,EFNS guidelines on the use of neuroimaging in the management of motor neuron diseases.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: These European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines on neuroimaging of motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are designed to provide practical help for the neurologists to make appropriate use of neuroimaging techniques in patients with MNDs, which ranges from diagnostic and monitoring aspects to the in vivo study of the pathobiology of such conditions.
METHODS: Literature searches were performed before expert members of the Task Force wrote proposal. Then, consensus was reached by circulating drafts of the manuscript to the Task Force members and by discussion of the classification of evidence and recommendations.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The use of conventional MRI in patients suspected of having a MND is yet restricted to exclude other causes of signs and symptoms of MN pathology [class IV, level good clinical practice point (GCPP)]. Although the detection of corticospinal tract hyperintensities on conventional MRI and a T2-hypointense rim in the pre-central gyrus can support a pre-existing suspicion of MND, the specific search of these abnormalities for the purpose of making a firm diagnosis of MND is not recommended (class IV, level GCPP). At present, advanced neuroimaging techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, do not have a role in the diagnosis or routine monitoring of MNDs yet (class IV, level GCPP). However, it is strongly advisable to incorporate measures derived from these techniques into new clinical trials as exploratory outcomes to gain additional insights into disease pathophysiology and into the value of these techniques in the (longitudinal) assessment of MNDs (class IV, level GCPP).","['Filippi M', 'Agosta F', 'Abrahams S', 'Fazekas F', 'Grosskreutz J', 'Kalra S', 'Kassubek J', 'Silani V', 'Turner MR', 'Masdeu JC', 'European Federation of Neurological Societies']",2010,17,4,Eur J Neurol,"Filippi M, et al.

In the present study, we compared the prevalence of psychiatric illness in patients with PLS and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We hypothesized that if the psychosocial stress of motor neuron disease predisposes patients to depressive disorders, patients with ALS (with a poorer prognosis and more disability than patients with PLS) should have a higher prevalence of depressive disorders than patients with PLS. We administered the gold standard of psychiatric assessment, the SCID, to 19 PLS and 13 ALS patients. We found a prevalence of current depressive disorders in PLS patients that was, by a non-significant trend, lower than that of ALS patients. The prevalence of current depressive disorders in the ALS patients was higher than previously reported and similar to that observed in non-neurological medical disorders. Other psychiatric disorders were rare. In conclusion, depressive disorders were the most commonly observed psychiatric disorders in both PLS and ALS. By a non-significant trend, the PLS patients had a lower current prevalence of depressive disorders than the ALS patients. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the psychosocial stress of MND is a risk factor for depression.","['Huey ED', 'Koppel J', 'Armstrong N', 'Grafman J', 'Floeter MK']",2010,11,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Huey ED, et al.

In fact, the discovery of pathological TDP-43 solidified the idea that these disorders are multi-system diseases and this led to the concept of a TDP-43 proteinopathy as a spectrum of disorders comprised of different clinical and pathological entities extending from ALS to ALS with cognitive impairment/dementia and FTLD-TDP without or with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). These align along a broad disease continuum sharing similar pathogenetic mechanisms linked to pathological TDP-43.

20094727,The epidemiology of motor neurone disease in two counties in the southwest of England.,"The epidemiology of motor neurone disease (MND) in the counties of Devon and Cornwall in the southwest of England has not previously been studied. A previous study of England and Wales has, however, reported a very high death certification rate of MND in Devon. This study was carried out to establish the prevalence and incidence of MND in Devon and Cornwall and make comparisons with published rates in other populations. We attempted to identify all cases of MND diagnosed in Devon and Cornwall between 2002 and 2007. Case identification was centred on the major hospitals in the two counties and multiple sources of ascertainment were used. All identified cases had their case notes reviewed to establish the diagnosis and classify by type of MND. Point prevalence of MND was established for September 1st, 2007. The overall incidence rate standardised to the 2001 United Kingdom population was 2.52 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 2.20-2.84). The incidence rate was significantly higher in males (P < 0.001). The estimated male to female incidence ratio was 2.10 (95% CI 1.61-2.73). The crude incidence rate in Cornwall was 3.78 per 100,000 (95% CI 3.03-4.53) and this was significantly higher (P = 0.011) than the rate in Devon, which was 2.61 per 100,000 (95% CI 2.19-3.04). The standardised incidence rate for the study period in Devon was 2.26 per 100,000 (95% CI 1.91-2.60) and in Cornwall it was 3.06 per 100,000 (95% CI 2.44-3.68). The overall standardised point prevalence rate was 5.66 per 100,000 (95% CI 4.49-6.83). The incidence rate of MND in our study is similar to reported findings in large prospective studies of the disease. There is a significant difference between the incidence rates in Devon and Cornwall. There is a need to establish a prospective MND Register to accurately document the epidemiological characteristics of the disease in the two counties.","['Imam I', 'Ball S', 'Wright D', 'Hanemann CO', 'Zajicek J']",2010,257,6,J Neurol,"Imam I, et al.

SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) assessing the effect of benzodiazepines in relieving breathlessness in patients with advanced stages of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic heart failure (CHF), motor neurone disease (MND), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed identified titles and abstracts. Three independent review authors performed assessment of all potentially relevant studies (full text), data extraction, and assessment of methodological quality. We carried out meta-analysis where appropriate.
MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies were identified, including 200 analysed participants with advanced cancer and COPD. Analysis of all seven studies (including a meta-analysis of six out of seven studies) did not show a beneficial effect of benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer and COPD. Furthermore, no significant effect could be observed in the prevention of breakthrough dyspnoea in cancer patients. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated no significant differences regarding type of benzodiazepine, dose, route and frequency of delivery, duration of treatment, or type of control.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for a beneficial effect of benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer and COPD. There is a slight but non-significant trend towards a beneficial effect but the overall effect size is small. Benzodiazepines caused more drowsiness as an adverse effect compared to placebo, but less compared to morphine. These results justify considering benzodiazepines as a second or third-line treatment within an individual therapeutic trial, when opioids and non-pharmacological measures have failed to control breathlessness. Although a few good quality studies were included in this review, there is still a further need for well-conducted and adequately powered studies.","['Simon ST', 'Higginson IJ', 'Booth S', 'Harding R', 'Bausewein C']",2010,,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Simon ST, et al.

20012109,Neuropathological heterogeneity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy: a quantitative study of 94 cases using principal components analysis.,"Studies suggest that frontotemporal lobar degeneration with transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP) is heterogeneous with division into four or five subtypes. To determine the degree of heterogeneity and the validity of the subtypes, we studied neuropathological variation within the frontal and temporal lobes of 94 cases of FTLD-TDP using quantitative estimates of density and principal components analysis (PCA). A PCA based on the density of TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, oligodendroglial inclusions, neuronal intranuclear inclusions, and dystrophic neurites, surviving neurons, enlarged neurons, and vacuolation suggested that cases were not segregated into distinct subtypes. Variation in the density of the vacuoles was the greatest source of variation between cases. A PCA based on TDP-43 pathology alone suggested that cases of FTLD-TDP with progranulin (GRN) mutation segregated to some degree. The pathological phenotype of all four subtypes overlapped but subtypes 1 and 4 were the most distinctive. Cases with coexisting motor neuron disease (MND) or hippocampal sclerosis (HS) also appeared to segregate to some extent. We suggest: (1) pathological variation in FTLD-TDP is best described as a 'continuum' without clearly distinct subtypes, (2) vacuolation was the single greatest source of variation and reflects the 'stage' of the disease, and (3) within the FTLD-TDP 'continuum' cases with GRN mutation and with coexisting MND or HS may have a more distinctive pathology.","['Armstrong RA', 'Ellis W', 'Hamilton RL', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Hedreen J', 'Gearing M', 'Montine T', 'Vonsattel JP', 'Head E', 'Lieberman AP', 'Cairns NJ']",2010,117,2,J Neural Transm (Vienna),"Armstrong RA, et al.

We examined 24 patients with MMN, 34 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), 23 with neuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy (PN+IgM), 13 with GBS, 34 with motor neuron disease (MND), 24 with other neuropathies and 20 normal subjects. Patients' sera were tested by ELISA for IgM reactivity to GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b and with GSCs made by any combination of two of these gangliosides. In all GM1 positive patients with MMN (11), PN+IgM (1), CIDP (1) and POEMS (1), binding to GM1 was abolished or consistently reduced when tested in GSCs also containing GD1a or other gangliosides. This only occurred in one of the three GM1 positive MND patients. In a patient with PN-IgM and anti-GM2 and GD1a IgM, both reactivities were reduced when tested in GSCs also containing GM1. New reactivities were found in a patient with CIDP and anti-GD1b IgM who presented an additional reactivity to GT1b/GM1 and GT1b/GM2 GSCs, and in one with PN-IgM who had reactivity to GM2/GD1b but not to individual gangliosides. Testing for IgM antibodies to GSCs rarely permitted to identify new reactivities in chronic immune neuropathies. IgM binding to gangliosides was however often modified in GSCs suggesting that these reactivities may be affected by contiguous gangliosides possibly influencing their pathogenicity.","['Nobile-Orazio E', 'Giannotta C', 'Briani C']",2010,219,1-2,J Neuroimmunol,"Nobile-Orazio E, et al.

19946783,"Trends in death certification for multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy in English populations 1979-2006.","The objective of this study is to report trends in mortality, as certified on death certificates, from multiple sclerosis (MS), motor neuron disease (MND), primary Parkinson's disease (PD), and epilepsy, analysing not only the underlying cause of death but also all certified causes for each disease. Death records in the Oxford region, 1979-2006, and England, 1996-2006, were analysed for ascertaining the trends in mortality. The percentage of deaths coded as the underlying cause changed over time, coinciding with changes to the rules for selecting the underlying cause of death. Changes over time to coding rules had a large impact on apparent trends in death rates for PD when studied by underlying cause alone. They also had significant, though smaller, effects on trends in death rates for MS, MND and epilepsy. Nationally, in the last period of the study, underlying cause mortality identified 64% of deaths with a mention of MS, 88% of MND, 56% of PD, and 48% of epilepsy. In the longstanding Oxford data from 1979 to 2006, death rates based on all certified causes of death showed no significant change for MS; an upward trend for MND (notably in women over 75), though only in the last few years of the study; a significant but small decline for PD; and no significant change for epilepsy. When mortality statistics are analysed by underlying cause only, their value is reduced. A substantial percentage of neurological deaths are missed. Time trends may be misleading. All certified causes for each disease, as well as the underlying cause, should be analysed.","['Goldacre MJ', 'Duncan M', 'Griffith M', 'Turner MR']",2010,257,5,J Neurol,"Goldacre MJ, et al.

19938690,[FTLD-U and Pick disease without Pick bodies--a clinical and pathological review].,"Circumscribed cerebral lobar atrophy is observed in Pick disease with or without Pick bodies (conventional Pick disease) show circumscribed cerebral lobar atrophy. Pick disease with Pick bodies was initially termed as 3-repeat tauopathy to distinguish this disease from the conventional Pick disease. Case of Pick disease without Pick bodies formed a heterogeneous group. In all cases of Pick disease without Pick bodies, except for rare cases without any type of inclusions [dementia lacking distinctive histology (DLDH)] the presence of ubiquitinated inclusions was confirmed, which were broadly termed as frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). In Japan, the number of cases of Pick disease with Pick bodies and those with FTLD-U appears to be almost the same. The patterns of cerebral and subcortical nuclear degeneration are quite simillar in cases of Pick disease with Pick bodies and in cases of Pick disease with FLTD-U. Investigation of the motor neuron system in FTLD-U cases revealed that approximately two-third patients had mild to severe degeneration in the upper motor neural system (pyramidal tract). These cases of FTLD-U with motor neuron involvement formed an important group, namely, FTLD with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia (ALS-D) in which degeneration of the lower motor neurons was generally prominent in comparison to the mild pyramidal tract degeneration in the case of FTLD-MND, is also a type of FTLD-MND. Thus, conventional Pick disease was further classified into Pick disease, FTLD-MND, FTLD-U (in a narrow sense), and DLDH.",['Ikeda K'],2009,61,11,Brain Nerve,Ikeda K.

19938679,[Symptoms of frontotemporal dementia].,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-a common clinical manifestation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)--is characterized by alterations in personality and social conduct. Its symptoms include inertia, loss of volition, social disinhibition, and distractibility, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function. We present the typical case of patient with typical clinical symptoms including ""going my way"" behavior, inactivity, lack of awareness of illness, stereotypic behavior, perseveration, and environmental dependency syndrome. These clinical symptoms can be interpreted on the basis of extent of damage to the frontal lobes and the interaction between the frontal lobes and other neural systems such as the posterior association cortices, basal ganglia or limbic systems. We also address several complex clinical issues, including the relationship between clinical manifestations and pathological findings, underestimation of FTD in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and/or motor neuron disease (MND), and impairment in a single cognitive domain such as isolated agraphia in ALS/MND and FTD. To address these problems, it is essential to observe the clinical symptoms in patients with FTD and ALS/MND in detail and to compare clinical characteristics with pathological findings. It is also critical to develop clinical tests that minimize the impact of speech and motor dysfunction on performance, particularly on the basis of a longitudinal analysis.","['Ichikawa H', 'Kawamura M']",2009,61,11,Brain Nerve,Ichikawa H and Kawamura M.

19938676,[History and classification of frontotemporal lobar degeneration].,"The history and classification of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are reviewed in this paper. After Pick's descriptions, there are confusions regarding the classification of the clinical syndromes and the underlying histological changes of frontotemporal lobe degeneration of the non-Alzheimer type. In 1994, the Lund and Manchester groups proposed clinical and neuropathological criteria for the classification of frontotemporal dementia (FTD); frontal lobe degeneration type, Pick-type, and motor neuron disease (MND) type. Ubiquitin-positive and tau-negative inclusions in the extra-motor neurons were characteristic of MND type and were first described by us. In 1996 and 1998, Neary et al. proposed the concept of FTLD to facilitate diagnosis and provide diagnostic criteria for 3 clinical syndromes associated with FTLD, namely, FTD, progressive nonfluent aphasia, and semantic dementia. In 2001, an international group of clinical and basic scientists reassessed the clinical and neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of FTD and recommended revised neuropathological criteria for diagnosis. In 2007, Cairns et al. proposed another version of the criteria for pathological diagnosis of the neurodegenerative group of diseases termed as FTLD on the basis of the recent advances in molecular genetic, biochemical, and neuropathological studies. According to these criteria, FTLD is mainly divided into 2 groups-tauopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies-on the basis of immunohistological methods.",['Okamoto K'],2009,61,11,Brain Nerve,Okamoto K.

Threshold loading may strengthen the inspiratory muscles and thereby improve patient prognosis. A phase II, double-blind, randomized-controlled trial was undertaken to determine whether a 12-week inspiratory muscle training programme attenuated the decline in respiratory function and inspiratory muscle strength in patients with ALS/MND. Nine patients were randomized to inspiratory muscle training and 10 to sham training. Primary endpoints were respiratory function (forced vital capacity, vital capacity), lung volumes and inspiratory muscle strength. Patients were assessed before, during and immediately after a 12-week training period, and at eight weeks follow-up. While improvements in inspiratory muscle strength were observed in both treatment arms, there was a non-significant increase in maximum inspiratory pressure of 6.1% in the experimental group compared to controls (standard error of mean, 6.93%; 95% confidence interval -8.58 -20.79; p=0.39). The gains in inspiratory muscle strength were partially reversed during a period of training cessation. In conclusion, inspiratory muscle training may potentially strengthen the inspiratory muscles and slow the decline in respiratory function in patients with ALS/MND.","['Cheah BC', 'Boland RA', 'Brodaty NE', 'Zoing MC', 'Jeffery SE', 'McKenzie DK', 'Kiernan MC']",2009,10,5-6,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Cheah BC, et al.

19917993,Smoking may be considered an established risk factor for sporadic ALS.,"OBJECTIVES: A 2003 evidence-based review of exogenous risk factors for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) identified smoking as the only risk factor that attained ""probable"" (more likely than not) status, based on 2 class II studies. The purpose of the current, evidence-based, update was to see if the conclusion of the previous review needed to be modified, based on studies published since.
METHODS: A Medline literature search was conducted for the period between 2003 and April 2009 using the search terms smoking and (ALS or ""amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"" or MND or ""motor neuron disease""). The references of primary articles and reviews were checked to assure completeness of the search. Primary articles published since the previous review were classified as before.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight titles were identified, but only 7 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, 1 provided class II evidence, and 1 class III evidence: both showed increased risk of ALS with smoking. The class II study showed a dose-response effect, and risk decreasing with number of years since quitting smoking. Five articles provided class IV or V evidence, which may not be relied upon to draw conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking may be considered an established risk factor for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (level A rating; 3 class II studies, 1 class III study). Evidence-based analysis of epidemiologic data shows concordance among results of better-designed studies linking smoking to ALS, and lets those results drive the conclusions.",['Armon C'],2009,73,20,Neurology,Armon C.

19830439,FUS pathology in basophilic inclusion body disease.,"Basophilic Inclusion Body Disease (BIBD) is a tau-negative form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), characterized by neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) that are visible on hematoxylin and eosin stain (HE), contain RNA, and are inconsistently ubiquitin-immunoreactive (ir). The normal nuclear expression of TDP-43 is not altered. Here we investigate whether the distribution of the structurally and functionally related protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) is altered in BIBD. Mutations in the FUS gene have recently been identified as a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition to these familial ALS cases, FUS protein has recently been demonstrated in NCI in a subset of FTLD with ubiquitinated inclusions (atypical FTLD-U) and in neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID). We examined seven BIBD brains of patients with average age at onset 46 (range 29-57) and average duration of disease 8 years (range 5-12). Three cases presented with the behavioural variant of fronto-temporal dementia (FTD-bv) and one with FTD-bv combined with severe dysarthria. All four developed motor neuron disease/ALS syndrome (MND/ALS) several years later. In the other three cases, presentation was predominantly with motor symptoms, construed as MND/ALS in two, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in one. Severity of cortical degeneration varied, but all cases shared severe nigrostriatal atrophy and lower motor neuron pathology. In spared areas of cortex, FUS antibodies showed intense labelling of neuronal nuclei and weak positivity of cytoplasm, whereas, in affected areas, intense labelling of NCI was accompanied by reduction or disappearance of the normal IR pattern. The number of FUS-ir NCI was much greater than the number detected by HE or with ubiquitin or P62 immunohistochemistry. FUS-ir glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) were abundant in the grey and white matter in all cases, whereas neuronal intranuclear inclusions were rare and only seen in 2/7 cases. Thus, BIBD shares with atypical FTLD-U and NIFID the presence of FUS-ir NCI and GCI, and together comprise a new biochemical category of neurodegenerative disease (FUS proteinopathies). The consistent involvement of motorneurons in BIBD indicates that the association of FTLD and MND/ALS can occur on a FUS or TDP-43 pathological substrate.","['Munoz DG', 'Neumann M', 'Kusaka H', 'Yokota O', 'Ishihara K', 'Terada S', 'Kuroda S', 'Mackenzie IR']",2009,118,5,Acta Neuropathol,"Munoz DG, et al.

Although many additional MND genes remain to be identified, the accumulated genetic evidence has already provided new insights into MND pathogenesis, which adds to the well-established involvement of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutations. The pathways that have been recently implicated include those that affect RNA processing, axonal transport and mitochondrial function. The functional classes of MND genes identified so far are likely to aid the selection of high-priority candidate genes for future investigation, including those for so-called sporadic cases.","['Dion PA', 'Daoud H', 'Rouleau GA']",2009,10,11,Nat Rev Genet,"Dion PA, et al.

19821416,Multidisciplinary care for adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary care (MDC) is increasingly thought to be an important means of symptomatic and supportive management for motor neuron disease (MND) but the evidence base for its effectiveness is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of MDC in adults with MND, especially the types of approaches that are effective (settings, intensity) and the outcomes that are affected.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (11 May 2009), and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2009), EMBASE (1980 to April 2009), CINAHLPlus (1937 to April 2009), AMED (1985 to April 2009) and LILACS (1982 to April 2009).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and controlled clinical trials that compared MDC in MND with either routinely available local services or lower levels of intervention; or studies that compared MDC in different settings or at different levels of intensity.Studies of 'other designs' (such as observational studies) were included only in the Discussion since such studies could only be of limited contribution to the best evidence synthesis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We performed a 'best evidence' synthesis based on methodological quality. We grouped studies in terms of setting and intensity (high or low) of therapy.
MAIN RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials were identified. We summarised the results of five observational studies (including one with two reports) in the Discussion section of this review.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials, the 'best' evidence to date is based on three 'low' and two 'very low quality' observational studies. These suggest 'very low quality evidence' for an advantage for mental health domains (only) of quality of life without increasing healthcare costs, and 'low level quality' evidence for reduced hospitalisation for MDC in low-intensity outpatient settings; and 'very low quality' evidence for improved disability in high-intensity settings. The evidence for survival is conflicting. These conclusions are tentative and the gap in current research should not be interpreted as proof that MDC is ineffective. Further research is needed into appropriate study designs; outcome measurement; caregiver needs; and the evaluation of optimal settings, type, intensity or frequency and cost-effectiveness of MDC in the MND population. Future research should focus on observational designs to assess care and outcomes in 'real-life' settings. The interface between neurology, rehabilitation and palliative care should be explored to provide long-term support for MND.","['Ng L', 'Khan F', 'Mathers S']",2009,,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Ng L, et al.

19821325,Mechanical ventilation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Without mechanical ventilation, death from respiratory failure usually follows within two to five years of the onset of symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of mechanical ventilation (tracheostomy and non-invasive ventilation) in improving survival, on disease progression and quality of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (December 8 2008), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2008), EMBASE (January 1947 to December 2008), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to December 2008), and AMED (January 1985 to December 2008). We also searched for ongoing studies on clinicaltrials.gov.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving non-invasive or tracheostomy assisted ventilation in participants with a clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four authors independently selected studies for assessment. All authors extracted data independently from the full text of selected studies and assessed the risk of bias in studies that met the inclusion criteria. We attempted to obtain missing data where possible.
MAIN RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials involving 54 participants receiving non-invasive ventilation were identified and included. Incomplete data were published for one study and we contacted the trial authors who were not able to provide the missing data. Therefore the results of the review were based on a single study of 41 participants. The study showed that the overall median survival in the whole cohort after initiation of assisted ventilation was significantly different between the non-invasive ventilation and standard care groups (P = 0.0062) with a median survival for the non-invasive ventilation group patients of 48 days longer than the standard care group participants. Non-invasive ventilation significantly improved survival and quality of life in the subgroup with normal to moderately impaired bulbar function. Non-invasive ventilation did not prolong survival in patients with poor bulbar function although it showed significant improvement in the mean symptoms domain of the sleep apnoea quality-of-life index but not in the Short Form-36 quality of life mental component summary score .
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from a single randomised trial of non-invasive ventilation in 41 participants suggests that it significantly prolongs survival and improves or maintains quality of life in people with ALS. Survival and some measures of quality of life were significantly improved in the subgroup of people with better bulbar function, but not in those with severe bulbar impairment.","['Radunovic A', 'Annane D', 'Jewitt K', 'Mustfa N']",2009,,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Radunovic A, et al.

We report a patient with SD who also demonstrated MND symptoms in an earlier stage of the disease. A 61-year-old man visited our memory disorder clinic as a result of language disturbance and dysarthria of 8 months duration and facial recognition impairment of 3 months duration. Neuropsychological tests revealed anomic aphasia, prosopagnosia, and decreased semantic fluency.

19780984,Clinical entity of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease.,"Non-Alzheimer-type dementias occur in association with a variety of pathological conditions that include a group of diseases characterized by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinical entity that comprises at least two distinct diseases: Pick's disease with Pick bodies and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). The vast majority of FTLD-U is now referred to as FTLD-TDP, following the recent discovery of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) as the major constituent of the ubiquitin-positive inclusions. FTLD-TDP, but not Pick's disease with Pick bodies, is often associated with motor neuron disease (MND). MND is a group of diseases in which the central nervous system lesions were long believed to be confined to the motor neuron system. In other words, MND was not considered to be associated with other neurological symptoms such as dementia. Nevertheless, more than 200 FTD cases associated with clinical MND have been reported in Japan since 1964. Neuropathologically, MND in such FTD cases was essentially similar to MND in cases without dementia. The combination of FTD and MND was so characteristic that we considered these cases comprise a unique clinicopathological subgroup of FTD. FTD with MND and the classical MND without dementia share the occurrence of ubiquitinated TDP-43-positive inclusions, a finding that could be a key to unlock the pathological backgrounds of both diseases.","['Mitsuyama Y', 'Inoue T']",2009,29,6,Neuropathology,Mitsuyama Y and Inoue T.

19726405,"Cancer in patients with motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease: record linkage studies.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of cancer before and after the diagnosis of motor neuron disease (MND), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: Analysis of statistical database of linked statistical abstracts of hospital and mortality data in an area in southern England.
RESULTS: Only people with PD showed a significant difference in the overall incidence of cancer compared with controls (rate ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% CIs 0.70 to 0.82 before PD; RR 0.61, 0.53 to 0.70, after PD). RRs were close to 1 for cancer in patients after MND (0.98, 0.75 to 1.26) and after MS (0.96, 0.83 to 1.09). There were high rate ratios for malignant brain cancer (7.4, 2.4 to 17.5) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (5.3, 1.1 to 15.6) in patients diagnosed with MND after cancer. In people with MS, malignant brain cancer also showed an increased RR both before hospital admission with a diagnosis of MS (3.2, 1.1 to 7.6) and after (2.4, 1.2 to 4.5). In people with PD, several specific cancers showed significantly and substantially reduced RRs for cancer, notably smoking related cancers, including lung cancer (0.5, 0.4 to 0.7, before PD; 0.5, 0.4 to 0.8, after PD) but also cancers that are not strongly smoking related, including colon cancer (0.7, 0.6 to 0.9, before PD; 0.5, 0.4 to 0.8, after PD).
CONCLUSIONS: People with MND, or MS, do not have an altered risk of cancer overall. There may sometimes be misdiagnosis between MND or MS and brain tumours. PD carries a reduced risk of cancer overall, of some smoking related cancers and of some cancers that are not smoking related.","['Fois AF', 'Wotton CJ', 'Yeates D', 'Turner MR', 'Goldacre MJ']",2010,81,2,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Fois AF, et al.

19688233,Quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy detects abnormalities in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and motor cortex of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the frontal and temporal neocortex. The single most common pathology underlying FTLD is neuronal degeneration with ubiquitin-positive but tau-negative inclusions consisting of Tar DNA binding proteins (TDP-43). Inclusions containing TDP-43 in neurons are also the most common pathology underlying motor neuron disease (MND). The present study tested the hypothesis that abnormal metabolite patterns within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as well as the motor cortex (MC) may be observed in FTLD patients without motor disorders, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). Twenty-six FTLD patients with cognitive damage and ten controls underwent multivoxel (1)H MRS. Absolute concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho) and myo-inositol (mI) were measured from the DLPFC, the MC and the parietal cortex (PC, an internal control). Statistical analyses were performed for group differences between FTLD patients and controls. Comparisons were also made across brain regions (PC and DLPFC; PC and MC) within FTLD patients. Significant reductions in NAA and Cr along with increased Cho and mI were observed in the DLPFC of FTLD patients compared to controls. Significantly lower NAA and higher Cho were also observed in the MCs of patients as compared to controls. Within the FTLD patients, both the MC and the DLPFC exhibited significantly decreased NAA and elevated Cho compared to the PC. However, only the DLPFC had significantly lower Cr and higher mI. Abnormal metabolite pattern from the MC supports the hypothesis that FTLD and MND may be closely linked.","['Chawla S', 'Wang S', 'Moore P', 'Woo JH', 'Elman L', 'McCluskey LF', 'Melhem ER', 'Grossman M', 'Poptani H']",2010,257,1,J Neurol,"Chawla S, et al.

Cytoplasmic ubiquitinated proteinaceous inclusions in motor and extra-motor neurons are the pathological hallmark of all three forms. In 2006, the TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) was both identified as the key protein component of the ubiquitinated inclusions and recognised as the key protein of a spectrum of diseases that have since been consolidated as TDP-43 proteinopathies. TDP-43 as a nuclear protein contributes to the regulation of gene expression, and associated with neurodegeneration, it has been found to be truncated, hyperphosphorylated, and mislocalized. It is unclear whether the loss of the TDP-43's nuclear function or the gain of a toxic function outside its nucleus is disease causing. Since 2008, several TARDBP-mutations have been identified as leading to the autosomal-dominant familial ALS (ALS 10), although no TARDBP-mutations have yet to be linked to FTLD.",['Prudlo J'],2009,77 Suppl 1,,Fortschr Neurol Psychiatr,Prudlo J.

First, we visualized slow degeneration of axons and motor nerve terminals at neuromuscular junctions following sciatic nerve injury in Wld(S) mice with slow Wallerian degeneration. Protection of axotomized motor nerve terminals was much weaker in Wld(S) heterozygotes than in homozygotes. We then induced covert modifiers of axonal and synaptic degeneration in heterozygous Wld(S) mice, by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis, and used CME to identify candidate mutants that either enhanced or suppressed axonal or synaptic degeneration. From 219 of the F1 progeny of ENU-mutagenized BALB/c mice and thy1.2-YFP16/Wld(S) mice, CME revealed six phenodeviants with suppression of synaptic degeneration. Inheritance of synaptic protection was confirmed in three of these founders, with evidence of Mendelian inheritance of a dominant mutation in one of them (designated CEMOP_S5). We next applied CME repeatedly to living Wld(S) mice and to SOD1(G93A) mice, an animal model of motor neuron disease, and observed degeneration of identified neuromuscular synapses over a 1-4day period in both of these mutant lines. Finally, we used CME to observe slow axonal regeneration in the ENU-mutant ostes mouse strain. The data show that CME can be used to monitor covert axonal and neuromuscular synaptic pathology and, when combined with mutagenesis, to identify genetic modifiers of its progression in vivo.","['Wong F', 'Fan L', 'Wells S', 'Hartley R', 'Mackenzie FE', 'Oyebode O', 'Brown R', 'Thomson D', 'Coleman MP', 'Blanco G', 'Ribchester RR']",2009,42,4,Mol Cell Neurosci,"Wong F, et al.

Survival is usually between two and five years, and some die within a few months. The condition thus lies at the boundary between chronic and terminal illness. Narrative interviews were conducted with 35 people living with MND and 11 family carers; analysis explored how people constructed their accounts as well as what they said. As well as accounts of biographical disruption, we identified a distinctive sense that the diagnosis is a 'death sentence' and life is already over, which we term 'biographical abruption'. We also found instances of biographical repair, as participants sought to make sense of their remaining life, restore normality and control, and find new meaning and identity.","['Locock L', 'Ziebland S', 'Dumelow C']",2009,31,7,Sociol Health Illn,"Locock L, et al.

19538797,Caring for a person in advanced illness and suffering from breathlessness at home: threats and resources.,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the factors that mediate the caregiving experience of informal carers at home, which could inform about ways of supporting them in their caregiving role. Our objective was to investigate the caring experience of carers for patients with an advanced progressive illness (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], heart failure, cancer, or motor neuron diseases [MND]), who suffer from breathlessness.
METHODS: A purposive sample of 15 carers was selected. They were recruited via the patients they cared for (who suffered from COPD, cancer, MND, or heart failure) from the hospital and the community. Data were collected through semistructured, in-depth interviews. All were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The analysis used a Grounded Theory approach and NVivo software facilitated the management and analysis of the data.
RESULTS: Several key issues affected caring in a positive or a negative way. The threats to caring were uncertainty, carers' own health problems, an imploded world, negative reactions from outside, person loss, and acute exacerbations. Resources that carers drew on were acceptance, self-care, availability of support, feeling that caring is a shared responsibility with the patient, and ""getting on with"" caring in case of emergencies. Breathlessness was particularly challenging, and carers did not have any strategies to relieve the symptom. They were ill prepared for acute exacerbations.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Carers need to be included in opportunities for support provision in advanced illness. Negotiated involvement of a health professional could buffer the heavy responsibilities related to home care. They could provide problem-solving skills and build on the resources that carers draw on in response to what they experience as most threatening to their caring role.","['Gysels MH', 'Higginson IJ']",2009,7,2,Palliat Support Care,Gysels MH and Higginson IJ.

19497409,Motor neuron diseases and neurotoxic substances: a possible link?,"The motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a group of related neurodegenerative diseases that cause the relative selective progressive death of motor neurons. Exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying MND phenotypes has been hampered by their multifactorial nature and high incidence of sporadic cases, although genetic factors are considered to play a considerable role at present. However, environmental factors, especial exposure to neurotoxic substances, could induce neurotoxicity with the same phenotypes of specific MNDs. Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia and progression to paralysis, with a concomitant distal axonal degeneration and secondary demyelination of central and peripheral axons. The inhibition and subsequent aging of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) by organophosphate has been proposed to be the initiating event in OPIDN. NTE is characterized to be a lysophospholipase/phospholipase B mostly in the nervous system to regulate phospholipid homeostasis. Brain-specific deletion of mouse NTE contributes to the behavioral defects characterized by neuronal loss. Recently, mutations in human NTE have also been shown to cause a hereditary spastic paraplegia called NTE-related motor neuron disorder with the same characteristics of OPIDN, which supported the role of NTE abnormalities in OPIDN, and raised the possibility that NTE pathway disturbances contribute to other MNDs. Together with the identified association of paraoxonase polymorphisms with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, there is a possibility that neurotoxic substances contribute to MND in genetically vulnerable people by gene-environment interactions.","['Chang PA', 'Wu YJ']",2009,180,2,Chem Biol Interact,Chang PA and Wu YJ.

At autopsy, severe neuronal loss in the anterior horn consistent with MND was found, but histopathological hallmarks like Bunina bodies and skein-like inclusions were absent. Surprisingly, numerous huge axonal swellings (about 30 microm in diameter) and onion-bulb-like structures were found in the spinal ventral roots. These changes were not observed in spinal dorsal roots or peripheral nerves. However, obvious segmental demyelination of the ventral root was not found. In addition, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques were present in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex and hippocampus, and to a lesser degree, in the amygdala, substantia nigra and thalamus.

In this study, we examined abnormal TDP-43 pathology in 13 sporadic ALS (SALS), six familial ALS (FALS) with and without Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutations (SOD1-FALS and non-SOD1-FALS), Guam ALS, two frontotemporal lobar degeneration with MND/ALS (FTLD-MND/ALS), one FTLD with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-U) and two progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Sections from the spinal cord were processed for immunohistochemistry using antibodies against TDP-43, ubiquitin, p62, cystatin C, phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau; AT8), alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated neurofilament protein (P-NF). In 12 out of 13 SALS and both Guam ALS cases ubiquitin and p62-immunoreactive (IR) neuronal inclusions co-localized with TDP-43. In three out of four SOD1-FALS and one of two non-SOD1-FALS cases, TDP-43-IR inclusions were absent despite the presence of p62 and/or ubiquitin-IR inclusions. However, a single TDP-43-IR neuronal inclusion co-localized with p62 and ubiquitin in one SOD1-FALS (His48Gln) case. Except for one neuron in a Guam case, all TDP-43-IR neuronal inclusions were negative for P-tau (AT8). TDP-43-IR glial inclusions and neurites were also demonstrated.

RESULTS: The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment determined with MMSE score was 24.2%. Comparison between patients with normal and abnormal MMSE showed statistic differences in depression state and FRS score. Since patients with anxiety and depression would also have abnormal NPI, a follow up study after 3-month antidepressive therapy for the depression patients was made and 2 patients were found to have probably frontotemporal dysfunction lasting for more than 6 months.

METHODS: We identified new cases of MND during the period 1990-2005 in the General Practice Research Database, which includes clinical information from more than 3 million Britons enrolled with selected general practitioners. Individuals with a first medical diagnosis of MND recorded in the database were considered incident cases of the disease. The positive predictive value of the computer-based diagnosis was estimated through review of a sample of medical records from potential MND cases.
RESULTS: In the period 1990-2005, 830 new cases of MND were identified. Age-standardized incidence of MND was 2.6 per 100 000 persons per year in women (95% CI: 2.3, 2.8) and 3.9 in men (95% CI: 3.6, 4.3). Incidence for both sexes peaked between 75 and 79 years. The rate of MND in men was 54% higher than in women (95% CI: 33%, 77%). The lifetime risk of MND, adjusting for competing causes of death, was 1 in 472 (2.1 per 1000) in women and 1 in 350 (2.9 per 1000) in men. No increase in MND incidence over time was apparent.

No major gene has been identified but a locus was mapped on chromosome 9 (9p21.3-p13.3).
METHODS: Ten French families with FTD-MND were tested for linkage to the 9p21.3-p13.3 region. We report extensive mutation screening in 9p-linked families and their clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: We identified six new families with evidence for linkage to the chromosome 9p. Cumulative multipoint LOD score values were positive between markers D9S1121 and D9S301, reaching a peak of 8.0 at marker D9S248. Haplotype reconstruction defined the telomeric boundary at marker AFM218xg11, slightly narrowing the candidate interval. We found no disease-causing mutations by sequencing 29 candidate genes including IFT74 and no copy number variations in the 9p region. The mean age at onset was 57.9 +/- 10.3 years (range, 41-84), with wide heterogeneity within and among families suggesting age-dependant penetrance. The patients presented isolated FTD (32%), isolated MND (29%), or both disorders (39%). The general characteristics of the disease did not differ, except for an older age at onset and shorter disease duration in the 9p-linked compared to nonlinked families. TDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were found in cortex and spinal cord in 3 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study increases the number of 9p-linked families now reported and shows that this locus may have a major effect on frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron disease (MND). Considering our results, the causative gene might be implicated in at least 60% of the families with FTD-MND disorder.","['Le Ber I', 'Camuzat A', 'Berger E', 'Hannequin D', 'Laquerrière A', 'Golfier V', 'Seilhean D', 'Viennet G', 'Couratier P', 'Verpillat P', 'Heath S', 'Camu W', 'Martinaud O', 'Lacomblez L', 'Vercelletto M', 'Salachas F', 'Sellal F', 'Didic M', 'Thomas-Anterion C', 'Puel M', 'Michel BF', 'Besse C', 'Duyckaerts C', 'Meininger V', 'Campion D', 'Dubois B', 'Brice A', 'French Research Network on FTD/FTD-MND']",2009,72,19,Neurology,"Le Ber I, et al.

19373940,Astrocyte function and role in motor neuron disease: a future therapeutic target?,"Astrocytes are the most numerous cell type within the central nervous system (CNS) and perform a variety of tasks, from axon guidance and synaptic support, to the control of the blood brain barrier and blood flow. To perform these roles, there is a great variety of astrocytes. In this review, we summarize the function of astrocytes, in particular, their role in maintaining homeostasis at the synapse, regulating neuronal signaling, protecting neurons from oxidative damage, and determining the fate of endogenous neural precursors. The review also highlights recent developments indicating the role of astrocytes in motor neuron disease (MND), emphasizing their potential as therapeutic targets and agents in cell replacement therapy. The Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene that has been implicated in 20% of cases of familial MND must be expressed in the glial cells as well as motor neurons to produce the disease state in murine models of disease. Selectively reducing mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) in astrocytes does not affect disease onset but slows disease progression, whereas reducing mSOD1 in motor neurons delays disease onset and slows early disease but has less effect on life span. This suggests that glial cells represent potential therapeutic targets in MND. However, the lack of specific markers for astrocytes, their precursors, and sub-types means that our knowledge of astrocyte development/differentiation and response to injury lags far behind our understanding of function. Only by filling this knowledge gap can astrocytes be effectively targeted or replaced to successfully treat chronic CNS disorders such as MND.","['Blackburn D', 'Sargsyan S', 'Monk PN', 'Shaw PJ']",2009,57,12,Glia,"Blackburn D, et al.

19330339,TDP-43 in ubiquitinated inclusions in the inferior olives in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and in other neurodegenerative diseases: a degenerative process distinct from normal ageing.,"Ubiquitin immunoreactive (UBQ-ir) inclusions were present to variable extents in the inferior olivary nucleus (ION) in 37/48 (77%) patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), in 10/11 (91%) patients with motor neurone disease (MND), in 5/5 (100%) patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 5/7 (71%) patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, 13/19 (68%) patients with Parkinson's disease, 11/11(100%) patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, 2/6 (33%) patients with Multisystem Atrophy, 1/3 (33%) patients with Huntington's disease and in 14/14 (100%) normal elderly control subjects. In FTLD, UBQ-ir inclusions were present in 26/32 (81%) patients with FTLD-U, in 10/15 (67%) patients with tauopathy, and in the single patient with Dementia Lacking Distinctive Histology. In 13 FTLD-U patients, and in a single AD and in 2 MND patients, the UBQ-ir inclusions had a rounded, spicular or skein-type appearance, and these were also TDP-43 immunoreactive (TDP-43-ir). In all other affected patients in all diagnostic groups, and in control subjects, the UBQ-ir neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) were of a conglomerated type, resembling a cluster of large granules or globules, but were never TDP-43-ir. In 3 of the 13 FTLD-U patients with spicular NCI, conglomerated NCI were also present but in separate cells. Double-labelling immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy, for UBQ and TDP-43 confirmed that only the spicular UBQ-ir inclusions in patients with FTLD-U, AD and MND contained TDP-43, though in these patients there were occasional TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions that were not UBQ-ir. Nuclear TDP-43 immunoreactivity was absent in ION in FTLD-U, AD or MND when TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions were present, but remained in neurones with UBQ-ir, TDP-43 negative inclusions. The target protein within the UBQ-ir, TDP-43-negative inclusions remains unknown, but present studies indicate that this is not tau, neurofilament or internexin proteins. These TDP-43 negative, UBQ-ir inclusions appear to be more related to ageing than neurodegeneration, and are without apparent diagnostic significance. The pathophysiological mechanism leading to their formation, and any consequences their presence may have on nerve cell function, remain unknown.","['Davidson Y', 'Amin H', 'Kelley T', 'Shi J', 'Tian J', 'Kumaran R', 'Lashley T', 'Lees AJ', 'DuPlessis D', 'Neary D', 'Snowden J', 'Akiyama H', 'Arai T', 'Hasegawa M', 'Bandopadhyay R', 'Sikkink S', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Mann DM']",2009,118,3,Acta Neuropathol,"Davidson Y, et al.

19329383,Frontotemporal dementias: update on recent developments in molecular genetics and neuropathology.,"Frontotemporal dementias (FTD) are the second most common type of presenile dementias, considered to be clinically and pathologically different from Alzheimer's dementia (AD). FTD differs clinically from AD because memory loss is rarely an early symptom. Instead, FTD is usually denoted by behavioural and language difficulties, and may co-occur with motor neuron disease (MND). Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) is the most common underlying pathology with and without MND. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), encoded by the TARDBP gene, has been identified as the major pathological protein of FTLD-U with or without MND, demonstrating that abnormal TDP-43 alone is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. FTLD is a genetically complex disorder. A proportion of cases of FTLD-U have various pathogenic mutations in the progranulin (GRN) gene. Other FTLD-U entities with TDP-43 proteinopathy include FTLD-U with valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene mutation and FTLD with MND linked to chromosome 9p. In contrast, chromosome 3-linked dementia, a FTLD-U with chromatic modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B) mutation, has TDP-43 negative inclusions. Thus, TDP-43 defines a novel class of neurodegenerative diseases called TDP-43 proteinopathies. These recent discoveries will contribute to an accurate diagnosis, and facilitate the development of diagnosis and therapy.",['Liscić RM'],2009,60,1,Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,Liscić RM.

19308766,Identifying poor adaptation to a new diagnosis of motor neuron disease: A pilot study into the value of an early patient-led interview.,"This pilot study explored whether clinicians can identify patients who may not be coping with a diagnosis of MND early in the disease course by using patient-led interviews rather than psychological testing. Consecutive, newly diagnosed MND patients underwent a semi-structured interview six and 18 weeks after diagnosis, and completed SEIQoL-DW, ALSFRS-R, MND Coping Scale, MND Social Withdrawal Scale, SF 36 v2 and HAD. Three physicians independently used a list of factors from the literature associated with coping with a diagnosis of MND, and overall impression to assign patients from interview transcripts to groups of copers and non-copers. Ten of 13 recruited patients were categorized unanimously using the first interview alone. Four patients were categorized as non-copers. These showed significantly higher scores for depression, anxiety and social withdrawal and significantly lower scores for coping and mental composite scores on the SF 36 v2. Our pilot study suggests it is possible for experienced clinicians to identify patients who may struggle to cope with a diagnosis of MND early by patient-led interview alone. This provides some evidence for the therapeutic potential of the early follow-up appointment interview with a senior doctor soon after diagnosis, advocated by current British guidelines.","['Hugel H', 'Pih N', 'Dougan CP', 'Rigby S', 'Young CA']",2010,11,1-2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Hugel H, et al.

19306041,Ocular fixation instabilities in motor neurone disease. A marker of frontal lobe dysfunction?,"OBJECTIVE: Eye movements are classically felt to be spared in motor neurone disease (MND). Although a range of ocular motor disorders have been reported, no consistent pattern has been established. Disturbances of ocular fixation have been noted in MND; however, fixation has not yet been formally examined. With the recent characterization of ocular fixation using saccadic intrusion amplitude and fixation periods, we performed a cross-sectional study to examine for abnormalities of ocular fixation in non-dementing patients with MND.
METHODS: A total of 44 patients and 45 controls were recruited. Fixation was examined using infra-red oculography and all subjects then underwent a neuropsychological evaluation.
RESULTS: Saccadic intrusion amplitude was found to be greater in patients compared to controls and in particular, spinal-onset patients. Saccadic intrusion amplitude in patients correlated with neuropsychological measures sensitive to lesions of the frontal lobes.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to identify abnormalities of fixation in MND and these results indicate that ocular fixation instabilities may be a marker of the sub-clinical frontal lobe dysfunction in MND. A longitudinal study to examine if saccadic intrusion amplitude deteriorates with time would be of interest as this could provide a quantifiable objective marker of disease progression.","['Donaghy C', 'Pinnock R', 'Abrahams S', 'Cardwell C', 'Hardiman O', 'Patterson V', 'McGivern RC', 'Gibson JM']",2009,256,3,J Neurol,"Donaghy C, et al.

19301432,Corticospinal neurons respond differentially to neurotrophins and myelin-associated glycoprotein in vitro.,"Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the survival and outgrowth of corticospinal tract (CST) neurons and other CNS tracts will be a key component in developing novel approaches for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and motor neuron disease (MND). However, the in vivo complexities of these diseases make a systematic evaluation of potential therapeutics that directly affect corticospinal regeneration or survival very challenging. Here, we use Thy1.2 transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in postnatal day 8 (P8) corticospinal neurons, as a source of CST neurons that have already established synapses in the spinal cord, to assess factors that influence neurite outgrowth and survival of axotomized CST neurons. After culture, YFP-positive corticospinal neurons represent an enriched neuronal population over other glia and interneurons, survive, and extend processes over time. YFP-positive CST neurons also continue to express the corticospinal markers CTIP2 and Otx1. CST neurons display different degrees of axon extension, dendritic branch length and elaboration, and neurite elongation in response to neurotrophin-3 and ciliary neurotrophic factor, and an inhibitory outgrowth response when cultured on myelin-associated glycoprotein. Some CST neurons are lost with extended culture, which provides a baseline from which we can also assess factors that enhance CST neuron survival. This assay thus allows us to assess independent aspects of CST axonal and dendritic outgrowth kinetics, which allows for the rapid and sensitive investigation of new therapies to address corticospinal neuron outgrowth in the context of CNS injury and neurodegenerative disorders.","['Richter MW', 'Roskams AJ']",2009,87,10,J Neurosci Res,Richter MW and Roskams AJ.

Though the patient had never created visual art before, he developed a compulsion for painting beginning at the earliest stages of his disease, and continued producing art daily until he could no longer lift a paintbrush because of his motor deficits.

However, cooccurrence of different neurodegenerative disorders is more frequent than would be expected. Therefore, there is an ongoing discussion whether some entities represent parts of a common spectrum.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We describe clinical hallmarks and treatment options in a group of 8 patients who had combined features of both a dopa-responsive parkinsonian syndrome and MND.
RESULTS: All patients exhibited a typical clinical picture of IPS, and all were treated with levodopa or other dopaminergic drugs with good clinical response. The patients also showed clinical and electrophysiological signs of upper and/or lower motor neuron degeneration. Noticeably, in contrast to well-known distinct entities like the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonism/ dementia complex in southwest New Guinea, we did not observe any cognitive decline during the observation period except in 1 patient.
CONCLUSION: This comorbidity of two neurodegenerative diseases supports the ongoing discussion of a pathophysiological and clinical overlap of disease processes. Due to the potent pharmacological options for the IPS symptoms in these overlap syndromes, these patients should be offered optimal symptomatic dopaminergic therapy.","['Pinkhardt EH', 'Sperfeld AD', 'Gdynia HJ', 'Ludolph AC', 'Kassubek J']",2009,6,3,Neurodegener Dis,"Pinkhardt EH, et al.

Despite improvements in symptomatic management in recent years, few therapies are available which modify survival. However, the challenge to find successful treatments would be greatly assisted by clearer elucidation of the underlying pathoaetiology. Many potential exogenous risk factors have been proposed as part of a gene-environment interaction in the aetiology of MND. A growing interest in the role of vigorous physical activity in the development of MND has followed reports of a higher than expected incidence of the disease in professional sports people. Such an association is also supported by current hypotheses concerning the cellular and genetic mechanisms of MND. However, evidence from epidemiological research remains conflicting and inconclusive.

19239541,Living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND): decision-making about 'ongoing change and adaptation'.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To present a model that explicates the dimensions of change and adaptation as revealed by people who are diagnosed and live with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease.
BACKGROUND: Most research about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease is medically focused on cause and cure for the illness. Although psychological studies have sought to understand the illness experience through questionnaires, little is known about the experience of living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease as described by people with the disease.
DESIGN: A grounded theory method of simultaneous data collection and constant comparative analysis was chosen for the conduct of this study.
METHODS: Data collection involved in-depth interviews, electronic correspondence, field notes, as well as stories, prose, songs and photographs important to participants. QSR NVivo 2 software was used to manage the data and modelling used to illustrate concepts.
FINDINGS: Participants used a cyclic, decision-making pattern about 'ongoing change and adaptation' as they lived with the disease. This pattern formed the basis of the model that is presented in this paper.
CONCLUSION: The lives of people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease revolve around the need to make decisions about how to live with the disease progression and their deteriorating abilities. Life decisions were negotiated by participants to maintain a sense of self and well-being in the face of change.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The 'ongoing change and adaptation' model is a framework that can guide practitioners to understand the decision-making processes of people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease. Such understanding will enhance caring and promote models of care that are person-centred. The model may also have relevance for people with other life limiting diseases and their care.","['King SJ', 'Duke MM', ""O'Connor BA""]",2009,18,5,J Clin Nurs,"King SJ, et al.

Less than 10% are familial and these too probably are associated with several interactive genes. The onset of ALS predates development of clinical symptoms by an unknown interval which may extend several years. The cause of neurodegeneration remains unknown but a common end-point is protein misfolding which in turn causes cell function failure. The complex nature of ALS has hindered therapeutic advances. In recent years longer survival is attributable largely to institution of non-invasive ventilation with BiPAP and timely implementation of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding. Symptomatic treatment has advanced improving quality of life. Several encouraging avenues of therapy for ALS are beginning to be emerge raising hope for real benefit.

METHODS: We neuropathologically investigated aPiD and D-MND cases with and without semantic aphasia.
RESULTS: We determined that the regions involved in the early stage of the disease course of semantic dementia were more restricted to the anterior and inferior portion of the temporal lobe on the side of the dominant hemisphere.

19160266,Treatment for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a rare neurodegenerative disease. Approximately 5% to 7% of ALS/MND patients report a family history of a similarly affected relative. Superoxide dismutase-1 gene mutations are the cause in about 20% of familial cases. In those with non-familial (sporadic) ALS/MND the cause is unknown. Also unknown is whether patients with familial and sporadic ALS/MND respond differently to treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the literature and to answer the specific question: 'Is there a difference in the response to treatment between patients with sporadic and familial forms of ALS?'
SEARCH STRATEGY: In May 2006 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2006) and EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2006) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two review authors read the titles and abstracts of all articles and reviewed the full text of all possibly relevant articles. We scanned references of all included trials to identify additional relevant articles. For all trials eligible for inclusion we contacted the authors to request the necessary raw data.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies had to meet two criteria: (a) randomized controlled study design, and (b) inclusion of patients with both familial and sporadic ALS/MND.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We attempted to contact authors of all trials that met inclusion criteria. We obtained data regarding ALS/MND type (sporadic versus familial), treatment assignment (active versus placebo), survival and ALS Functional Rating Scale scores for four large RCTs that included 822 sporadic and 41 familial ALS patients. We could not obtain data from 25 potentially eligible studies (17 trial authors could not be contacted and eight were unwilling to provide data).
MAIN RESULTS: There was no statistical evidence for a different response to treatment in patients with familial ALS/MND compared to those with sporadic ALS/MND. The pooled estimate of the hazard ratio for the interaction term (treatment x familial ALS) suggested a more beneficial response with respect to survival among patients with familial ALS/MND, but the result was not statistically significant. Estimates of the rate of decline on the ALS Functional Rating Scale also suggested a slightly better response to treatment among those with familial ALS/MND, but the result was not statistically significant.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Future RCTs should document whether patients with familial ALS/MND are included and the presence or absence of a mutation in the superoxide dismutase-1 gene amongst those with familial ALS/MND.","['Benatar M', 'Kurent J', 'Moore DH']",2009,2009,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Benatar M, et al.

Clinical examination revealed postural tremor at the right hand, mild tongue atrophy with diffuse fasciculations and brisk tendon reflexes without other muscular weakness or atrophies. Electromyography demonstrated denervation in tongue and in the first dorsal interosseous of right hand ; motor evoked potentials disclosed normal central motor conduction time. Laboratory studies revealed only a mild increase of p-ANCA. A muscle biopsy showed a small inflammatory infiltrate around a vessel. The patient started high dosage of oral steroids. After one year of follow-up the patient suspended oral steroids, postural tremor of the right hand disappeared and tongue fasciculations were reduced. Vasculitis may mimic a MND, particularly in the absence of sensory involvement. Caution should be exercised in the clinical diagnosis of MND. Muscle biopsy is indicated in patient with atypical MND especially in those with an exclusive involvement of lower motor neuron.","['Luigetti M', 'Tasca G', 'Mirabella M', 'Tonali PA', 'Sabatelli M']",2008,108,3,Acta Neurol Belg,"Luigetti M, et al.

19103449,Emotional Lability in MND: Relationship to cognition and psychopathology and impact on caregivers.,"Emotional Lability (EL) is a well recognized symptom of cortico-bulbar pathway dysfunction in Motor Neuron Disease/Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (MND/ALS), and is reported to occur in 19-49% of patients. The Emotional Lability Questionnaire (ELQ), is specifically designed to detect EL as reported by MND patients and as observed by their carers. The aims of this study were to 1) validate the Italian version of the ELQ; 2) investigate the relationship between EL and presence of cognitive dysfunction; 3) investigate the relationship between EL and presence of psychopathology. Forty one MND patients, 39 caregivers and respective control groups composed of 39 subjects and 39 partners/friends were tested. The Italian version of the ELQ was found to have good psychometric properties. Seventy-one per cent of patients reported suffering from EL. Correlations were found between bulbar involvement and EL, and between bulbar involvement and low performance on tests of fluid intelligence and working memory. However, the cognitive profile did not correlate with any aspect of EL. The findings suggests that damage to different neurological pathways underlie cognitive change and EL, which supports the concept of MND/ALS as a multisystem disorder. Moreover the outcomes suggest that EL affects patients' everyday life with the increased anxiety and emotional frailty. The findings suggest that those involved in the care of MND patients should be more aware of the effects of EL in the management of the disease.","['Palmieri A', 'Abrahams S', 'Sorarù G', 'Mattiuzzi L', ""D'Ascenzo C"", 'Pegoraro E', 'Angelini C']",2009,278,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Palmieri A, et al.

19101631,Progranulin Leu271LeufsX10 is one of the most common FTLD and CBS associated mutations worldwide.,"Mutations in the progranulin gene (PGRN) are a major cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Herein we estimated the contribution of the PGRN Leu271LeufsX10 mutation to FTLD and related disorders in the Brescia cohort. The PGRN Leu271LeufsX10 mutation was found in 31% of corticobasal syndrome (CBS), 29% of frontotemporal dementia with motorneuron disease (FTD-MND), 15% of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 9.5% of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), 2% dementia with Lewy bodies and 0% of progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy cases. The prevalence strongly increased in familial forms (75% CBS, 50% FTD-MND, 27% FTD, 18% PPA): in our cohort this mutation is a major disease determinant for FTLD-related disorders with a prominent motor component. MAPT haplotype was demonstrated to be a disease modifier in PGRN Leu271LeufsX10 carriers: in H1H2 subjects the disease onset was earlier than in H2H2 individuals. Sequencing of the whole PGRN gene disclosed a previously described mutation (c.2T>C, Met1X) and three novel ones (c.709-3; c.1011delG, His340ThrfsX21; c.1021C>T, Gln341X) in single families. In the Brescia cohort, while MAPT mutations have low prevalence, mutations in PGRN were shown in 28% of familial FTLD and 75% of familial CBS cases. The PGRN Leu271LeufsX10 mutation becomes one of the most common mutations worldwide, since it was identified in 38 patients belonging to 27 unrelated families.","['Benussi L', 'Ghidoni R', 'Pegoiani E', 'Moretti DV', 'Zanetti O', 'Binetti G']",2009,33,3,Neurobiol Dis,"Benussi L, et al.

19091712,Cause of death and clinical grading criteria in a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases undergoing autopsy from the Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Register.,"BACKGROUND: The Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Register is a population based register of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND) in Scotland, with high case ascertainment levels.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause of death by autopsy and assess grading criteria in a cohort of cases of ALS from the Scottish MND Register.
METHODS: The records of 44 patients undergoing autopsy were reviewed to determine the cause of death, clinical assessment (El Escorial and modified World Federation of Neurology criteria) during life and neuropathological autopsy findings.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 44 cases undergoing autopsy between 1989 and 1998, the cause of death could be directly or indirectly (bronchopneumonia, aspiration/pneumonia and respiratory failure) attributed to MND in 32/44 (73%) cases. The clinical diagnosis of MND was confirmed at autopsy in 44/44 (100%) cases, 3/44 (7%) cases showed coexistent neurodegenerative disease and 5/44 (11%) were familial MND cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Within our cohort, MND contributes to death in the majority of cases and there is excellent clinicopathological correlation, irrespective of the clinical grading criteria used. However, the autopsy rate is low (4%) and further larger studies are required to identify heterogeneity within the disease.","['Kurian KM', 'Forbes RB', 'Colville S', 'Swingler RJ']",2009,80,1,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Kurian KM, et al.

19049508,Low prevalence of progranulin mutations in Finnish patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene have recently been associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The frequency of these mutations varies between populations. The aim of this study was to determine mutations and genetic variations of the PGRN gene in Finnish patients with FTLD and FTLD with associated motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All exons of the PGRN gene were sequenced from 69 Finnish patients with FTLD. The FTLD-MND phenotype was present in 13 of the 69 patients.
RESULTS: No pathogenic PGRN mutations were identified in the cohort. Eleven sequence variations were detected, of which IVS8 + 15C>T, IVS4-51_-52insAGTC and IVS11 + 25G>A have not been reported previously. At least one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of PGRN was detected in 83% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that mutations in PGRN are rare among Finnish patients with FTLD and FTLD-MND.

19025120,Role of complement in motor neuron disease: animal models and therapeutic potential of complement inhibitors.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the major forms of motor neuron disease (MND), a group of degenerative disorders causing progressive motor neuron death leading to eventual paralysis and death. The pathogenesis of MND is poorly understood and may include genetic and/or environmental factors, with a common end-stage outcome. The majority of cases are sporadic, with a small percentage of familial cases identified. Mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) enzyme are frequent in familial ALS, and have allowed for the development of transgenic SOD1 rodent models of ALS. There has been evidence for immune system involvement in the disease, and activated components of the classical complement pathway have been observed in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid and neuronal tissue of diseased individuals. Furthermore, motor neurons and spinal cord tissue from SOD1 transgenic mice show an upregulation in C1q mRNA transcript and protein, in some cases prior to disease onset. Our laboratory has preliminary data indicating a specific pathogenic role for the activation fragment of complement C5 (C5a) in this disease. Using selective C5a receptor antagonists, we dosed SOD1 transgenic rats and observed an extension in survival and reduced motor symptoms compared to untreated rats. Collectively, these clinical and experimental findings suggest that targeting complement using specific inhibitors may represent a novel therapeutic approach to treating MND. Further experimental and clinical studies are required to validate this hypothesis. This review will summarize the clinical and experimental evidence to date implicating complement in the pathogenesis of MND.","['Woodruff TM', 'Costantini KJ', 'Taylor SM', 'Noakes PG']",2008,632,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Woodruff TM, et al.

18974920,Fine structural analysis of the neuronal inclusions of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy.,"TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a major component of the pathological inclusions of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy, also called FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U), and motor neuron disease (MND). TDP-43 is predominantly expressed in the nucleus and regulates gene expression and splicing. In FTLD with TDP-43 proteinopathy, neuronal inclusions present variably as cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs), dystrophic neurites (DNs), and intranuclear inclusions (NIIs), leading to a fourfold neuropathological classification correlating with genotype. There have been few fine structural studies of these inclusions. Thus, we undertook an immunoelectron microscopic study of FTLD with TDP-43 proteinopathy, including sporadic and familial cases with progranulin (GRN) mutation. TDP-43-immunoreactive inclusions comprised two components: granular and filamentous. Filament widths, expressed as mean (range) were: NCI, 9 nm (4-16 nm); DN, 10 nm (5-16 nm); NII, 18 nm (9-50 nm). Morphologically distinct inclusion components may reflect the process of TDP-43 aggregation and interaction with other proteins: determining these latter may contribute towards understanding the heterogeneous pathogenesis of FTLD with TDP-43 proteinopathy.","['Thorpe JR', 'Tang H', 'Atherton J', 'Cairns NJ']",2008,115,12,J Neural Transm (Vienna),"Thorpe JR, et al.

18825435,Slow vertical saccades in the frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Ocular motor abnormalities play an important role in differential diagnoses of Pick complex diseases.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated how frequently supranuclear vertical saccadic impairment was observed in patients with frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). In addition, we tried to characterize their vertical saccadic abnormalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with FTD-MND were recruited. Supranuclear vertical saccadic impairment on gross examination was defined as slow saccades with or without reduction in the final amplitude of the movement accompanied by intact oculocephalic reflex. We also recorded their saccades in 6 out of 11 patients using 2-dimensional videooculography (VOG). We measured the amplitude and peak velocity of each saccade.
RESULTS: On bedside examination, supranuclear vertical saccadic impairment was observed in 9 of 11 patients. One of the two remaining patients could not be evaluated due to poor cooperation and the other showed normal saccades. Five of nine patients with ocular abnormalities and one patient with normal saccade on gross examination underwent the VOG studies. The results showed that all the five patients with gross ocular abnormalities, compared with age-matched controls, had slowing of vertical saccades. Three out of five patients also showed slowing even in the large horizontal saccades.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that slow vertical saccades are common in FTDMND. FTD-MND could be another disease that affects vertical gaze among Pick complex disease. Future pathologic studies are needed to confirm the involvement of the burst neurons in the dorsal midbrain in patients with FTDMND.","['Moon SY', 'Lee BH', 'Seo SW', 'Kang SJ', 'Na DL']",2008,255,9,J Neurol,"Moon SY, et al.

18820733,Metabolomic analysis and signatures in motor neuron disease.,"Motor neuron diseases (MND) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that includes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and result in death of motor neurons. These diseases may produce characteristic perturbations of the metabolome, the collection of small-molecules (metabolites) present in a cell, tissue, or organism. To test this hypothesis, we used high performance liquid chromatography followed by electrochemical detection to profile blood plasma from 28 patients with MND and 30 healthy controls. Of 317 metabolites, 50 were elevated in MNDpatients and more than 70 were decreased (p < 0.05). Among the compounds elevated, 12 were associated with the drug Riluzole. In a subsequent study of 19 subjects with MND who were not taking Riluzole and 33 healthy control subjects, six compounds were significantly elevated in MND, while the number of compounds with decreased concentration was similar to study 1. Our data also revealed a distinctive signature of highly correlated metabolites in a set of four patients, three of whom had lower motor neuron (LMN) disease. In both datasets we were able to separate MND patients from controls using multivariate regression techniques. These results suggest that metabolomic studies can be used to ascertain metabolic signatures of disease in a non-invasive fashion. Elucidation of the structures of signature molecules in ALS and other forms of MND should provide insight into aberrant biochemical pathways and may provide diagnostic markers and targets for drug design.","['Rozen S', 'Cudkowicz ME', 'Bogdanov M', 'Matson WR', 'Kristal BS', 'Beecher C', 'Harrison S', 'Vouros P', 'Flarakos J', 'Vigneau-Callahan K', 'Matson TD', 'Newhall KM', 'Beal MF', 'Brown RH', 'Kaddurah-Daouk R']",2005,1,2,Metabolomics,"Rozen S, et al.

18784414,Epidemiology and medical expenses of motor neuron diseases in Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study is to investigate the epidemiology and associated medical expenses of motor neuron diseases (MND) in Taiwan.
METHODS: Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, involving diagnoses of MND and Certificates of Serious Accidents and Diseases, were retrieved from January 2000 to December 2005. Age- and sex-specific incidences of MND were estimated by dividing the incidence number by population data obtained from the Department of Statistics, Ministry of the Interior.
RESULTS: In total, 1,554 patients with MND were identified. The average yearly incidence was 1.05 per 100,000 people. The male to female ratio was 1.51. The incidence rate, which was 1.25 in men and 0.84 in women, tended to increase with age, and peaked in the ranges of 65-69 years in men and 70-74 years in women. The expenses of the medical services associated with MND increased year by year, except for a sudden drop in inpatient expenses in 2005.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of MND in Taiwan was 1.05 per 100,000/year, which was lower than that of Caucasians. The incidence had moderate male predominance and increased with age. With an aging population, case numbers and medical expenses associated with these diseases are expected to rise in future decades.","['Lai CH', 'Tseng HF']",2008,31,3,Neuroepidemiology,Lai CH and Tseng HF.

Patients with SMA exhibit muscle weakness and hypotonia. Stem cell transplantation is a potential therapeutic strategy for SMA and other MNDs. In this study, we isolated spinal cord neural stem cells (NSCs) from mice expressing green fluorescent protein only in motor neurons and assessed their therapeutic effects on the phenotype of SMA mice. Intrathecally grafted NSCs migrated into the parenchyma and generated a small proportion of motor neurons. Treated SMA mice exhibited improved neuromuscular function, increased life span, and improved motor unit pathology. Global gene expression analysis of laser-capture-microdissected motor neurons from treated mice showed that the major effect of NSC transplantation was modification of the SMA phenotype toward the wild-type pattern, including changes in RNA metabolism proteins, cell cycle proteins, and actin-binding proteins. NSC transplantation positively affected the SMA disease phenotype, indicating that transplantation of NSCs may be a possible treatment for SMA.","['Corti S', 'Nizzardo M', 'Nardini M', 'Donadoni C', 'Salani S', 'Ronchi D', 'Saladino F', 'Bordoni A', 'Fortunato F', 'Del Bo R', 'Papadimitriou D', 'Locatelli F', 'Menozzi G', 'Strazzer S', 'Bresolin N', 'Comi GP']",2008,118,10,J Clin Invest,"Corti S, et al.

18755042,Pedigree with frontotemporal lobar degeneration--motor neuron disease and Tar DNA binding protein-43 positive neuropathology: genetic linkage to chromosome 9.,"BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) represents a clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder, often complicated by neurological signs such as motor neuron-related limb weakness, spasticity and paralysis, parkinsonism and gait disturbances. Linkage to chromosome 9p had been reported for pedigrees with the neurodegenerative disorder, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND). The objective in this study is to identify the genetic locus in a multi-generational Australian family with FTLD-MND.
METHODS: Clinical review and standard neuropathological analysis of brain sections from affected pedigree members. Genome-wide scan using microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphism fine mapping. Examination of candidate genes by direct DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Neuropathological examination revealed cytoplasmic deposition of the TDP-43 protein in three affected individuals. Moreover, we identify a family member with clinical Alzheimer's disease, and FTLD-Ubiquitin neuropathology. Genetic linkage and haplotype analyses, defined a critical region between markers D9S169 and D9S1845 on chromosome 9p21. Screening of all candidate genes within this region did not reveal any novel genetic alterations that co-segregate with disease haplotype, suggesting that one individual carrying a meiotic recombination may represent a phenocopy. Re-analysis of linkage data using the new affection status revealed a maximal two-point LOD score of 3.24 and a multipoint LOD score of 3.41 at marker D9S1817. This provides the highest reported LOD scores from a single FTLD-MND pedigree.
CONCLUSION: Our reported increase in the minimal disease region should inform other researchers that the chromosome 9 locus may be more telomeric than predicted by published recombination boundaries. Moreover, the existence of a family member with clinical Alzheimer's disease, and who shares the disease haplotype, highlights the possibility that late-onset AD patients in the other linked pedigrees may be mis-classified as sporadic dementia cases.","['Luty AA', 'Kwok JB', 'Thompson EM', 'Blumbergs P', 'Brooks WS', 'Loy CT', 'Dobson-Stone C', 'Panegyres PK', 'Hecker J', 'Nicholson GA', 'Halliday GM', 'Schofield PR']",2008,8,,BMC Neurol,"Luty AA, et al.

18703462,Distinct genetic forms of frontotemporal dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common type of presenile dementia and can be distinguished into various clinical variants. The identification of MAPT and GRN defects and the discovery of the TDP-43 protein in FTD have led to the classification of pathologic and genetic subtypes. In addition to these genetic subtypes, there exist familial forms of FTD with unknown genetic defects.
METHODS: We investigated the frequency, demographic, and clinical data of patients with FTD with a positive family history in our prospective cohort of 364 patients. Genetic analysis of genes associated with FTD was performed on all patients with a positive family history. Immunohistochemical studies were carried out with a panel of antibodies (tau, ubiquitin, TDP-43) in brains collected at autopsy.
RESULTS: In the total cohort of 364 patients, 27% had a positive family history suggestive for an autosomal mode of inheritance, including MAPT (11%) and GRN (6%) mutations. We identified a new Gln300X GRN mutation in a patient with a sporadic FTD. The mean age at onset in GRN patients (61.8 +/- 9.9 years) was higher than MAPT patients (52.4 +/- 5.9 years). In the remaining 10% of patients with suggestive autosomal dominant inheritance, the genetic defect has yet to be identified. Neuropathologically, this group can be distinguished into familial FTLD+MND and familial FTLD-U with hippocampal sclerosis.
CONCLUSION: Future genetic studies need to identify genetic defects in at least two distinct familial forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with unknown genetic defects: frontotemporal lobe degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions with hippocampal sclerosis and frontotemporal lobe degeneration with motor neuron disease.","['Seelaar H', 'Kamphorst W', 'Rosso SM', 'Azmani A', 'Masdjedi R', 'de Koning I', 'Maat-Kievit JA', 'Anar B', 'Donker Kaat L', 'Breedveld GJ', 'Dooijes D', 'Rozemuller JM', 'Bronner IF', 'Rizzu P', 'van Swieten JC']",2008,71,16,Neurology,"Seelaar H, et al.

18691039,Biochemical markers in CSF of ALS patients.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of motor neuron diseases (MND) characterized by progressive selective degeneration of motor neurons. Although several mutations underlying rare cases of familial ALS were identified during the last decade, the pathogenesis of ALS remains poorly understood. Various mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to disease pathology such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and inflammation. Accordingly, several candidate biochemical markers related to these pathomechanisms were investigated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although none of these markers gained clinical importance so far, CSF might reflect pathophysiological alterations in the course of the disease and could therefore provide an insight into pathomechanisms in vivo. It is suggested that cellular and proteinchemical processes are better reflected in the CSF than in other body fluids such as blood or urine due to the proximity of the affected motor neurons to the CSF compartment. Accordingly, alterations in protein expression, post-translational modification or turnover within the tissue of the central nervous system may be mirrored in corresponding changes in CSF protein content. Research on biomarkers in CSF using novel discovery technologies such as proteomics allows to search for a set of proteins that reflect different disease specific molecular pathways and might therefore be of relevance for the establishment of biomarkers for therapeutic monitoring and the development of novel therapies. In this review, an updated overview is given on CSF biomarkers related to the pathomechanisms supposed to be participating in the complex disease process of ALS.","['Süssmuth SD', 'Brettschneider J', 'Ludolph AC', 'Tumani H']",2008,15,18,Curr Med Chem,"Süssmuth SD, et al.

18685417,Management of dyspnea in advanced motor neuron diseases.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) invariably develop respiratory muscle weakness and most die from pulmonary complications. Little evidence is available that identifies optimal management approaches for caring for the dying patient. This review discusses the state of the art on dyspnea in advanced ALS/MND and its treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple observational studies have demonstrated that noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is beneficial in ALS/MND. It is a relatively safe intervention in the late stages of disease with additional survival benefits when it is started relatively early and it can improve survival. Despite guidelines related to pulmonary function testing about the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, the factors, which are most closely associated with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation utilization, are dyspnea and orthopnea.
SUMMARY: In ALS/MND, loss of function relentlessly progresses, and subsequent death occurs mostly in a predictable manner. Therefore, the end of life care is heavily influenced by the type and quality of care provided from the earliest stages. Most patients with ALS/MND develop dyspnea, agitation, anxiety and air hunger in the final phase. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation has become the standard of care for patients with ALS/MND and advanced respiratory insufficiency. A multidisciplinary approach is strongly recommended.","['Tripodoro VA', 'De Vito EL']",2008,2,3,Curr Opin Support Palliat Care,Tripodoro VA and De Vito EL.

18677632,Anterior cysts of the spine: a difficult differential diagnosis to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"We describe three patients referred to our ALS/MND clinic with suspected diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The patients were all male, middle aged, and their initial symptoms were weakness and fasciculations in upper limb muscles. Results of clinical and electrophysiological examination in all cases were in accordance with possible ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria. Other conditions mimicking ALS appeared to be excluded by extensive technical examinations and laboratory tests. Only repeated MRI examinations revealed anterior spinal cysts several years after symptom onset. This report intends to highlight this rare and difficult differential diagnosis of ALS and underlines the value of the revised El Escorial criteria in conjunction with electrophysiology to asses the certainty of the diagnosis ALS.","['Schmalbach S', 'Petri S', 'Götz F', 'Dengler R', 'Krampfl K']",2008,255,11,J Neurol,"Schmalbach S, et al.

18646122,Drug therapy for pain in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of the motor system in adults. Pain in ALS is a frequent symptom especially in the later stages of disease and can have a pronounced influence on quality of life and suffering. Treatment of pain therefore should be recognised as an important aspect of palliative care in ALS.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the evidence for the efficacy of drug therapy in relieving pain in ALS. We also aimed to evaluate possible adverse effects associated with the different drugs and their influence on survival and quality of life.
SEARCH STRATEGY: The authors searched the following databases: the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2007), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2007), CINAHL (January 1982 to October 2007), AMED (January 1985 to October 2007) and LILACS (January 1982 to October 2007). We checked the bibliographies of trials identified and contacted other disease experts to identify further published and unpublished trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials on drug therapy for pain in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were collected using a specially designed form and analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager software.
MAIN RESULTS: No randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials on drug therapy for pain in ALS or MND were found.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials about the management of pain in ALS. Further research on this important aspect of palliative care in ALS is needed. Randomised controlled trials should be initiated to determine the effectiveness of different analgesics for treatment of pain in ALS.","['Brettschneider J', 'Kurent J', 'Ludolph A', 'Mitchell JD']",2008,,3,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Brettschneider J, et al.

18644408,A simple method for comparing microarray genotype data between brain and other tissues.,"A number of software packages are currently available to analyse the large amounts of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data generated using microarrays. However, for less usual datasets, such as those involving DNA from different types of tissue in cases and controls, investigators need a program that can be tailored to their particular needs. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a flexible method of analysing SNP data derived from Affymetrix 500K GeneChips without the need for an array-dedicated software package. SNP genotype calls from white cell and brain DNA samples from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and controls were imported into a Microsoft Access((R)) database and analysed in two ways. The first used database ""queries"" designed through the Access graphical user interface. The second involved scripts written with the Visual Basic software that is supplied with Access. Both the queries and scripts performed simple two-way comparisons as well as three-way comparisons between genotypes, which is vital when comparing genotypes in different tissues in cases and controls. A similar method could be used to compare copy number changes derived from SNP intensities between multiple datasets. This flexible method can easily be customised by the investigator and would be of use in comparing microarray SNP data between multiple datasets, in particular where somatic mosaicism was suspected.","['Ruff ME', 'Pamphlett R']",2008,173,2,J Neurosci Methods,Ruff ME and Pamphlett R.

18608107,Whole brain-based computerized neuroimaging in ALS and other motor neuron disorders.,"Advanced neuroimaging applications to patients suffering from ALS and other motor neuron disorders (MND) have a high potential in terms of understanding the pathophysiology and visualizing the in vivo pathoanatomy of the diseases. In this context, particularly observer-independent computerized analyses of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data are of special interest since they overcome shortcomings of region-of-interest-based techniques. For three-dimensional structural T1-weighted MRI of the whole brain, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has proven the most valuable approach to analyse regional volume alterations of the grey or white matter at group level. For the analysis of the white matter integrity with respect to tissue diffusivity and white matter connectivity including fibre tracking algorithms, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) which can also be performed on a whole brain-basis is of the highest potential to date. Both VBM and DTI have been applied to various MND, in particular ALS, in multiple studies over recent years and have substantially broadened our knowledge about their in vivo pathoanatomy and mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Especially both the degree of damage to motor areas and the involvement of non-motor areas are of interest to be subjected to quantitative assessment, in order to establish quantitative surrogate markers for disease progression usable in clinical trials. Here, the technical state-of-the-art and the results of VBM and DTI studies in MND as the current state are reviewed, and future perspectives for further neuroimaging applications are highlighted.","['Grosskreutz J', 'Peschel T', 'Unrath A', 'Dengler R', 'Ludolph AC', 'Kassubek J']",2008,9,4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Grosskreutz J, et al.

18608095,Clinical phenotypes and natural progression for motor neuron disease: analysis from an Australian database.,"From 1997 to 2003 we prospectively followed a cohort of ALS/MND patients. Patients were allocated to predetermined clinical phenotypes using the principles established in the modified El Escorial criteria. The date and region of symptom onset were carefully determined and their progression was scored using the Appel ALS rating scale. The four distinct clinical phenotypes: Global, Flail Arm, Flail Leg and Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) demonstrated significantly different rates of progression and survival times. The Global ALS/MND phenotype can present with initial symptoms in any region and rapidly progresses to involve all segments, with symptoms due to a mixture of combined corticospinal tract and anterior horn cell dysfunction. The Global phenotype has the shortest survival and most rapid rate of disease progression. There was a significant difference in survival between Global bulbar onset and cervical onset disease but no significant difference in the rate of disease progression between the three Global subgroups as determined by the Appel/ALS rating scale. Flail patients had much slower rates of progression and significantly longer survival compared to the Global phenotype. Patients with Primary Lateral Sclerosis as expected progressed the slowest and survived the longest compared to the other clinical phenotypes. The utility of developing a method of assigning clinical phenotypes with similar survival and disease progression rates is discussed in relation to therapeutic trial design, practice benchmarking and clinico-pathological correlations.","['Talman P', 'Forbes A', 'Mathers S']",2009,10,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Talman P, et al.

18584184,"White matter lesions in the brain with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease: TDP-43-immunopositive inclusions co-localize with p62, but not ubiquitin.","Recently, TDP-43 was established as a major component of the ubiquitinated inclusions found in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). However, differences in the underlying pathogenesis between ALS and FTLD-MND remain yet to be elucidated. Originally, TDP-43-immunopositive inclusions were found in neuronal cells and reported to be ubiquitinated. This study shows that TDP-43-positive inclusions were distributed throughout the subcortical white matter except for the occipital lobe in the FTLD-MND brain, but not in the ALS brain. TDP-43-positive inclusions were also prominent features of pathologically proven FTLD-MND cases (p-FTLD-MND) without history of apparent clinical cognitive decline. A substantial fraction of these inclusions was also p62-immunoreactive, and another noteworthy feature was that those inclusions did not stain positively for ubiquitin. Significant correlations between immunoreactivity for TDP-43 and p62 were observed, particularly in p-FTLD-MND (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.976). Furthermore, TDP-43 extracted from white matter appeared to be uncleaved. These results indicate that pathological changes might take place within the white matter also in the brain with FTLD-MND, but in a different manner than within the gray matter.","['Hiji M', 'Takahashi T', 'Fukuba H', 'Yamashita H', 'Kohriyama T', 'Matsumoto M']",2008,116,2,Acta Neuropathol,"Hiji M, et al.

In this review, we discuss recent developments in dissecting the mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) as a new group of mechanism-based drugs for motor neuron diseases, together with current progress in understanding their clinical application. We also discuss how the use of HDACi on animal models with motor neuron defects has allowed critical advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of motor neuron diseases. The use of HDACi and possible mechanisms of action will be reviewed in three MND, i.e. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), diseases among which clinical trials with HDACi are currently perfomed (ALS, SMA).","['Echaniz-Laguna A', 'Bousiges O', 'Loeffler JP', 'Boutillier AL']",2008,15,13,Curr Med Chem,"Echaniz-Laguna A, et al.

18425913,Therapeutic exercise for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the high incidence of muscle weakness in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND), the effects of exercise in this population are not well understood.
OBJECTIVES: The objective was to systematically review randomised and quasi-randomised studies of exercise for people with ALS or MND.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2007), LILACS (January 1982 to August 2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2007), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PEDro (January 1980 to August 2007), AMED (January 1985 to August 2007), HealthSTAR (January 1975 to August 2007), CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2007). We also searched Dissertation Abstracts, inspected the reference lists of all papers selected for review and contacted the authors with expertise in the field.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of people with a diagnosis of definite, probable, probable with laboratory support, or possible amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as defined by the El Escorial criteria. We included progressive resistance or strengthening exercise and endurance or aerobic exercise. The control condition was no exercise or standard rehabilitation management. Our primary outcome measure was improvement in functional ability, decrease in disability or reduction in rate of decline as measured by a validated outcome tool at three months. Our secondary outcome measures were improvement in psychological status or quality of life, decrease in fatigue, increase in, or reduction in rate of decline of muscle strength (strengthening or resistance studies), increase in, or reduction in rate of decline of aerobic endurance (aerobic or endurance studies) at three months and frequency of adverse effects.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data. The authors of the papers were contacted to obtain information not available in the published articles.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified two randomised controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. The first examined the effects of a twice-daily exercise program of moderate load, endurance exercise versus ""usual activities"" in 25 people with ALS. The second examined the effects of thrice weekly moderate load and moderate intensity resistance exercises compared to usual care (stretching exercises) in 27 people with ALS. After three months, when the results of the two trials were combined, there was a significant weighted mean improvement in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) measure of function in the exercise compared with the control groups (3.21, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 5.96) in favour of the exercise group. No statistically significant differences in quality of life, fatigue or muscle strength were found.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The only studies detected were too small to determine to what extent strengthening exercises for people with ALS are beneficial, or whether exercise is harmful. There is a complete lack of randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials examining aerobic exercise in this population. More research is needed.","['Dalbello-Haas V', 'Florence JM', 'Krivickas LS']",2008,,2,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Dalbello-Haas V, et al.

18379501,[The study of chronic partial denervation and quality of life in patients with motor neuron disease treated with semax].,"The study of chronic partial denervation (CPD) and quality of life was carried out in 27 patients with definite, probable and possible diagnosis of motor neuron disease (MND) treated with semax (1% solution). The needle electromyography (EMG) was performed thrice with short-term 2 month interval (60 days before enrollment and on day 1 and day 48 of the study) in three muscles on bulbar, cervical and lumbosacral levels on the less affected side. According to Revised El-Escorial Criteria (1998) the needle EMG for diagnostic purposes was also performed in two muscles on the cervical and lumbosacral levels on the more affected side along with stimulation electroneuronmyography of motor and sensory fibers of the peripheral nerves of neck, upper and lower extremities. The open-label clinical trial of Semax (1% solution) was conducted in sequential groups of patients. The drug was administered intranasally in two 10-day-long courses with 2-weeks break in daily dose of 12 mg. Sixty days before enrollment, and on days 1, 10, 24, 34 and 48, patients were assessed by the Norris ALS, the ALS Functioning Rating Scale and the ALSAQ-40 quality of life in the ALS scale. It was shown that CPD on the early as well as on the late stages was characterized by forward-backward, but not unidirectional course, that did not allow to recommend the follow-up needle EMG with short-term interval for evaluation of drug efficacy monitoring. Early CPD stages were characterized by forward-backwards fluctuations reflecting the compensatory reinnervation process (a phenomenon of exchange of muscle fibers, more rational in view of reinnervation, between adjacent motor units) whereas on the late CPD stages these forward-backwards CPD fluctuations reflected the processes of progressive deterioration of muscle fibers and secondary demyelination of large motor axons. Semax (1% solution) does not influence either the course of CPD or the dynamics of clinical estimates, in particular the terms of ensuing marked functional deficits on bulbar, cervical and lumbosacral levels of segmental innervation. However, 1% semax significantly improves the total estimate of life quality due to the improvement of emotional state and motivation in MND patients with the maximal effect on day 10. This finding suggests that it is feasible to administer 1% semax in complex MND palliative therapy.","['Serdiuk AV', 'Levitskiĭ GN', 'Miasoedov NF', 'Skvortsova VI']",2007,107,4,Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,"Serdiuk AV, et al.

18367294,The neural basis of semantic memory: evidence from semantic dementia.,"Semantic dementia (SD) is a syndrome of progressive impairment in semantic memory. Fifty-eight brain regions were measured in seven post mortem SD cases, ten normal controls and two disease controls (diagnosis frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease, FTD-MND). Manual segmentation of the whole brain has not previously been undertaken in a series of SD cases, either post mortem or during life. Widespread volume loss relative to controls was found in SD, with anterior temporal lobe regions bearing the brunt (>60% atrophy of temporopolar and perirhinal cortices bilaterally). Comparison of regional volumes in SD and FTD-MND found greater atrophy in SD only in temporopolar and perirhinal volumes. The sole region showing atrophy relative to controls in FTD-MND but not SD was motor cortex. Posterior temporal and frontal regions were not consistently affected and no significant asymmetry of atrophy was found. In summary, whole-brain regional evaluation in SD, in comparison with normal controls and FTD-MND, found anterior temporal atrophy encompassing the perirhinal cortex with relative sparing of adjacent posterior temporal regions.","['Davies RR', 'Halliday GM', 'Xuereb JH', 'Kril JJ', 'Hodges JR']",2009,30,12,Neurobiol Aging,"Davies RR, et al.

18358870,[Genetics of motor neuron disorders].,"Motor neuron disorders (MND) form a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative affections: phenotypic description is based on selective injury to the upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron or both. Phenotypic heterogeneity is also present concerning genetic features: genetic factors involved in MND may be causative or susceptibility factors. Consequences of genetic abnormalities lead to metabolic or functional cellular disturbances that are apparently specific for motor neuron disorder. Genetics greatly contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration. Genetic studies provide pathological hypotheses considering the function of protein encoded. Moreover, when a gene mutation is identified, animal models can be developed to search for modifications induced by the mutation. We propose to detail causative and susceptibility genetic factors involved in MND and to discuss pathological mechanisms that may explain motor neuron death.","['Corcia P', 'Praline J', ""Vourc'h P"", 'Andres C']",2008,164,2,Rev Neurol (Paris),"Corcia P, et al.

18357425,Clinicopathological and genetic correlates of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and corticobasal degeneration.,"OBJECTIVE: To correlate clinical diagnosis and genetic features with different pathological substrates in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD).
METHODS: 32 cases with pathological proven FTLD or CBD were selected. Patients were classified clinically as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD), CBD or FLTD with motor neuron disease (FLTDMND). Coding exons 1 and 9-13 of MAPT and exons 0-12 of the PGRN gene were screened by direct sequencing. Regarding the neuropathological findings, cases were classified as tau-positive, ubiquitinpositive tau-negative (FTLD-U), neuronal intermediate filaments inclusions disease (NIFID), dementia lacking distinctive histology (DLDH) or CBD.
RESULTS: 17 patients were clinically diagnosed with FTD. Ten showed tau pathology, 3 FTLD-U, 1 NIFID and 3 DLDH. All patients clinically classified as FTLD-MND (6 patients) or SD (3 patients) were FTLD-U. Tau-positive pathology was the substrate of the three patients with PNFA. All three patients classified clinically as CBD presented neuropathologic features of CBD. The three individuals with familial history of early onset FTD and tau-positive pathology carried the P301L mutation in the MAPT gene. One out of 3 cases with FTLD-U and intranuclear inclusions carried a mutation in the PGRN gene.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that pathology underlying sporadic FTD is heterogeneous and not predictable. MAPT mutations and clinical diagnosis of PNFA and CBD were associated with tau-positive pathology. The presence of signs of lower MND and SD correlated with FTLD-U.A genetic study of MAPT is only recommended when familial history of early onset DFT is present.","['Lladó A', 'Sánchez-Valle R', 'Rey MJ', 'Ezquerra M', 'Tolosa E', 'Ferrer I', 'Molinuevo JL', 'Catalan collaborative Study Group for FTLD']",2008,255,4,J Neurol,"Lladó A, et al.

18325023,ALS patients request more information about cognitive symptoms.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Once thought to impact only voluntary motor function, ALS/Motor neuron disease (MND) is now seen as a multi-system disorder in which a minority of patients experience mild cognitive dysfunction or frontotemporal dementia. Despite clinical guidelines advocating supplying complete information to patients, educational materials on ALS often state that the mind is unaffected. We sought to establish how much patients and caregivers understand about ALS, what they have been told to expect by their physician, and if they would have appreciated more complete information.
METHODS: A two-part survey was administered online. An 'ALS quiz' gauged participants' knowledge of physical and psychological aspects of ALS. A second questionnaire assessed which symptoms patients had discussed with their clinician and explored patients' desire to receive information on psychological effects.
RESULTS: A total of 247 ALS patients and 87 caregivers participated. Participants knew less about psychological symptoms than physical ones (72% correct responses versus 82%; paired t((333)) = -5.04, P < 0.001). Patients commonly reported being told by their doctor about physical symptoms such as problems walking (85%) or stiffness/cramps (74%) but not psychological issues like emotional lability (46%) or cognitive change (11%). The majority of patients (62%) and carers (71%) indicated a desire to be informed that cognitive change or dementia might occur.
CONCLUSION: ALS is a multi-system disorder. However, despite a desire for more information from patients and their carers, healthcare professionals continue to primarily address only the physical consequences of the disease.","['Wicks P', 'Frost J']",2008,15,5,Eur J Neurol,Wicks P and Frost J.

18313024,Neuropathy target esterase gene mutations cause motor neuron disease.,"The possibility that organophosphorus (OP) compounds contribute to motor neuron disease (MND) is supported by association of paraoxonase 1 polymorphisms with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the occurrence of MND in OP compound-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN), in which neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is inhibited by organophosphorylation. We evaluated a consanguineous kindred and a genetically unrelated nonconsanguineous kindred in which affected subjects exhibited progressive spastic paraplegia and distal muscle wasting. Affected subjects resembled those with OPIDN and those with Troyer Syndrome due to SPG20/spartin gene mutation (excluded by genetic linkage and SPG20/spartin sequence analysis). Genome-wide analysis suggested linkage to a 22 cM homozygous locus (D19S565 to D19S884, maximum multipoint LOD score 3.28) on chromosome 19p13 to which NTE had been mapped (GenBank AJ004832). NTE was a candidate because of its role in OPIDN and the similarity of our patients to those with OPIDN. Affected subjects in the consanguineous kindred were homozygous for disease-specific NTE mutation c.3034A-->G that disrupted an interspecies conserved residue (M1012V) in NTE's catalytic domain. Affected subjects in the nonconsanguineous family were compound heterozygotes: one allele had c.2669G-->A mutation, which disrupts an interspecies conserved residue in NTE's catalytic domain (R890H), and the other allele had an insertion (c.2946_2947insCAGC) causing frameshift and protein truncation (p.S982fs1019). Disease-specific, nonconserved NTE mutations in unrelated MND patients indicates NTE's importance in maintaining axonal integrity, raises the possibility that NTE pathway disturbances contribute to other MNDs including ALS, and supports the role of NTE abnormalities in axonopathy produced by neuropathic OP compounds.","['Rainier S', 'Bui M', 'Mark E', 'Thomas D', 'Tokarz D', 'Ming L', 'Delaney C', 'Richardson RJ', 'Albers JW', 'Matsunami N', 'Stevens J', 'Coon H', 'Leppert M', 'Fink JK']",2008,82,3,Am J Hum Genet,"Rainier S, et al.

In the present study, the extent of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antioxidant defenses were evaluated in the erythrocytes of 20 sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and 20 controls. We observed that lipid peroxidation in the erythrocytes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients significantly increased with respect to controls (P<0.001). On the other hand, catalase activity was found to be significantly lower (P<0.001). The activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase and glutathione levels were also found to be significantly reduced in ALS patients compared to healthy subjects (P<0.001, P<0.01 and P<0.01, respectively). It was further observed that lipid peroxidation started to increase and catalase, glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme activities and glutathione levels started to decrease as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progressed from 6 to 24 months, suggesting a correlation between these parameters and duration of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study confirms the involvement of oxidative stress during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the need to develop specific peripheral biomarkers.","['Babu GN', 'Kumar A', 'Chandra R', 'Puri SK', 'Singh RL', 'Kalita J', 'Misra UK']",2008,52,6,Neurochem Int,"Babu GN, et al.

It is not clear whether LPDs play a role in the pathogenesis of MND; however it is possible that patients might have antibodies against motor neurons. An association between motor neuron disease and Multiple myeloma (MM) is rarely reported in the literature. This article reports a case of a 75-year-old male with MM and MND. Interestingly, the patient was in complete remission for MM when he was diagnosed as MND and he died due to progressive MND.","['Koc F', 'Paydas S', 'Yerdelen D', 'Demirkiran M']",2008,118,3,Int J Neurosci,"Koc F, et al.

In 73 patients we found that the median time to diagnosis from symptom onset was 15.6 months, being shorter in bulbar onset patients and longer in females or those presenting with nonspecific gait disturbance. We divided this interval into three time periods--symptom onset to first medical contact, first medical contact to neurology referral and neurology referral to diagnosis. The time period from first medical contact to neurology referral was the longest of the three periods studied indicating that appropriate timely referral of patients to neurologists was responsible for the greatest delay in making a diagnosis of MND. We propose that improving the accessibility of neurological services could potentially reduce the time to diagnosis by at least three months.","['Donaghy C', 'Dick A', 'Hardiman O', 'Patterson V']",2008,77,1,Ulster Med J,"Donaghy C, et al.

In this report we present four PLS patients who have been observed from the time of symptom onset (1990-1999) through January 2007. All of them have had only upper motor neuron (UMN) signs and slow clinical progression. Three patients have been presented with spastic paraparesis. Spasticity was the main clinical feature in demonstrated cases with hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, clonus, and Babinski signs. One patient was presented with spastic dysarthria at the disease onset. Mean disease duration, measured from symptom onset to the present, was 11.5 years in our reported series. All four PLS patients had not developed lower motor neuron (LMN) signs during this time of observation. This prospective analysis of our PLS series is in agreement with data from other studies suggesting that pure PLS cases have a prolonged course of disease with a high level of independence when compared to other MND.","['Tomik B', 'Zur KA', 'Szczudlik A']",2008,110,4,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,"Tomik B, et al.

18245784,"Phenotype variability in progranulin mutation carriers: a clinical, neuropsychological, imaging and genetic study.","Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by behavioural and language disorders, is a clinically, genetically and pathologically heterogeneous group of diseases. The most recently identified of the four known genes is GRN, associated with 17q-linked FTD with ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions. GRN was analysed in 502 probands with frontal variant FTD (fvFTD), FTD with motoneuron disease (FTD-MND), primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS). We studied the clinical, neuropsychological and brain perfusion characteristics of mutation carriers. Eighteen mutations, seven novel were found in 24 families including 32 symptomatic mutation carriers. No copy number variation was found. The phenotypes associated with GRN mutations vary greatly: 20/32 (63%) carriers had fvFTD, the other (12/32, 37%) had clinical diagnoses of PPA, CBDS, Lewy body dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Parkinsonism developed in 13/32 (41%), visual hallucinations in 8/32 (25%) and motor apraxia in 5/21 (24%). Constructional disorders were present in 10/21 (48%). Episodic memory disorders were frequent (16/18, 89%), consistent with hippocampal amnestic syndrome in 5/18 (28%). Hypoperfusion was observed in the hippocampus, parietal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus, as well as the frontotemporal cortices. The frequency of mutations according to phenotype was 5.7% (20/352) in fvFTD, 17.9% (19/106) in familial forms, 4.4% in PPA (3/68), 3.3% in CBDS (1/30). Hallucinations, apraxia and amnestic syndrome may help differentiate GRN mutation carriers from others FTD patients. Variable phenotypes and neuropsychological profiles, as well as brain perfusion profiles associated with GRN mutations may reflect different patterns of neurodegeneration. Since all the mutations cause a progranulin haploinsufficiency, additional factors probably explain the variable clinical presentation of the disease.","['Le Ber I', 'Camuzat A', 'Hannequin D', 'Pasquier F', 'Guedj E', 'Rovelet-Lecrux A', 'Hahn-Barma V', 'van der Zee J', 'Clot F', 'Bakchine S', 'Puel M', 'Ghanim M', 'Lacomblez L', 'Mikol J', 'Deramecourt V', 'Lejeune P', 'de la Sayette V', 'Belliard S', 'Vercelletto M', 'Meyrignac C', 'Van Broeckhoven C', 'Lambert JC', 'Verpillat P', 'Campion D', 'Habert MO', 'Dubois B', 'Brice A', 'French research network on FTD/FTD-MND']",2008,131,Pt 3,Brain,"Le Ber I, et al.

18192287,Frequency and clinical characteristics of progranulin mutation carriers in the Manchester frontotemporal lobar degeneration cohort: comparison with patients with MAPT and no known mutations.,"Two hundred and twenty-three consecutive patients fulfilling clinical diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and 259 patients with motor neuron disease (MND), for whom genomic DNA was available, were investigated for the presence of mutations in tau (MAPT) and progranulin (PGRN) genes. All FTLD patients had undergone longitudinal neuropsychological and clinical assessment, and in 44 cases, the diagnosis had been pathologically confirmed at post-mortem. Six different PGRN mutations were found in 13 (6%) patients with FTLD. Four apparently unrelated patients shared exon Q415X 10 stop codon mutation. However, genotyping data revealed all four patients shared common alleles of 15 SNPs from rs708386 to rs5848, defining a 45.8-kb haplotype containing the whole PGRN gene, suggesting they are related. Three patients shared exon 11 R493X stop codon mutation. Four patients shared exon 10 V452WfsX38 frameshift mutation. Two of these patients were siblings, though not apparently related to the other patients who in turn appeared unrelated. One patient had exon 1 C31LfsX34 frameshift mutation, one had exon 4 Q130SfsX130 frameshift mutation and one had exon 10 Q468X stop codon mutation. In addition, two non-synonymous changes were detected: G168S change in exon 5 was found in a single patient, with no family history, who showed a mixed FTLD/MND picture and A324T change in exon 9 was found in two cases; one case of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with a sister with FTD+MND and the other in a case of progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) without any apparent family history. MAPT mutations were found in 17 (8%) patients. One patient bore exon 10 + 13 splice mutation, and 16 patients bore exon 10 + 16 splice mutation. When PGRN and MAPT mutation carriers were excluded, there were no significant differences in either the allele or genotype frequencies, or haplotype frequencies, between the FTLD cohort as a whole, or for any clinical diagnostic FTLD subgroup, and 286 controls or between MND cases and controls. However, possession of the A allele of SNP rs9897526, in intron 4 of PGRN, delayed mean age at onset by approximately 4 years. Patients with PGRN and MAPT mutations did not differ significantly from other FTLD cases in terms of gender distribution or total duration of illness. However, a family history of dementia in a first-degree relative was invariably present in MAPT cases, but not always so in PGRN cases. Onset of illness was earlier in MAPT cases compared to PGRN and other FTLD cases. PNFA, combined with limb apraxia was significantly more common in PGRN mutation cases than other FTLD cases. By contrast, the behavioural disorder of FTD combined with semantic impairment was a strong predictor of MAPT mutations. These findings complement recent clinico-pathological findings in suggesting identifiable associations between clinical phenotype and genotype in FTLD.","['Pickering-Brown SM', 'Rollinson S', 'Du Plessis D', 'Morrison KE', 'Varma A', 'Richardson AM', 'Neary D', 'Snowden JS', 'Mann DM']",2008,131,Pt 3,Brain,"Pickering-Brown SM, et al.

18183624,Molecular characterization of novel progranulin (GRN) mutations in frontotemporal dementia.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinical term encompassing dementia characterized by the presence of two major phenotypes: 1) behavioral and personality disorder, and 2) language disorder, which includes primary progressive aphasia and semantic dementia. Recently, the gene for familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) linked to chromosome 17 was cloned. In the present study, 62 unrelated patients from the Washington University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Midwest Consortium for FTD with clinically diagnosed FTD and/or neuropathologically characterized cases of FTLD-U with or without motor neuron disease (MND) were screened for mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN; also PGRN). We discovered two pathogenic mutations in four families: 1) a single-base substitution within the 3' splice acceptor site of intron 6/exon 7 (g.5913A>G [IVS6-2A>G]) causing skipping of exon 7 and premature termination of the coding sequence (PTC); and 2) a missense mutation in exon 1 (g.4068C>A) introducing a charged amino acid in the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide at residue 9 (p.A9D). Functional analysis in mutation carriers for the splice acceptor site mutation revealed a 50% decrease in GRN mRNA and protein levels, supporting haploinsufficiency. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the total GRN mRNA between cases and controls carrying the p.A9D mutation. Further, subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy indicate that although the mutant protein is expressed, it is not secreted, and appears to be trapped within an intracellular compartment, possibly resulting in a functional haploinsufficiency.","['Mukherjee O', 'Wang J', 'Gitcho M', 'Chakraverty S', 'Taylor-Reinwald L', 'Shears S', 'Kauwe JS', 'Norton J', 'Levitch D', 'Bigio EH', 'Hatanpaa KJ', 'White CL', 'Morris JC', 'Cairns NJ', 'Goate A']",2008,29,4,Hum Mutat,"Mukherjee O, et al.

Concurrence of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with clinical features of motor neurone disease (FTLD/MND) is a recognised cause of dementia with widely accepted diagnostic criteria, but it is not mentioned in DSM-IV-TR. Aim. To draw attention to cases of FTLD/MND referred by psychiatrists, or already under the care of psychiatrists at time of referral, to a dedicated Cognitive Function Clinic. Methods. Prospective study of FTLD/MND cases, 1999-2007 inclusive; case note review. Results. Nine of 13 cases of FTLD/MND were either referred by or already under the care of a psychiatrist. Although most had been identified as having a dementia, in none had the correct diagnosis been made. All patients had signs of motor neurone pathology on clinical examination, sometimes subtle, in addition to cognitive and psychiatric features. A wide variety of drugs had been prescribed including antidepressants, antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors, and memantine. Conclusions. A high index of clinical suspicion is required to identify cases of possible FTLD/MND, and thereby initiate appropriate investigations and management and avoid inappropriate medication. Absence of FTLD/MND in DSM-IV-TR may further handicap psychiatrists in making this diagnosis.","['Sathasivam S', 'Doran M', 'Larner AJ']",2008,12,2,Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract,"Sathasivam S, et al.

Of the 454 patients, 240 who were born and who lived in Wakayama Prefecture were diagnosed with definite or probable ALS during this period, according to the El Escorial criteria. The clinical data of the 240 patients, including sex, birth date, birthplace, address, age at onset, initial symptoms, date when respiratory support was applied (tracheostomy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, or mandatory artificial ventilation), and date of death were reviewed retrospectively. The age at onset of patients who developed initial symptoms before 1990 was 53.4+/-10.6 (mean+/-S.D.) and that in 1990 or thereafter was 64.8+/-10.3, respectively, showing a significant difference (p<0.0001). Clinical duration was determined from onset to either date of death or initiation of respiratory support in this study. Survival rate was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method according to age at onset, sex, initial symptoms and year of onset. Mean age at onset shifted towards older age according to a later year of onset, due to the overwhelming senility rate in Wakayama Prefecture. Older onset patients had a significantly poorer survival rate than younger onset patients when it was compared based on 10-year age groups (log rank, p<0.0001). Male patients had a poorer survival rate than female patients (p<0.0001). ALS patients with bulbar palsy onset showed shorter clinical durations than those with lower leg onset (p<0.0071, Breslow-Gehan-Wilcoxon test). Patients over 70 years old more frequently showed bulbar palsy onset compared to those younger than 69 (p=0.003). In a comparison of year of onset before and after 1990, ALS patients after 1990 had characteristics of older age onset and shorter clinical duration, and more frequently showed bulbar palsy onset compared with those before 1990. These findings indicated that younger onset patients with ALS decreased after 1990 in Wakayama Prefecture and this might partly explain the recent decline of ALS incidence in Wakayama Prefecture. The shift of the mean age at onset to older age might be due to exogenous factors, including changes in lifestyle, food, and drinking water in this area. Bulbar palsy onset and age at onset were expected as predictors of the survival rate.","['Kihira T', 'Yoshida S', 'Okamoto K', 'Kazimoto Y', 'Ookawa M', 'Hama K', 'Miwa H', 'Kondo T']",2008,268,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Kihira T, et al.

Recent work now shows that cognitive difficulties are present in up to half of the patients with this disorder. About 5-10% of patients with MND have a frank dementia that resembles frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Imaging studies show quantitative abnormalities that resemble FTLD. Moreover, biochemical studies of ubiquinated histopathologic abnormalities in MND and FTLD reveal identical inclusions of TDP-43. These findings underline a fundamental link between MND and FTLD.

To study how this mutation affects the function of the dynein/dynactin complex and contributes to motor neuron degeneration, we generated p150(glued) G59S knock-in mice. We found that the G59S mutation destabilizes p150(glued) and disrupts the function of dynein/dynactin complex, resulting in early embryonic lethality of homozygous knock-in mice. Heterozygous knock-in mice, which developed normally, displayed MND-like phenotypes after 10 months of age, including excessive accumulation of cytoskeletal and synaptic vesicle proteins at neuromuscular junctions, loss of spinal motor neurons, increase of reactive astrogliosis, and shortening of gait compared with wild-type littermates and age-matched p150(glued) heterozygous knock-out mice. Our findings indicate that the G59S mutation in p150(glued) abrogates the normal function of p150(glued) and accelerates motor neuron degeneration.","['Lai C', 'Lin X', 'Chandran J', 'Shim H', 'Yang WJ', 'Cai H']",2007,27,51,J Neurosci,"Lai C, et al.

18060051,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: an emerging era of collaborative gene discovery.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of motor neuron disease (MND). It is currently incurable and treatment is largely limited to supportive care. Family history is associated with an increased risk of ALS, and many Mendelian causes have been discovered. However, most forms of the disease are not obviously familial. Recent advances in human genetics have enabled genome-wide analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that make it possible to study complex genetic contributions to human disease. Genome-wide SNP analyses require a large sample size and thus depend upon collaborative efforts to collect and manage the biological samples and corresponding data. Public availability of biological samples (such as DNA), phenotypic and genotypic data further enhances research endeavors. Here we discuss a large collaboration among academic investigators, government, and non-government organizations which has created a public repository of human DNA, immortalized cell lines, and clinical data to further gene discovery in ALS. This resource currently maintains samples and associated phenotypic data from 2332 MND subjects and 4692 controls. This resource should facilitate genetic discoveries which we anticipate will ultimately provide a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ALS.","['Gwinn K', 'Corriveau RA', 'Mitsumoto H', 'Bednarz K', 'Brown RH', 'Cudkowicz M', 'Gordon PH', 'Hardy J', 'Kasarskis EJ', 'Kaufmann P', 'Miller R', 'Sorenson E', 'Tandan R', 'Traynor BJ', 'Nash J', 'Sherman A', 'Mailman MD', 'Ostell J', 'Bruijn L', 'Cwik V', 'Rich SS', 'Singleton A', 'Refolo L', 'Andrews J', 'Zhang R', 'Conwit R', 'Keller MA', 'ALS Research Group']",2007,2,12,PLoS One,"Gwinn K, et al.

The most comprehensive UK study was conducted more than 15 years ago. This study examines trends in mortality from MND in England & Wales, and Scotland, between 1975 and 2004. Age, gender, and cause-specific mortality rates were calculated for the period 1975-2004 using national data from England & Wales, and Scotland. Rates were directly age-standardized to the European standard population. Trends in mortality rates over time were examined for men and women separately, as well as by the age groups 0-59 years, and 60 or more years. MND mortality rates rose steadily over the 30-year period 1975-2004 in both sexes in England & Wales, and Scotland. There is a clear upward trend in all four groups (p for trend <0.001). All increases were largely restricted to the age group 60 years and above, with rates showing increases of 70-80%, and no evidence of a flattening of this trajectory. Rates for the 0-59 years age group remained stable over the period.

18004574,Severe subcortical TDP-43 pathology in sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease.,"Recently, TDP-43, a 43 kDa nuclear TAR DNA-binding protein, was identified as the major disease protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U), FTLD-U with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To date, TDP-43 pathology in sporadic FTLD-MND has been reported only in select central nervous system areas. However, this distribution of lesions is insufficient to explain all clinical signs of FTLD-MND and the extent of TDP-43 pathology, throughout the brain, remains unknown. Therefore, as a pilot study, we performed an immunohistochemical whole brain scan of two cases diagnosed clinically as FTLD-MND and two control subjects. We found evidence of both neuronal and glial TDP-43 pathology in multiple brain areas including the nigro-striatal system, neo- and allocortical brain areas, with varying frequency, morphology, and degree, and nowhere in control tissue. The finding of a distinct cytopathological profile consisting of a cell nucleus devoid of endogenous TDP-43 staining coupled with diffuse/granular cytoplasmic staining (""pre-inclusion"") was prominent in a couple of brain areas. These pre-inclusions were not or only weakly ubiquitin-immunoreactive. While the findings of severe involvement of extracortical or extrapyramidal areas are strongly suggestive for FTLD-MND being a TDP-43 multisystem proteinopathy rather than a disease predominantly affecting the cortex and spinal cord, more detailed clinicopathological studies of larger cohorts are needed to fully elucidate the distribution and severity of pathological TDP-43 in this disease.","['Brandmeir NJ', 'Geser F', 'Kwong LK', 'Zimmerman E', 'Qian J', 'Lee VM', 'Trojanowski JQ']",2008,115,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Brandmeir NJ, et al.

17969557,Gene therapy for peripheral nervous system diseases.,"Peripheral nerve diseases, also known as peripheral neuropathies, affect 15-20 million of Americans and diabetic neuropathy is the most common condition. Currently, the treatment of peripheral neuropathies is more focused on managing pain rather than providing permissive conditions for regeneration. Despite advances in microsurgical techniques, including nerve grafting and reanastomosis, axonal regeneration after peripheral nerve injury remains suboptimal. Also, no satisfactory treatments are available at this time for peripheral neurodegeneration occurring in motor neuron diseases (MND), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Peripheral nerves have the inherent capacity of regeneration. Gene therapy strategies focused on neuroprotection may help optimizing axonal regrowth. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular events involved in axonal degeneration and regeneration have helped researchers to identify targets for intervention. This review summarizes the current state on the clinical experience as well as gene therapy strategies for peripheral neuropathies, including MND, peripheral nerve injury, neuropathic pain, and diabetic neuropathy.","['Federici T', 'Boulis N']",2007,7,4,Curr Gene Ther,Federici T and Boulis N.

17969341,[Phenotypes in ALS--clinical features and pathology].,"Typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND) is not hard to diagnose, but when it comes to atypical forms of MND which account for about 20% in clinical setting, we may face some difficulties in differentiating clearly between atypical forms of ALS/MND and other non-ALS diseases, such as multifocal motor neuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and cervical spondylosis. There is striking phenotypic variation in sporadic ALS/MND, i.e. flail arm syndrome (brachial amyotrophic diplegia), pseudopolyneuritic form, hemiplegic type, ALS/MND with markedly extended involvement beyond the motor system, MND with basophilic inclusion bodies, spinal progressive muscular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and motor neuron disease with dementia. These variations must be recognized when physicians are to tailor advice on disease progression, prognosis, drug therapy, and care to the needs of the individual. Clinical trials of new therapeutic agents have been performed, on the assumption that patients with ALS/MND have the same underlying etiology, addressing the heterogeneous population of the patients under a single diagnostic category. This can be detrimental to the well-being of the individual, because clinical heterogeneity may mask drug effects in clinical trials. The attempt to categorize subgroups based on the clinical and pathological background within the spectrum of ALS/MND may be a critical step in facilitating clinical research in ALS/MND. Definition of clinicopathologic syndromes in patients with ALS/MND is an important challenging task. It will be necessary to accumulate motor neuron disease cases with phenotypic variation and analyze them clinically and pathologically to elucidate whether various kinds of subgroups of motor neuron diseases lie on the same spectrum of ALS.",['Sasaki S'],2007,59,10,Brain Nerve,Sasaki S.

17943766,Recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Trophic factors, including recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) are possible disease modifying therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (March 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2006) and EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2006) and asked the authors of randomised clinical trials and manufacturers of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered all randomised controlled clinical trials involving rhIGF-I treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in adults with a clinical diagnosis of definite or probable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis according to the El Escorial Criteria. The primary outcome measure was change in Appel Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Rating Scale (AALSRS) total score after nine months treatment and secondary outcome measures were change in AALSRS at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 months, change in quality of life (Sickness Impact Profile scale), survival and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified three randomised clinical trials. Only two were included in the analysis. Each author graded the studies for methodological quality. Data were extracted and entered by the lead author and checked by the other two. Some missing data had to be regenerated by calculations based on ruler measurements of data presented in published graphs.
MAIN RESULTS: In a European trial with 59 participants on placebo and 124 on rhIGF-I, 0.1 mg/kg/day the mean difference (MD) in change in AALSRS total score after nine months was -3.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) -8.68 to 2.08), non-significantly less in the treated than the placebo group. In a North American trial, in which 90 participants on placebo were compared with 89 on recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I 0.05 mg/kg/day, and 87 participants on 0.1 mg/kg/day, the MD after nine months was -6.00 (95%CI -10.99 to -1.01), significantly less on treatment. The combined analysis from both randomised clinical trials showed a weighted mean difference after nine months of -4.75 (95% CI -8.41 to -1.09), a significant difference in favour of the treated group. The secondary outcome measures showed non-significant trends favouring rhIGF-I. Similarly the data with the 0.05 mg/kg/day dose showed trends favouring rhIGF-I at all time points but did not reach significance at the five per cent level at any point. There was an increased risk of injection site reactions with rhIGF-I (relative risk 2.53, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.59).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available randomised placebo controlled trials do not permit a definitive assessment of the clinical efficacy of rhIGF-I on ALS. More research is needed and one trial is in progress. Future trials should include survival as an outcome measure.","['Mitchell JD', 'Wokke JH', 'Borasio GD']",2007,,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Mitchell JD, et al.

Only one patient with a long history of lower motor weakness had a repeat length in the Kennedy disease range.

17874192,Geographic distribution of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through motor neuron disease mortality data.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare and devastating neurological disorder of the adult age with a prognosis of about 2-3 years from the onset of the disease. No clear cause has been identified but it seems to be a multifactorial disease with genetic and environmental components involved. Increments of mortality rates were observed since 1980 both in Italy and in many other countries. The objective of the present study is to describe the distribution of ALS mortality in Italy in the period 1980-2001 detecting single municipalities or clusters with high mortality levels for motor neuron disease (MND). ALS represents the main part (85%) of the MND group which is globally identified by the IX ICD (International Classification of Diseases and Causes of Death) 335.2 code. Death numbers and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for MND were calculated for all Italian municipalities through the ENEA mortality database system (data source: National Institute of Statistics-ISTAT), using national mortality rates as reference. Subsequently, in order to detect municipal clusters, spatial analysis was performed. Out of the 8,099 Italian municipalities, 132 where characterized by SMR values higher than expected. Moreover 16 clusters with significant high relative risk values (RR) were identified, 12 out of them including only a single municipality. Only 22 of the municipalities with high SMR were included in the clusters. In conclusion, the two different epidemiological methodologies demonstrated to be widely complementary in detecting the geographical distribution of the disease in terms of risk for populations. A first selection of the priority areas where analytical studies should be carried on, in order to identify risk factors associated to ALS, is tentatively suggested.","['Uccelli R', 'Binazzi A', 'Altavista P', 'Belli S', 'Comba P', 'Mastrantonio M', 'Vanacore N']",2007,22,11,Eur J Epidemiol,"Uccelli R, et al.

Three patients were considered cured of their cancer at the time of the study. Four patients have died, one from associated colonic cancer, and three from MND. As in a previous report, the clinical pattern of MND in these patients was that of predominant upper motor neuron involvement in 6/7 cases. Three had frontotemporal dementia.

As Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) or Guamanian ALS (G-PDC or G-ALS) of the Chamorro population may present clinically similar to FTLD-U and ALS, TDP-43 pathology may be present in the G-PDC and G-ALS. Thus, we examined cortical or spinal cord samples from 54 Guamanian subjects for evidence of TDP-43 pathology. In addition to cortical neurofibrillary and glial tau pathology, G-PDC was associated with cortical TDP-43 positive dystrophic neurites and neuronal and glial inclusions in gray and/or white matter. Biochemical analyses showed the presence of FTLD-U-like insoluble TDP-43 in G-PDC, but not in Guam controls (G-C). Spinal cord pathology of G-PDC or G-ALS was characterized by tau positive tangles as well as TDP-43 positive inclusions in lower motor neurons and glial cells. G-C had variable tau and negligible TDP-43 pathology. These results indicate that G-PDC and G-ALS are associated with pathological TDP-43 similar to FTLD-U with/without MND as well as ALS, and that neocortical or hippocampal TDP-43 pathology distinguishes controls from disease subjects better than tau pathology. Finally, we conclude that the spectrum of TDP-43 proteinopathies should be expanded to include neurodegenerative cognitive and motor diseases, affecting the Chamorro population of Guam.","['Geser F', 'Winton MJ', 'Kwong LK', 'Xu Y', 'Xie SX', 'Igaz LM', 'Garruto RM', 'Perl DP', 'Galasko D', 'Lee VM', 'Trojanowski JQ']",2008,115,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Geser F, et al.

METHOD: Seven individuals with MND and AOS were identified from among 80 patients with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and AOS (J. R. Duffy, 2006). The history, presenting complaints, neurological findings, and speech-language findings were documented for each case.
RESULTS: Spastic or mixed spastic-flaccid dysarthria was present in all 7 cases. The AOS was judged as worse than the dysarthria in 4 cases. Nonverbal oral apraxia was eventually present in all cases. Aphasia was present in 2 cases and equivocally present in another 2. Dementia was present in 1 case and equivocally present in 2.
CONCLUSIONS: AOS can occur in MND, typically also with dysarthria, but not invariably with aphasia or other cognitive deficits. Thus, a diagnosis of MND does not preclude the presence of AOS. More importantly, MND should be a diagnostic consideration when AOS is a prominent sign of degenerative disease.","['Duffy JR', 'Peach RK', 'Strand EA']",2007,16,3,Am J Speech Lang Pathol,"Duffy JR, et al.

This model is based on the insertion of a high copy number of disease-causing human Cu/Zn SOD mutations into the intact mouse genome. It serves to establish hypotheses for the pathogenesis of anterior horn cell death, but also to test potential pharmacological approaches to therapy in human ALS. Today, more than 100 -- published and unpublished -- compounds have been tested in this animal model, a large part of them being reported as successful. However, it proved to be difficult to translate these therapeutic successes in the animal model into human trials. Also, a number of disease-modifying strategies were difficult to reproduce, even by the same group. On the other hand, the step from mice to men means a huge investment for the sponsors of clinical trials and the scientific community.

17615171,Factors associated with survival probability in autopsy-proven frontotemporal lobar degeneration.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and pathological factors associated with survival in autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).
METHODS: The final analysis cohort included 71 patients with pathologically proven FTLD, excluding patients with clinical motor neuron disease (MND), evaluated at the University of Pennsylvania or at the University of California, San Francisco. We assessed clinical and demographic features; cognitive functioning at presentation; genetic markers of disease; and graded anatomical distribution of tau, ubiquitin and amyloid pathology.
RESULTS: The tau-negative group (n = 35) had a median survival time of 96 months (95% CI: 72-114 months), whereas the tau-positive group (n = 36) had a median survival time of 72 months (95% CI: 60-84 months). Patients with tau-positive pathology across all brain regions had shorter survival than those with tau-negative pathology in univariate Cox regression analyses (Hazard ratio of dying = 2.003, 95% CI = 1.209-3.318, p = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Tau-positive pathology represents a significant risk to survival in FTLD, whereas tau-negative pathology is associated with a longer survival time when clinical MND is excluded.","['Xie SX', 'Forman MS', 'Farmer J', 'Moore P', 'Wang Y', 'Wang X', 'Clark CM', 'Coslett HB', 'Chatterjee A', 'Arnold SE', 'Rosen H', 'Karlawish JH', 'Van Deerlin VM', 'Lee VM', 'Trojanowski JQ', 'Grossman M']",2008,79,2,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Xie SX, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To describe demographic data, clinical forms of presentation and evolution of patients with MND, looking for prognostic indicators factors.
METHODS: Retrospective study of a series of patients with MND, registering demographic data, clinical variables and mortality-survival, analyzed by means of statistical package SPSS 6.1.2.
RESULTS: They are 54 patients with MND (50 ALS, 3 PMA and 1 PLS), 30 (55.6%) men and 24 (44.4%) women, bulbar beginning forms in 13 cases (24.1%) and spinal in 41 (75.9%). Average age at beginning 60+/-14 (29-82 years), more delayed in women (p<0.05), and in patients with bulbar form (p<0.05) with clear predominance of female sex (p<0.03). There are 31 dead patients (57.4%) and 23 alive ones (42.6%), with average survival from the beginning symptoms of 46.51+/-40.9 months.

17605810,Vitamin E deficiency and risk of equine motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Equine motor neuron disease (EMND) is a spontaneous neurologic disorder of adult horses which results from the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. Clinical manifestations, pathological findings, and epidemiologic attributes resemble those of human motor neuron disease (MND). As in MND the etiology of the disease is not known. We evaluated the predisposition role of vitamin E deficiency on the risk of EMND.
METHODS: Eleven horses at risk of EMND were identified and enrolled in a field trial at different times. The horses were maintained on a diet deficient in vitamin E and monitored periodically for levels of antioxidants--alpha-tocopherols, vitamins A, C, beta-carotene, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and erythrocytic superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In addition to the self-control another parallel control group was included. Survival analysis was used to assess the probability of developing EMND past a specific period of time.
RESULTS: There was large variability in the levels of vitamins A and C, beta-carotene, GSH-Px, and SOD1. Plasma vitamin E levels dropped significantly over time. Ten horses developed EMND within 44 months of enrollment. The median time to develop EMND was 38.5 months. None of the controls developed EMND.
CONCLUSION: The study elucidated the role of vitamin E deficiency on the risk of EMND. Reproducing this disease in a natural animal model for the first time will enable us to carry out studies to test specific hypotheses regarding the mechanism by which the disease occurs.","['Mohammed HO', 'Divers TJ', 'Summers BA', 'de Lahunta A']",2007,49,1,Acta Vet Scand,"Mohammed HO, et al.

17591968,TDP-43 in familial and sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions.,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a major pathological protein of sporadic and familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without motor neuron disease (MND). Thus, TDP-43 defines a novel class of neurodegenerative diseases called TDP-43 proteinopathies. We performed ubiquitin and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on 193 cases of familial and sporadic FTLD with or without MND. On selected cases, immunoelectron microscopy and biochemistry were performed. Clinically defined frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) included four groups: 1) familial FTD with mutations in progranulin (n = 36), valosin-containing protein (n = 5), charged multivesicular body protein 2B (n = 4), and linked to chromosome 9p (n = 7); 2) familial cases of FTD with unknown gene association (n = 29); 3) sporadic FTD (n = 72); and 4) familial and sporadic FTD with MND (n = 40). Our studies confirm that the spectrum of TDP-43 proteinopathies includes most cases of sporadic and familial FTLD-U with and without MND and expand this disease spectrum to include reported families with FTD linked to chromosome 9p but not FTD with charged multivesicular body protein 2B mutations. Thus, despite significant clinical, genetic, and neuropathological heterogeneity of FTLD-U, TDP-43 is a common pathological substrate underlying a large subset of these disorders, thereby implicating TDP-43 in novel and unifying mechanisms of FTLD pathogenesis.","['Cairns NJ', 'Neumann M', 'Bigio EH', 'Holm IE', 'Troost D', 'Hatanpaa KJ', 'Foong C', 'White CL', 'Schneider JA', 'Kretzschmar HA', 'Carter D', 'Taylor-Reinwald L', 'Paulsmeyer K', 'Strider J', 'Gitcho M', 'Goate AM', 'Morris JC', 'Mishra M', 'Kwong LK', 'Stieber A', 'Xu Y', 'Forman MS', 'Trojanowski JQ', 'Lee VM', 'Mackenzie IR']",2007,171,1,Am J Pathol,"Cairns NJ, et al.

17579875,Neuropathologic diagnostic and nosologic criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration: consensus of the Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.,"The aim of this study was to improve the neuropathologic recognition and provide criteria for the pathological diagnosis in the neurodegenerative diseases grouped as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD); revised criteria are proposed. Recent advances in molecular genetics, biochemistry, and neuropathology of FTLD prompted the Midwest Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and experts at other centers to review and revise the existing neuropathologic diagnostic criteria for FTLD. The proposed criteria for FTLD are based on existing criteria, which include the tauopathies [FTLD with Pick bodies, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, sporadic multiple system tauopathy with dementia, argyrophilic grain disease, neurofibrillary tangle dementia, and FTD with microtubule-associated tau (MAPT) gene mutation, also called FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17)]. The proposed criteria take into account new disease entities and include the novel molecular pathology, TDP-43 proteinopathy, now recognized to be the most frequent histological finding in FTLD. TDP-43 is a major component of the pathologic inclusions of most sporadic and familial cases of FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without motor neuron disease (MND). Molecular genetic studies of familial cases of FTLD-U have shown that mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene are a major genetic cause of FTLD-U. Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene are present in rare familial forms of FTD, and some families with FTD and/or MND have been linked to chromosome 9p, and both are types of FTLD-U. Thus, familial TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with defects in multiple genes, and molecular genetics is required in these cases to correctly identify the causative gene defect. In addition to genetic heterogeneity amongst the TDP-43 proteinopathies, there is also neuropathologic heterogeneity and there is a close relationship between genotype and FTLD-U subtype. In addition to these recent significant advances in the neuropathology of FTLD-U, novel FTLD entities have been further characterized, including neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease. The proposed criteria incorporate up-to-date neuropathology of FTLD in the light of recent immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic advances. These criteria will be of value to the practicing neuropathologist and provide a foundation for clinical, clinico-pathologic, mechanistic studies and in vivo models of pathogenesis of FTLD.","['Cairns NJ', 'Bigio EH', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Neumann M', 'Lee VM', 'Hatanpaa KJ', 'White CL', 'Schneider JA', 'Grinberg LT', 'Halliday G', 'Duyckaerts C', 'Lowe JS', 'Holm IE', 'Tolnay M', 'Okamoto K', 'Yokoo H', 'Murayama S', 'Woulfe J', 'Munoz DG', 'Dickson DW', 'Ince PG', 'Trojanowski JQ', 'Mann DM', 'Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration']",2007,114,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Cairns NJ, et al.

17569066,TDP-43 in differential diagnosis of motor neuron disorders.,"Motor neuron disorders are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous. They can be classified into those that affect primarily upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons or both. The most common disorder to affect both upper and lower motor neurons is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Some forms of motor neuron disease (MND) affect primarily motor neurons in the spinal cord or brainstem, while others affect motor neurons at all levels of the neuraxis. A number of genetic loci have been identified for the various motor neuron disorders. Several of the MND genes encode for proteins important for cytoskeletal stability and axoplasmic transport. Despite these genetic advances, the relationship of the various motor neuron disorders to each other is unclear. Except for rare familial forms of ALS associated with mutations in superoxide dismutase type 1 (SOD1), which are associated with neuronal inclusions that contain SOD1, specific molecular or cellular markers that differentiate ALS from other motor neuron disorders have not been available. Recently, the TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been shown to be present in neuronal inclusions in ALS, and it has been suggested that TDP-43 may be a specific marker for ALS. This pilot study aimed to determine the value of TDP-43 in the differential diagnosis of MND. Immunohistochemistry for TDP-43 was used to detect neuronal inclusions in the medulla of disorders affecting upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons or both. Medullary motor neuron pathology also was assessed in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) that had no evidence of MND. TDP-43 immunoreactivity was detected in the hypoglossal nucleus in all cases of ALS, all cases of FTLD-MND and some of cases of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). It was not detected in FTLD-PLS. Surprisingly, sparse TDP-43 immunoreactivity was detected in motor neurons in about 10% of FTLD that did not have clinical or pathologic features of MND. The results suggest that TDP-43 immunoreactivity is useful in differentiating FTLD-MND and ALS from other disorders associated with upper or lower motor neuron pathology. It also reveals subclinical MND in a subset of cases of FTLD without clinical or pathologic evidence of MND.","['Dickson DW', 'Josephs KA', 'Amador-Ortiz C']",2007,114,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Dickson DW, et al.

17569065,Frontotemporal lobar degeneration: clinical and pathological relationships.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) encompasses a heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes that include frontotemporal dementia (FTD), frontotemporal dementia with motor neurone disease (FTD/MND), progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and progressive apraxia (PAX). Clinical phenotype is often assumed to be a poor predictor of underlying histopathology. Advances in immunohistochemistry provide the opportunity to re-examine this assumption. We classified pathological material from 79 FTLD brains, blind to clinical diagnosis, according to topography of brain atrophy and immunohistochemical characteristics. There were highly significant relationships to clinical syndrome. Atrophy was predominantly frontal and anterior temporal in FTD, frontal in FTD/MND, markedly asymmetric perisylvian in PNFA, asymmetric bitemporal in SD and premotor, parietal in PAX. Tau pathology was found in half of FTD and all PAX cases but in no FTD/MND or SD cases and only rarely in PNFA. FTD/MND, SD and PNFA cases were ubiquitin and TDP-43 positive. SD cases were associated with dystrophic neurites without neuronal cytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusions (FTLD-U, type 1), FTD/MND with numerous neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (FTLD-U, type 2 ) and PNFA with neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, dystrophic neurites and neuronal intranuclear inclusions (FTLD-U, type 3). MAPT mutations were linked to FTD and PGRN mutations to FTD and PNFA. The findings demonstrate predictable relationships between clinical phenotype and both topographical distribution of brain atrophy and immunohistochemical characteristics. The findings emphasise the importance of refined delineation of both clinical and pathological phenotype in furthering understanding of FTLD and its molecular substrate.","['Snowden J', 'Neary D', 'Mann D']",2007,114,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Snowden J, et al.

17569064,Gene expression analysis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration of the motor neuron disease type with ubiquitinated inclusions.,"Neurodegenerative disorders share a process of aggregation of insoluble protein. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U) is characterized by the presence of ubiquitin and TDP-43 positive aggregates which are likely related to specific gene expression profiles. We carried out gene expression microarray analysis on post-mortem brain tissue from FTLD-U, FTLD-MND, and controls. Using total RNA from carefully dissected frontal cortical layer II, we obtained gene expression profiles showing that FTLD-U and controls differ in over 100 networks, including those involved in synapse formation, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, endosomal sorting, and apoptosis. We performed qRT-PCR validation for three genes, representative of three different networks. Dynein axonemal light intermediate chain 1 (DNALI1) (microtubule/cytoskeleton network associated) expression was 3-fold higher and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) (signal transduction network) was 3.3 times higher in FTLD-U than FTLD-MND and controls; annexin A2 (ANXA2) (endosomal sorting) expression was 11.3-fold higher in FTLD-U than FTLD-MND and 2.3-fold higher than controls. The identification of progranulin (PGRN) gene mutations and TDP-43 as the major protein component of the ubiquitinated inclusions, are two recent landmark discoveries in the field of FTLD-U. We found 1.5-fold increase in TDP-43 in both FTLD-MND and FTLD-U while progranulin showed no gene expression differences between controls and FTLD-MND. However, one of the FTLD-U cases tested by Affymetrix microarray showed ""absence call"" of this transcript, suggesting absent or decreased gene expression. Our findings point to specific gene-linked-pathways which may be influenced by neurodegenerative disease process and may be targeted for further exploration.","['Mishra M', 'Paunesku T', 'Woloschak GE', 'Siddique T', 'Zhu LJ', 'Lin S', 'Greco K', 'Bigio EH']",2007,114,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Mishra M, et al.

17540579,"A mutation in human VAP-B--MSP domain, present in ALS patients, affects the interaction with other cellular proteins.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset Motor Neuron Disease (MND), characterized by motor neurons death in the cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. Ten loci linked to Familial ALS have been mapped. ALS8 is caused by a substitution of a proline by a serine in the Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein-Associated protein-B/C (VAP-B/C). VAP-B belongs to a highly conserved family of proteins implicated in Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport and microtubules stabilization. Previous studies demonstrated that the P56S mutation disrupts the subcellular localization of VAP-B and that this position would be essential for Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) induced by VAP-B. In the present work we expressed and purified recombinant wild-type and P56S mutant VAP-B-MSP domain for the analysis of its interactions with other cellular proteins. Our findings suggest that the P56S mutation may lead to a less stable interaction of this endoplasmic reticulum protein with at least two other proteins: tubulin and GAPDH. These two proteins have been previously related to other forms of neurodegenerative diseases and are potential key points to understand ALS8 pathogenesis and other forms of MND. Understanding the role of these protein interactions may help the treatment of this devastating disease in the future.","['Mitne-Neto M', 'Ramos CR', 'Pimenta DC', 'Luz JS', 'Nishimura AL', 'Gonzales FA', 'Oliveira CC', 'Zatz M']",2007,55,1,Protein Expr Purif,"Mitne-Neto M, et al.

17507161,Appearance pattern of TDP-43 in Japanese frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions.,"TAR-DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) was identified as a major component of ubiquitin-positive intracellular inclusions from brains of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). Here, we immunohistochemically investigated the appearance pattern of TDP-43 to compare the distribution of TDP-43-positive structures with that of ubiquitin-positive structures in brains of seven patients with Japanese FTLD-U, five of atypical Pick's disease (aPiD) and two of dementia with motor neuron disease (D-MND), as well as two patients with PiD as control. TDP-43-immunoreactivity generally colocalized to ubiquitin-immunoreactivity in both neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and neurites in FTLD-U brains, but TDP-43-immunoreactivity alone or ubiquitin-immunoreactivity alone was also observed. In five aPiD cases, double-immunostaining with TDP-43 and ubiquitin demonstrated that diffuse neuronal cytoplasmic immunostaining for ubiquitin did not always display TDP-43-immunoreactivity. In contrast, ubiquitin-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions usually displayed TDP-43-immunoreactivity in two D-MND cases, although most glial inclusions in one of two cases were immunostained only for TDP-43. TDP-43-positive structures were not detected in two PiD cases. Thus, the ratio in the appearance pattern of TDP-43 and ubiquitin was different between aPiD and D-MND, leading to the hypothesis that this difference may be associated with the two pathogenic variants related to clinical and pathological heterogeneity in FTLD-U.","['Higashi S', 'Iseki E', 'Yamamoto R', 'Minegishi M', 'Hino H', 'Fujisawa K', 'Togo T', 'Katsuse O', 'Uchikado H', 'Furukawa Y', 'Kosaka K', 'Arai H']",2007,419,3,Neurosci Lett,"Higashi S, et al.

17503480,Genetic susceptibility to environmental toxicants in ALS.,"Environmental toxicants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and chemicals appear to be risk factors for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS). An impaired ability to break down these toxicants because of differences in detoxification genes could underlie some cases of this disease. We therefore examined the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 186 SALS patients and 186 controls at the allele, genotype, and haplotype levels for the metallothionein (MT) family of genes, metal transcription factor-1 (MTF-1), and glutathione synthetase (GSS). Exposure to heavy metals, solvents/chemicals, and pesticides/herbicides was assessed by questionnaire, and gene-toxicant interactions were analyzed. An intronic SNP upstream of MT-Ie differed in SALS patients and controls at the allele and genotype levels. Haplotypes covering MT-I isoforms also differed between the two groups. Alleles and genotypes of one MTF-1 SNP differed in female SALS patients. One GSS haplotype interacted with both metals and solvents/chemicals to increase the risk of the disease. Differences in genes involved in handling toxicants, and interactions between toxicants and these genes, appear to be present in some patients with SALS. This suggests that impaired detoxification mechanisms play a role in SALS.","['Morahan JM', 'Yu B', 'Trent RJ', 'Pamphlett R']",2007,144B,7,Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet,"Morahan JM, et al.

Not only was the identity of the ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate in neurons and glia of these disorders finally resolved, but it also was shown that pathologic TDP-43 was hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated and cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments in affected brain and spinal cord of FTLD-U and ALS. This review summarizes the growing evidence that TDP-43 proteinopathy is the common pathologic substrate linking FTLD and ALS, and it considers the implications of these findings for developing better strategies to diagnose and treat these neurodegenerative disorders.","['Kwong LK', 'Neumann M', 'Sampathu DM', 'Lee VM', 'Trojanowski JQ']",2007,114,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Kwong LK, et al.

The questionnaire was designed to be used in studies evaluating treatment regimes where missing data may cause problems with data analyses. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate an algorithm for the imputation of missing dimension scores on the ALSAQ-40. We used a postal survey of patients diagnosed with MND/ALS. One thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine patients were surveyed and 1093 (55.2%) questionnaires returned. Of these, complete ALSAQ-40 data was available in 854 (85.8%) cases. Data were deleted from this complete dataset, and in a randomly selected subset of 100 cases, and then imputed using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm: results were then compared to the dataset prior to data deletion. Descriptive statistics, mean scores and spread of scores were almost identical between original and imputed datasets. Furthermore, the two datasets were highly correlated (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.95 or greater), and mean differences were small (+/-1.00). We concluded that EM imputation for the ALSAQ-40 provides data that closely mirrors the original when this has been deliberately removed. Consequently, EM is likely to be appropriate for studies using the ALSAQ-40 that contain missing data points.","['Jenkinson C', 'Harris R', 'Fitzpatrick R']",2007,8,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Jenkinson C, et al.

In the present study, the levels of transcripts from elements in the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) W family were determined in muscle biopsies from patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and control subjects. Transcripts from the HERV-W element on chromosome 7q21.2 encoding syncytin and from the SOD1 gene were detected at elevated levels in biopsies from the most affected muscles from MND patients compared to biopsies from control individuals. According to a recent study, syncytin is expressed in microglia in normal brain and can be up-regulated in macrophages/microglia during inflammation. Although syncytin may have cytotoxic effects, it is therefore more likely that the present findings reflect a macrophage response in the muscles undergoing neurogenic atrophy than a primary pathogenetic event in MND.","['Oluwole SO', 'Yao Y', 'Conradi S', 'Kristensson K', 'Karlsson H']",2007,8,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Oluwole SO, et al.

17445834,A review of psychosocial aspects of motor neurone disease.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is an illness involving the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurones. There is no known cause or cure. The physical aspects of MND frequently receive the majority of attention, with psychosocial aspects accorded secondary importance. We undertook a comprehensive search of the available literature published between 1966 and 2006 on the psychosocial aspects of MND, including quality of life (QoL), depression, social support, life sustaining treatment (LST), coping, spirituality and current practice. The literature identified that QoL correlated more strongly with measures of suffering, social support and hopelessness than with the physical state of the patient. Depression is relatively common (prevalence rates up to 50%), as are other forms of psychological distress in the MND population, and is not associated with illness severity and functional status. Depression strongly correlates with QoL. Social support is often limited for MND patients and this also influences QoL. Hope and hopelessness are important issues for MND patients with hopelessness contributing significantly to suffering and, for some, a desire for hastened death. Choices and decisions about life sustaining treatments pose a burden for patients and carers. Despite the physical and emotional suffering associated with MND, a significant number cope well and find positive meaning in life. Many patients opting for life sustaining treatment report a satisfactory QoL. In conclusion, psychosocial aspects of life are important for patients with MND. Depression and other expressions of distress require recognition and treatment. Issues of hope, spirituality and life and death also require attention in clinical practice. Although guidelines exist to direct physicians to attend to the physical care, there is a distinct lack of guidance to attend to the psychological state of the MND patient.","['McLeod JE', 'Clarke DM']",2007,258,1-2,J Neurol Sci,McLeod JE and Clarke DM.

17432191,[Phenotypic variation in ALS].,"Making a diagnosis of typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not a tough job, but when it comes to atypical forms of motor neuron disease (MND) which are not uncommon in clinical setting, we may have some difficulty to diagnose ALS/MND. There is striking phenotypic variation in sporadic ALS/MND, such as frail arm syndrome (brachial amyotrophic diplegia), pseudopolyneuritic form, hemiplegic type, ALS/MND with markedly extended involvement beyond the motor system, and MND with basophilic inclusion bodies. These variations must be recognized if physicians are to tailor advice on disease progression, prognosis, drug therapy, and care to the needs of the individual. Clinical trials of new therapeutic agents have been performed, on the assumption that patients with ALS/MND have the same underlying etiology, addressing the heterogeneous population of the patients under a single diagnostic category. This can be detrimental to the well-being of the individual, because clinical heterogeneity may mask drug effects in clinical trials. The attempt to categorize subgroups based on the clinical and pathological backgrounds within the spectrum of ALS/MND may be a critical step in facilitating clinical research in ALS/MND.

No pathogenic mutations were detected suggesting that inherited mtDNA mutations are not a common cause of atypical MND presentations.","['Phoenix C', 'Taylor GA', 'Hartley J', 'Nixon H', 'Ince PG', 'Shaw PJ', 'Turnbull DM', 'Taylor RW']",2007,254,4,J Neurol,"Phoenix C, et al.

17370652,[Clinico-pathological investigation of two patients with dementia with motor neuron disease].,"Dementia with motor neuron disease (D-MND) is characterized clinically by frontal and neurological signs, and pathologically by localized atrophy of the fronto-temporal lobes and neuronal ubiquitin(Ub)-positive inclusions. In this study, we compared the clinico-pathological findings of two patients with D-MND. Case 1 (55-year-old male): At the age of 51, he developed personality change and disinhibition, lacking neurological signs. Brain MRI exhibited localized atrophy of the frontal lobes. At the age of 54, he showed dysphagia and died after a disease duration of 4 years. Neuropathologically, the cerebrum showed localized atrophy of the dorsal area of the frontal lobes. The atrophied cerebral cortex demonstrated moderate neuronal loss with spongy change and gliosis in the superficial layers. The brainstem and spinal cord revealed moderate neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, severe neuronal loss with Bunina bodies in the hypoglossal nucleus, and moderate neuronal loss in the cervical anterior horn. There were some Ub-positive neuronal inclusions in the atrophied cortex and many in the dentate gyrus. Case 2 (68-year-old female): At the age of 64, she developed personality change, and then gait disturbance and dysarthria. Brain MRI exhibited localized atrophy of the fronto-temporal lobes. At the age of 67, she showed dysphagia with Babinski signs and died after a disease duration of 4 years. Neuropathologically, the cerebrum showed localized atrophy of the basal area of the temporal lobes, especially on the right side. The atrophied cerebral cortex demonstrated moderated neuronal loss with spongy change and gliosis in the superficial layers. The pre-central cortex revealed severe loss of Betz cells. The brainstem and spinal cord showed mild neuronal loss without Bunina bodies in the hypoglossal nucleus and cervical anterior horn, accompanied by severe degeneration of the bilateral pyramidal tracts. There were many Ub-positive neuronal inclusions with a few neurites in the atrophied cortex and some in the dentate gyrus. Cases 1 and 2 were clinically diagnosed as Pick's disease (PiD) and D-MND, respectively, although pathological diagnoses were both D-MND. Case 1 showed neuropathological findings typical to D-MND, whereas case 2 showed neuropathological findings common to atypical Pick's disease (aPiD). D-MND and aPiD are should be clinico-pathologically differentiated, although they are included in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease-type inclusions.","['Yamamoto R', 'Iseki E', 'Murayama N', 'Minegishi M', 'Kimura M', 'Eto K', 'Arai H', 'Ohbu S', 'Hatanaka D', 'Hino H', 'Fujisawa K']",2007,59,3,Brain Nerve,"Yamamoto R, et al.

17363404,Matched follow-up study of 5-8 year old ICSI-singletons: comparison of their neuromotor development to IVF and naturally conceived singletons.,"BACKGROUND: Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is an invasive technique of artificial reproduction. We investigated the effect of ICSI on neuromotor development in 5-8 year old singletons.
METHODS: We did a follow-up of ICSI-singletons born between 1996 and 1999 after treatment in the Leiden University Medical Center and compared them with matched controls born after in vitro fertilization (IVF) and natural conception (NC). Children underwent a thorough neurological examination that focused on minor neurological dysfunction (MND).
RESULTS: There were no differences in outcome between ICSI (n = 81) and IVF-children (n = 81), all born at term: MND prevalence 66.3% versus 61.3%, prevalence ratio (PR) 1.08 [0.83; 1.29]. MND prevalence among all ICSI-children (n = 87) was higher than among NC-controls (n = 85) (66.3% versus 50.6%, PR 1.31 [1.02; 1.55]). After adjustment for maternal age and parity, the PR remained elevated but was no longer statistically significant (adjusted PR 1.22 [0.86; 1.52]). When comparing only term ICSI and NC-children (n = 81; n = 85), the PR adjusted for maternal age and parity was 1.20 [0.83; 1.51].
CONCLUSIONS: Neuromotor outcome of 5-8 year old singletons born at term after ICSI or IVF was similar; ICSI-children (both the total group and term children only) deviated slightly from NC-controls. Part of this effect was explained by a difference in parity, but not prematurity.","['Knoester M', 'Vandenbroucke JP', 'Helmerhorst FM', 'van der Westerlaken LA', 'Walther FJ', 'Veen S']",2007,22,6,Hum Reprod,"Knoester M, et al.

17360763,TDP-43 pathology in familial frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease without Progranulin mutations.,"Frontotemporal dementia is accompanied by motor neuron disease (FTD + MND) in approximately 10% of cases. There is accumulating evidence for a clinicopathological overlap between FTD and MND based on observations of familial aggregation and neuropathological findings of ubiquitin-positive neuronal cytoplasmatic inclusions (NCI) in lower motor neurons, hippocampus and neocortex in both conditions. Several familial forms exist with different genetic loci and defects. We investigated the familial aggregation and clinical presentation of FTD + MND cases in a large cohort of 368 FTD patients in The Netherlands. Immunohistochemistry of available brain tissue of deceased patients was investigated using a panel of antibodies including ubiquitin, p62 and TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa antibodies. A total of eight patients coming from six families had a family history positive for FTD + MND (mean age at onset 53.2 +/- 8.4 years). Five patients presented with behavioural changes and cognitive changes followed by motor neuron disease, whereas symptoms of motor neuron disease were the presenting features in the remaining three patients. Other affected relatives in these families showed dementia/FTD, MND or FTD + MND reflecting the clinical interfamilial variation. No mutations were identified in any of the candidate genes, including Superoxide Dismutase 1, dynactin, angiogenin, Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau, valosin-containing protein and progranulin. Available brain tissue of five patients with familial FTD + MND showed NCI in hippocampus, neocortex and spinal cord in all, and neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) in two brains. TDP-43 antibody showed robust staining of neuronal inclusions similar in distribution and morphology to NCI and NII. Additionally, TDP-43 antibody also stained ubiquitin-negative glial inclusions in the basal striatum of one case. In conclusion, there exists considerable clinical variation within families with FTD + MND, which may be determined by other genetic or environmental factors. NII are also found in some cases of familial FTD + MND without Progranulin mutations. The observation of glial TDP-43 positive inclusions in one brain is very interesting, although their pathophysiological significance is yet unknown.","['Seelaar H', 'Schelhaas HJ', 'Azmani A', 'Küsters B', 'Rosso S', 'Majoor-Krakauer D', 'de Rijk MC', 'Rizzu P', 'ten Brummelhuis M', 'van Doorn PA', 'Kamphorst W', 'Willemsen R', 'van Swieten JC']",2007,130,Pt 5,Brain,"Seelaar H, et al.

17354000,A novel locus for distal motor neuron degeneration maps to chromosome 7q34-q36.,"The motor neuron diseases (MND) are a group of related neurodegenerative diseases that cause the relative selective progressive death of motor neurons. These diseases range from slowly progressive forms including hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN), to the rapidly progressive disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). There is clinical and genetic overlap among these MNDs, implicating shared pathogenic mechanisms. We recruited a large family with a MND that was previously described as juvenile ALS and distal HMN. We identified a novel MND/HMN locus on chromosome 7q34-q36 following a genome-wide scan for linkage in this family. The disease causing mutation maps to a 26.2 cM (12.3 Mb) interval flanked by D7S2513 and D7S637 on chromosome 7q34-q36. Recombinant haplotype analysis including unaffected individuals suggests that the refined candidate interval spans 14.3 cM (6.3 Mb) flanked by D7S2511 and D7S798. One gene in the candidate interval, CDK5, was selected for immediate mutation analysis based upon its known association with an ALS-like phenotype in mice however, no mutations were identified. Identification of genes causing familial MND will lead to a greater understanding of the biological basis of both familial and sporadic motor neuron degeneration including ALS.","['Gopinath S', 'Blair IP', 'Kennerson ML', 'Durnall JC', 'Nicholson GA']",2007,121,5,Hum Genet,"Gopinath S, et al.

17317300,Dynamic change of proximal conduction in demyelinating neuropathies: a cervical magnetic stimulation combined with maximum voluntary contraction.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate conduction abnormalities in the nerves innervating the proximal muscles in demyelinating neuropathies (DN) using cervical magnetic stimulation.
METHODS: We applied cervical root magnetic stimulation in the biceps brachii muscles and examined its activity-dependent conduction changes produced by maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in 12 DN patients (seven chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and five multifocal motor neuropathy), six motor neuron disease (MND) patients, and 12 healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: Defining the upper normal limit of motor threshold (31%) and latency (6.7 ms) of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) as mean+2SD, most DN patients revealed an abnormality in motor threshold (10/12) and latency (11/12) in contrast to MND patients (motor threshold (1/6) and latency (0/6)). These parameters contribute to the differentiation of DN from MND (P<0.01). Furthermore, the MVC maneuver transiently decreased the CMAP amplitude ratio (after MVC/before MVC x 100) in DN (83+/-18 %) compared with MND (P<0.01). Two of three DN patients who showed normal motor threshold or latency as in MND were successfully differentiated from MND by the MVC maneuver.
CONCLUSIONS: In DN patients, conduction abnormality in the nerves innervating the proximal muscles was revealed by cervical magnetic stimulation combined with the MVC maneuver.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggested that conduction abnormalities in the proximal nerves innervating the proximal muscles could be evaluated by this method.","['Hitomi T', 'Kaji R', 'Murase N', 'Kohara N', 'Mezaki T', 'Nodera H', 'Kawamura T', 'Ikeda A', 'Shibasaki H']",2007,118,4,Clin Neurophysiol,"Hitomi T, et al.

Previous reports indicate that pure motor neuron disease (MND) is rarely of paraneoplastic origin.
OBJECTIVE: To screen systematically for the prevalence of well characterised paraneoplastic ANAbs in a large collective of patients with pure MND.
METHODS: In a cohort of 145 patients with MND, the frequency of ANAbs was estimated by ELISA, employing recombinant antigens (HuD, Yo, Ri, CV2/CRMP5, Ma2 and amphiphysin).
RESULTS: None of the sera revealed high antineuronal antigen reactivity. Very low reactivity was detected in only five sera, in all probability representing background activity.
CONCLUSION: According to these data, routine analysis for ANAbs in patients with isolated MND is not mandatory.","['Stich O', 'Kleer B', 'Rauer S']",2007,78,8,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Stich O, et al.

They were compared firstly with a group of controls, then later directly with a group of sporadic ALS patients and a familial ALS group homozygous for the 'D90A' SOD1 gene mutation. There was a similar pattern of decreased binding in PLS patients when compared to controls as that seen in a previous study of sporadic ALS patients, supporting the concept that PLS is part of the same overall spectrum of MND. However, in direct group comparisons, both sporadic and homD90A ALS patients demonstrated relative decreases in anterior and orbito-frontal binding compared to PLS patients, suggesting that there may be differences in cortical vulnerability between phenotypic groups.","['Turner MR', 'Hammers A', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Shaw CE', 'Andersen PM', 'Brooks DJ', 'Leigh PN']",2007,254,8,J Neurol,"Turner MR, et al.

17253460,Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND).,"BACKGROUND: Riluzole has been approved for treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in most countries. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost and modest efficacy.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival, and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register for randomized trials in December 2004 and made enquiries of authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 25 2006) and EMBASE (January 1980 to September 30th 2006).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: randomized trials.
TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo. Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50, 100 and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified four eligible randomized trials.
MAIN RESULTS: The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole treated patients and 503 placebo treated patients. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (P value = 0.042, hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.99) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P value = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P value < 0.0001) and the random effects model, which takes this into account, resulted in the overall treatment effect estimate falling just short of significance (P value = 0.056, hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.01). This represented a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (57% in the placebo and 66% in the riluzole group). There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A threefold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole treated patients than controls (weighted mean difference 2.62, 95% confidence interval 1.59 to 4.31).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","['Miller RG', 'Mitchell JD', 'Lyon M', 'Moore DH']",2007,,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Miller RG, et al.

We detected this fourth allele in a Caucasian patient with motor neuron disease (MND). According to the literature we refer to this allele as epsilon3r.

17241187,"Nutritional advice and treatment by dietitians to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease: a survey of current practice in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Canada.","BACKGROUND: The management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND) has shifted from an attitude of nihilism to treatments that prolong survival and offer hope. Nutrition is an integral component of ALS/MND care requiring coordination among acute and community multi-disciplinary teams (MDT). Evidence-based nutrition guidelines exist for this patient group but their use among dietitians is unknown. The aim of this study was to survey the knowledge, practice and guideline use of dietitians working in ALS/MND centres/clinics across England, Wales, Northern Ireland (EWNI) and Canada.
METHOD: Dietetic contact details were obtained from the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) and the ALS Society of Canada (ALSSC) websites. Telephone interviews were conducted with 23 dietitians using a standardized questionnaire.
RESULTS: Multi-disciplinary team membership was high (78%). Only 22% dietitians had >4-years experience in ALS/MND care. Dietitians reported using body weight, percentage weight loss (PWL) and body mass index (BMI) to assess nutritional status. Equations used to estimate energy and protein requirements differed. Most frequent dietary advice was high calorie, texture modification and prescription nutritional supplements. Artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) was discussed when patients developed dysphagia, energy intake was inadequate, weight loss of 10% or forced vital capacity (FVC) was reduced. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) service was available at all clinics/centres.
CONCLUSION: Nutritional assessment techniques and dietary advice should be standardized. Dietetic collaboration at national and international level is recommended to reduce professional isolation. Training and support in ALS/MND nutrition should be made available as part of post-dietetic registration. Further dietetic research is required to stimulate nutritional care.","['Rio A', 'Cawadias E']",2007,20,1,J Hum Nutr Diet,"Rio A and Cawadias E.

17219193,"Ubiquitinated pathological lesions in frontotemporal lobar degeneration contain the TAR DNA-binding protein, TDP-43.","We have investigated the extent and pattern of immunostaining for the TAR DNA-binding protein, TDP-43, in 37 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin (UBQ) pathology (FTLD-U). We confirm that TDP-43 protein is a component of the UBQ immunoreactive (UBQ-ir) neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI), neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) and neurites of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in FTLD-U. We further show that the same three histological patterns, previously identified by us according to the form, number and distribution of the UBQ-ir NCI, NII and neurites are equivalently present in TDP-43 immunohistochemistry. TDP-43 immunoreactive (TDP-43-ir) NCI with rounded, spicular or skein-type appearance were seen in motor neurones of the trigeminal or facial cranial nerve nuclei in one patient with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and in the spinal cord in three patients with FTD + motor neurone disease (MND). In patients with MND alone, TDP-43-ir NCI are common in anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, and occasionally seen in neurones of the hypoglossus nucleus. We show that TDP-43-ir NCI are also present within neurones in the superior and inferior olives in FTLD-U, and in some patients with MND. Although TDP-43 is normally seen as a nuclear protein, nuclear TDP-ir was not observed in neurones of the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord in FTLD-U or MND when NCI were present. We conclude that the UBQ-ir lesions of FTLD and MND are defined by the presence of TDP-43, and that these disorders can be subsumed into a single disease entity under the umbrella of TDP-43 proteinopathy.","['Davidson Y', 'Kelley T', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Du Plessis D', 'Neary D', 'Snowden JS', 'Mann DM']",2007,113,5,Acta Neuropathol,"Davidson Y, et al.

17204329,A gene-environment study of the paraoxonase 1 gene and pesticides in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS) causes progressive muscle weakness because of the loss of motor neurons. SALS has been associated with exposure to environmental toxins, including pesticides and chemical warfare agents, many of which are organophosphates. The enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) detoxifies organophosphates and the efficacy of this enzyme varies with polymorphisms in the PON1 gene. To determine if an impaired ability to break down organophosphates underlies some cases of SALS, we compared the frequencies of PON1 polymorphisms in SALS patients and controls and investigated gene-environment interactions with self-reported pesticide/herbicide exposure. The PON1 coding polymorphisms L55M, Q192R and I102V, and the promoter polymorphisms -909c>g, -832g>a, -162g>a and -108c>t, were genotyped in 143 SALS patients and 143 matched controls. Statistical comparisons were carried out at allele, genotype and haplotype levels. The PON1 promoter allele -108t, which reduces PON1 expression, was strongly associated with SALS. Overall, promoter haplotypes that decrease PON1 expression were associated with SALS, whereas haplotypes that increase expression were associated with controls. Coding polymorphisms did not correlate with SALS. Gene-environment interactions were identified at the allele level for some promoter SNPs and pesticide/herbicide exposure, but not at the genotype or haplotype level. In conclusion, some PON1 promoter polymorphisms may predispose to SALS, possibly by making motor neurons more susceptible to organophosphate-containing toxins.","['Morahan JM', 'Yu B', 'Trent RJ', 'Pamphlett R']",2007,28,3,Neurotoxicology,"Morahan JM, et al.

METHODS: CSF samples from patients with GBS, chronic neuropathies, motor neuron disease (MND), definite sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), and normal control subjects were analyzed by standard immunoblot assay, using a polyclonal anti-14-3-3 antibody. CSF samples were also tested with antibodies recognizing specific isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins, either after one-dimensional or two-dimensional electrophoretic separation.
RESULTS: A positive 14-3-3 assay was observed in 29 of 38 patients with GBS and in 4 patients with MND and other neuropathies, including 2 subjects with vasculitic neuropathy (VN). In GBS, 14-3-3 protein was detected as early as 12 to 48 hours after disease onset and showed an isoform pattern different from that encountered in patients with noninflammatory neuropathies, VN, MND, and sCJD. Immunohistochemical studies performed in archival fatal GBS cases disclosed marked 14-3-3 expression by mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and Schwann cells.

17164563,Affective disorders in motor neuron disease: a population-based study.,"Several studies have suggested that there may be an increased prevalence of affective disorders in people with motor neuron disease (MND). However, the literature is inconsistent, possibly because of small sample sizes in the existing studies. The Canadian province of Alberta has a universal health care system in which physician contacts are recorded along with ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. In this analysis, diagnostic codes indicative of MND and affective disorders were used. Stratified analysis and logistic regression were used in the analysis. There were 336 cases of MND leading to a prevalence of 14.5 per 100,000 in provincial residents > or =20 years old. Affective disorders were identified in 8.6% of the total population during the same year. The crude odds ratio for affective disorders in MND was 2.3 (95% CI = 1.7-3.0). However, the prevalence of affective disorders declined with increasing illness duration.","['Patten SB', 'Svenson LW', 'White CM', 'Khaled SM', 'Metz LM']",2007,28,1,Neuroepidemiology,"Patten SB, et al.

17156946,Are metallothionein genes silenced in ALS?,"Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS) results from the death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Environmental exposure to heavy metals has been implicated in SALS and impaired detoxification of these metals may cause susceptibility to the disease. The metallothionein (MT) family of proteins are the primary detoxification mechanism for heavy metals and MT-Ia and MT-IIa are the most common human isoforms. Inappropriate methylation at the promoters of these genes could lead to silencing of transcription and reduce the availability of MTs. We therefore measured the level of methylation in the promoters of MT-Ia and MT-IIa in 25 leukocyte and six brain DNA samples from SALS patients and compared these with controls. No promoter methylation was evident in any SALS or control samples. In conclusion, it is unlikely that methylation at these gene promoters is a common cause of SALS.","['Morahan JM', 'Yu B', 'Trent RJ', 'Pamphlett R']",2007,168,1,Toxicol Lett,"Morahan JM, et al.

17118410,Inferring thought and action in motor neurone disease.,"The traditional assumption that classical motor neurone disease (MND) invariably spares cognitive function is now recognised to be incorrect. Deficits have most commonly been demonstrated on executive tasks suggesting impaired function of frontal systems. Yet, crucial aspects of frontal lobe function have not hitherto been explored. The study used tests of theory of mind (ToM) (interpretation of cartoons and stories) to examine the ability of 16 patients with MND to interpret social situations and ascribe mental states to others. Only minor differences were elicited in the MND group as a whole compared to controls, and performance was not differentially affected for cartoons and stories requiring inference of another's mental state (mental) compared to control (physical) cartoons and stories. However, abnormalities were elicited on both mental and physical tasks in a subgroup of patients with bulbar signs. Moreover, examination of individual patient scores revealed a spectrum of performance ranging from normal to severely impaired. Errors were qualitatively similar to those seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Performance on the ToM tasks was significantly correlated with conventional, untimed measures of executive function, suggesting that ToM deficits in MND are likely to be linked to a more general executive failure. The findings contribute to the understanding of ToM performance in neurodegenerative disease and provide further evidence of the association between MND and FTD.","['Gibbons ZC', 'Snowden JS', 'Thompson JC', 'Happé F', 'Richardson A', 'Neary D']",2007,45,6,Neuropsychologia,"Gibbons ZC, et al.

However, levels of all three examined parameters in CSF were significantly lower in the MND group than in the healthy controls with the statistical significance for IGF-1 and insulin of P < 0.001.

C. jejuni specific antibodies (CAs) were measured in 420 blood donors (controls), 99 patients with recent C. jejuni infection, 34 patients with central nervous system disorders (neurology controls), and 44 patients with peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorders: 18 with GBS, 12 with MND and 14 with chronic inflammatory neuropathies. Elevated CA titres consistent with recent C. jejuni infection were found in six of the 44 patients with PNS disorders (three with GBS, two with neuropathy, and one with MND, only one of whom had a history of recent C. jejuni infection), compared with two of 454 controls (p = 0.00001). Therefore, we conclude that CAs are often raised in patients with PNS disorders who do not have a history of recent C. jejuni gastroenteritis, so Campylobacter serology may be an unreliable marker of recent infection in this patient group.","['Taylor BV', 'Williamson J', 'Jones D', 'Coleman D', 'Luck J', 'McGregor A']",2007,14,2,J Clin Neurosci,"Taylor BV, et al.

The patient was a 52-year-old woman with almost simultaneous emergence of severe dysarthria and FTD. The severe dysarthria subsequently evolved into anterior opercular syndrome. Motor neuron signs then emerged, and the patient developed akinetic mutism approximately 2 years after the onset of the disease. The patient died of pneumonia after a 7-year clinical illness. Pathologically, severe and widespread degeneration in the frontal and temporal lobes, including the anterior opercular area, limbic system, basal ganglia, spinal cord and cerebellum, and frequent ubiquitin- and tau-negative basophilic inclusions were observed. The pyramidal tracts and anterior horns of the cervical cord also showed marked degeneration. Cases showing basophilic inclusions reported so far have been divided into two groups: early onset FTD and MND with basophilic inclusions. Our case presented clinicopathological features of both FTD and MND, which suggests that cases showing basophilic inclusions may constitute a clinicopathological entity of FTD/MND.","['Ishihara K', 'Araki S', 'Ihori N', 'Shiota J', 'Kawamura M', 'Nakano I']",2006,26,5,Neuropathology,"Ishihara K, et al.

DESIGN: national, descriptive survey of service use and support needs for 503 patients and 373 carers. Patients and carers were recruited from the databases of the disease associations in three Australian states. Patients were excluded if recently diagnosed or too sick or disabled to complete the survey. This was a specification of the ethics committee overseeing this project.
FINDINGS: the MND and HD groups had the greatest needs for support and appeared most receptive to a palliative approach. The MS group was least likely to have a carer and more likely to live alone. HD and PD groups had the highest rates of anxiety and HD groups had the highest rate of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: patients and carers who received more tailored services and more palliative care services were the most satisfied. Therefore, results highlight the need for tailored and flexible models of care for these groups with unique care requirements.","['Kristjanson LJ', 'Aoun SM', 'Oldham L']",2006,12,8,Int J Palliat Nurs,"Kristjanson LJ, et al.

17021754,Heterogeneity of ubiquitin pathology in frontotemporal lobar degeneration: classification and relation to clinical phenotype.,"We have investigated the extent and pattern of immunostaining for ubiquitin protein (UBQ) in 60 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U), 37 of whom were ascertained in Manchester UK and 23 in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, UK. There were three distinct histological patterns according to the form and distribution of the UBQ pathology. Histological type 1 was present in 19 patients (32%) and characterised by the presence of a moderate number, or numerous, UBQ immunoreactive neurites and intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions within layer II of the frontal and temporal cerebral cortex, and cytoplasmic inclusions within granule cells of the dentate gyrus; neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) of a ""cat's eye"" or ""lentiform"" appearance were present in 17 of these patients. In histological type 2 (16 patients, 27%), UBQ neurites were predominantly, or exclusively, present with few intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions within layer II of the cerebral cortex, while in histological type 3 (25 patients, 42%), UBQ intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions either within the cortical layer II or in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, with few or no UBQ neurites, were seen. In neither of these latter two groups were NII present. The influence of histological type on clinical phenotype was highly significant with type 1 histology being associated clinically with cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), type 2 histology with semantic dementia (SD), and type 3 histology with FTD, or FTD and motor neurone disease (MND).","['Mackenzie IR', 'Baborie A', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Du Plessis D', 'Jaros E', 'Perry RH', 'Neary D', 'Snowden JS', 'Mann DM']",2006,112,5,Acta Neuropathol,"Mackenzie IR, et al.

17016698,Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin pathology: an autopsy case presenting with semantic dementia and upper motor neuron signs with a clinical course of 19 years.,"We report a case of a right-handed 74-year-old man who showed semantic dementia with a disease duration of 19 years. He initially presented with excessive use of pronouns and semantic paraphasia at the age of 55 years. Impairment of object recognition developed 5 years after the onset. Face recognition impairment and stereotypic behaviors developed 11 years after onset, and pyramidal signs 2 years before death. Pathological examination disclosed circumscribed severe atrophy in not only the bilateral temporal tips but also in the left precentral gyrus and pars opercularis in a motor speech field. Pyramidal tract involvement and loss of Betz cells were also evident. On the other hand, neurons in the anterior horns and hypoglossal nuclei were spared in number, although astrocytes were mildly proliferated. Ubiquitin-positive lesions were observed in the hippocampus, and frontal and temporal cortices. Neither Bunina bodies nor Pick bodies were present. These features clinically fit the international diagnostic criteria of semantic dementia and, histopathologically, frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). This case suggests that (1) the distribution of cortical lesions associated with language disturbance is not uniform in FTLD-MND. It may be that only some cases of FTLD with ubiquitin pathology develop semantic dementia despite the high incidence of language disturbance, and (2) the precentral gyrus can be severely affected in FTLD-MND. After reviewing previous cases of FTLD-MND with a clinical course of more than 10 years, we also noticed that (3) FTLD-MND cases with a long disease duration often show upper motor neuron-predominant involvement.","['Yokota O', 'Tsuchiya K', 'Itoh Y', 'Ishizu H', 'Akiyama H', 'Ikeda M', 'Kuzuhara S', 'Otomo E']",2006,112,6,Acta Neuropathol,"Yokota O, et al.

However, the first synthesis had some drawbacks regarding reagents, processes, and overall yield, which furthermore decreased when the synthesis was scaled up. Therefore, we now report a new synthetic route for this compound which requires fewer steps and is suited for large-scale production. This compound significantly relieved the symptoms of neuromuscular deficit in mnd mice, a model of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis with motor neuron dysfunction. After oral administration, the concentrations of the compound in the brain and spinal cord were about threefold higher than those in the plasma. In summary, this novel AMPA antagonist is accessible through an optimized synthetic route, has good neurobehavioral activity, oral bioavailability, and favorable brain penetration. This opens new possibilities for the treatment of devastating neurological diseases that are mediated by the AMPA receptor.","['Elger B', 'Schneider M', 'Winter E', 'Carvelli L', 'Bonomi M', 'Fracasso C', 'Guiso G', 'Colovic M', 'Caccia S', 'Mennini T']",2006,1,10,ChemMedChem,"Elger B, et al.

A qualitative study of current guidelines-based practice.,"Management during the diagnostic phase of MND is considered an important influence on the patient's further disease course. Guidelines for the management of MND have been developed, but little is known on how recommended practices influence patients' experience of a new diagnosis of MND. We undertook an interview-based study exploring issues surrounding the diagnosis of MND in a sample of consecutive patients recently diagnosed at a neurosciences centre. Data were analysed with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Thirteen patients were recruited to the study. The major themes identified in descending order were 'Family/carers', 'Communication of the diagnosis', 'Reaction to the diagnosis', 'Physical difficulties', 'Time before diagnosis', 'Information', 'Future', 'Coping with the diagnosis' and 'Formal support'. Communication was perceived satisfactory if handled according to existing guidelines. Physical difficulties impacted considerably on patients' lives. Delays in the diagnostic process appeared in various interviews. Five patients were avoiding information following the diagnosis. Some patients commented on an increasing number of uncoordinated services becoming involved after their diagnosis. This study supports the current international guidelines for MND care around diagnosis from the patients' perspective and underlines the importance of a multi-disciplinary, coordinated approach for patients with MND from diagnosis onwards.","['Hugel H', 'Grundy N', 'Rigby S', 'Young CA']",2006,7,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Hugel H, et al.

The main themes were: 1) Impact on carer: general health, emotional state, life satisfaction, socio-economic concerns, relationships, and protective factors; 2) Experience of service provision: primary care, health professionals, social care, written information, and voluntary organizations. There is a paucity of written documentation on the experience of assisting someone with MND. Data collected are diverse and sometimes contradictory. Sample sizes are often small and generalization difficult. Main findings show that maintenance of social support, activities, and a positive outlook may lessen the chance of ill health arising from long hours spent caring, and having a named coordinator may assist with access to resources, and provide practical and emotional support during and after the caring role.

The subjects in the FTLD-U group were older at death and had longer disease duration. After adjusting for age at death and disease duration, we found a significant difference in the frequency of hippocampal sclerosis in the FTLD-U group (79%) compared to FTLD-MND group (26%) (p=0.02). The difference in frequency of HpScl in FTLD-U compared to FTLD-MND is further evidence that they are separate clinicopathologic entities.","['Josephs KA', 'Dickson DW']",2007,28,11,Neurobiol Aging,Josephs KA and Dickson DW.

16909959,"[Increase in mortality for motor neuron disease in Italy, 1980-1999].","OBJECTIVE: To describe the mortality rates for motor neuron disease (MND) in Italy both at national level and at three large geographical sub-areas (Northern, Central, Southern Italy).
DESIGN: Deaths for MND are coded accordingly to ICD (IX revision) with 335.2 code. Mortality for MND is analysed for the period 1980-99. Mortality rates are age-standardized on the structure of the 1991 Italian population. Mortality data are derived from the National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT) and are made available by the Epidemiological Database of the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment (ENEA).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age adjusted mortality rates for MND are calculated for 5-year periods (1980-84, 1985-89, 1990-94, 1995-99) at both national level and three geographical sub-areas (north, center and south); sex and age specific mortality rates are also reported for two decades (1980-89 and 1990-99).
RESULTS: During 1980-99 the annual age-standardized mortality rate in Italy was 1.35 x 100000 in males and 1.10 (x 100000) in females. In the period 1995-99 the mortality rates increased by 39.3% in males and 78.2% in females at national level when compared to 1980-84 rates (1.56 vs 1.12 deaths per 100000 for males and 1.39 vs 0.78 per 100000 for females in 1980-84 and 1995-99, respectively). In the three large geographical sub-areas such increases were 37.6%, 29.7% and 57% in males and 73%, 63.1% and 114.3% in females, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The increase reported in this study is probably due to a mix of different factors as population ageing (age-specific rates reach a peak in the age class 70-74 years), better accuracy of death certificates, adoption of new clinical criteria and at last a wide spread of environmental risk factors (metals, solvents, pesticides, electromagnetic fields) and modification of life style (smoking, diet, professional sport).","['Altavista P', 'Belli S', 'Binazzi A', 'Comba P', 'Mastrantonio M', 'Uccelli R', 'Vanacore N']",2006,30,2,Epidemiol Prev,"Altavista P, et al.

16835248,Novel threshold tracking techniques suggest that cortical hyperexcitability is an early feature of motor neuron disease.,"The dying forward hypothesis of motor neuron disease (MND) suggests that corticomotoneurons induce excitotoxic anterior horn cell death, with involvement of the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system. The aim of the present study was to apply novel threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques in conjunction with peripheral nerve excitability studies in MND patients to further investigate the dying forward hypothesis and possibly determine the site of disease onset. Studies were undertaken in 23 MND patients using a 90-mm circular coil connected to a BiStim magnetic stimulator for cortical studies and electrical stimulation for peripheral nerve excitability studies. Motor-evoked potentials and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis in the same setting. Measures of cortical and peripheral nerve excitability were correlated with clinical and neurophysiological parameters of disease severity. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was significantly reduced in MND patients compared with controls (MND group = 3.6 +/- 0.8%; controls = 8.5 +/- 1.0%, P < 0.001), most prominently in MND patients with limb-onset disease. Changes in intracortical inhibition were accompanied by alterations in the magnetic stimulus-response curve, cortical silent period duration and resting motor threshold, all indicative of cortical hyperexcitability. Although the reduction in SICI was more pronounced in MND patients with less severe disease, as assessed by the CMAP amplitude, it remained evident even in MND patients with advanced disease. Measures of peripheral disease burden, namely the CMAP amplitude (r = -0.6) and neurophysiological index (r = -0.6), correlated with cortical hyperexcitability changes, as did the strength-duration time constant (r = -0.6), a peripheral marker of axonal excitability. Simultaneous assessment of central and peripheral nerve excitability has established the presence of co-existent upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, with cortical hyperexcitability an early feature in MND.","['Vucic S', 'Kiernan MC']",2006,129,Pt 9,Brain,Vucic S and Kiernan MC.

16780447,Nocturnal hypoxia in motor neuron disease is not predicted by standard respiratory function tests.,"BACKGROUND: With increasing awareness of motor neuron disease (MND) in Australia, the approach to respiratory management of patients with this disease will more commonly face the respiratory physician.
AIM: The aim of this study was to determine if standard respiratory function tests could determine the presence of nocturnal hypoxia (NH) in patients with MND.
METHODS: Respiratory function tests were used to examine daytime respiratory function, and sleep studies were used to detect NH in 16 consecutive patients with MND and in 9 healthy control subjects. Demographic data, clinical parameters, respiratory function tests and sleep studies were obtained. Statistical analyses were carried out using t-tests and anova, where appropriate.
RESULTS: NH was detected in 50% of patients with MND, with no hypoxic events detected in the control group. Standard respiratory function tests were not able to predict the presence of NH.
CONCLUSION: There was no correlation between respiratory function tests and NH. This study emphasizes the inability of standard respiratory function tests to predict NH that may arise early in the course of MND.","['Winhammar JM', 'Joffe D', 'Simmul R', 'Schoeffel R', 'Kiernan MC', 'Rowe DB']",2006,36,7,Intern Med J,"Winhammar JM, et al.

16774628,Anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies in peripheral neuropathy and motor neuronopathy.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the occurence of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTGA) in peripheral nerve disorders, and to correlate them with neurophysiologic findings and anti-glycolipid antibodies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined tTGA immunoglobulin-A serum level from 220 patients with polyneuropathy (acute inflammatory: n=90; chronic inflammatory: n=56; non-inflammatory: n=74) and 110 with motor neuron disease (MND).
RESULTS: Seven of the 330 neurologic patients (2.1%, six with polyneuropathy and one with MND) were positive for tTGA. Sixty-one of the 330 neurologic patients (18.4%) had slightly increased tTGA values compared with healthy controls. Increased tTGA values were associated with greater impairment of neurophysiologic findings, but not with the presence of anti-glycolipid antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of tTGA reactivity in patients with peripheral nerve disorders or MND. However, we were unable to demonstrate an increased risk of celiac disease in these diseases.","['Matà S', 'Renzi D', 'Pinto F', 'Calabrò A']",2006,114,1,Acta Neurol Scand,"Matà S, et al.

16753974,A retrospective analysis of sleep quality and survival with domiciliary ventilatory support in motor neuron disease.,"Previous studies have demonstrated that domiciliary ventilatory support improves survival, quality of life and cognitive function in motor neuron disease (MND). These benefits are partly attributed to better sleep quality and less hypoxia. In a retrospective analysis we compared the effect of non-invasive (NPPV, n = 52), tracheostomy (TPPV, n = 23) and no ventilation (n = 43) on sleep and survival in MND patients over a seven-year period. The TPPV and NPPV groups had more sleep arousals (AI, p = 0.024), more respiratory events (p = 0.001) and more time asleep with an oxygen saturation less than 90% (%TST with SpO2<90%, p = 0.01), than those who were not ventilated. After treatment with TPPV or NPPV, the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep increased (p<0.001) and the %TST with Sp02<90% (p = 0.006) and AI (p = 0.001) decreased. Improvements were larger and more consistent with NPPV. The median survival of those who used TPPV was 41 months, NPPV 32 months and of those not ventilated was 25 months, significantly different four years (p = 0.0497) after symptom onset. In this retrospective cohort of MND patients, ventilation, particularly NPPV, markedly improved sleep and conferred a modest survival advantage.","['Berlowitz DJ', 'Detering K', 'Schachter L']",2006,7,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Berlowitz DJ, et al.

16753969,Audit of outcomes in motor neuron disease (MND) patients treated with riluzole.,"A review of riluzole in MND by NICE concluded that riluzole was modestly effective. NICE however suggested that further studies were needed to gain further insights into its clinical effectiveness. As these studies have not been carried out we audited outcomes in our use of riluzole. Median survival of 148 MND patients receiving riluzole was 3.07 years (2.25 years for 327 patients not given riluzole), hazard ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-2.12; 3.61 years in 103 limb onset patients given riluzole (2.62 years for 124 limb onset patients not given riluzole), hazard ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.09-2.05; 2.19 years in 43 bulbar onset patients receiving riluzole (1.84 years for 103 bulbar onset patients not given riluzole), hazard ratio 1.34, 95% CI 0.89-2.07 and 3.80 years in 87 patients with a PEG given riluzole (2.21 years for 261 patients with a PEG not given riluzole), hazard ratio 1.86, 95% CI 1.44-2.39. These findings are comparable with the results of similar analyses from other groups. The uncertainties they raise emphasize the importance of adequate randomized studies being completed prior to licensing of new drugs. They further illustrate the desirability of controlled introduction of new drugs into clinical practice when RCTs have only suggested a modest level of efficacy.","['Mitchell JD', ""O'brien MR"", 'Joshi M']",2006,7,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Mitchell JD, et al.

16733338,Olfaction in neurodegenerative disorder.,"There has been gradual increase of interest in olfactory dysfunction since it was realised that anosmia was a common feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and Alzheimer-type dementia. It is an intriguing observation that a premonitory sign of a disorder hitherto regarded as one of movement or cognition may be that of disturbed sense of smell. In this review of aging, IPD, parkinsonian syndromes, tremor, Alzheimer's disease (AD), motor neuron disease (MND), Huntington's chorea (HC) and inherited ataxia, the following observations are made: (1) olfactory senescence starts at about the age of 36 years in both sexes and accelerates with advancing years, involving pleasant odours preferentially; (2) olfactory dysfunction is near-universal, early and often severe in IPD and AD developing before any movement or cognitive disorder; (3) normal smell identification in IPD is rare and should prompt review of diagnosis unless the patient is female with tremor-dominant disease; (4) anosmia in suspected progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration is atypical and should likewise provoke diagnostic review; (5) subjects with hyposmia and one ApoE4 allele have an approximate 5-fold increased risk of later AD; (6) impaired sense of smell may be seen in some patients at 50% risk of parkinsonism, and possibly in patients with unexplained hyposmia; (7) smell testing in HC and MND where abnormality may be found is not likely to be of clinical value, and (8) biopsy of olfactory nasal neurons reveals non-specific changes in IPD and AD and at present will not aid diagnosis.",['Hawkes C'],2006,63,,Adv Otorhinolaryngol,Hawkes C.

16702190,Impairment of mitochondrial anti-oxidant defence in SOD1-related motor neuron injury and amelioration by ebselen.,"There is now compelling evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in motor neuron disease (MND), but the molecular basis of these abnormalities is unknown. It is also unclear whether the observed mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in disease pathogenesis, and if so, whether its amelioration might present therapeutic opportunities. We adopted a candidate generation approach using proteomics to screen for changes in mitochondrial protein expression in a well-validated cell-culture model of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) related familial MND (fMND). Changed proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy. Protein candidates included apoptotic regulators, anti-oxidants and components of the electron transport chain. Confirmatory Western blotting was performed, and validated protein expression changes were further investigated. Peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx3), a mitochondrial thioredoxin-dependent hydroperoxidase, is downregulated in the presence of mutant SOD1 in both our cell-culture model and in the spinal cord mitochondria of mutant SOD1 transgenic mice. We confirm the expression of Prx3 within the mitochondria of spinal motor neurons in mouse and humans by immunohistochemistry. Using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR), we show that Prx3 is also downregulated in spinal motor neurons from patients with both sporadic (sMND) and SOD1-related fMND. In a disease characterized by oxidative stress, this represents a potentially important deficit in mitochondrial anti-oxidant defence. Recent evidence suggests that oxidative stress from aberrant copper chemistry may not play a major part in the pathogenesis of SOD1-related fMND. From the results of this study we propose disruption of mitochondrial anti-oxidant defence as an alternative mechanism whereby mutant SOD1 may generate oxidative stress within motor neurons. We further demonstrate that ebselen, an anti-oxidant drug already safely used in human studies and that acts as a Prx mimic, is able to ameliorate the toxicity of mutant SOD1 in our cell-culture model. We conclude by showing that ebselen is capable of inducing transcription of the anti-oxidant response element (ARE) and postulate that ebselen may act both by the transcriptional upregulation of anti-oxidant proteins, and directly as an anti-oxidant in its own right.","['Wood-Allum CA', 'Barber SC', 'Kirby J', 'Heath P', 'Holden H', 'Mead R', 'Higginbottom A', 'Allen S', 'Beaujeux T', 'Alexson SE', 'Ince PG', 'Shaw PJ']",2006,129,Pt 7,Brain,"Wood-Allum CA, et al.

16614031,Cardiomyopathy in motor neuron diseases.,"OBJECTIVE: Myocardial involvement in motor neuron diseases (MND) is an uncommon feature. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system affecting cardiac function have been described, for the hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) comparable manifestations are unknown. This study observed ALS and HSP patients with coexisting cardiomyopathy without major cardial risk factors.
METHODS: Four patients with definite ALS and two pHSP patients. In all patients detailed clinical, cardiological, electrophysiological and laboratory data were analysed. In two ALS patients skeletal muscle biopsy was performed.
RESULTS: In all investigated MND patients cardiomyopathy was present. Beside hyperlipoproteinaemia and mild hypertension in one case, none of the patients showed major cardiovascular risk factors. There was no evidence for a secondary cause of cardiomyopathy like coronary heart disease, myocarditis, or mitochondrial damage mimicking MND.
CONCLUSION: This report could not conclude that the occurrence of cardiomyopathy is rare logically. Although an underlying pathophysiological cause was not obvious, it is proposed that in all MND patients a routine cardiological evaluation should be performed.","['Gdynia HJ', 'Kurt A', 'Endruhn S', 'Ludolph AC', 'Sperfeld AD']",2006,77,5,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Gdynia HJ, et al.

16606762,Clinically undetected motor neuron disease in pathologically proven frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) is a pathological entity characterized by motor neuron degeneration and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The ability to detect the clinical signs of dementia and motor neuron disease in pathologically confirmed FTLD-MND has not been assessed.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if all cases of pathologically confirmed FTLD-MND have clinical evidence of frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease, and to determine the possible reasons for misdiagnosis.
METHOD: Review of historical records and semiquantitative analysis of the motor and extramotor pathological findings of all cases of pathologically confirmed FTLD-MND.
RESULTS: From a total of 17 cases of pathologically confirmed FTLD-MND, all had clinical evidence of frontotemporal dementia, while only 10 (59%) had clinical evidence of motor neuron disease. Semiquantitative analysis of motor and extramotor pathological findings revealed a spectrum of pathological changes underlying FTLD-MND. Hippocampal sclerosis, predominantly of the subiculum, was a significantly more frequent occurrence in the cases without clinical evidence of motor neuron disease (P<.01). In addition, neuronal loss, gliosis, and corticospinal tract degeneration were less severe in the other 3 cases without clinical evidence of motor neuron disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnostic sensitivity for the elements of FTLD-MND is modest and may be affected by the fact that FTLD-MND represents a spectrum of pathological findings, rather than a single homogeneous entity. Detection of signs of clinical motor neuron disease is also difficult when motor neuron degeneration is mild and in patients with hippocampal sclerosis.","['Josephs KA', 'Parisi JE', 'Knopman DS', 'Boeve BF', 'Petersen RC', 'Dickson DW']",2006,63,4,Arch Neurol,"Josephs KA, et al.

16600498,Total antioxidant capacity of cerebrospinal fluid is decreased in patients with motor neuron disease.,"Oxidative stress has been associated with motor neuron disease (MND). The human body has several antioxidant defense systems to repair the damage caused by oxidative stress. The activity of these systems is thought to be reduced in neurodegenerative diseases, which may increase the level of oxidative damage and be a contributing factor to motor neuron death. In the present study, we compared the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of human serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MND patients with that of a control group including patients with migraine, tension headache and psychiatric disorders. Within-subject serum and CSF TAC were strongly correlated (r=0.639; p=0.000), and CSF TAC was significantly lower in MND patients as compared to controls after adjustment for known influencing factors (112.7 micromol Fe/L+/-11.7 versus 135.2 micromol Fe/L+/-19.7; p=0.012). No differences in serum or CSF TAC were observed among the clinical forms of MND considered in this work. In conclusion, the CSF TAC was strongly correlated with serum TAC, and a decrease in CSF TAC was demonstrated in MND patients compared to controls that was not independent from serum antioxidants, this translating in a systemic (but prevailing in the CNS) oxidative damage in this pathology.","['Mandrioli J', 'Del Rio D', 'Zini A', 'Nichelli P', 'Merelli E', 'Beltrami D', 'Cesari C', 'Pellegrini N', 'Brighenti F', 'Sola P']",2006,401,3,Neurosci Lett,"Mandrioli J, et al.

METHODS: A questionnaire was developed to assess carers' perceptions of their social support network (the Caregiver Network Scale, CNS), including measures of sociodemographic status and general well-being (GHQ-12), and mailed to carers of people living with MND.
RESULTS: Seventy-five surveys were returned (response rate: 33%). In univariate analyses, relationships between well-being and carer age, time as caregiver, and four subscales of the CNS were found to be significant. However, multivariate analyses combining their effects revealed that stress on carer social networks was the best single contributor to predictions of carer well-being.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Results indicate that prolonged caring for others living with MND has substantial costs for the carer in terms of loss of social support, which affects carer well-being and impacts ultimately on those living with MND. The CNS offers promise as a measure for screening at-risk carers; those who are distressed become candidates for professional intervention to help them cope better. Further research, providing validation of the scale for this task, is recommended.","['Love A', 'Street A', 'Harris R', 'Lowe R']",2005,3,1,Palliat Support Care,"Love A, et al.

Normal values of EMG parameters for muscle studied and test-retest correlation coefficient were calculated in 35 healthy volunteers. In MND on the early stages (1 and 2) of CPD, duration and amplitude of motor unit potentials (MUPs) correlated negatively while on the later stages (3A, SB, 4 and 5) the correlations were positive, but only in muscles within the site of onset. There was no significant predominance of duration and amplitude of MUPs in those muscles. MUPs amplitude was significantly higher in patients with MND with predominant lower motor neuron involvement (p < 0.05). In muscles with MUPs duration higher than--20% and increased amplitude, MUPs duration decreased within the site of onset up to the second study. In BMND, MUPs duration and amplitude never decreased in follow-up. These parameters were significantly higher in BMND than in MND (p < 0.0001) in less affected muscles (without paresis). In contrast to BMND, no lag of paresis behind the CPD stage was observed in MND. The data obtained suggest a recurrent and forward mode of CPD on late stages and allow to differentiate slowly progressive MND and BMND in the single as well as in repeated study after a short period of time.","['Serdiuk AV', 'Levitskiĭ GN', 'Skvortsova VI']",2006,106,2,Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,"Serdiuk AV, et al.

16546753,Management of respiration in MND/ALS patients: an evidence based review.,"This systematic review comprises an objective appraisal of the evidence in regard to the management of respiration in patients with motor neuron disease (MND/ALS). Studies were identified through computerised searches of 32 databases. Internet searches of websites of drug companies and MND/ALS research web sites, 'snow balling' and hand searches were also employed to locate any unpublished study or other 'grey literature' on respiration and MND/ALS. Since management of MND/ALS involves a number of health professionals and care workers, searches were made across multiple disciplines. No time frame was imposed on the search in order to increase the probability of identifying all relevant studies, although there was a final limit of March 2005. Recommendations for patient and carer-based guidelines for the clinical management of respiration for MND/ALS patients are suggested on the basis of qualitative analyses of the available evidence. However, these recommendations are based on current evidence of best practice, which largely comprises observational research and clinical opinion. There is a clear need for further evidence, in particular randomised and non-randomised controlled trials on the effects of non-invasive ventilation and additional larger scale cohort studies on the issues of initial assessment of respiratory symptoms, and management and timing of interventions.","['Heffernan C', 'Jenkinson C', 'Holmes T', 'Macleod H', 'Kinnear W', 'Oliver D', 'Leigh N', 'Ampong MA']",2006,7,1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler,"Heffernan C, et al.

A morphometric study.,"The cytopathology and loss of neurons was studied in 7670 neurons from the ventral horn of the third lumbar segment of the spinal cord of six sporadic motor neuron disease (MND) patients compared with 7568 neurons in seven age matched control subjects. A modified Tomlinson et al. [Tomlinson BE, Irving D, Rebeiz JJ. Total numbers of limb motor neurones in the human lumbosacral cord and an analysis of the accuracy of various sampling procedures.

Neuronal populations were also classified by the maximum cell diameter through the nucleolus. There was widespread loss of neurons in all quadrants of the ventral horn in MND. Size distribution histograms showed similar neuron loss across all populations of neurons. The dorsomedial quadrant contains almost exclusively interneurons and the ventrolateral quadrant mostly motor neurons. The cytopathology of neurons in the dorsomedial quadrant and of large motorneurons in the ventrolateral quadrant MND was similar. In the dorsomedial quadrant, neuron loss (56.7%) was similar to the loss of large motor neurons in the ventrolateral quadrant (64.4%). The loss of presumed motor neurons and interneurons increased with increased disease duration. There was no evidence that loss of presumed interneurons occurred prior, or subsequent, to loss of motor neurons. We conclude that, in sporadic MND, all neuronal populations in the ventral horn are affected and that interneurons are involved to a similar extent and in parallel with motor neurons, as reported in the G86R transgenic mouse model of familial MND. The increasing evidence of loss of neurons other than motor neurons in MND suggests the need for revising the concept of selective motor neuron vulnerability.","['Stephens B', 'Guiloff RJ', 'Navarrete R', 'Newman P', 'Nikhar N', 'Lewis P']",2006,244,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Stephens B, et al.

16459354,[Detoxication gene polymorphism and susceptibility to sporadic motor neuron disease in Russian population].,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons of the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. Many genetic systems are thought to be involved in pathogenesis of this complex disease. A significant etiological factor of MND may be oxygen free radicals, which damage neuronal cells when they are present in high concentrations. Detoxication processes resulting in the formation of free radicals, which subsequently transformed into nontoxic products, are also critical for the disease development. The major participants of these processes are cytochromes P-450 (CYP2E1, CYP2D6), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1) and N-acetyltransferases (NAT2). To investigate a role of genes of detoxication system in development of MND, we study polymorphisms in these genes in 72 patients with MND from Moscow and controls from Russia. Significant statistical differences have been found in frequency of the alleles CYP2E1*1D, CYP2D6*4 and GSTM1(0/0) and genotypes homozygous for GSTM1 (0) between the study and control groups. The analysis of GSTT1, GSTP1 and NAT1 gene polymorphisms has revealed no between-group differences in distribution of different alleles and genotypes.

16410201,Riluzole therapy for motor neurone disease: an early Australian experience (1996-2002).,"Riluzole is the only therapy proven in clinical trials to prolong survival in patients with motor neurone disease (MND). Prior to its listing by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Scheme in June 2003, the aim of the present study was to provide Australian patients with MND early access to riluzole and to expand the safety profile data of this therapy. Patients with MND were referred to the programme by neurologists covering the Sydney metropolitan region. To be eligible to receive riluzole, patients had to be aged between 18 and 75 years and have probable or definite MND based on El Escorial criteria, with a disease duration of less than 5 years and a vital capacity greater than 60% before study entry. Patients were prescribed riluzole 50 mg twice daily. Safety data were collected through documentation of adverse events by clinical history in combination with regular laboratory screening. Full blood count, haematocrit, differential white cell counts and serum liver transaminase levels were obtained monthly for 3 months, and then at each 3-monthly visit for 1 year. In total, 25 patients with MND (17 male, 8 female; age range 40-74 years; mean age 59 years) were commenced on riluzole. Of these, 28% had definite MND and the remaining 72% were diagnosed as probable MND, with the majority (84%) having limb-onset MND. At 12 months, 68% of patients continued on riluzole, 16% had died from their disease and 16% ceased riluzole because of side-effects or other reasons, largely disenchantment owing to a perceived lack of efficacy. Haematological and biochemical assays showed no significant alteration during the initial 12-month period. Long-term survival data for patients in the present series suggest a greater benefit for patients who commenced riluzole early in the course of their illness. In conclusion, riluzole was generally tolerated well by Australian patients with MND. Of the few patients who experienced side-effects attributed to riluzole, all were reversible. Issues related to patient perceptions of efficacy highlight the need for patients and treating physicians to maintain realistic expectations of riluzole therapy.","['Zoing MC', 'Burke D', 'Pamphlett R', 'Kiernan MC']",2006,13,1,J Clin Neurosci,"Zoing MC, et al.

16409556,Ubiquitin-positive inclusions and progression of pathology in frontotemporal dementia and motor neurone disease identifies a group with mainly early pathology.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with tau-negative, ubiquitin-positive inclusions has been a topic of major interest in recent years, with this group now accounting for the majority of tau-negative cases of frontotemporal degeneration. The severity of neurodegeneration in FTLD is dependent on the stage of disease and is substantial even in the earliest stages. Elucidating the pathogenesis of FTLD requires evaluation of changes during the earliest possible stage of disease. However, the long survival of most frontotemporal dementia cases means that cases with early neuropathology are not frequently encountered. Cases of FTLD with the shortest survival are those with coexisting motor neurone disease (FTLD + MND), making these the ideal group for studying early FTLD pathology. It is not clear, however, what the pathological contribution of MND is in these cases. This study evaluates the pathology of 20 cases of FTLD (11 with no clinical signs of MND and nine with FTLD + MND) as well as 10 cases of MND without dementia. Our findings indicate that the deposition of ubiquitin does not play a key role in the neurodegenerative process in FTLD, and that the severity of neurodegeneration in FTLD is similar in cases with and without clinical MND.","['Kersaitis C', 'Halliday GM', 'Xuereb JH', 'Pamphlett R', 'Bak TH', 'Hodges JR', 'Kril JJ']",2006,32,1,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Kersaitis C, et al.

However, we have only scanty information on the immunoreactivity of alpha-synuclein in other inclusion bodies such as the Lewy body-like inclusions and the skein-like inclusions observed in motor neuron disease (MND). In this report, we immunocytochemically investigated inclusion bodies observed in the anterior horn neurons of the spinal cord in 29 patients with sporadic MND. Sixteen age-matched patients without any neurological disease served as controls. In MND patients, we recognized Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions, skein-like inclusions, Bunina bodies, basophilic inclusions, and intracytoplasmic hyaline (colloid) inclusions, but none of them were immunostained for alpha-synuclein. Our findings in this study do not support the hypothesis that MND could be classified as one of the diseases grouped as alpha-synucleinopathies.","['Sasaki S', 'Komori T', 'Iwata M']",2006,397,1-2,Neurosci Lett,"Sasaki S, et al.

16403674,Cervical nerve root stimulation. Part II: findings in primary demyelinating neuropathies and motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical nerve root stimulation (CRS) allows the assessment of conduction in the proximal segments of motor fibers destined to the upper extremities, which are not evaluated by routine nerve conduction studies (NCS). Since many primary demyelinating polyneuropathies (PDP) are multifocal lesions may be confined to the proximal nerve segments. CRS may therefore increase the yield of neurophysiologic studies in diagnosing PDP.
METHODS: We reviewed clinical and neurophysiologic data from 38 PDP patients and compared them to 35 patients with motor neuron disease (MND), and 21 healthy controls (HC).
RESULTS: Mean onset-latency was significantly prolonged in PDP patients. The optimal onset-latency cutoff necessary to distinguish PDP from MND and controls was 17.5 ms for the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and 7 ms for Biceps and Triceps. Mean reduction in proximal to distal CMAP amplitude to APB and ADM was significantly greater in PDP patients, with an optimal cutoff in proximal to distal CMAP amplitude reduction necessary to distinguish PDP from MND and HC being 45%.
CONCLUSIONS: CRS is effective in distinguishing PDP from MND and HC based on prolonged onset latency and conduction block criteria.
SIGNIFICANCE: CRS may increase the diagnostic yield in cases where demyelinating lesions are confined to the proximal peripheral neuraxis.","['Vucic S', 'Black K', 'Siao Tick Chong P', 'Cros D']",2006,117,2,Clin Neurophysiol,"Vucic S, et al.

16401843,Clinicopathologic analysis of frontotemporal and corticobasal degenerations and PSP.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between early clinical features, pathologies, and biochemistry of the frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLDs), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD).
METHODS: The authors conducted pathologic reexamination with the most recent immunohistochemistry of all cases diagnosed with FTLD, PSP, and CBD between 1970 and 2004. The authors also reviewed the early clinical features for clinical diagnosis and application of published research criteria.
RESULTS: Of 127 cases analyzed, 57 had a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD, 49 PSP, and 21 CBD. Of these, 38 were clinically reclassified as frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 13 as progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), 21 as CBD-like, 33 as PSP-like, and 13 with frontotemporal dementia with coexisting motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). The authors were unable to classify nine cases. All cases of FTD-MND were tau-negative and had pathologic evidence of motor neuron degeneration. All cases classified as PSP-like or CBD-like had tau-positive pathology. Of the 13 cases with PNFA, PSP and CBD accounted for almost 70% of the cases, while FTD was almost equally divided between tau-positive and tau-negative diseases.
CONCLUSION: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have overlapping clinical features. The prediction of tau-positive pathology from a CBD or PSP-like presentation is good, while the frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-motor neuron disease syndrome almost certainly predicts motor neuron degeneration. Surprisingly, PSP and CBD accounted for most cases classified as progressive non-fluent aphasia. Frontal variant FTD is an unpredictable disease in terms of its biochemistry.","['Josephs KA', 'Petersen RC', 'Knopman DS', 'Boeve BF', 'Whitwell JL', 'Duffy JR', 'Parisi JE', 'Dickson DW']",2006,66,1,Neurology,"Josephs KA, et al.

We identified a patient with clinical features suggestive of MND but additional cardiac and metabolic symptoms. We wished to determine if the clinical features were due to a mitochondrial DNA mutation.
METHODS: The brain and spinal cord were studied using neuropathological techniques and agenetic defect investigated in individual neurons.
RESULTS: There were atypical neuropathological features and genetic studies identified a pathogenic, heteroplasmic mitochondria tRNA(Ile) (4274T>C) mutation.
INTERPRETATION: This case adds to the phenotypic variation seen in mitochondrial DNA disease but also highlights the potential role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the cause of MND.","['Borthwick GM', 'Taylor RW', 'Walls TJ', 'Tonska K', 'Taylor GA', 'Shaw PJ', 'Ince PG', 'Turnbull DM']",2006,59,3,Ann Neurol,"Borthwick GM, et al.

16334972,A comparison of psychosocial and physical functioning in patients with motor neurone disease and metastatic cancer.,"Although their disease processes and treatments are different, patients with motor neurone disease (MND) and those with late-stage cancer share a common situation--one in which the quality of life, rather than a cure, becomes the focus of care. We report here a comparison of 126 patients with MND and 125 with metastatic cancer on a range of physical and psychosocial measures. Compared to cancer patients, MND patients were younger, had greater social contacts, but were more physically impaired. Cancer patients had more pain and were on more medication (opioids, steroids, and analgesics). Although the Beck depression scores were similar in both groups, MND patients had significantly higher scores for demoralization, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. Cancer patients, on the other hand, scored significantly higher on anhedonia. We suggest this difference in the quality of depression represents a difference in illness experience of the two groups and has relevance for the ways we treat depression in the medically ill.","['Clarke DM', 'McLeod JE', 'Smith GC', 'Trauer T', 'Kissane DW']",2005,21,3,J Palliat Care,"Clarke DM, et al.

16326402,Atrophy of large myelinated motor axons and declining muscle grip strength following mercury vapor inhalation in mice.,"The effects of acute mercury vapor (Hg(0)) exposure on the peripheral motor system have not been previously addressed in the literature. Early case studies report that acute exposure in humans can cause symptoms resembling motor neuron disease (MND). Mercury granules can be histochemically demonstrated in the cytoplasm of murine motor neurons following Hg(0) exposure, suggesting it is transported from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to the cell body by retrograde axonal transport mechanisms. We considered the hypothesis that morphological damage to the peripheral motor axonal cytoskeleton possibly involving neurofilaments (NFs) follows Hg(0) exposure. Eight-week-old wild type (Wt) 129S/v mice were exposed to 500 microg/m(3) of Hg(0) for 4 h in an experimental vapor exposure chamber. Forelimb grip strength (FGS) was measured over 4-wk intervals prior to removal of the murine phrenic nerves (MPN) 7 mo postexposure. Autometallography of 7-microm-thick spinal-cord sections from Hg(0)-exposed mice confirmed the presence of mercury deposits in ventral horn motor neurons. The morphology of the myelinated motor axons was assessed by computer-assisted image analysis of 1-microm-thick resin cross sections of the MPN. The group exposed to Hg(0) showed a significant reduction in the mean axon caliber, p < .0001. Gaussian spectral analysis of axon diameter distribution showed atrophy principally to large myelinated fibers, a subpopulation of axons that is also affected in MND. This atrophic change was also accompanied by an increased irregularity in axon shape. FGS initially increased with age until 20 wk and then progressively decreased after 22 wk to 36 wk. In conclusion, Hg(0) exposure appears to reduce axon diameter, suggesting axon caliber-determining cytoskeletal components such as neurofilaments may be damaged by heavy metal-induced oxidative stress mechanisms, resulting in functional changes to motor units.",['Stankovic R'],2006,18,1,Inhal Toxicol,Stankovic R.

16319030,Dementia of frontal lobe type in Kennedy's disease.,"The pathomorphological correlate of Kennedy's disease (KD) is a degeneration of spinal and bulbar alpha-motor neurons. The disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the X-chromosomal androgene receptor gene. Contrary to the common belief that cognitive disorders in motor neuron diseases (MND) are either rare or only mild, there is now an increasing number of case reports on dementia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In ALS, dementia of the frontal lobe type (frontotemporal dementia, FTD) seems to be the characteristic pattern. However, in KD cognitive dysfunction has not been studied systematically. Here we present a case with clinical characteristics of FTD in a patient with genetically confirmed KD. It remains speculative whether there is an association between KD and FTD comparable to a genetic linkage between ALS and FTD, which has been proposed in recent years. However, we suggest that cognitive dysfunction may be more common in KD than reported until today.","['Kessler H', 'Prudlo J', 'Kraft S', 'Supprian T']",2005,6,4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Kessler H, et al.

16317257,Ubiquitin immunohistochemistry of frontotemporal lobar degeneration differentiates cases with and without motor neuron disease.,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) without tau pathology is clinically and pathologically heterogeneous. The present report describes the neuropathology of 52 brains with FTLD without tau pathology compared with 10 brains of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without dementia using ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. The 52 cases were classified into 47 cases of FTLD with motor neuron disease (MND)-type inclusions but without MND (FTLD-MNI), three cases of FTLD with MND (FTLD-MND), and two cases of dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) based on the features of ubiquitin-immunoreactive (ubiquitin-ir) structures in the caudate, frontotemporal cortices and dentate fascia, and presence or absence of neuronal loss in lower motor neurons. Many ubiquitin-ir neuronal inclusions and neurites in the caudate nucleus, frontotemporal cortices, and ubiquitin-ir crescent-or ring-shaped neuronal inclusions in the dentate fascia characterized FTLD-MNI. Ubiquitin-ir neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) were observed in 26 of 43 cases and associated with many neurites in the caudate nucleus as well as a familial history in most cases. A subset of cases had Pick-body-like inclusions in the dentate fascia and caudate nucleus with paucity of neuritic pathology and no NII; another had crescent-shaped inclusions in the dentate fascia and neuritic pathology with NII in the caudate. FTLD with MND was characterized by a few or no ubiquitin-ir inclusions in the caudate nucleus and frontotemporal cortices and ubiquitin-ir granular inclusions in the dentate fascia, as well as loss of lower motor neurons. These features were similar to ALS, but different from FTLD-MNI. The findings suggest that FTLD-MNI has a different pathogenesis from FTLD-MND and ALS.","['Katsuse O', 'Dickson DW']",2005,19 Suppl 1,,Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,Katsuse O and Dickson DW.

ELISA was employed to examine IgG antibodies against ten HSPs (HSP27, alphaA and alphaB crystallins, HSP60, CCT, Mycobacterium bovis HSP65, Escherichia coli GroEL, HSP70, HSC70 and HSP90) in CSF from 30 patients with MS, and 25 patients with motor neuron diseases (MND). Significantly higher antibody titers against HSP70 and HSC70 proteins were found in CSF obtained from patients with MS as compared with MND independent of CSF total protein, IgG concentrations and IgG indices, respectively. The antibody titers against HSP70 were indicated to be significantly higher in the progressive cases than in cases of remission. The results suggest that IgG antibodies against specific types of HSPs especially HSP70 family proteins (HSP70 and HSC70) in CSF may play an important role in the pathophysiology of MS through the modification of immune response and cytoprotective functions of molecular chaperons.","['Chiba S', 'Yokota S', 'Yonekura K', 'Tanaka S', 'Furuyama H', 'Kubota H', 'Fujii N', 'Matsumoto H']",2006,241,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Chiba S, et al.

16247937,An epidemiological study of motor neuron disease in Hong Kong.,"Worldwide, the incidence of motor neuron disease (MND) has been increasing steadily over recent decades.

Every retrieved case or their records were reviewed and validated by neurologist(s) of the responsible regional hospitals which the patients attended. One hundred and twenty cases from seven regional hospitals (serving 48.05% of the HKSAR population) were identified, validated and confirmed to be MND or related diseases. Ninety-eight new cases were diagnosed during the study period. Average age of onset was 58.76 years; SD 14.12 (28-89) years. Male to female ratio was 1.72:1. Peak age of onset was 60-64 years without sex difference. The adjusted incidence rate was 0.60/100,000/year. The adjusted point prevalence at the prevalence date (31 January 2001) was 3.04/100,000. Despite the incidence and prevalence of MND among Hong Kong Chinese, it remained low compared to worldwide figures, and our data suggested a significant rise of MND or related disease in the last decade.

16228969,Gene-based treatment of motor neuron diseases.,"Motor neuron diseases (MND), such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), are progressive neurodegenerative diseases that share the common characteristic of upper and/or lower motor neuron degeneration. Therapeutic strategies for MND are designed to confer neuroprotection, using trophic factors, anti-apoptotic proteins, as well as antioxidants and anti-excitotoxicity agents. Although a large number of therapeutic clinical trials have been attempted, none has been shown satisfactory for MND at this time. A variety of strategies have emerged for motor neuron gene transfer. Application of these approaches has yielded therapeutic results in cell culture and animal models, including the SOD1 models of ALS. In this study we describe the gene-based treatment of MND in general, examining the potential viral vector candidates, gene delivery strategies, and main therapeutic approaches currently attempted. Finally, we discuss future directions and potential strategies for more effective motor neuron gene delivery and clinical translation.","['Federici T', 'Boulis NM']",2006,33,3,Muscle Nerve,Federici T and Boulis NM.

16222525,Histopathological changes underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration with clinicopathological correlation.,"We have investigated the pathological correlates of dementia in the brains from a consecutive series of 70 patients dying with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Clinical misdiagnosis rate was low with only 3 patients (4%) failing to show pathological changes consistent with this diagnosis; 1 patient had Alzheimer's disease and 2 had cerebrovascular disease (CVD). In the remaining 67 patients, the most common underlying histological cause was ubiquitin pathology with 24 (36%) cases so affected. In these, ubiquitin-positive inclusions were present in the cerebral cortex as small, rounded or crescent-shaped structures within the cytoplasm of neurones of layer II, together with coiled or curvilinear bodies within neurites, and in the hippocampus as small, solid and more spherical-shaped inclusion bodies within the cytoplasm of dentate gyrus granule cells. In one patient, ""cat's eye"" or ""lentiform"" intranuclear ubiquitin inclusions were also present. The second most common histological type was dementia lacking distinctive histology (DLDH), in which neither tau nor ubiquitin inclusions were present, with 16 cases (24%) being affected. Pick-type histology was seen in 14 cases (21%) and tau histological changes associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) were present in 11 cases (16%). One case (1%) showed an unusual tau pathology that could not be allocated to any of the other tau groups. Only 1 case (1%) had neuronal intermediate filament inclusion dementia. No cases with ubiquitinated, valosin-containing protein-immunoreactive intranuclear inclusion bodies of the type seen in inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia were seen. Clinicopathological correlation showed that any of these histological subtypes can be associated with FTD. However, for FTD with motor neurone disease (FTD+MND), semantic dementia or primary progressive aphasia (PA), the histological profile was either ubiquitin type or DLDH type; Pick-type histology was seen in only 1 case of PA. None of these latter three clinical subtypes was associated with a mutation in tau gene and FTDP-17 type of tau pathology. All cases of progressive apraxia were associated with Pick-type histology. Present data therefore indicate that, although ubiquitin pathology is the most common histological form associated with FTLD, this pathology is not tightly linked with, nor is pathologically diagnostic for, any particular clinical form of the disease, including FTD+MND.","['Shi J', 'Shaw CL', 'Du Plessis D', 'Richardson AM', 'Bailey KL', 'Julien C', 'Stopford C', 'Thompson J', 'Varma A', 'Craufurd D', 'Tian J', 'Pickering-Brown S', 'Neary D', 'Snowden JS', 'Mann DM']",2005,110,5,Acta Neuropathol,"Shi J, et al.

16222359,Access to palliative care for people with motor neurone disease in New Zealand.,"AIM: To identify the services available through hospices for people with motor neurone disease (MND) in New Zealand; to find out about the type of care and support available in each service; and to identify any barriers to access to care for these people.
METHOD: A postal questionnaire was sent to hospices and palliative care services who were listed in the Hospice New Zealand directory (N=41) in March 2004.
RESULTS: Thirty-five services returned completed surveys (85% response rate). All services responding offered care for people with MND, with a wide range of services being offered. Results indicated that for a small number their service contract was a barrier to accessing services. One identified the issue of bed availability for respite care and another expressed concern about long-term care. Other challenges noted included the high level of time and resources needed to care for people with MND; the complexity of multidisciplinary care; the knowledge of the disease process needed; the duration of the condition and the uncertainty of prognosis; the different focus of care compared to the care of people with cancer; and the ability to find appropriately skilled carers.
CONCLUSION: Palliative care services have much to offer in the care of people with MND particularly in symptom management, respite care, and in addressing the psychological and spiritual issues that have been shown to have a greater bearing on quality of life than physical functioning. Co-ordination of service provision and timely referral to palliative care services are essential if the optimum care is to be provided. The development of the knowledge base required for effective care, a systematic approach to providing support, and effective coordination are all essential to improve the quality of life for people with MND and their families.","['McKenna C', 'MacLeod R']",2005,118,1222,N Z Med J,McKenna C and MacLeod R.

16218983,Who's there and who cares: age as an indicator of social support networks for caregivers among people living with motor neurone disease.,"This paper explores the social support networks available to the informal carers of people living with motor neurone disease (MND). An ethnographic case study was undertaken using eco mapping, observation and conversational interviews to collect data from 18 primary carers of people living with MND. Interviews took place in participants' homes in metropolitan, regional and rural locations. Participants discussed the content of their support network and drew lines between individuals to indicate the type and strength of relationship. Changes to the network were depicted on eco maps during subsequent interviews. While health policy-makers assume that healthy social capital exists in Australian communities and that social cohesion will ensure active and available support networks in times of illness or disability, data from this exploratory study indicated that this was not consistently the case. Support networks varied in size and composition; however, age was identified as a discriminator of the availability and consistency of support. People in older age groups identified more diverse but consistent support systems while people in younger age groups reported more fluctuations in the strength of relationships and declines in support as caregiving became more demanding. Individual assessment of support networks at regular intervals in the caregiving trajectory is vital for all carers. However carers in younger age groups may need specific support to manage the psychological crises that occur and more access to paid care. Older carers may need consistent support to handle more of the instrumental aspects of care and assistance to mobilise their support networks.

16218200,Blink reflex in motor neuron disease.,"The aim of the study was to analyse the diagnostic value of blink reflex (BR) in motor neuron disease (MND). We studied 25 patients with MND including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 18 patients, primary muscular atrophy (PMA) in 4 patients, and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) in 3 patients and 12 healthy volunteers. The blink reflex was obtained in typical way. In ALS group, statistically significant increase in latency and decreased amplitude of R2 responses were found compared to the control group (p < 0.05), whereas BR in patients with PLS and PMA was within normal limits. The presence of low amplitude of R2 responses in patients with ALS may suggest loss of lower brainstem neurons connecting trigeminal and facial system, and probably also decreased facilitator effect of central nervous system on reticular formation in the brainstem.","['Szmidt-Sałkowska E', 'Rowińska-Marcińska K']",2005,45,5,Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol,Szmidt-Sałkowska E and Rowińska-Marcińska K.

16193838,Is motor neuron disease-inclusion dementia a forme fruste of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia? An autopsy case further supporting the disease concept.,"We report the autopsy findings of a 62-year-old man who exhibited progressive FTD 10 years before the appearance of muscle weakness and wasting, and who died approximately 11 years after onset of the symptoms. Degeneration and atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, which contained ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions and dystrophic neurites, were evident. Circumscribed degeneration affecting the hippocampal CA1-subiculum border zone was also a feature. Moreover, degeneration was present in both the upper and lower motor neuron systems, the latter being more severely affected. A few lower motor neurons were found to contain the cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of ALS (i.e. Bunina bodies and ubiquitin-positive skeins). Also of interest was the presence of pallidonigroluysian atrophy, which appeared to be responsible for the chorea-like involuntary movements that developed in this patient approximately 2 months before death. The clinical and pathological features of our patient further support the idea that motor neuron disease-inclusion dementia (MND-ID), which has been classified as a pathological subgroup of FTD, is a forme fruste of ALS with dementia. In other words, if patients with MND-ID live long enough, they may develop ALS.","['Toyoshima Y', 'Tan CF', 'Kozakai T', 'Tanaka M', 'Takahashi H']",2005,25,3,Neuropathology,"Toyoshima Y, et al.

In addition, cases of MND with dementia (MND-d) also have ub-ir neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and dystrophic neurites in extramotor neocortex and hippocampus. Although this extramotor pathology is a highly sensitive marker for dementia in MND, similar changes are found in a subset of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with no motor symptoms (FTD-MND type). The purpose of this study is to more fully describe and compare the pattern of ub-ir pathology in these 3 conditions. We performed ubiquitin immunohistochemistry on postmortem tissue, representing a wide range of neuroanatomic structures, in cases of classic MND (n = 20), MND-d (n = 15), and FTD-MND type (n = 15). We found the variety of morphologies and the anatomic distribution of ub-ir pathology to be greater than previously documented. Moreover, the degree of overlap suggests that MND, MND-d, and FTD-MND type represent a spectrum of clinical disease with a common pathologic substrate.

16098753,A case of presumptive primary lateral sclerosis with upper and lower motor neurone pathology.,"Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is one of the commonest neurodegenerative disorders of adulthood. MND characteristically presents with a combination of both upper and lower motor neurone features. Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) is thought to be a variant of MND presenting with purely upper motor neurone signs. Debate continues over whether PLS constitutes a distinct pathological entity or whether it is part of the spectrum of motor neurone diseases that present as an upper motor neurone-predominant form of MND. We present a case of MND with purely upper motor neurone features and a prominent pain component. A pre-mortem diagnosis of PLS was made, however autopsy findings demonstrated both upper and lower motor neurone involvement. We believe these findings support the view that PLS is not a discrete pathological entity, but that it is a part of the range of motor neurone diseases that present with predominant but not exclusive upper motor neurone involvement. This case also highlights the feature that pain may be associated with MND even though it is not appreciated to have a sensory pathology.","['Short CL', 'Scott G', 'Blumbergs PC', 'Koblar SA']",2005,12,6,J Clin Neurosci,"Short CL, et al.

Here we investigated the response of NPCs in mouse models of spinal cord disease [motor neuron disease (MND)] with and without sciatic nerve axotomy, and spinal cord injury (SCI). We found that neither axotomy, nor MND alone brought about a response by Nestin-positive NPCs. However, the combination of the two resulted in mobilization of NPCs in the spinal cord. We also found that there was an increase in the number of NPCs following SCI which was further enhanced by systemic administration of the neuregulatory cytokine, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). NPCs were demonstrated to differentiate into astrocytes in axotomized MND mice. However, significant differentiation into the various neural cell phenotypes was not demonstrated at 1 or 2 weeks following SCI. These data suggest that factors inherent to injury mechanisms are required for induction of an NPC response in the mammalian spinal cord.","['Azari MF', 'Profyris C', 'Zang DW', 'Petratos S', 'Cheema SS']",2005,12,8,Eur J Neurol,"Azari MF, et al.

The authors performed a retrospective analysis of family information in pedigrees dating back to the 1780s, to determine the age-dependent penetrance of three different SOD1 mutations: Glu100Gly, Ile113Thr, and Val148G1y. The penetrance of symptomatic MND in these three SOD1 mutations was greater than 95% by the age of 78. The affected family members with the Val148Gly mutation had the worst prognosis, with a mean age of death of 46.1 years, compared to 54.2 years for the Glu100Gly mutation and 59.9 years for Ile113Thr mutation. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that survival of the 3 SOD1 mutation families, when combined, was reduced by nearly 10 years with the mean age of death for all SOD1 mutation carriers being 52.6 years compared to 62.5 years for the control individuals. The SOD1 mutation group also resulted in earlier death compared to sporadic MND, which from natural history studies is 61.4 years. This may reflect that the SOD1 mutation is associated with more progressive and rapid disease, as the age of onset of disease was not earlier. This information would have important implications for genetic counseling of members of individual SOD1 mutation carrier families.","['Aggarwal A', 'Nicholson G']",2005,115,8,Int J Neurosci,Aggarwal A and Nicholson G.

16036432,Expression of FKBP12 and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the spinal cord of MND patients.,"We investigated the FKBP12 and ryanodine receptor (RyR) immunoreactivity (IR) in the spinal cords of neurological controls and patients with motor neuron disease (MND). In the neurological controls, the cytoplasm of the spinal anterior horn neurons was stained with anti-FKBP12 antibodies and anti-RyR (type 1 and type 2) antibodies. In the MND cases, the residual neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord showed IR for RyR (type 1 and 2) antibodies, while weak IR for anti-FKBP12 antibodies was comparable to that of controls. The numbers of neurons recognized with the anti-FKBP 12 or anti-RyR (type 1 and 2) antibodies were counted in the anterior horn of spinal cords from the MND cases and neurological controls. Frequency of neurons stained with anti-FKBP 12 antibody was significantly decreased in the MND cases compared to that in controls (48.7+/-23.2%, 71.0+/-18.5%, respectively, mean+/-SD, p<0.0005). In the MND cases, numbers of normal-appearing, chromatolytic neurons showing IR to anti-FKBP12 (N19) antibody were significantly decreased compared to those in the controls. Immunoreactivities to anti-RyR antibodies (type 1and 2) in MND cases were present and there was no difference compared to those of the controls. Neurons in the spinal cord anterior horn of Kii-ALS cases with prolonged clinical duration were immunostained with both anti-FKBP12 and anti-RyR (type 1 and 2) antibodies similar to that in the controls. The anterior horn neurons of MND cases of short clinical duration showed absent IR to FKBP 12 antibody but present IR to RyR (type 1 and 2) antibodies. The present result suggests that FKBP12 IR was decreased in the MND cases with short clinical duration. RyR (type 1 and 2) is a major component of the intracellular calcium channel, which mediates calcium-induced calcium release. FKBP12, which is an endogenous ligand for RyR, stabilizes the calcium channels preventing calcium leakage in the absence of receptor activation. Imbalance between FKBP12 and RyR IR may play an important role in degeneration due to MND. Further study of the correlation between RyR and FKBP12 should contribute to clarifying the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in MND, including calcium-induced neuronal loss.","['Kihira T', 'Utunomiya H', 'Kondo T']",2005,6,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Kihira T, et al.

Measurement of progression poses difficulties, and an optimum end-point measure has not been determined.

Lesions indicative of associated MND were observed: neuronal loss in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, Bunina bodies, axonal spheroids, degeneration of the pyramidal tracts, and of FTD: decreased neuronal density and laminar microvacuolation of layers II and III in the frontal and temporal cortex. Ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive changes were found in the spinal cord and medulla, but were absent from the temporal and frontal cortex. There were also widespread deposits of various neuronal and glial inclusions containing abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, the Western blotting pattern of which was characterized by two major bands of 64 and 69 kDa. There were no abnormalities of the entire coding sequences of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD(1)) genes.

METHODS: Hypotheses generated from 1982 to 1991 study were tested in data from 22 states for the years 1992-1998. Specific occupations and exposures to pesticides, solvents, oxidative stressors, magnetic fields, and welding fumes were evaluated.
RESULTS: About one third (26/87) of the occupations hypothesized with neurodegenerative associations had statistically significant elevated mortality odds ratios (MOR) for the same outcome. Occupations with the largest MORs were (a) for presenile dementia (PSD)-dentists, graders/sorters (non-agricultural), and clergy; (b) for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-bank tellers, clergy, aircraft mechanics, and hairdressers; (c) for Parkinson's disease (PD)-biological scientists, clergy, religious workers, and post-secondary teachers; and (d) for motor neuron disease (MND)-veterinarians, hairdressers, and graders and sorters (non-agricultural). Teachers had significantly elevated MORs for all four diseases, and hairdressers for three of the four. Non-horticultural farmers below age 65 had elevated PD (MOR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.47-3.26), PSD (MOR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.10-4.05), and AD (MOR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.04-2.81). Sixty hertz magnetic fields exhibited significant exposure-response for AD and, below age 65, for PD (MOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.14-2.98) and MND (MOR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.10-2.39).

15896851,The experimental toxicology of metallic mercury on the murine peripheral motor system: a novel method of assessing axon calibre spectra using the phrenic nerve.,"The toxicology of metallic mercury on motor neurons and their processes requires further work to resolve controversial implications in the aetiology of human motor neuron disease (MND). The assessment of experimental neurotoxicity in the peripheral motor system is, however, technically problematic and difficult to interpret. The mean number of axons in a nerve can vary considerably due to a high degree of biological variation. Atrophy of large axons can appear as loss when, in fact, their numbers appear in smaller diameter axonal categories. We addressed these quantitative problems using the murine phrenic nerve (MPN), a mono-fascicular, predominantly motor nerve as a model system. One micrometer transverse sections of gluteraldehyde/osmium tetroxide fixed MPNs were stained for myelin using a silver technique. Axon areas were measured from digital images of the nerve in cross-section (ImagePro Plus software) and transformed to circular diameter equivalents, then displayed as frequency distributions. We found a high biological variation in the mean axon number between paired nerves within experimental groups. Therefore, axon diameter data within individuals group was pooled. Theoretical simulation of axonal degeneration, atrophy and hypertrophy of larger myelinated axons (also affected in MND) were modelled by manipulating the original data set. With this model, by comparing normal distributions, it is possible to distinguish axonal atrophy, degenerative loss, and hypertrophy as distinct pathological processes in the large calibre axon subgroup that are selectively vulnerable to metallic toxins such as mercury.","['Stankovic RK', 'Shingde M', 'Cullen KM']",2005,147,2,J Neurosci Methods,"Stankovic RK, et al.

15892300,"Neuropathologic, biochemical, and molecular characterization of the frontotemporal dementias.","The frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized clinically by dementia, personality changes, language impairment, and occasionally extrapyramidal movement disorders. Historically, the diagnosis and classification of FTDs has been fraught with difficulties, especially with regard to establishing a consensus on the neuropathologic diagnosis. Recently, an international group of scientists participated in a consensus conference to develop such neuropathologic criteria. They recommended a diagnostic classification scheme that incorporated a biochemical analysis of the insoluble tau isoform composition, as well as ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. The use and reliability of this classification system has yet to be examined. In this study, we evaluated 21 cases of FTD. Using traditional histochemical stains and tau protein and ubiquitin immunohistochemistry, we separated each case into one of the following categories: classic Pick disease (PiD; n = 7), corticobasal degeneration (CBD; n = 5), dementia lacking distinctive histopathologic features (DLDH; n = 4), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n = 2), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease or motor neuron disease-type inclusions (FTLD-MND/MNI; n = 2), and neurofibrillary tangle dementia (NFTD; n = 1). Additionally, we independently categorized each case by the insoluble tau isoform pattern, including 3R (n = 5), 4R (n = 7), 3R/4R (n = 3), and no insoluble tau (n = 6). As suggested by the proposed diagnostic scheme, we found that the insoluble tau isoform patterns correlated strongly with the independently derived histopathologic diagnoses (p < 0.001). The data show that cases containing predominantly 3R tau were classic PiD (100%). Cases with predominantly 4R tau were either CBD (71%) or PSP (29%). Cases with both 3R and 4R tau were either a combination of PiD and Alzheimer disease (67%) or NFTD (33%). Finally, cases with no insoluble tau were either DLDH (67%) or FTLD-MND/MNI (33%). To further characterize these cases, we also performed quantitative Western blots for soluble tau, APOE genotyping, and, in selected cases, tau gene sequencing. We show that soluble tau is reduced in DLDH and FTLD-MND/MNI and that APOE4 is overrepresented in PiD and DLDH. We also identified a new family with the R406W mutation and pathology consistent with NFTD. This study validates the recently proposed diagnostic criteria and forms a framework for further refinement of this classification scheme.","['Mott RT', 'Dickson DW', 'Trojanowski JQ', 'Zhukareva V', 'Lee VM', 'Forman M', 'Van Deerlin V', 'Ervin JF', 'Wang DS', 'Schmechel DE', 'Hulette CM']",2005,64,5,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Mott RT, et al.

15885820,Behavioral assessment in mouse models of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis using a light-cued T-maze.,"Learning impairment is a common feature of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL), a family of lysosomal storage disorders associated with progressive neurodegeneration. Murine models for the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses include the well-characterized motor neuron degeneration (mnd/mnd) model for one variant of late infantile NCL (CLN8), and the more recently generated models for the infantile (CLN1) and juvenile (CLN3) forms of NCL. To determine whether these mouse models exhibit behavioral deficits analogous to the learning impairment characteristic of the human disorders, the performance of these animals on an associative learning task was assessed. The abilities of affected and normal control mice to associate a light stimulus with a food reward were evaluated in 14-16-week-old animals using a T-maze. Normal mice were able to reach a criterion for having learned to make the association within a mean of 9.4 trials. The CLN8 and CLN3 mice, on the other hand, required means of 26.2 and 27.5 trials, respectively, to reach the same performance criterion (p<0.05), whereas none of the CLN1 mice were able to reach the criterion within a limit of 30 trials. The poor performance of the mutant mice did not appear to result from impaired retinal function; mice of all three strains exhibited retinal electrophysiological responses to dim light flashes and displayed robust pupillary light reflexes. Associative learning deficits appear to be an early disease phenotype in the NCL mouse models that will be useful for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions such as gene or stem cell therapies.","['Wendt KD', 'Lei B', 'Schachtman TR', 'Tullis GE', 'Ibe ME', 'Katz ML']",2005,161,2,Behav Brain Res,"Wendt KD, et al.

METHODS: The coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of the cardiac beta myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) were screened by DHPLC for mutation identification in 150 unrelated patients diagnosed with FHC. One hundred and forty patients with sporadic MND were genotyped for the A67T SNP in the poliovirus receptor gene. All DHPLC positive signals were confirmed by conventional methods.
RESULTS: Mutation screening of MYH7 covered 10 kb with a total of 5700 amplicons, and more than 6750 DHPLC injections were completed within 35 days. The causative mutation was identified in 14% of FHC cases, including seven novel missense mutations (L227V, E328G, K351E, V411I, M435T, E894G, and E927K). Genotyping of the A67T SNP was performed at two different temperatures both in MND cases and 280 controls. This coding SNP was found more frequently in MND cases (13.6%) than in controls (6.8%). Furthermore, 19 and two SNPs were identified in MYH7 and the poliovirus receptor gene, respectively, during DHPLC screening.
CONCLUSIONS: DHPLC is a high throughput, sensitive, specific, and robust platform for the detection of DNA variants, such as disease causing mutations or SNPs. It enables rapid and accurate screening of large genomic regions.","['Yu B', 'Sawyer NA', 'Caramins M', 'Yuan ZG', 'Saunderson RB', 'Pamphlett R', 'Richmond DR', 'Jeremy RW', 'Trent RJ']",2005,58,5,J Clin Pathol,"Yu B, et al.

We report the case of a 66-year-old man, previously diagnosed with motor neuron disease (MND), who presented acute and reversible left vocal fold (dysphonia) and pharyngeal paresis, followed by a slowly progressive weakness and also bouts of weakness, wasting and fasciculation on tongue, masseter, face, pharyngeal, and some proximal more than distal upper limb muscles, associated to bilateral hand tremor and mild gynecomastia. There were 5 electroneuromyography exams between 1989 and 2003 that revealed chronic reinnervation, some fasciculations (less than clinically observed) and rare fibrillation potentials, and slowly progressive sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) abnormality, leading to absent/low amplitude potentials. PCR techniques of DNA analysis showed an abnormal number of CAG repeats, found to be 44 (normal 11-34). Our case revealed an acute and asymmetric clinical presentation related to bulbar motoneurons; low amplitude/absent SNAP with mild asymmetry; a sub-clinical or subtle involvement of proximal/distal muscles of both upper and lower limbs; and a probable evolution with bouts of acute dennervation, followed by an efficient reinnervation.","['Kouyoumdjian JA', 'Morita Mda P', 'Araújo RG']",2005,63,1,Arq Neuropsiquiatr,"Kouyoumdjian JA, et al.

15826318,The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis Cln8 gene expression is developmentally regulated in mouse brain and up-regulated in the hippocampal kindling model of epilepsy.,"BACKGROUND: The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of autofluorescent material in many tissues, especially in neurons. Mutations in the CLN8 gene, encoding an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein of unknown function, underlie NCL phenotypes in humans and mice. The human phenotype is characterized by epilepsy, progressive psychomotor deterioration and visual loss, while motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mice with a Cln8 mutation show progressive motor neuron dysfunction and retinal degeneration.
RESULTS: We investigated spatial and temporal expression of Cln8 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) using in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and northern blotting. Cln8 is ubiquitously expressed at low levels in embryonic and adult tissues. In prenatal embryos Cln8 is most prominently expressed in the developing gastrointestinal tract, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and brain. In postnatal brain the highest expression is in the cortex and hippocampus. Expression of Cln8 mRNA in the central nervous system (CNS) was also analyzed in the hippocampal electrical kindling model of epilepsy, in which Cln8 expression was rapidly up-regulated in hippocampal pyramidal and granular neurons.
CONCLUSION: Expression of Cln8 in the developing and mature brain suggests roles for Cln8 in maturation, differentiation and supporting the survival of different neuronal populations. The relevance of Cln8 up-regulation in hippocampal neurons of kindled mice should be further explored.","['Lonka L', 'Aalto A', 'Kopra O', 'Kuronen M', 'Kokaia Z', 'Saarma M', 'Lehesjoki AE']",2005,6,,BMC Neurosci,"Lonka L, et al.

15824349,"Temporal and geographic variation in United States motor neuron disease mortality, 1969-1998.","OBJECTIVE: To describe temporal trends of motor neuron disease (MND) mortality in the United States. Variations in MND by demographic variables of sex, age, geography, and race/ethnicity were evaluated to assess the possible explanations for observed trends.
METHODS: Multiple-cause mortality files from the National Center for Health Statistics for the years 1969 through 1998 were searched for all United States death records with codes corresponding to MND. Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated by sex, race/ethnicity, age, birth cohort, and place of death.
RESULTS: Overall MND mortality rates increased from 1.25 per 100,000 to 1.82 per 100,000, representing a 46% increase during the 30-year period. Rates among women increased by 60% and continue to rise. Rates among men rose by 35% during this period but have leveled off in the most recent decade evaluated. Mortality rates among African Americans and Hispanics were approximately 50% lower than rates among non-Hispanic whites. A southeast to northwest gradient was observed when rates were grouped by 12 geographic areas. MND mortality rates per 100,000 (and 95% CI) ranged from 2.22 (1.89 to 2.55) in the Northwest to 1.57 (1.44 to 1.71) in the Southeast.
CONCLUSIONS: Variations in motor neuron disease (MND) mortality by time, race/ethnicity, sex, and geography were consistent with the hypothesis that environmental exposures, combined with factors of genetic susceptibility, play a role in the development of MND.","['Noonan CW', 'White MC', 'Thurman D', 'Wong LY']",2005,64,7,Neurology,"Noonan CW, et al.

15822738,[Pharmacological therapy of sialorrhea in patients with motor neuron disease].,"A comparative trial of amithryptiline and dysport (botulinic toxin type A) in the treatment of sialorrhea in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) was conducted in 10 MND patients with sialorrhea, of whom 5 were treated with subcutaneous injections of Dysport and 5 with Amithriptiline, and 6 controls without salivary dysfunction. Gravimetry and scintigraphy of salivary glands were used before and after treatment. Compared to controls, saliva production was significantly decreased in MND patients. Both amithryptilin and dysport used in mean therapeutic doses decreased sialorrhea with similar effect. However, 3 patients, receiving amythryptiline in dosage 50 mg/day, experienced side effects (constipation, accommodation disturbances, dry mouth, sleepiness and poor concentration). Reducing of amithryptiline dose, along with prescribing dysport, removed the side-effects in these patients, while sialorrhea did not increase. The authors concluded that due to high efficacy and low cost of amithryptiline therapy of sialorrhea proved to be a golden standard of palliative care in MDN. However, in these terms dysport can not be an alternative to amithryptiline in sialorrhea therapy. Nevertheless, in cases when amithryptiline treatment is accomplished with side-effects, the drug dosage can be reduced and combined with dysport.","['Levitskiĭ GN', 'Alekhin AV', 'Serdiuk AV', 'Morgunova MS', 'Koneva ON', 'Skvortsova VI']",2005,105,3,Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,"Levitskiĭ GN, et al.

15750484,Nursing role in the multidisciplinary management of motor neurone disease.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a debilitating and progressive neurological disorder in which degeneration of the motor neurones results in muscle weakness and wasting. Recent high-profile media coverage about assisted suicide and euthanasia has increased awareness of MND and yet still relatively little is known or understood about it, even among the healthcare profession. This article looks at the key areas in management of patients with MND, including the role of the nurse and the importance of a well-coordinated multidisciplinary team. Ways to deal with communication problems, respiratory dysfunction, feeding and nutrition, and legal and ethical issues are examined. Good management of patients with MND involves a hospital and community-based multidisciplinary team. The essence of care is good symptomatic management of respiratory failure and nutritional problems that result from difficulties in swallowing and increasing dependency. Palliative care should be introduced before the terminal stages after careful discussion with the patient and carers. Most patients with MND die from pulmonary infections or respiratory failure, but contrary to popular belief, death by choking attacks is rare and the final stages of MND are usually peaceful and dignified.",['Skelton J'],2005,14,1,Br J Nurs,Skelton J.

15717908,"Living with motor neurone disease: lives, experiences of services and suggestions for change.","Palliative care involves the complete, holistic care of people with progressive illness and their families. People living with motor neurone disease (MND) require a range of multidisciplinary palliative care services. However, there are significant gaps in our understanding of these people's lives, experiences of services and their suggestions for service change. The present study addressed the following questions: (1) What are the lived experiences of people living with MND? (2) What are people's experiences of services? and (3) Can improvements to care be identified? A qualitative research design was adopted using semi-structured interviews. The topic guide was developed from existing literature. The study was based in three boroughs in London, UK. People living with MND and professionals were drawn from a database at King's College Hospital, and additionally, through 'snowball' sampling. Nine people with MND, five carers/family members and 15 professionals took part in the interviews. These interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and checked for accuracy against the original recordings. Themes within the interviews were coded and grouped. The analysis was facilitated with the NVIVO computer software package. The findings are presented within three substantive groups: (1) the impact of MND on people's lives (the physical impacts of the illness, including increasing disability; social issues, including restrictions on social activities; and adjustments to people's lives, including methods of coping with the illness); (2) experiences of services (accessing service entitlements, information sources, professionals' attitudes and approaches, and professionals' knowledge and understanding of MND); and (3) suggestions for service change (better information and communication, including information on service entitlements; improved knowledge amongst professionals about MND; and some suggestions for service restructuring). This study brings a fresh approach to understanding the impacts of MND and the ways in which services can be improved to meet people's needs. The paper concludes with methodological considerations, the implications of the findings for practitioners and policy makers, and suggestions for further research.","['Hughes RA', 'Sinha A', 'Higginson I', 'Down K', 'Leigh PN']",2005,13,1,Health Soc Care Community,"Hughes RA, et al.

15696783,Inclusion body myopathy associated with motor neuron syndrome: three case reports.,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (h-IBM) is an autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant hereditary disease characterized by peculiar findings in muscle biopsies which resemble those occurring in inclusion body myositis (IBM). The absence of an inflammatory infiltrate in myofibers in h-IBM is a relevant differential criterion between the two pathologies. Motor neuron diseases (MND) represent a group of disorders involving both upper and lower motor neurons, characterized by fasciculations, progressive muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. The most common form and prototype of MND is the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Charcot's Disease, a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder occurring in late adulthood. The pathogenesis of ALS remains still unknown, a variety of hypotheses having been proposed to account for the disease. The association of both pathologies is not common and offers new hypotheses about the pathogenic mechanisms in skeletal muscle and nervous system degeneration.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Described are three case reports in which we observed the clinical, laboratory and histopathological association of IBM and MND. In one case, dementia was also present. Muscle data was obtained by muscle biopsies and immunohistochemistry, while diagnosis of MND was supported by common neurophysiological techniques.
RESULTS: The accumulation ofphosphorylated neurofilaments with a hereditary IBM-like pattern in skeletal muscle fibers without accumulation of amyloid-beta protein was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: A better knowledge of the mechanisms in cellular death cascade could explain the pathogenesis of these different degenerative disorders.","['Cafforio G', 'Pistolesi S', ""D'Avino C"", 'Galluzzi F', 'Patricelli A', 'Solito B', 'Fontanini G', 'Siciliano G']",2005,24,1,Clin Neuropathol,"Cafforio G, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all neurological units in Sweden asking about the numbers of patients with ALS/MND and whether these patients were treated with riluzole. Sales statistics for riluzole were obtained from the 906 public pharmacies and 89 hospital pharmacies in Sweden.
RESULTS: Eighty percent of the neurological units answered the questionnaire. The estimated prevalence in September 2003 from the questionnaire was 5.4/100,000 inhabitants. The sales expressed in defined daily dose/100,000 inhabitants/day was 3.8. For the counties the correlation between these two parameters was 0.83.

15668955,Loss of synaptophysin-positive boutons on lumbar motor neurons innervating the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the SOD1G93A G1H transgenic mouse model of ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a common form of motor neuron disease (MND) that involves both upper and lower nervous systems. In the SOD1G93A G1H transgenic mouse, a widely used animal model of human ALS, a significant pathology is linked to the degeneration of lower motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord and brainstem. In the current study, the number of presynaptic boutons immunoreactive for synaptophysin was estimated on retrogradely labeled soma and proximal dendrites of alpha and gamma motor neurons innervating the medial gastrocnemius muscle. No changes were detected on both soma and proximal dendrites at postnatal day 60 (P60) of alpha and gamma motor neurons. By P90 and P120, however, alpha motor neuron soma had a reduction of 14 and 33% and a dendritic reduction of 19 and 36%, respectively. By P90 and P120, gamma motor neuron soma had a reduction of 17 and 41% and a dendritic reduction of 19 and 35%, respectively. This study shows that levels of afferent innervation significantly decreased on surviving alpha and gamma motor neurons that innervate the medial gastrocnemius muscle. This finding suggests that the loss of motor neurons and the decrease of synaptophysin in the remaining motor neurons could lead to functional motor deficits, which may contribute significantly to the progression of ALS/MND.","['Zang DW', 'Lopes EC', 'Cheema SS']",2005,79,5,J Neurosci Res,"Zang DW, et al.

15644070,Clinical and epidemiological features of motor neuron disease in south-western Greece.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiological and clinical features of motor neuron disease (MND) in a region (835,000 inhabitants) of south-western Greece.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of all patients diagnosed with adult-onset MND at the Department of Neurology of the University Hospital of Patras from 1990 to 2003 were reviewed.
RESULTS: Overall 133 patients were identified, corresponding to a mean annual incidence rate of 1.13/100,000 population with male preponderance. Eighty-five of them were males (63.9%) and 48 (36.1%) females with a mean age of 61.4 +/- 13.3 years. The most common type of MND was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) being identified in 111 (83.5%) patients, whereas 19 cases (14.3%) were classified as progressive spinal muscular atrophy (PSMA) and three (2.2%) cases as progressive bulbar palsy (PBP). The mean age at onset was 60.3 +/- 13.5 years, while the mean delay between age at onset and age at diagnosis was 1.3 +/- 1.1 years. The symptoms at onset involved the lower limbs in 76 (57.2%) cases, upper limbs in 32 (24%) cases, bulbar region in 22 (16.5%) cases and respiratory muscles in three (2.3%) cases. The mean survival time after onset of disease was 20.4 +/- 8.3 months for ALS patients, 15.3 +/- 4.5 months for PBP and 38.1 +/- 26.4 months for PSMA patients.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant difference in the results of the considered epidemiological parameters of our study to those reported by other similar studies. The study of the patients with MND showed a predominance of ALS patients. No potentially causative clinical associations were found and no relation between socioeconomic factors, occupational exposure and the disease was noted.","['Argyriou AA', 'Polychronopoulos P', 'Papapetropoulos S', 'Ellul J', 'Andriopoulos I', 'Katsoulas G', 'Salakou S', 'Chroni E']",2005,111,2,Acta Neurol Scand,"Argyriou AA, et al.

All cases showed rostral-dominant atrophy in the temporal and frontal lobes, although the degree of atrophy with neuronal loss was much more severe in the aPiD cases. In both aPiD and D-MND cases, ub-positive and tau-negative structures were found mainly in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cerebral cortex. Granular cells of the dentate gyrus showed similar ub-positive intraneuronal inclusions in both cases. In the aPiD cases, most of the ub-positive cortical structures were ub-positive dendrites in layers II-IIIab and layers V-VI, although some neurons also showed diffuse ub-positive staining in the cytoplasm. In the D-MND cases, some neurons showed ub-positive inclusions in layers II-IIIab, and ub-positive dendrites were unremarkable. The number of ub-positive neurons and dendrites in relation to the degree of neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex were then evaluated. The number of ub-positive neurons in the regions showing very mild to mild neuronal loss was significantly greater in the D-MND cases than in the aPiD cases. However, in the aPiD cases, the number of ub-positive neurons was significantly greater in the regions showing moderate neuronal loss. When double-immunostained, almost all ub-positive structures were positive for ub-binding protein p62. Some ub-positive or negative neurons in the cerebral cortex were immunostained with anti-ub ligase (Parkin) and anti-ub C-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1) antibodies. Granular cells of the dentate gyrus were weakly positive for UCH-L1. There could be some differences in the mechanism by which neurons in the cerebral cortex accumulate ub between aPiD and D-MND.","['Furukawa Y', 'Iseki E', 'Hino H', 'Odawara T', 'Ikeda K', 'Tsuchiya K', 'Kosaka K']",2004,24,4,Neuropathology,"Furukawa Y, et al.

The forms of the inclusions were tentatively classified into three types: (i) C-type, consisting of relatively large and intensely stained crescent or circular structures; (ii) L-type, showing fine linear structures around the nuclei; and (iii) G-type, showing faintly stained granular structures. The frequencies of the C-type, L-type and G-type was 0.5-9.3%,0.2-6.5% and 0-6.6% of dentate granule cells, respectively. In contrast to the dentate gyrus, almost all inclusions showed either the C-type or L-type form in the parahippocampal gyrus. A positive correlation was noted only between incidences of C-type inclusion of the dentate gyrus and that of the parahippocampal gyrus (r = 0.69, P < 0.05).

There were no fasciculation of the muscle. Deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive without Babinski's signs. Sensation, coordination, and gait were normal. Neurophysiological studies demonstrated normal motor nerve conduction velocities and sensory action potential. The results of needle electromyography of the upper limbs were compatible with motor neuron disease (MND). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed atrophy of the bilateral temporal region of the brain. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) showed reduced uptake of tracer in the bilateral temporal region. On neuropsychological examination, his behavior was normal, and orientation and intelligence were also preserved, but his speech was severely impaired. Reading comprehension was slightly impaired. In regard to writing comprehension, he had no difficulty in copying of words though dictation was found to be impaired. He omitted one kana letter in a word. Agraphia is accompanied by various factors such as aphasia, dementia, agnosia, alexia. But in this case at least for early stage, agraphia existed without other higher cortical dysfunction. He did not show severe dementia in his early stage of his disease, but developed it later in the disease's progression. In this case, agraphia might be due to the atrophic changes in the temporal lobe.","['Kanzaki M', 'Sato M', 'Ogawa G', 'Miyamoto N', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Kamakura K', 'Takeda K']",2004,44,10,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Kanzaki M, et al.

15564993,Healthcare professionals' knowledge of motor neurone disease.,"Healthcare professionals have a professional duty to provide patients with accurate information in order to assist in managing their illness. This may be more difficult with an uncommon illness, such as motor neurone disease (MND), as many healthcare professionals may feel poorly informed about the illness themselves. This study set out to survey the level of knowledge and understanding about MND among a group of 100 healthcare professionals who had personal experience of managing the care of a person with MND. The value of the MND nurse specialist and the Motor Neurone Disease Association as sources of information were highlighted. There was evidence of active information-seeking about MND among all professional groups. However, while many respondents felt that their knowledge of the disease processes in MND and their own profession's role in the management of the condition was good, 57% of respondents felt that their current level of overall knowledge about MND was inadequate.","[""O'Brien MR""]",2004,13,18,Br J Nurs,O'Brien MR.

15548498,Unexpected decline in survival from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe survival of 1226 Scottish adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND).
METHODS: Ten year, prospective, population based disease register. Cox time dependent proportional hazards modelling for multivariate survival analyses.
RESULTS: Median survival from onset was 25 months (interquartile range 16-34 months). In multivariate models we found an increased hazard with more recently diagnosed cases-that is, there was an unexpected decline in survival over the 10 year period (hazard ratio (HR) 1.06 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.09). Positive effects on survival were demonstrated for longer time from onset to diagnosis (HR 0.38 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.42), assessment by a neurological specialist (HR 0.56 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.77), and treatment with riluzole (HR 0.24 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.42). Poor prognosis was associated with bulbar onset (HR 1.25 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.46) and a mixed lower and upper motor neurone syndrome (HR 1.23 (95% CI 1.01-1.49) and increasing age.
CONCLUSIONS: We found an unexpected decline in survival over the 10 year period, despite controlling for potential confounding variables. We would be cautious about over-interpreting these observations and suggest that further research is required to confirm or refute these findings.","['Forbes RB', 'Colville S', 'Cran GW', 'Swingler RJ', 'Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Register']",2004,75,12,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Forbes RB, et al.

15505152,Clinical and neuropathologic variation in neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease.,"BACKGROUND: Recently described neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID) shows considerable clinical heterogeneity.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the spectrum of the clinical and neuropathological features in 10 NIFID cases.
METHODS: Retrospective chart and comprehensive neuropathological review of these NIFID cases was conducted.
RESULTS: The mean age at onset was 40.8 (range 23 to 56) years, mean disease duration was 4.5 (range 2.7 to 13) years, and mean age at death was 45.3 (range 28 to 61) years. The most common presenting symptoms were behavioral and personality changes in 7 of 10 cases and, less often, memory loss, cognitive impairment, language deficits, and motor weakness. Extrapyramidal features were present in 8 of 10 patients. Language impairment, perseveration, executive dysfunction, hyperreflexia, and primitive reflexes were frequent signs, whereas a minority had buccofacial apraxia, supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, upper motor neuron disease (MND), and limb dystonia. Frontotemporal and caudate atrophy were common. Histologic changes were extensive in many cortical areas, deep gray matter, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The hallmark lesions of NIFID were unique neuronal IF inclusions detected most robustly by antibodies to neurofilament triplet proteins and alpha-internexin.
CONCLUSION: NIFID is a neuropathologically distinct, clinically heterogeneous variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) that may include parkinsonism or MND. Neuronal IF inclusions are the neuropathological signatures of NIFID that distinguish it from all other FTD variants including FTD with MND and FTD tauopathies.","['Cairns NJ', 'Grossman M', 'Arnold SE', 'Burn DJ', 'Jaros E', 'Perry RH', 'Duyckaerts C', 'Stankoff B', 'Pillon B', 'Skullerud K', 'Cruz-Sanchez FF', 'Bigio EH', 'Mackenzie IR', 'Gearing M', 'Juncos JL', 'Glass JD', 'Yokoo H', 'Nakazato Y', 'Mosaheb S', 'Thorpe JR', 'Uryu K', 'Lee VM', 'Trojanowski JQ']",2004,63,8,Neurology,"Cairns NJ, et al.

15503098,On the early diagnosis of IVIg-responsive chronic multifocal acquired motor axonopathy.,"Multifocal acquired motor axonopathy (MAMA) is a treatable, immune mediated motor neuropathy with purely axonal electrophysiological features. Distinction from degenerative neuronopathies such as progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) or early motor neuron disease (MND) can be difficult because of the similar clinical and electrophysiological findings. Here, we report the clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory findings in 6 patients with MAMA. Electrophysiological testing showed purely axonal findings with evidence of pathological spontaneous activity and chronic neurogenic changes. Of particular note, pathological spontaneous activity in paraspinal myotoms was not detectable in any of the patients even though it had been documented in peripheral muscles of the corresponding myotome(s). Elevated serum ganglioside antibody levels,most frequently anti-GD1a antibodies, were present in all 6 patients. IV Ig treatment led to clinical improvement in all but one patient, who showed an allergic response when exposed to IVIg. Our findings indicate that paraspinal EMG and anti-GD1a antibodies can facilitate the early identification of treatable, IVIg responsive, patients with MAMA.","['Fischer D', 'Grothe C', 'Schmidt S', 'Schröder R']",2004,251,10,J Neurol,"Fischer D, et al.

The FTLD with ubiquitin-only-immunoreactive neuronal changes (FTLD-U) subtype is pathologically characterized by ubiquitin-positive, tau and alpha-synuclein-negative neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the frontotemporal cortex and hippocampal dentate fascia. When similar pathological changes are accompanied by histological features of motor neuron disease (MND), the term FTLD-MND is used. The latter pathological changes may be found in patients with or without clinical evidence of MND. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical details of three patients with a rapidly progressive, levodopa-unresponsive bradykinetic-rigid syndrome and frontal cognitive impairment. A diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) had been considered in all three cases at initial presentation. Two of the cases fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for PSP, which was the final clinical diagnosis during life. Pathological analysis showed typical histological appearances of FTLD-MND in two cases and of FTLD-U in one case. Semi-quantitative analysis of pathological load seemed to correlate with the clinical phenotype. FTLD-U or FTLD-MND should be considered in the differential diagnosis of progressive frontal dementia with an akinetic rigid syndrome and supranuclear gaze palsy or Steele-Richardson-Olszewski disease.","['Paviour DC', 'Lees AJ', 'Josephs KA', 'Ozawa T', 'Ganguly M', 'Strand C', 'Godbolt A', 'Howard RS', 'Revesz T', 'Holton JL']",2004,127,Pt 11,Brain,"Paviour DC, et al.

Factors affecting their information-seeking behaviour were identified through a process of interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three distinct information-seeking categories emerged. Active seekers personally acquired information from a variety of sources. Selective seekers had access to information but often relied on 'buffers' to filter out unsuitable material. Information avoiders almost always used a 'buffer' to pre-screen any information to which they were exposed. All participants described negative effects on being exposed to unsolicited information, often in the form of media coverage.

15372378,A mutation in the vesicle-trafficking protein VAPB causes late-onset spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders with involvement of upper and/or lower motor neurons, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), progressive bulbar palsy, and primary lateral sclerosis. Recently, we have mapped a new locus for an atypical form of ALS/MND (atypical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS8]) at 20q13.3 in a large white Brazilian family. Here, we report the finding of a novel missense mutation in the vesicle-associated membrane protein/synaptobrevin-associated membrane protein B (VAPB) gene in patients from this family. Subsequently, the same mutation was identified in patients from six additional kindreds but with different clinical courses, such as ALS8, late-onset SMA, and typical severe ALS with rapid progression. Although it was not possible to link all these families, haplotype analysis suggests a founder effect. Members of the vesicle-associated proteins are intracellular membrane proteins that can associate with microtubules and that have been shown to have a function in membrane transport. These data suggest that clinically variable MNDs may be caused by a dysfunction in intracellular membrane trafficking.","['Nishimura AL', 'Mitne-Neto M', 'Silva HC', 'Richieri-Costa A', 'Middleton S', 'Cascio D', 'Kok F', 'Oliveira JR', 'Gillingwater T', 'Webb J', 'Skehel P', 'Zatz M']",2004,75,5,Am J Hum Genet,"Nishimura AL, et al.

To date, 2 reports have described intranuclear ubiquitinated inclusions (Ub-INIs) in 9 cases of familial FTD-MND-type (without clinical or pathologic motor neuron disease, MND). In the current study we found an additional 11 cases with Ub-INIs. We have identified for the first time among these cases 2 with a negative family history and 3 that have concomitant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The results of the present study i) confirm a previous report of significantly lower average brain weight and longer duration in cases with Ub-INIs, ii) reveal significantly greater striatal neuronal loss and gliosis in cases with intranuclear inclusions, and iii) demonstrate that intranuclear inclusions correlate with cytoplasmic inclusions and dystrophic neurites in frontal cortex and striatum but not in dentate gyrus. In addition, the current study confirms that Ub-INIs are found in familial FTD-MND-type, but also extends the presence of Ub-INIs to familial FTD-MND (with concomitant ALS), and probably also to non-familial FTD-MND-type.","['Bigio EH', 'Johnson NA', 'Rademaker AW', 'Fung BB', 'Mesulam MM', 'Siddique N', 'Dellefave L', 'Caliendo J', 'Freeman S', 'Siddique T']",2004,63,8,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Bigio EH, et al.

15306257,Riluzole slows the progression of neuromuscular dysfunction in the wobbler mouse motor neuron disease.,"In the wobbler mouse motor neuron disease (MND), we firstly evaluated the effect of riluzole, the only approved drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and compared it with that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Wobbler mice received either daily subcutaneous treatment with BDNF (5, 20, and 40 mg/kg) or oral riluzole in drinking water (100 and 200 microg/ml), beginning immediately after the clinical onset of MND. We examined motor functions, such as grip strength and rota-rod walking performance, weekly, and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in the forelimb biceps at the end of treatment. BDNF treatment slowed the disease progression maximally at a dose of 20 mg/kg, consistent to the previous evidence. Only high-dose riluzole treatment increased grip strength at weeks 1 (P=0.0023) and 2 (P=0.021), time before falling in the rota-rod test throughout all 4 weeks of treatment (P=0.0022 to 0.0282), and CMAP amplitude (P=0.0069) at the end of treatment, compared with the vehicle. Furthermore, the riluzole treatment increased the number of the cervical cord anterior horn neurons that were immunoreactive for SMI-32, a specific motor neuron marker, by the end of treatment (P=0.0063), although it did not affect the vacuolar degeneration on the SMI-32-positive neurons. This study demonstrated that riluzole was comparable to BDNF in slowing the progression of neuromuscular dysfunction in the wobbler mouse MND, which may provide a useful model for examining the mechanisms of selective motor neuron degeneration.","['Ishiyama T', 'Okada R', 'Nishibe H', 'Mitsumoto H', 'Nakayama C']",2004,1019,1-2,Brain Res,"Ishiyama T, et al.

METHODS: The Scottish MND Register, a population based disease register (1989-1998), with record linkage to the Scottish Morbidity 1 dataset of hospital discharges coded for gastrostomy procedure was used. Descriptive statistics of patients undergoing gastrostomy were extracted. Survival analysis used Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods.
RESULTS: For patients diagnosed between 1989-98, 142 percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion episodes were identified in 1226 patients, 130 of which occurred before the censoring date of 31 December 1999.Annually, on average, 5% of all revalent patients underwent gastrostomy, and this rate appeared to double between 1989-98. The cumulative incidence of gastrostomy was 11%. Mean age at PEG tube insertion was 66.8 years, with a mean disease duration of 24 months. Median survival from PEG tube insertion was 146 days. The 1 month mortality after gastrostomy was 25%. Gastrostomy did not confer a survival advantage compared with no gastrostomy.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that gastrostomy feeding tubes are being inserted more frequently in people with ALS/MND. An unexpectedly high early mortality was detected which probably reflects a lack of selection bias compared with previously published data. It is possible that changes in the practice of gastrostomy placement since 1998 result in better outcomes for patients with ALS/MND. Prospective studies are required to assess the risks and benefits of enteral nutrition in ALS/MND.","['Forbes RB', 'Colville S', 'Swingler RJ', 'Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Research Group']",2004,251,7,J Neurol,"Forbes RB, et al.

We here used the mutant motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse, a late-infantile NCL variant, to investigate the retinal oxidative state and apoptotic cell death as a function of age and sex. Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels revealed progressive increases in retinal oxyradicals and lipid peroxides of mnd mice of both sexes. Female mnd retinas showed a higher oxidation rate and consistently exhibited the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)-adducts staining and advanced histopathologic profile when compared to male mnd retinas matched for age. In situ DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining) appeared in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) as early as 1 month of age. At 4 months, there were more intense and numerous TUNEL-positive cells in the same layer and in the inner nuclear (INL) and ganglion cell (GCL) layers; whereas at 8 months TUNEL staining was restricted to a few scattered cells in the INL and GCL, when a severe retinal cell loss had occurred. Caspase-3 activation confirmed apoptotic demise and its processing turned out to be higher in mnd females than males. These results demonstrate the involvement of oxidation and apoptotic processes in mnd mouse retinopathy and highlight sex-related differences in retinal vulnerability to oxidative stress and damage.","['Guarneri R', 'Russo D', 'Cascio C', ""D'Agostino S"", 'Galizzi G', 'Bigini P', 'Mennini T', 'Guarneri P']",2004,1014,1-2,Brain Res,"Guarneri R, et al.

15178948,Neuronal intranuclear inclusions distinguish familial FTD-MND type from sporadic cases.,"Ubiquitin-immunoreactive (ub-ir) neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions are characteristically found in the extramotor cortex in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and dementia (MND-dementia) and in a subset of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) without motor symptoms (FTD-MND type). Recently, ub-ir neuronal intranuclear inclusions have been described in a small number of patients with familial FTD-MND type. To better define the sensitivity and specificity of this pathological change, we examined postmortem tissue from 14 patients with FTD-MND type (8 familial, 6 sporadic), 10 cases of MND-dementia (5 familial, 5 sporadic) and 19 cases of MND with no history of cognitive dysfunction (2 familial, 17 sporadic). Numerous intranuclear inclusions were found in multiple anatomic sites in 6/8 cases of familial FTD-MND. Rare intranuclear inclusions were present in the hippocampal dentate granule cells in 1 case of familial MND-dementia. No sporadic cases had intranuclear inclusions. These findings suggest that intranuclear inclusions are specific for familial FTD and may identify a subset of families with a common genetic basis. Although intranuclear inclusions are most characteristic of families with pure FTD, they may also be found in some pedigrees with both FTD and MND, further supporting the hypothesis that FTD-MND type and MND-dementia represent a clinicopathological spectrum of disease.","['Mackenzie IR', 'Feldman H']",2004,17,4,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,Mackenzie IR and Feldman H.

15144872,Clenbuterol retards loss of motor function in motor neuron degeneration mice.,"Motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mice exhibit lysosomal accumulation of lipofuscin-like material that is associated with progressive loss of motor function and strength. Motor dysfunction scores at 8.5-9 months of age were highly correlated with the occurrence of abnormal spinal motor neurons with eccentric nuclei, although the total numbers of motor neurons were not significantly reduced. Nuclear eccentricity is a characteristic of the axon reaction that results from injury and subsequent compensatory axonal sprouting indicating axonal/synaptic dysfunction in mnd motor neurons. Treatment with clenbuterol, a beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist that can enhance regeneration of motor neuron axons, opposed the development of motor deficits in parallel with a reduced proportion of motor neurons with eccentric nuclei consistent with improved synaptic function. Clenbuterol also opposed decreases in grip strength and muscle mass suggesting beta(2)-agonist treatment as a potential therapeutic modality for lipofuscinoses.","['Zeman RJ', 'Peng H', 'Etlinger JD']",2004,187,2,Exp Neurol,"Zeman RJ, et al.

15130949,Cortical selective vulnerability in motor neuron disease: a morphometric study.,"Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies have revealed that the primary motor cortex (PMC) and the extramotor cortical areas are functionally abnormal in motor neuron disease (MND, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), but the nature of the cortical lesions that underlie these changes is poorly understood. In particular, there have been few attempts to quantify neuronal loss in the PMC and in other cortical areas in MND. We used SMI-32, an antibody against an epitope on non-phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, to analyse the size and density of SMI-32-positive cortical pyramidal neurons in layer V of the PMC, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the supragenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in 13 MND and eight control subjects. There was a statistically significant reduction in the density of SMI-32-immunoreactive (IR) pyramidal neurons within cortical layer V in the PMC, the DLPFC and the ACC in MND subjects compared with controls [t (19) = 2.91, P = 0.009; estimated reduction 25%; 95% CI = 8%, 40%]. In addition, we studied the density and size of interneurons immunoreactive for the calcium-binding proteins calbindin-D(28K) (CB), parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR) in the same areas (PMC, DLPFC and ACC). Statistically significant differences in the densities of CB-IR neurons were observed within cortical layers V (P = 0.003) and VI (P = 0.001) in MND cases compared with controls. The densities of CR- and PV-IR neurons were not significantly different between MND and control cases, although there were trends towards reductions of CR-IR neuronal density within the same layers and of PV-IR neuronal density within cortical layer VI. Loss of pyramidal neurons and of GABAergic interneurons is more widespread than has been appreciated and is present in areas associated with neuroimaging and cognitive abnormalities in MND. These findings support the notion that MND should be considered a multisystem disorder.","['Maekawa S', 'Al-Sarraj S', 'Kibble M', 'Landau S', 'Parnavelas J', 'Cotter D', 'Everall I', 'Leigh PN']",2004,127,Pt 6,Brain,"Maekawa S, et al.

The diagnosis is based on rigid criteria, considering clinical aspects and eletroneuromyography findings. Blood tests and radiological investigation are necessary to look for other diagnosis mimicking PMA. We herein present 11 patients with PMA (5.9% of all our MND patients), 9 men and 2 women, which onset of symptoms occurred mainly under de age of 50, with a mean of 45.5 years. Cramp was the most frequent symptom preceding muscular weakness. Muscle pain, fatigue and fasciculations were also cited as starting symptoms. Asymmetric weakness of the arms was the most frequent pattern of onset of the disease. Bulbar muscular weakness developed in all patients during the course of the disease. Predisposing factors and distinctive clinical outcome was not observed in any of the patients. Ophthalmoparesis and sphincter dysfunction were seen in two patients who had a prolonged time in artificial respiratory assistance. Immunosuppressive therapy was ineffective in all patients.

15083302,The future of motor neuron disease: the challenge is in the genes.,"Adult-onset motor neuron disease (MND) includes sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), lower motor neuron disease including progressive and segmental spinal muscular atrophy (LMND) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). ALS/MND can be considered to be a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases characterised by a preferential degeneration of upper and/or lower motor neurons. ALS and LMND have a complex multifactorial aetiology and a large clinical variability. This combination warrants an increasing genomics approach in future research. Genomics is the structural and functional study of genomes--i. e. the complete set of chromosomes and the genes they contain. Several methods may help to understand gene functions, and every method has led to its own ""omics"". The study of the complex relationship between on the one hand genomics data, transcriptomics data, proteomics data, and interactomics data and on the other hand the phenotype, is called ""phenomics"". In phenomics, the extensive and detailed phenotyping by the clinician is a prerequisite for meaningful associations. As a consequence, in ALS/MND clinicians have the task to agree about different clinical subtypes in order to make these associations and hence to gain further insight into the complex pathogenesis and identification of diagnostic markers in ALS/MND. Also, several new approaches in the treatment of ALS/MND are here discussed, including the viral delivery of protective compounds, RNA-interference, and stem cell therapy. Further, we argue that a future challenge is to allow for patients to have early access to multidisciplinary centres with specialist knowledge of ALS/MND. These centres can apply specific models of care for people with ALS/MND, but must be designed in a patient-centred format. Ultimately, these models should be assessed according to their outcomes.","['Veldink JH', 'Van den Berg LH', 'Wokke JH']",2004,251,4,J Neurol,"Veldink JH, et al.

On the other hand, only a few cases of motor neuron disease (MND) have been reported to date in HIV-positive patients, even though this neurological complication occurs with a 27-fold greater frequency in these subjects compared with the general population. A retroviral etiology for MND has long been hypothesized, and epidemiological and experimental data suggest a pathogenetic link between HIV infection and MND, because retroviral infections may cause motor neuron damage in both laboratory animals and humans, as a result of various pathways. Furthermore, the introduction of potent, protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral combinations has had a great impact on the natural history of HIV disease and produced a dramatic improvement in some patients with HIV-associated MND, but optimal treatment for this progressive neurological complication has not been well defined. A case of MND in a male HIV-infected patient with significant but transient reversal of neurological symptoms after the use of protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral regimen is described.","['Calza L', 'Manfredi R', 'Freo E', 'Farneti B', 'Tampellini L', ""d'Orsi G"", 'Chiodo F']",2004,16,1,J Chemother,"Calza L, et al.

In this article we hope to demonstrate that language dysfunction is not only a pronounced and well documented symptom in some MND patients but also that the study of language in MND can address interesting theoretical questions about the representation of language and conceptual knowledge in the brain. After a brief introduction delineating clinical and pathological features of the disease we discuss the evidence available in the literature for language dysfunction in MND. We then present linguistic data from our own study of seven patients with MND/dementia/aphasia syndrome focusing on the dissociation between noun and verb processing. To illustrate the clinical, neuropsychological and linguistic aspects of MND we describe in more detail the patient E.N., a pathologically confirmed case of MND/dementia.

15024584,Alzheimer disease pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. In some ALS patients, dementia or aphasia may be present (ALS-D). The dementia is most commonly a frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and many of these cases have ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions in neurons of the dentate gyrus and superficial layers of the frontal and temporal lobes. Identical inclusions have been found in cases presenting with FTD and have been designated motor neuron disease (MND)-inclusions. Cases of ALS-D without MND-inclusions have been reported to show neocortical gliosis, neuronal loss, and superficial spongiosis, but there have also been scattered case reports of ALS with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To determine whether AD pathology may play a role in the dementia or aphasia syndromes in ALS, we reviewed 30 cases of sporadic ALS diagnosed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A clinical history of ALS-D was found in 24.1% of the cases, of which 57% had MND-inclusions. Although the ALS-D cases with MND-inclusions typically had amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, there were no neuritic plaques. Three cases of ALS-D had no MND-inclusions, and two of these fulfilled pathological criteria for AD. One ALS-D case showed severe amyloid angiopathy but no neuritic plaques or MND-inclusions. MND-inclusions were not found in any ALS case without dementia; however, four patients without dementia or aphasia showed moderate or frequent numbers of neuritic plaques. In conclusion, we found that approximately 30% of ALS cases with dementia have AD and that some ALS cases without frank dementia have significant AD pathology.","['Hamilton RL', 'Bowser R']",2004,107,6,Acta Neuropathol,Hamilton RL and Bowser R.

14991384,Increased expression of neuronal cyclooxygenase-2 in the hippocampus in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis both with and without dementia.,"The pathophysiological basis of cognitive dysfunction, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS with dementia (ALSD) remains unclear. On the other hand, increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the spinal cord is thought to play a pivotal role in motor neuron degeneration in ALS. In this study, to assess the relationship between the neuronal COX-2 expression in the cerebrum, the formation of tau- and alpha-synuclein-negative but ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions (UPIs), and dementia in motor neuron disease (MND), we examined neuronal COX-2 immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of patients with non-demented ALS without UPIs ( n=11), ALSD with UPIs ( n=6), and normal controls ( n=24) using a quantitative immunohistochemical technique. Neuronal COX-2 expression in all CA1-4 in the hippocampus was significantly up-regulated in the ALSD group, and, to lesser degree but significantly, in the ALS group. Neuronal COX-2 expression in the frontal cortex was also significantly up-regulated in the ALSD group but not in the ALS group. These findings suggest that (1) the frontal cortex and hippocampus of MND are involved in the same pathogenic process associated with COX-2 induction that has been observed in spinal anterior horn cells, (2) COX-2 induction in the cerebrum is a pathogenic process that can occur even in the absence of UPI formation in MND, and (3) COX-2 expression in the cerebrum may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in MND.","['Yokota O', 'Terada S', 'Ishizu H', 'Ishihara T', 'Nakashima H', 'Kugo A', 'Tsuchiya K', 'Ikeda K', 'Hayabara T', 'Saito Y', 'Murayama S', 'Uéda K', 'Checler F', 'Kuroda S']",2004,107,5,Acta Neuropathol,"Yokota O, et al.

DESIGN: Prospective, population-based descriptive epidemiological study.
SETTING: Scotland (population 5.1 million), The Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Register 1989-1998.
PARTICIPANTS: 135 people aged 80 years or over at diagnosis.
METHODS: Descriptive Epidemiology of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Motor Neurone Disease in the over 80s. Survival described using Kaplan-Meier curves.
RESULTS: 135 of 1226 cases (11%) were aged 80 years or more. Sixty-seven (50%) had bulbar onset, and 58 (43%) were men. The standardised incidence was 10.2/100000 (95% CI 7.4-13.1) in men and 6.1/100000 (95% CI = 4.3-7.6) in women. Median survival from first symptoms was 1.7 years (IQR 1.0-2.8), less than younger patients (P = 0.0003; log Rank test). We found evidence of differences in the process of care, as older people were less likely to be prescribed Riluzole (OR 0.12, 95% CI = 0.02-0.89) or be assessed by a neurologist (OR 0.76, 95% CI = 0.67-0.86).
CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive report of the epidemiology of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Motor Neurone Disease in older people. Clinical presentation and survival differ from the population as a whole. There is evidence of a different process of care. While this may be to the detriment of their survival, this finding would need to be confirmed by further prospective studies.","['Forbes RB', 'Colville S', 'Swingler RJ', 'Scottish ALS/MND Register']",2004,33,2,Age Ageing,"Forbes RB, et al.

14745570,Extrapyramidal features in patients with motor neuron disease and dementia; a clinicopathological correlative study.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) may be complicated by frontotemporal dementia and/or an extrapyramidal movement disorder. Several studies have identified the pathological substrate for dementia in MND as being ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions and dystrophic neurites in the extramotor neocortex and hippocampus. Although degenerative changes have previously been noted in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra in MND, detailed pathological studies with clinical correlation are lacking. We examined postmortem material from eight patients with a history of MND and dementia, four of whom also had prominent extrapyramidal features. All cases showed the expected degenerative changes in the pyramidal motor system and ubiquitin-positive inclusions in the extramotor cortex. In addition, the cases with a history of extrapyramidal features had striking pathology in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra; neuronal loss and gliosis ranged from moderate to severe and immunohistochemistry demonstrated numerous neuronal inclusions and dystrophic neurites, which were reactive for ubiquitin, but not tau or alpha-synuclein. Similar pathology was either absent or much milder in cases without extrapyramidal features. This study illustrates the utility of ubiquitin immunohistochemistry in demonstrating the range of pathology in MND and provides a neuropathological correlate for the extrapyramidal features which may occur in MND with dementia.","['Mackenzie IR', 'Feldman H']",2004,107,4,Acta Neuropathol,Mackenzie IR and Feldman H.

14722583,Analysis of heavy neurofilament subunit gene polymorphism in Russian patients with sporadic motor neuron disease (MND).,"Motor neuron disease (MND) results in the selective degeneration of motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. The most common form of MND is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). MND is complex and many genetic systems may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Pathological and animal studies implicate neurofilament involvement in MND. The heavy subunit (NEFH) tail domain contains a repeated motif. In humans, there are two common variants: the 45 motif repeats long allele (L) and 44 motif repeats short allele (S). Previous studies have shown that the NEFH tail may be involved in the pathogenesis of MND. To investigate whether the L/S genotypes of the NEFH gene are associated with MND, we studied the frequency of L and S alleles in sporadic MND patients and a control population from Moscow. We observed a difference in SS genotype frequency between the control population and sporadic MND patients from Moscow. It was established that the SS genotype is sufficiently higher in sporadic MND patients. Moreover, we determined that patients with the SS genotype have the highest value of loss of the total clinical score. In summary, we conclude that the NEFH gene is involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic MND. The SS genotype represents a risk factor for the development and progression of sporadic MND in the Moscow population.","['Skvortsova V', 'Shadrina M', 'Slominsky P', 'Levitsky G', 'Kondratieva E', 'Zherebtsova A', 'Levitskaya N', 'Alekhin A', 'Serdyuk A', 'Limborska S']",2004,12,3,Eur J Hum Genet,"Skvortsova V, et al.

We previously reported a significant increase in GFAP protein levels in the lumbar spinal cord homogenates by western blot analysis and upregulation of TNF, a proinflammatory cytokine, in the motor neurons of lumbar spinal cord of mnd mice, already in a presymptomatic stage (4 months of age). In the present study, using immunohistochemical analysis, we performed a time course in mnd mice (1, 4 and 9 months of age) evaluating the expression and the distribution of astroglial and microglial cells and the expression of both TNF receptors, TNFR-I and TNFR-II. We observed a marked increase in astroglial and microglial cells and in TNFR-I immunoreactivity already at the 4th month. Since motor neuron dysfunction occurs in mnd mice in the absence of evident loss of spinal motor neurons, the present results indicate that the activation of microglial cells and astrocytes is independent from neuronal degeneration. The role of TNF and TNFR-I on motor neurons is still to be demonstrated.","['Mennini T', 'Bigini P', 'Cagnotto A', 'Carvelli L', 'Di Nunno P', 'Fumagalli E', 'Tortarolo M', 'Buurman WA', 'Ghezzi P', 'Bendotti C']",2004,25,3,Cytokine,"Mennini T, et al.

Clinical records of subjects with MND and a comparison group were reviewed to determine the diagnosis according to El-Escariol Criteria of ALS. Cervical, thoracic and lumbar cord sections were stained with an antibody to ASN. A blinded, semiquantitative review of sections from both groups included examination for evidence of spheroids, neuronal staining, cytoplasmic inclusions, anterior horn granules, white and gray matter glial staining, corticospinal tract axonal fiber and myelin changes. MND cases, including ALS and progressive muscular atrophy, displayed significantly increased ASN staining of spheroids ( P< or =0.001), and glial staining in gray and white matter ( P< or =0.05). Significant abnormal staining of corticospinal axon tract fibers and myelin was also observed ( P< or =0.05 and 0.01). Detection of possible ASN-positive neuronal inclusions did not differ between groups. Significant ASN abnormalities were observed in MND.

14629785,"Pick Complex: an integrative approach to frontotemporal dementia: primary progressive aphasia, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy.","BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a new label for clinical Pick's disease (PiD) because the eponymic term is increasingly restricted to the pathologic finding of Pick bodies. This restriction created the impression that PiD is rare and that is it difficult to diagnose. FTD is also a term most often used for behavioral and personality alterations. Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), formerly the extrapyramidal variety of PiD, are also part of the syndrome. Recently, chromosome 17 localization and tau mutations were discovered in familial forms of the disease.
REVIEW SUMMARY: FTD consists of behavioral and personality changes, often beginning with apathy and disinterest, which may be mistaken for depression. Disinhibition and perseverative, compulsive behavior often appear at the same time. A quantifiable frontal behavioral inventory is useful in the diagnosis beyond a checklist. The second type of presentation is progressive language loss (PPA). A less common variety is semantic dementia: the meaning of nouns and objects is lost. As the disease progresses, all components tend to overlap. CBD and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), although described as distinct entities, show a great deal of clinical, pathologic, genetic, and biochemical overlap. The evidence suggests they also belong to the complex. The association of motor neuron disease (MND) with FTD and other varieties of the complex is also reviewed.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical Pick's disease or Pick Complex includes the overlapping syndromes of FTD, PPA, CBD, PSP, and FTD-MND. The neuropathological and genetic spectrum should be viewed with emphasis on the commonalities rather than the differences, allowing the recognition of the relatively high frequency of this presenile syndrome.",['Kertesz A'],2003,9,6,Neurologist,"Kertesz A.

We conclude that in most cases progressive dysarthria is the presenting sign of an established neurodegenerative disease (generally degenerative dementia or motor neuron disease), although the possibility that progressive dysarthria is a distinct entity cannot be excluded. To clarify this issue, studies (probably multicenter) on more patients with longer clinical follow-up and pathological confirmation are required.","['Soliveri P', 'Piacentini S', 'Carella F', 'Testa D', 'Ciano C', 'Girotti F']",2003,24,3,Neurol Sci,"Soliveri P, et al.

14560061,Rapidly progressive aphasic dementia with motor neuron disease: a distinctive clinical entity.,"The association of motor neuron disease (MND) with rapidly progressive aphasic dementia has been recognized as a distinct clinical syndrome within the group of frontotemporal dementias (FTDs). Although the clinical and neuropsychological features of this syndrome have been defined, a small number of post-mortem studies have been published with heterogeneous neuropathological findings. We performed cognitive, neuro-imaging and neuropathological studies on a 71-year-old male with rapidly progressive aphasic dementia and MND. We initially found a selective non-fluent aphasia associated with hypoperfusion of the left frontotemporal cortex. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed an asymmetric change of brain metabolites, with greater changes in the left temporal lobe. The bulbar manifestations of MND occurred over the following 6 months, and the patient died of bronchopneumonia. The neuropathological examination revealed loss of neurons in the hypoglossal nucleus and anterior horns of the cervical spinal cord with microvacuolation and dot-like ubiquitin-positive deposits in the frontoparietotemporal cortex, but no changes suggestive of Alzheimer's, Pick's or Lewy body disease. These findings support the conclusion that MND with rapidly progressive aphasic dementia is a distinctive clinical entity within the group of FTD-MND.","['Catani M', 'Piccirilli M', 'Geloso MC', 'Cherubini A', 'Finali G', 'Pelliccioli G', 'Senin U', 'Mecocci P']",2004,17,1-2,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,"Catani M, et al.

We have used death certificates held in pension fund archives and linked unbiased historical occupational records to investigate the effects of occupational exposure to metals or solvents on the risk of death from MND in 22 cases and 206 controls from 22,526 past employees of a major UK engineering company. We found no evidence of increased risk of death from MND in individuals who had worked with either metals (adjusted odds ratio=0.88, 95% CI 0.35-2.22) or solvents (odds ratio=1.12, 95% CI 0.45-2.78), and no relation between disease risk and either duration or intensity of exposure.

14535957,Antisense peptide nucleic acid-mediated knockdown of the p75 neurotrophin receptor delays motor neuron disease in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice.,"Re-expression of the death-signalling p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is associated with injury and neurodegeneration in the adult nervous system. The induction of p75NTR expression in mature degenerating spinal motor neurons of humans and transgenic mice with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suggests a role of p75NTR in the progression of motor neuron disease (MND). In this study, we designed, synthesized and evaluated novel antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) constructs targeting p75NTR as a potential gene knockdown therapeutic strategy for ALS. An 11-mer antisense PNA directed at the initiation codon, but not downstream gene sequences, dose-dependently inhibited p75NTR expression and death-signalling by nerve growth factor (NGF) in Schwann cell cultures. Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (PS-ODN) sequences used for comparison failed to confer such inhibitory activity. Systemic intraperitoneal administration of this antisense PNA to mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1G93A) transgenic mice significantly delayed locomotor impairment and mortality compared with mice injected with nonsense or scrambled PNA sequences. Reductions in p75NTR expression and subsequent caspase-3 activation in spinal cords were consistent with increased survival in antisense PNA-treated mice. The uptake of fluorescent-labelled antisense PNA in the nervous system of transgenic mice was also confirmed. This study suggests that p75NTR may be a promising antisense target in the treatment of ALS.","['Turner BJ', 'Cheah IK', 'Macfarlane KJ', 'Lopes EC', 'Petratos S', 'Langford SJ', 'Cheema SS']",2003,87,3,J Neurochem,"Turner BJ, et al.

MND patients were more likely to have free medical care than MS patients, despite legislation favouring the converse. Severely disabled MND patients were more successful at accessing free community-based services than were severely disabled MS patients. Private medical insurance conferred no advantage when obtaining services or purchasing equipment. Many patients were unaware of the specific roles of the various clinical professionals. There are significant deficiencies in patients' ability to access multidisciplinary services. Voluntary organisations often bridge the gap in service provision.

The aim of this study was to investigate if mutation in these genes is associated with upper motor neurone degeneration in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) or selected motor neurone disease (MND) cases. DNA was extracted from whole blood and screened using single stranded conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis. No mutation in the spastin or paraplegin genes was identified in the PLS or MND cases. Polymorphism was identified in the paraplegin gene but no association was shown with PLS or MND. We therefore conclude that mutation in spastin and paraplegin genes does not appear to cause PLS or MND.,"['McDermott CJ', 'Roberts D', 'Tomkins J', 'Bushby KM', 'Shaw PJ']",2003,4,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"McDermott CJ, et al.

13677501,Patients' health-related quality-of-life and health state values for motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) has a severe impact on patient quality of life, especially in later stages of the disease. This study assesses the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of MND patients, and for the first time elicits health state values from patients for their present health state. A structured interview was conducted with 77 patients. Patients completed a disease specific health status measure (ALSAQ-40), a generic health status measure (EuroQol EQ-5D), a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a standard gamble (SG) exercise. The ALSAQ-40 was sensitive to disease severity. Patients' mean VAS rating of their own health ranged from 0.74 for stage 1 (early) disease severity (n = 15), to 0.37 for stage 4 (late stage) disease severity (n = 19). Utilities elicited via SG varied from a mean of 0.79 for stage 1 disease severity to a mean of 0.45 for stage 4 disease severity. The EQ-5D derived single index ranged from a mean of 0.63 for stage 1 disease severity to a mean of -0.01 for stage 4 disease severity. This study demonstrates that it is feasible and practical to obtain health state values from MND patients and it provides evidence that patients place a high value on their HRQL, even in cases where health status is very poor.","['Green C', 'Kiebert G', 'Murphy C', 'Mitchell JD', ""O'Brien M"", 'Burrell A', 'Leigh PN']",2003,12,5,Qual Life Res,"Green C, et al.

13129806,Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND).,"BACKGROUND: Riluzole 100 mg probably prolongs survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by about two months and the safety of the drug is not a major concern. The evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that patients taking riluzole probably survive longer than patients taking placebo. The beneficial effects are very modest and the drug is expensive. Adverse effects from riluzole are relatively minor and for the most part reversible after stopping the drug. Riluzole has been approved for treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in many countries but not all. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost, modest efficacy and concern over adverse effects.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival, and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Search of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register for randomized trials and enquiry from authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. The most recent search was November 2002.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials of adults with diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), treated with riluzole or placebo. Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality as a function of time with riluzole 100 mg and other doses of riluzole; neurologic function, quality of life, muscle strength and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION & ANALYSIS: We identified four eligible randomized trials. Each reviewer graded them for methodological quality. Data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and checked by two others. We obtained some missing data from investigators and regulatory agencies. We performed meta-analyses with Review Manager 4.1 software using a fixed effects model. A test of drug efficacy was based on the Parmar pooled hazard ratio.
RESULTS: The three trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 876 riluzole treated patients and 406 placebo treated patients. The data for tracheostomy-free survival was not available from the fourth trial. The methodological quality was acceptable and the three trials were easily comparable, although one trial included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (p=0.039, hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.99) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (p=0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) is added, there is evidence of heterogeneity (p<0.0001) and the random effects model, which takes this into account results in the overall treatment effect estimate falling just short of significance (p=0.056, hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.01). This represents a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (57% in the placebo and 66% in the riluzole group). In secondary analyses of survival at separate time points, there was a significant survival advantage with riluzole 100 mg at six, nine, 12 and 15 months, but not at three or 18 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. There were no data on quality of life, but patients treated with riluzole remained in a more moderately affected health state significantly longer than placebo-treated patients (weighted mean difference 35.5 days, 95% confidence interval 5.9 to 65.0). A threefold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole treated patients than controls (weighted mean difference 2.69, 95% confidence interval 1.65 to 4.38).
CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs survival by about two months in patients with ALS. More studies are needed, especially to clarify its effect in older patients (over 75 years), and those with more advanced disease.","['Miller RG', 'Mitchell JD', 'Lyon M', 'Moore DH']",2003,4,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Miller RG, et al.

12913196,Survival in frontotemporal dementia.,"OBJECTIVES: To establish survival in patients with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and to determine whether clinical or pathologic subtype affects prognosis.
METHODS: The authors reviewed the presenting clinical features of 61 patients with dementia and pathologically confirmed FTD studied in Sydney (n = 31) and Cambridge (n = 30) over a 10-year period. Data were available on time of symptom onset, diagnosis, institutionalization, and death. Cases were classified pathologically as tau-positive and tau-negative.
RESULTS: Of the 61 patients with FTD, 26 presented with frontal variant (fvFTD), 9 with semantic dementia, 8 with progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), 9 with associated motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), and 9 with corticobasal degeneration features. There was no difference between the groups in age at symptom onset (overall mean 58.5 +/- 7.8 years), but at diagnosis the PNFA (68.3 +/- 2.7) group was significantly older than the fvFTD (59.9 +/- 7.4) and FTD-MND (57.7 +/- 7.9) groups. The median survival from symptom onset and from diagnosis was 6 +/- 1.1 years (95% CI) for fvFTD and 3 +/- 0.4 years for FTD-MND. Survival across subgroups was equivalent except for the FTD-MND group, which had significantly shorter survival. Cases with tau-positive pathology had an older age at onset and a significantly better prognosis: median survival 9.0 +/- 0.9 years vs 5.0 +/- 1.1 years.
CONCLUSIONS: FTD is a malignant disorder with limited life expectancy. FTD-MND has the shortest duration both before and after diagnosis. Tau-positivity is associated with a more slowly progressive form of FTD.","['Hodges JR', 'Davies R', 'Xuereb J', 'Kril J', 'Halliday G']",2003,61,3,Neurology,"Hodges JR, et al.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of NO and oxidative stress in MND by estimating nitrite and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 22 patients of MND and 20 control subjects suffering from neurological disorders not known to affect NO metabolism. There was no significant change in the CSF nitrite and MDA levels in MND. The nitrite and MDA levels did not have any significant correlation with age, duration of illness, or severity of disease. Univariate analysis of the clinical features in patients with MND and the nitrite levels revealed that two patients with a positive family history had significantly higher CSF nitrite levels as compared to those with a negative family history. There was no correlation between the CSF nitrite and MDA levels. Results of the present study did not indicate significant alterations in the MDA and NO levels in the CSF of MND patients. However, involvement of NO in MND with positive family history is suggested by the results obtained.","['Shukla R', 'Rajani M', 'Barthwal MK', 'Srivastava N', 'Dikshit M']",2003,113,8,Int J Neurosci,"Shukla R, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of bulbar-onset polymyositis where the initial clinical presentation was suggestive of MND.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old woman was admitted for investigation of acute-onset dysphagia without dysarthria. Examination revealed nasal dysphonia and severe oropharyngeal weakness. Subtle upper-limb weakness, brisk tendon reflexes, and fasciculations in the right deltoid muscle were also demonstrated. A clinical diagnosis of MND was entertained. The serum creatine kinase value was within the reference range. Findings from electromyographic studies, however, were suggestive of a myopathic rather than a neurodegenerative process, and a muscle biopsy specimen was diagnostic of polymyositis. The dysphagia rapidly resolved upon treatment with corticosteroids and azathioprine.
CONCLUSIONS: Bulbar-onset polymyositis may mimic MND, particularly in the absence of inflammatory markers or elevated muscle enzyme levels. Caution should be exercised in the clinical diagnosis of bulbar dysfunction, and further investigations such as electromyography and muscle biopsy are indicated to confirm the diagnosis.","['Ryan A', 'Nor AM', 'Costigan D', 'Foley-Nolan D', 'El-Rafie A', 'Farrell MA', 'Hardiman O']",2003,60,7,Arch Neurol,"Ryan A, et al.

Significantly younger onset of disease symptoms and a predominance of pure upper motor neuron signs at presentation characterised the long term survivors, but factors traditionally regarded as being associated with poor prognosis were also well represented. For a few people with motor neuron disease there remains the hope, whatever the initial presentation, that their subsequent survival will be longer than expected.","['Turner MR', 'Parton MJ', 'Shaw CE', 'Leigh PN', 'Al-Chalabi A']",2003,74,7,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Turner MR, et al.

12787321,Frontotemporal and motor neurone degeneration with neurofilament inclusion bodies: additional evidence for overlap between FTD and ALS.,"We present the case of a patient who had clinical frontal lobe dementia without apparent motor neurone disease (MND), with pathologic findings not typical of any single currently classified frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). At autopsy, the brain had frontal and temporal atrophy with neuronal loss, gliosis, and superficial spongiosis, typical of all FTDs. There were at least three different morphologic types of intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions in a variety of brain and brainstem regions, including the hippocampal dentate gyrus and pyramidal neurones, the neocortex (in particular, the motor cortex), basal ganglia, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, basis pontis, and inferior olivary nuclei. Inclusions had the morphologies of Pick-like bodies, pleomorphic inclusions, and hyaline conglomerate (HC)-like inclusions. None of these were positive with tau immunostains. Pick-like bodies in the dentate gyrus were labelled with ubiquitin. The pleomorphic inclusions in the neocortex and dentate gyrus and the HC-like inclusions in the motor and parietal cortex were strongly positive with immunostains for neurofilament. We discuss the differential diagnosis and compare this case with those disorders to which it is most similar. In particular, we compare the unique neurofilament-positive inclusions to the inclusions of FTD-MND, to Pick bodies, and to the basophilic and HC inclusions that are occasionally seen in amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although FTD-MND may be found in ALS, the findings in this case may have additional implications for a link between FTD and ALS.","['Bigio EH', 'Lipton AM', 'White CL', 'Dickson DW', 'Hirano A']",2003,29,3,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Bigio EH, et al.

D-MND accounted for 30.4% of all forms of frontal lobe dementia (FLD) including FLD and Pick's disease. These data support that this combined syndrome may be more frequent than previously reported. As the subcortical neuropathology of D-MND is identical with MND, D-MND is rather the cortical manifestation of MND than a new disease entity.","['Marquard R', 'Bergida R', 'Müller R', 'Becker I', 'Wada M', 'Kurz A']",2003,16,2,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,"Marquard R, et al.

12745615,Health-related locus of control: does it change in motor neurone disease (MND)?,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have attempted to describe locus of control beliefs in people with MND. This exploratory, longitudinal study set out to examine some of the possible correlations of health-related locus of control beliefs and the stability of these beliefs.
METHOD: 32 people with Motor Neurone Disease completed the Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) scale, initially on average 10.3 months after diagnosis, and again on average 16.4 months after diagnosis. Physical symptoms were assessed at both times.
RESULTS: Initially there were no correlations between MHLC beliefs or disease duration and physical symptomatology, although longer disease duration was associated with greater beliefs in the role of powerful others in health control. At the second assessment, belief in the role of powerful others controlling health had increased, with this increase relating significantly to a worsening in physical symptoms. At this second assessment, neither duration of symptoms nor time since diagnosis correlated with MHLC beliefs.
CONCLUSIONS: Whilst health locus of control beliefs do appear to change in MND, current findings suggest that this does not occur simply as a function of the passage of time. How symptoms change seems to be of particular importance when considering health locus of control beliefs in people with MND. Suggestions are made concerning other factors that might usefully be examined in future studies of this type.","['Goldstein LH', 'Atkins L', 'Leigh PN']",2003,4,1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Goldstein LH, et al.

12745611,Stem therapy for ALS: hope and reality.,"All are agreed that there is pressing need for an effective treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS; MND). Such treatment may derive from a combination of therapeutic strategies aimed at different aspects of the disorder, and might include drugs directed at the initial, intermediate or terminal cascade of events leading to cell death, as well as the use of stem cells to replace dead motor neurons, or to protect those that remain. The attraction of cell implantation or transplantation is that it might help to overcome the inability of the CNS to replace lost neurons. It is also clear that neural implantation will yield little benefit if the donor cells fail to integrate functionally into the recipient CNS circuitry. In this respect, ALS poses an especially difficult problem. The recent breakthroughs in stem cell research might nevertheless provide possibilities for neural implantation and cell replacement therapy for patients with ALS. The potential impact of these new approaches to neurodegenerative diseases has been emphasised by the many experiments using human foetal cell grafts in patients affected by Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Clinical benefits in Parkinson's disease seem to be associated with integration of the donor cells into the recipient brain. Despite promising results, however, significant constraints have hampered the use of foetal cells for neural implantation and transplantation. Besides ethical concerns, the viability, purity, and final destiny of the foetal tissue have not been completely defined. Foetal cells are, in addition, post-mitotic and cannot be expanded or stored for long periods, necessitating close synchronisation of tissue donation and neurosurgery.","['Silani V', 'Leigh N']",2003,4,1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,Silani V and Leigh N.

Recently, ub-ir neuronal intranuclear inclusions have been described in a small number of patients with familial FTD-MND type. To better define the sensitivity and specificity of this pathological change, we examined postmortem tissue from 14 patients with FTD-MND type (8 familial, 6 sporadic), 10 cases of MND-dementia (5 familial, 5 sporadic), and 19 cases of MND with no history of cognitive dysfunction (2 familial, 17 sporadic). Numerous intranuclear inclusions were found in multiple anatomic sites in 6/8 cases of familial FTD-MND. Rare intranuclear inclusions were present in the hippocampal dentate granule cells in 1 case of familial MND-dementia. No sporadic cases had intranuclear inclusions. These findings suggest that intranuclear inclusions are specific for familial FTD and may identify a subset of families with a common molecular pathogenesis. Although intranuclear inclusions are most characteristic of families in which the clinical presentation is pure FTD, they may also be found in some pedigrees with both FTD and MND; further supporting the hypothesis that FTD-MND type and MND-dementia represent a clinicopathological spectrum of disease.","['Mackenzie IR', 'Feldman H']",2003,105,6,Acta Neuropathol,Mackenzie IR and Feldman H.

12727313,Neuronal and glial inclusions in frontotemporal dementia with or without motor neuron disease are immunopositive for p62.,"We examined the immunoreactivity of p62 in five cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions. Only one case had clinical features suggestive of motor neuron disease (MND). In all cases, ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions and neurites in the hippocampal region and cerebral neocortex were immunohistochemically positive for p62. Moreover, in the temporal region of a case of FTD with MND, many oligodendrocytes and some astrocytes were positive for p62. These results suggest that the degenerative process involves p62 in FTD and that the process takes place not only in neurons but also in glial cells.","['Arai T', 'Nonaka T', 'Hasegawa M', 'Akiyama H', 'Yoshida M', 'Hashizume Y', 'Tsuchiya K', 'Oda T', 'Ikeda K']",2003,342,1-2,Neurosci Lett,"Arai T, et al.

Diagnosis should be made as early as possible. Patients should have early access to centres with specialist knowledge of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Services should be flexible and responsive to the needs of the patient, and operate to best advantage when functioning as a coordinated team that cross-refers internally. Patients with ALS should be empowered to make rational end-of-life decisions based on maximizing quality of life and maintaining dignity. All models of care should be designed to cater for the sudden change from health to chronic illness, and should aim to provide a core of specialties that are patient-oriented, flexible and responsive. Ultimately, models of care should be assessed based on their outcomes.","['Hardiman O', 'Traynor BJ', 'Corr B', 'Frost E']",2002,3,4,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Hardiman O, et al.

We found that individuals with homozygosity for NF-H gene short allele (S/S-genotype carriers) in MND group predominate significantly over those in control one (p < 0.001). We revealed significant increase of oxidative markers in CSF and blood serum in MDN patients vs controls (p < 0.05), but not in patients with spondylogenic myelopathy, conforming non-specific role of oxidative stress in MND pathogenesis. There were no differences between TBARS level in CSF and serum in relation to the rate of MND progression, suggesting that oxidative stress does not influence the MND course. We showed normal SOD-1 activity in erythrocytes and CSF of MND patients that argued for the absence of these antioxidant enzymes deficiency in MND without SOD-1 gene mutations. We found significant association between homozygosity for short allele (S) and increased TBARS level in CSF (p < 0.02).

It is an intriguing possibility that the first sign of a disorder hitherto regarded as one of movement or cognition may be that of disturbed smell sense. In this review of PD, parkinsonian syndromes, essential tremor, AD, motor neurone disease (MND) and Huntington's chorea (HC) the following observations are made: 1). olfactory dysfunction is frequent and often severe in PD and AD; 2). normal smell identification in PD is rare and should prompt review of diagnosis unless the patient is female with tremor-dominant disease; 3). anosmia in suspected progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration is atypical and should likewise provoke diagnostic review; 4). hyposmia is an early feature of PD and AD and may precede motor and cognitive signs respectively; 5). subjects with anosmia and one ApoE-4 allele have an approximate 5-fold increased risk of later AD; 6). impaired smell sense is seen in some patients at 50% risk of parkinsonism; 7). smell testing in HC and MND where abnormality may be found, is not likely to be of clinical value; and 8). biopsy of olfactory nasal neurons shows non-specific changes in PD and AD and at present will not aid diagnosis.",['Hawkes C'],2003,18,4,Mov Disord,Hawkes C.

Concentric needle EMG was used in conjunction with our own computerized EMG-LAB system. Motor unit action potential (MUAP) parameters were measured in 543 muscles on weak and maximum effort. MUAP amplitude and area were found to increase in the early stages of damage, declining to normal or subnormal values in the course of the disease. It was concluded that in MND there is a pathological sequence: denervation--reinnervation--terminal denervation. The increase in MUAP amplitude and area in the early stages of lesion, reflecting reinnervation, was much greater in SMA than MND and most marked in prior polio. The eventual decrease is an expression of terminal decompensation.","['Emeryk-Szajewska B', 'Kopeć J', 'Karwańska A']",2003,43,1,Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol,"Emeryk-Szajewska B, et al.

12564766,FKBP12 immunoreactivity in the human spinal cord of motor neuron disease patients.,"We investigated the FKBP12 immunoreactivity in the spinal cord of neurological controls and motor neuron disease (MND) patients. In the neurological controls, the spinal neurons were markedly stained with antihuman FKBP12 (N-19 and C-19) antibodies. FKBP12 immunoreactivity was associated with lipofuscin in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. In an electron microscopic view, the 10-nm colloidal gold particles labeled by the anti-FKBP12 (N-19) antibody were present on the lipofuscin of the spinal anterior horn neurons. In the MND cases, atrophic neurons with an abundance of lipofuscin granules in the anterior horns of the spinal cord were mildly stained with the anti-FKBP12 (N-19 and C-19) antibodies. Normal-appearing neurons, inclusion-laden neurons and chromatolytic neurons of MND cases were weak or negatively stained with anti-FKBP12 (N-19) antibodies. These findings suggest that FKBP12 (N-19) may decrease in the early stages of degeneration in MND. Complexes of FKBP12 and ligands were reported to have neuroprotective and/or neuroregenerative properties. It is speculated that the decrease in FKBP12 (N-19) plays some causative role in the development of neurodegeneration in MND. Further investigation of FKBP12 and ligands may help elucidate the pathogenesis of MND.","['Kihira T', 'Hironishi M', 'Utunomiya H', 'Kondo T']",2002,22,4,Neuropathology,"Kihira T, et al.

Patients can deteriorate quickly in the preterminal stages resulting in inappropriate resuscitation or admission to intensive care units (ICU) or accident and emergency (A & E).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We looked at patterns of mortality with emphasis on the place of death. A retrospective study was performed of all patients attending an MND clinic, who had died within a 10-year period.
RESULTS: Of 179 patients (63 female), 81 patients (45%) died at home, in a hospice or in a nursing home. Sixty-five patients (36%) died in hospital (11 in ICU or A & E). Nine of the latter were previously known to have MND and six admissions were probably avoidable. Most ward patients died of respiratory causes and were treated conservatively.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients dying in A & E or ICU was small but could have been reduced further. A number of those who died on the wards could probably have been managed conservatively at home. Older patients and those with bulbar disease had a poorer prognosis.","['Chaudri MB', 'Kinnear WJ', 'Jefferson D']",2003,107,1,Acta Neurol Scand,"Chaudri MB, et al.

12536219,The relationship between extramotor ubiquitin-immunoreactive neuronal inclusions and dementia in motor neuron disease.,"Dementia is thought to be an uncommon complication of motor neuron disease (MND). In addition to the characteristic motor system degeneration, pathological studies of MND patients with dementia have demonstrated changes in extramotor cortex; ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions are present in neocortical layer II neurons and hippocampal dentate granule cells. To examine how specifically this pathology is associated with dementia in MND, we performed ubiquitin immunohistochemistry on sections of hippocampus, prefrontal and temporal neocortex from 29 cases of MND, 10 with dementia and 19 with no clinical history of cognitive impairment. All cases with dementia had numerous ubiquitin-positive inclusions in dentate granule cells, whereas involvement of the neocortex was more variable. Six (32%) of the nondemented cases had ubiquitin pathology, which was similar to the demented cases in its morphology and distribution but of slightly less severe degree. These findings demonstrate that, although ubiquitinated inclusions in extramotor cortex are a consistent finding in MND with dementia, they are also common in MND in the absence of documented cognitive abnormalities. Such cases may either represent a subclinical stage of pathology or indicate that cognitive dysfunction is an underrecognized complication of MND.","['Mackenzie IR', 'Feldman H']",2003,105,2,Acta Neuropathol,Mackenzie IR and Feldman H.

12531959,Deriving summary indices of health status from the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaires (ALSAQ-40 and ALSAQ-5).,"OBJECTIVES: To use statistical procedures, operationalising what is known as item response theory (IRT), to assess the unidimensionality of the 40 item Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire, and consequently to develop a single index figure from the measure. A secondary objective is to compare scores gained on the ALSAQ-40 with a five item short form (the ALSAQ-5).
METHODS: Postal survey of patients diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) on the MND Associations database. Copies of the ALSAQ-40 and, nested within it, the ALSAQ-5 were completed on two occasions. At time one, the survey contained the ALSAQ-40 and demographic questions. In addition, patients were asked to indicate if they were willing to take part in the follow up. Those who agreed to do so were sent another copy of the questionnaire after a period of three months. Respondents were also asked to indicate how much change they had experienced since baseline on each of the five domains of the questionnaire. Rasch analysis, a form of IRT methodology, was used to determine if the 40 items in the ALSAQ-40 tapped an underlying ""latent trait"", and were consequently measuring a unidimensional construct. The results from the ALSAQ-40 single index were then compared with those gained from the ALSAQ-5.
RESULTS: Analyses indicated that, at both baseline and follow up, all items on the ALSAQ-40 fitted the Rasch model. Consequently the 40 items were summed to create a single index. Results on this instrument were compared with those gained by summing the five items of the ALSAQ-5. Results on the instruments were found to be highly correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from the analyses suggests that 40 item ALSAQ does contain a unidimensional scale, and can, therefore be summed to create a single index. Furthermore the ALSAQ-5 closely replicates the results of the patient measure.","['Jenkinson C', 'Norquist JM', 'Fitzpatrick R']",2003,74,2,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Jenkinson C, et al.

12495576,Non-invasive ventilation in motor neuron disease: current UK practice.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical application of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in motor neuron disease (MND) in the UK.
METHOD: We conducted a postal survey of the current clinical practice of all consultant neurologists in the UK, with a second mailing to non-responders after 6 weeks. The principal outcome measures assessed were: 1. the percentage of patients with MND receiving NIV, 2. access to a NIV service, 3. routine monitoring of respiratory function, and 4. influence of symptoms, respiratory function, rate of disease progression, level of disability and bulbar involvement on referral for NIV.
RESULTS: The response rate was 76%, 1719 new patients had been diagnosed in the preceding 12 months and a total of 2280 patients were under review. Of these, 126 were currently receiving NIV (5.5% of patients under review, estimated 2.6-3.5% of all MND patients). Most neurologists (172/265) had referred no patients for NIV in the preceding year, while three neurologists made 30% of all referrals nationally. Referral was based primarily on symptoms, and was influenced by the number of MND patients under review, level of disability, rate of disease progression and availability of a NIV service. Bulbar involvement was considered a relative contra-indication to NIV by 51% of responders.
CONCLUSIONS: In the UK, few patients with MND are treated with NIV. There is marked variation in clinical practice. This may reflect uncertainty about the role of non-invasive ventilation in MND, and emphasizes the need for a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of NIV on quality of life and survival.","['Bourke SC', 'Williams TL', 'Bullock RE', 'Gibson GJ', 'Shaw PJ']",2002,3,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Bourke SC, et al.

12495573,Correlates of Quality of Life in people with motor neuron disease (MND).,"OBJECTIVES: Previous work has not found correlations between standardized questionnaire measures of quality of life (QoL) and physical strength/functional ability in people with motor neuron disease (MND). Little is known about the relationship between ratings on an abbreviated self-generated measure of QoL, the Schedule for Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW), and measures of functional status such as the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), although the former has been rated by people with MND as providing a more valid measure of their own QoL than the latter. The aim of this study was to examine whether self-generated ratings of QoL correlated with measures of physical impairment and self-reported functional status, psychological wellbeing and self-reported cognitive functioning, and with factors such as social support, which elsewhere has been reported to be a determinant of QoL in MND.
DESIGN: The present cross-sectional study investigated between SEIQoL-DW ratings and SIP and the relationship ALS Severity Scale (ALSSS) scores, as well as with self-reported anxiety, depression, social support and everyday cognitive functioning in 31 people with MND.
RESULTS: Overall QoL ratings on the SEIQoL-DW failed to correlate with any of the ALSSS or SIP subscale scores. This was despite the fact that health was nominated as an important QoL-related category by 64.5% of the sample. QoL scores were, however, found to correlate positively with the existence of confiding and emotional support; they also correlated negatively with the presence of self-rated everyday cognitive difficulties but not with affective state.
CONCLUSIONS: Current findings support recent observations that individuals' ratings of their QoL cannot simply be equated with their physical impairment and functional limitations, and that support systems may be important. Cognitive functioning, known to be impaired in some people with MND, should also be considered when evaluating QoL.","['Goldstein LH', 'Atkins L', 'Leigh PN']",2002,3,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Goldstein LH, et al.

12492423,Mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse central nervous system.,"The mnd mouse spontaneously develops slowly evolving motoneuron pathology leading to progressive motor impairment. There is strong evidence that a complex interplay between oxidative stress, mitochondria abnormalities and alteration of glutamate neurotransmission plays an important role in the pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases. Therefore, we investigated the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction in frontal, central (comprising the motor area) and occipital regions of the cerebral cortex and in the spinal cord of 35-week-old mnd mice. Lipid peroxide derivatives reacting with thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) were measured in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. In addition biochemical and behavioural analyses were carried out in mnd mice chronically treated with l-carnitine from the 11th to the 34th week of life (mndT mice). Slight but significant alterations of mitochondrial enzyme activities were seen in the mnd cortical regions. The central area was the most affected and both complex I, IV and citrate synthase were decreased with respect to controls. The rate of oxygen consumption (QO2) was markedly decreased in both the upper (cervical + upper portion of the thoracic region) and lower (lumbar + lower portion of the thoracic region) mnd spinal cord. The level of TBARS showed a rostro-caudal trend to increase, being 30% higher in the lumbar tract of mnd mice in comparison with controls. L-carnitine treatment increased the mitochondrial enzyme activities in cortical regions towards control value and was effective in enhancing QO2 and decreasing TBARS levels in the spinal cord of mndT. Behavioural testing showed that L-carnitine significantly delayed the onset of motor behaviour impairment. This beneficial effect was declining at 35 week of age, when the biochemical measurements were performed.","['Bertamini M', 'Marzani B', 'Guarneri R', 'Guarneri P', 'Bigini P', 'Mennini T', 'Curti D']",2002,16,12,Eur J Neurosci,"Bertamini M, et al.

The constitutive subunit of the NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor, NMDAR1, was expressed in all neurons of the grey matter and was not modified in the spinal cord of mnd mice in either its normal or phosphorylated form. The immunoreactivity of GluR2, but not its mRNA, was increased mainly in the substantia gelatinosa both in presymptomatic and in 8-month-old symptomatic mice, suggesting compensatory changes aimed at reducing the Ca2+ permeability of the receptor channel. In spinal cord of mnd mice, mRNA, and protein levels of GluR3 were low only at the symptomatic stage, possibly as a consequence of motor neuron dysfunction. This was not due to motoneuron degeneration, because the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunopositive lumbar motor neurons and the ChAT activity in the spinal cord and hind leg muscles of symptomatic mnd mice were no different from control mice. GluR4 mRNA was increased throughout the grey matter, presumably in relation to the marked microglia activation reported in the grey matter of the lumbar spinal cord in mnd mice. These changes in ionotropic glutamate receptors may alter glutamatergic neurotransmission and play some role in the pathology of mnd mice.","['Mennini T', 'Bigini P', 'Ravizza T', 'Vezzani A', 'Calvaresi N', 'Tortarolo M', 'Bendotti C']",2002,70,4,J Neurosci Res,"Mennini T, et al.

12390974,Distinctive abnormalities of motor axonal strength-duration properties in multifocal motor neuropathy and in motor neurone disease.,"The strength-duration function is a classic measure of neural excitability. When studied on peripheral motor axons it reflects the intrinsic nodal membrane properties, and its time-constant (tau(SD) or chronaxie) predominantly depends on non-voltage-gated, rest Na(+) inward conductances. We assessed the strength-duration curve of ulnar motor axons in 22 nerves of healthy controls, in 18 nerves of patients with multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction blocks (MMN), and in 19 nerves of patients with motor neurone disease (MND). The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was smaller in nerves of both groups of patients than in controls (P < 0.05). The rheobasic current (rh(50%)) [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] was higher in patients with MMN than in controls (13.3 +/- 16.3 mA; controls 4.7 +/- 1.7 mA, P < 0.05). The tau(SD) was differentially abnormal in the nerves of the two groups of patients: it was prolonged in the nerves of patients with MND for >or=40 years (227.2 +/- 34.5 micro s; controls 190.9 +/- 51.0 micro s, P < 0.05), but it was shortened in the nerves of patients with MMN (146.5 +/- 55.4 micro s; controls 208.6 +/- 51.2 micro s, P < 0.05) who had not been treated recently with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Nerves of patients with recently treated MMN (<6 weeks) who were under the therapeutic effect of IVIg had a normal tau(SD)(.) Our results suggest that, probably due to an immuno-mediated rest Na(+) channel dysfunction, Na(+) conductances are reduced in MMN. This abnormality is a function of the time after the last IVIg treatment and involves also the axonal membrane outside the conduction block. Conversely, in MND, possibly owing to the ionic leakage of degenerating membrane, rest Na(+) conductances are increased. Measuring the strength-duration curve of the ulnar motor axons might be useful in the differential diagnosis between de novo MMN and MND.","['Priori A', 'Cinnante C', 'Pesenti A', 'Carpo M', 'Cappellari A', 'Nobile-Orazio E', 'Scarlato G', 'Barbieri S']",2002,125,Pt 11,Brain,"Priori A, et al.

12373553,In-vivo proton MR-spectroscopy of the human brain: assessment of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) reduction as a marker for neurodegeneration.,"Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) is a non-invasive method to investigate changes in brain metabolite composition in different cerebral diseases. We performed proton spectroscopy in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD) and in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) with the aim to detect the specific metabolic pattern for these neurodegenerative disorders. In the MND group we found a significant reduction of NAA/tCr metabolite ratios in the motor cortex, which correlates with the disease severity and the clinical lateralization of neurological symptoms and further decreases in the time course of the disease. In AD patients a reduction of NAA/tCr was observed in the medial temporal lobe. Since NAA is exclusively expressed in neurons as shown by immunohistochemical studies, reduced NAA levels suggest neuronal loss or dysfunction in the observed regions. The observed regional metabolic alterations reflect the neuronal basis of the characteristic neurological symptoms in AD (dementia) and MND (muscular palsy) and mirrors the disease progress over time.","['Block W', 'Träber F', 'Flacke S', 'Jessen F', 'Pohl C', 'Schild H']",2002,23,1-3,Amino Acids,"Block W, et al.

DESIGN: We carried out a longitudinal postal survey. The two administrations of the questionnaire were separated by 3 months.
SAMPLE: Subjects were patients diagnosed with ALS/MND and registered with the UK MND Association.
RESULTS: Dimensions of the ALSAQ-40 were shown to have high levels of internal reliability. The ALSAQ-40 was found to be sensitive to changes in self reported overall health state.

12357010,Motor neurone disease.,"Motor neurone disease (MND), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown aetiology. Progressive motor weakness and bulbar dysfunction lead to premature death, usually from respiratory failure. Confirming the diagnosis may initially be difficult until the full clinical features are manifest. For all forms of the disease there is a significant differential diagnosis to consider, including treatable conditions, and therefore specialist neurological opinion should always be sought. Clear genetic inheritance has been demonstrated in a minority of patients with familial ALS but elucidation of the biological basis of genetic subtypes is also providing important information which may lead to treatments for sporadic forms of the disease. In the absence of curative or disease modifying therapy, management is supportive and requires a multidisciplinary approach. If, as seems likely, complex inherited and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of MND, future treatment may involve a combination of molecular based treatments or restoration of cellular integrity using stem cell grafts.",['Talbot K'],2002,78,923,Postgrad Med J,Talbot K.

There was no family history of dementia or motor neuron disease. There was 10 months history of dysarthria and dysphagia. On examination, she showed profound difficulty in articulation. Her comprehension was impaired in that she was unable to obey three-stage command. Her written language was also impaired with phonological spelling errors, syntactic errors, and perseveration. Neuroradiological investigations showed atrophic changes and hypoperfusion of left temporal and bilateral parietal region revealed by MRI and SPECT, respectively. Her subsequent decline was rapid. It might be likely that aphasia is much more common in dementia with bulbar MND than is currently recognized because bulbar palsy might mask the language disorder.","['Hyodo T', 'Ikeda M', 'Ueno S', 'Komori K', 'Hokoishi K', 'Fukuhara R', 'Tanabe H']",2002,54,8,No To Shinkei,"Hyodo T, et al.

Their results have been compared to those obtained by a group of healthy volunteers. The most obvious disclosure was the finding of 4 cases of frontal dementia in the MND group. Apart from that, we demonstrated subtle though evident frontal disruption signs, evidenced by an alteration in language planning, language comprehension, morphosyntactic operations, planning, attention deficit, and abstract reasoning disturbances which got worse during the 15 months of follow-up in all the other subjects. We suggest that a specific and sensitive neurolinguistic and neuropsychological test battery could detect signs of disruption of cognition present even in the sporadic form of MND.

No significant segmental differences in levels of NOS1 immunoreactivity occurred between the two control groups, and differences between cervical, thoracic and lumbar MN of the three subject groups were not significant.

We use immunohistochemistry for PrP, including five monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes and three different pretreatments, alpha-synuclein, phosphorylated tau, beta-amyloid, and ubiquitin. Disease-specific inclusions are devoid of PrP(C) IR. Using double immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy we observe focal overlapping of PrP(C) with tau and with alpha-synuclein in early, but not in fully developed inclusions. However, PrP(C) IR neurons may contain abnormal tau or alpha-synuclein aggregates. Additionally, we observe a loss of PrP(C) IR in anterior horn neurons in MND. Our results suggest that expression of PrP(C) reflects a general response to cellular stress rather than specific co-operation in aggregation of other proteins.","['Kovacs GG', 'Zerbi P', 'Voigtländer T', 'Strohschneider M', 'Trabattoni G', 'Hainfellner JA', 'Budka H']",2002,329,3,Neurosci Lett,"Kovacs GG, et al.

12076411,Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND).,"BACKGROUND: Riluzole has been approved for treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in many countries but not all. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost, modest efficacy and concern over adverse effects.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival, and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Search of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register for randomized trials and enquiry from authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field. The most recent search was May, 2001 SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: randomized trials
TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality as a function of time with riluzole 100 mg and other doses of riluzole; neurologic function, quality of life, muscle strength and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified four eligible randomized trials. Each reviewer graded them for methodological quality. Data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and checked by two others. We obtained some missing data from investigators and regulatory agencies. We performed meta-analyses with Review Manager 4.1 software using a fixed effects model. A test of drug efficacy was based on the Parmar pooled hazard ratio.
MAIN RESULTS: The three trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 876 riluzole treated patients and 406 placebo treated patients. The data for tracheostomy-free survival was not available from the fourth trial. The methodological quality was acceptable and the three trials were easily comparable, although one trial included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (p=0.039, hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.99) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (p=0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) is added, there is evidence of heterogeneity (p<0.0001) and the random effects model, which takes this into account results in the overall treatment effect estimate falling just short of significance (p=0.056, hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.01). This represents a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year (57% in the placebo and 66% in the riluzole group). In secondary analyses of survival at separate time points, there was a significant survival advantage with riluzole 100 mg at six, nine, 12 and 15 months, but not at three or 18 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. There were no data on quality of life, but patients treated with riluzole remained in a more moderately affected health state significantly longer than placebo-treated patients (weighted mean difference 35.5 days, 95% confidence interval 5.9 to 65.0). A threefold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole treated patients than controls (weighted mean difference 2.69, 95% confidence interval 1.65 to 4.38).
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs survival by about two months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. More studies are needed, especially to clarify its effect in older patients (over 75 years), and those with more advanced disease.","['Miller RG', 'Mitchell JD', 'Lyon M', 'Moore DH']",2002,,2,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Miller RG, et al.

12061944,Prognostic modelling of therapeutic interventions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease with a widely varying prognosis. The majority of patients survive about 3 years, but a significant number survive for 10 years or more, leading to problems in clinical trial design.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that simple clinical variables can be used to construct a robust predictive model for survival, and to assess the effect of a known treatment within this model.
METHODS: We carried out a retrospective multivariate modelling of a database of 841 patients with ALS seen over a 10-year period in a specialist motor neuron disorders clinic. The use of riluzole was tested as a prognostic factor within the model.
RESULTS: A prognostic score generated from one cohort of patients predicted survival for a second cohort of patients (r(2) = 0.78). Prognostic variables included site of onset, age of onset, time from symptom onset to diagnosis, and El Escorial category at presentation. Riluzole therapy was an independently significant prognostic factor (relative risk of death 0.48, P < 0.0001, model chi(2) 297, P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical databases can be used to generate multivariate prognostic models in ALS. Such models could be used to predict survival, to improve criteria for matching of patients in future clinical trials, and to test the impact of interventions.","['Turner MR', 'Bakker M', 'Sham P', 'Shaw CE', 'Leigh PN', 'Al-Chalabi A']",2002,3,1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Turner MR, et al.

12056336,Evaluation of postural tremor of finger for neuromuscular diseases and its application to the classification.,"The purpose of this study is to verify the features of the power spectrum of postural tremors for neuromuscular disease patients and to classify the postural tremors. The subjects were 88 neuromuscular disease patients (30 Parkinson disease (PD), 25 cerebellar disease (CER), 7 multiple sclerosis (MS), 7 neuropathy (NEU), 10 motor neuron disease (MND), 9 myopathy (MYO)). The control subjects were 12 normal young persons and 10 normal aged persons. Postural tremor was detected by accelerator sensor. Postural tremor was recorded under the two postural conditions: The subjects maintained the index finger without or with a weight load of 50 g in a horizontal position while looking at a visual target in front of the tip of the index finger. The power spectrum was calculated by an auto-regressive model (AR model). The peak frequency and the peak power were evaluated under the two conditions. Two frequency components of 8-12 Hz and 20-25 Hz appeared in the postural tremor of both normal subjects and neuromuscular disease patients. The difference of the postural tremor between the subjects mainly appeared in the 8-12 Hz component during the postural tremor with a weight load. MYO patients belonged to one group (called as group P1) due to lower peak power, CER patients belonged to one group (called as group P2) due to higher peak power, and PD and MS patients belonged to one group (called as group P3) due to lower peak frequency and higher peak power. NER and MND patients belonged to one group (called as group N which meant normal group). These results suggested that the peak frequency and the peak power of the 8-12 Hz component were changed by the conditions of both spinal reflex system and central nervous system. An oscillator within the central nervous system produced the underlying frequency of 8-12 Hz component, while the amplitude of 8-12 Hz component was governed by both spinal reflex system and central nervous system. In conclusion, the classification of postural tremor for neuromuscular disease patients was a useful index to elucidate the mechanism of tremor oscillation and to assist in clinical diagnosis of neuromuscular disease.","['Makabe H', 'Sakamoto K']",2002,42,4,Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol,Makabe H and Sakamoto K.

12023419,Outcome of ventilatory support for acute respiratory failure in motor neurone disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To review the outcome of acute ventilatory support in patients presenting acutely with respiratory failure, either with an established diagnosis of motor neurone disease (MND) or with a clinical event where the diagnosis of MND has not yet been established.
METHODS: Outcome was reviewed in 24 patients with respiratory failure due to MND who received endotracheal intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation either at presentation or as a result of the unexpected development of respiratory failure. Patients presenting to local hospitals with acute respiratory insufficiency and requiring tracheal intubation, ventilatory support, and admission to an intensive therapy unit (ITU) before transfer to a regional respiratory care unit were selected. Clinical features of presentation, management, and outcome were studied.
RESULTS: 24 patients with MND were identified, all being intubated and ventilated acutely within hours of presentation. 17 patients (71%) were admitted in respiratory failure before the diagnosis of MND had been made; the remaining seven patients (29%) were already known to have MND but deteriorated rapidly such that intubation and ventilation were initiated acutely. Seven patients (29%) died on ITU (between seven and 54 days after admission). 17 patients (71%) were discharged from ITU. 16 patients (67%) received long term respiratory support and one patient required no respiratory support following tracheal extubation. The daily duration of support that was required increased gradually with time.
CONCLUSION: When a patient with MND is ventilated acutely, with or without an established diagnosis, independence from the ventilator is rarely achieved. Almost all of these patients need long term ventilatory support and the degree of respiratory support increases with time as the disease progresses. The aim of management should be weaning the patient to the minimum support compatible with symptomatic relief and comfort. Respiratory failure should be anticipated in patients with MND when the diagnosis has been established.","['Bradley MD', 'Orrell RW', 'Clarke J', 'Davidson AC', 'Williams AJ', 'Kullmann DM', 'Hirsch N', 'Howard RS']",2002,72,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Bradley MD, et al.

12020865,The development of behavioral abnormalities in the motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse.,"The motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse, which has widespread abnormal accumulating lipoprotein and neuronal degeneration, has a mutation in CLN8, the gene for human progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EPMR). EPMR is one of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), a group of neurological disorders characterized by autofluorescent lipopigment accumulation, blindness, seizures, motor deterioration, and dementia. The human phenotype of EPMR suggests that, in addition to the motor symptoms previously categorized, various types of progressive behavioral abnormalities would be expected in mnd mice. We have therefore examined exploratory behavior, fear conditioning, and aggression in 2-3 month and 4-5 month old male mnd mice and age-matched C57BL/6 (B6) controls. The mnd mice displayed increased activity with decreased habituation in the activity monitor, poor contextual and cued memory, and heightened aggression relative to B6 controls. These behavioral deficits were most prominent at 4-5 months of age, which is prior to the onset of gross motor symptoms at 6 months. Our results provide a link from the mutation via pathology to a quantifiable multidimensional behavioral phenotype of this naturally occurring mouse model of NCL.","['Bolivar VJ', 'Scott Ganus J', 'Messer A']",2002,937,1-2,Brain Res,"Bolivar VJ, et al.

12006778,Accuracy of death certificates for motor neuron disease and multiple sclerosis in the province of Palermo in southern Italy.,"Mortality studies based on death certificates (DCs) are relatively inexpensive and easy to conduct. Therefore, they are frequently used to evaluate variations of geographical and temporal patterns, particularly in uncommon diseases. Recent surveys of motor neuron disease (MND) and multiple sclerosis (MS) based on official mortality statistics in Italy showed a decreasing trend of mortality from northern to southern Italy. To evaluate if DCs are homogeneously recorded in Italy and whether or not they can be considered a good instrument for mortality studies, we assessed the accuracy of DCs for MND and MS in the province of Palermo, Italy, and compared our results with those reported in other studies. We searched the archives of the neurological clinic of the University of Palermo for patients affected by one of the two diseases who were residents and were diagnosed in Palermo province. We found 157 patients with definite MND and 360 with clinically definite MS. Seventy-eight out of the 157 MND patients and 43 out of the 360 MS patients had died. Considering the underlying cause of death, the true-positive rate was 48% [95% confidence interval (CI) 36-60%] for MND and 46% (95% Cl 30-62%) for MS. The rates we found for MND were lower than those reported either in Italy or worldwide. This result suggests caution in formulating gradient hypotheses for MND. Concerning MS, the rate we found was low, but similar to that found by others. This indicates that a mortality survey of MS based on DCs is unlikely to be contributory.","['Ragonese P', 'Salemi G', 'Aridon P', 'Conte S', 'Cuccia G', 'Lupo I', 'Savettieri G']",2002,21,3,Neuroepidemiology,"Ragonese P, et al.

We investigated the substantia nigra (SN) in MND cases; two cases of motor neurone disease inclusion body (MND-IB) dementia, six cases of DMND, 14 cases of MND (including one case from Guam and two cases of familial SOD1 mutation), four cases of Parkinson's disease (PD), and 10 cases of age-matched normal controls. SN and spinal cord sections were stained with ubiquitin (alpha-synuclein, tau, PGM1, SMI-31 and SOD1 antibodies). The neuronal density in SN was quantified by using a computer-based image analysis system. Four out of six DMND cases showed rounded ubiquitin positive inclusions with irregular frayed edges, associated with neuronal loss, reactive astrocytosis and a large number of activated microglia cells. These inclusions are negative with antibodies to (alpha-synuclein, tau, SMI-31 and SOD1). The SN in cases from MND-IB dementia and MND showed occasional neuronal loss and no inclusions. The ubiquitin-only inclusions in SN of DMND cases are similar (but not identical) to the ubiquitinated inclusions described previously in the spinal cord of MND cases and are distinct from Lewy bodies (LBs). The degeneration of SN is most likely a primary neurodegenerative process of motor neurone disease type frequently involving the DMND cases. MND disease is a spectrum and multisystem disorder with DMND located at the extreme end of a spectrum affecting the CNS more widely than just the motor system.","['Al-Sarraj S', 'Maekawa S', 'Kibble M', 'Everall I', 'Leigh N']",2002,28,2,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Al-Sarraj S, et al.

11939352,"Anti-LM1 antibodies in the sera of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, and motor neuron disease.","This study is designed to establish whether sialosylneolactotetraosylceramide (LM1), a major component of human peripheral nerve ganglioside, is a potential target antigen for the development of peripheral autoimmune neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). Serum antibodies against LM1 in 116 patients with GBS, 56 patients with MFS, 88 patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and 60 normal control subjects were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The presence of anti-LM1 antibodies were confirmed using an immunostaining method on high-performance thin-layer chromatographic plates (HPTLC). Anti-LM1 IgG antibodies were detected in 22% (25/116) of patients with GBS. The ratio of the demyelination type to the axonal type of GBS was approximately 3:1. Among the 25 anti-LM1-positive GBS patients, additional anti-GM1 IgG antibodies were detected in 7 patients, 4 of whom possessed the axonal form of GBS. Anti-LM1 antibodies were also detected in a significant portion of patients with MFS (20%, 11/56). In contrast, anti-LM1 antibodies were detected in only 2% (2/88) of patients with MND, and 7% (4/60) of normal control subjects. The results of this study suggest that serum antibodies against LM1 may have a pathogenic role in the development of GBS and MFS.","['Harukawa H', 'Utsumi H', 'Asano A', 'Yoshino H']",2002,7,1,J Peripher Nerv Syst,"Harukawa H, et al.

11935270,Motor neuron disease with dementia combined with degeneration of striatonigral and pallidoluysian systems.,"This study concerns an autopsy case of motor neuron disease with dementia (MND-D) that exhibited unusual clinical and neuropathological findings. The patient was a Japanese man without any relevant family history who was 60 years old at the time of death. His clinical manifestation included character change at the age of 54, followed by frozen gait, dysarthria and bradykinesia and he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He gradually developed spastic paresis and died of respiratory failure 6 years after onset of the illness. Neuropathological examinations showed prominent degeneration in the striatonigral and pallidoluysian systems in addition to the neuronal loss and microvacuolation in the second to third layers of the frontal and temporal cortex, the involvement of the upper and lower motor neuron systems and the presence of ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions. To our knowledge, five cases of motor neuron disease (MND) combined with pallido-nigro-luysian atrophy (PNLA) have been reported previously, but the present case is the first report of MND-D combined with the degeneration of the striatonigral and pallidoluysian systems. Such an association may represent more than a coincidental occurrence, and it suggests that MND-D is not simply a disease of the motor neuron system but a multisystem degeneration.","['Sudo S', 'Fukutani Y', 'Matsubara R', 'Sasaki K', 'Shiozawa M', 'Wada Y', 'Naiki H', 'Isaki K']",2002,103,5,Acta Neuropathol,"Sudo S, et al.

11912107,Minocycline prevents neurotoxicity induced by cerebrospinal fluid from patients with motor neurone disease.,"CSF from patients with motor neurone disease (MND) has been reported to be toxic to cultured primary neurones. We found that CSF from MND patients homozygous for the D90A CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) mutation, patients with sporadic MND and patients with familial MND without CuZn-SOD mutations significantly increased apoptosis and reduced phosphorylation of neurofilaments in cultured spinal cord neurones when compared with the effects of CSF from patients with other neurological diseases. Exposure of spinal cord cultures to MND CSF also triggered microglial activation. The toxicity of MND CSF was independent of the presence of the CuZn-SOD mutation, and it did not correlate with gelatinase activity or the presence of immunoglobulin G autoantibodies in the CSF. The concentrations of glutamate, aspartate and glycine in MND CSF were not elevated. Antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid/kainate receptors prevented the toxic CSF-induced neuronal death but not microglial activation, whereas minocycline, a tetracycline derivative with anti-inflammatory potential independent of antimicrobial activity, reduced both the apoptotic neuronal death and microglial activation. We conclude that the cytotoxic action of CSF is prevalent in all MND cases and that microglia may mediate the toxicity of CSF by releasing excitotoxicity-enhancing factors.","['Tikka TM', 'Vartiainen NE', 'Goldsteins G', 'Oja SS', 'Andersen PM', 'Marklund SL', 'Koistinaho J']",2002,125,Pt 4,Brain,"Tikka TM, et al.

11907801,Evidence for pathological involvement of the spinal cord in motor neuron disease-inclusion dementia.,"Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), characterised pathologically by ubiquitinated inclusions in the hippocampal dentate fascia and fronto-temporal cortex, may develop in association with motor neuron disease (MND). However, FTD with identical pathological hallmarks may occur in isolation and has been termed motor neuron disease-inclusion dementia (MND-ID). We studied the pathology of three cases of MND-ID including the spinal cord, which has not previously been examined in this condition. The ages of the patients at death were 53, 70 and 68 years and the onset of FTD 10, 15 and 9 years before death. Neuropathological findings in all cases included micro-vacuolation in cortical layer II and ubiquitinated intraneuronal inclusions in fronto-temporal cortex and hippocampal dentate fascia. One case showed unusual basophilic, ubiquitinated neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the brain stem. Qualitative assessment of the spinal cord was normal in two cases, while the third showed mild pallor of the lateral cortico-spinal tracts and ubiquitinated inclusions in motor neurons typical of MND. Morphometry did not reveal any significant loss or decrease in size of anterior horn motor neurons. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the pathological changes of pure MND and MND-ID form a spectrum and demonstrate that pathological involvement of the motor system may occur in MND-ID without clinical evidence of MND.","['Holton JL', 'Révész T', 'Crooks R', 'Scaravilli F']",2002,103,3,Acta Neuropathol,"Holton JL, et al.

11889831,[An autopsy case of dementia with motor neuron disease accompanying Alzheimer's disease lesion].,"We report the case of a 60-year-old man with autopsy-proven dementia with motor neuron disease (D-MND) and Alzheimer's disease lesion. The patient presented with clumsiness of his right hand at the age of 55 years old and subsequently developed dysarthria, weakness and atrophy of his upper limbs. He was unaffectionate towards his family, repeated the same phrase, and showed severe disorientation of time and place. Neurological examination on admission showed not only diffuse lower motor neuron signs, such as weakness, atrophy, fasciculation and areflexia in both upper limbs, but also dementia (HDS-R 9/30). He died of respiratory insufficiency. Neuropathological examination showed mild atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes and anterior spinal roots. Microscopic examination of cortical sections revealed degenerative changes with simple atrophy and gliosis, and these changes were predominant in layers 1 and 2 of the frontal and temporal cortices. Using immunohistochemical staining, ubiquitin-positive but tau-negative inclusions were frequently found in neurons of the hippocampal granular cell layers and temporal lobes. Many senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were present in all sections of the brain. Our final diagnosis was dementia with motor neuron disease accompanying Alzheimer's disease lesion, because of hypoperfusion in the parietal lobe as well as the frontal lobe demonstrated by SPECT, and the presence of many senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex. Overlapping of pathologically-proven D-MND and Alzheimer's disease lesion is extremely rare, and this case may improve our understanding of the process of neurodegeneration.","['Osoegawa M', 'Takao T', 'Taniwaki T', 'Kikuchi H', 'Arakawa K', 'Furuya H', 'Iwaki T', 'Kira J']",2001,41,8,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Osoegawa M, et al.

11847479,Tumor necrosis factor and motoneuronal degeneration: an open problem.,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various central nervous system diseases with an inflammatory component. Elevated TNF levels were observed in animal models of motor neuron disease (MND), and activation of the TNF system has been reported in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The easy availability of scientific reports to the layman through the web, often based only on the abstracts, has prompted many patients to ask whether anti-TNF therapy might be beneficial in ALS. This review discusses the possible role of TNF in motoneuronal degeneration. Although TNF is mostly regarded as neurotoxic cytokine, there are reports of a neuroprotective and neurotrophic action. Studies with animal models of ALS are not sufficient to show whether TNF has a pathogenic or a protective role in MND though anti-TNF antibodies have shown protective effects in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). On the other hand, while TNF-deficient mice are protected from EAE, anti-TNF antibodies worsen the disease in MS patients, suggesting caution in extrapolating preliminary basic studies to the patient.","['Ghezzi P', 'Mennini T']",2001,9,4,Neuroimmunomodulation,Ghezzi P and Mennini T.

11846819,Service use and needs of people with motor neurone disease and their carers in Scotland.,"A national study of patients with motor neurone disease (MND) and their carers was conducted in Scotland in late 1996. A questionnaire covering areas such as: use of medical, social and voluntary services; use of or waiting for specialised equipment; satisfaction with provided services; and standard demographic data was used in face-to-face interviews conducted by the four Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association care advisers. The care advisers also assessed the respondent's level of impairment, using a standard instrument: the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Severity Scale (ALSSS). The data was analysed using SPSS-PC. In total 153 people participated (response rate 92%), and as expected with this patient group the study recruited more men (57%) than women. Sixty per cent of the sample was severely disabled as measured on the ALSSS. Health services did not meet the needs of respondents in 19% of the cases and social services failed to do so according to 24% of respondents. Eighty per cent of patients with MND had an identified carer. Nearly four out of 10 of these carers had their sleep disturbed regularly, and nearly a quarter of them would have liked to have more help. In addition, differences were found in service provision between the East and West of Scotland, and consequently differences in respondent's perceptions about the extent to which needs were met. As found in similar studies, the formal health and social care sectors in conjunction with voluntary organisations are only partially managing the trajectory of patients with a rare progressive degenerative disease.","['van Teijlingen ER', 'Friend E', 'Kamal AD']",2001,9,6,Health Soc Care Community,"van Teijlingen ER, et al.

11817274,Medical technology assessment. Electrodiagnosis in motor neuron diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"In motor neuron diseases/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND-ALS), electrodiagnostic techniques are essential in supporting the diagnosis and excluding other conditions that clinically resemble MND-ALS. Electrodiagnostic techniques can also monitor disease progression and provide prognostic information. Electromyography has an important role in the diagnosis of MND-ALS, but some drawbacks should be borne in mind. Although internationally accepted electrophysiological criteria have been defined to support MND-ALS diagnosis, differences in different laboratories can raise unexpected difficulties in application of diagnosis criteria. Much work needs to be done to increase standardisation of the electrodiagnosis of MND-ALS in order to improve quality. Differential diagnosis with motor axonal neuropathies may be particularly difficult. EMG is an essential tool for the early diagnosis of MND-ALS, which increases potential benefit of therapeutic interventions. A wide discussion among neurophysiologists from different schools could create a sound consensus on early diagnosis of MND-ALS.","['de Carvalho M', 'Johnsen B', 'Fuglsang-Frederiksen A']",2001,31,5,Neurophysiol Clin,"de Carvalho M, et al.

11687111,Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND).,"BACKGROUND: Riluzole has been approved for treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in some countries but not others. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost, modest efficacy and concern over adverse effects.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival, and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Search of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register for randomized trials and enquiry from authors of trials and other experts in the field. The most recent search was conducted in June 1999.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: randomized trials
TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: adults with a diagnosis of ALS Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: per cent mortality at 12 months with riluzole 100 mg Secondary: per cent mortality as a function of time with 100 mg and with all doses of riluzole, scales of neurologic function, quality of life, muscle strength and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified two randomized trials. Each reviewer graded them for methodological quality. Data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and checked by the other two. We obtained some missing data from investigators. We performed meta-analyses with RevMan software using a fixed effects model.
MAIN RESULTS: The two eligible trials included a total of 794 riluzole treated patients and 320 placebo treated patients. The methodological quality was acceptable and the trials were easily comparable. There were significant differences between the riluzole and placebo groups of both trials, in terms of the primary outcome measure, which was per cent mortality at 12 months with the 100 mg dose of riluzole. The odds ratio for the combined studies was 0.57 (95%CI 0.41 to 0.80) at 12 months. In the secondary outcome measures, there was a survival advantage with riluzole 100 mg at six, nine, 12 and 15 months, but not at three or 18 months. Pooled data from the 50, 100 and 200mg dose groups in the larger trial showed a lower per cent mortality with riluzole compared to placebo only at 12 months (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88). There was no beneficial effect on bulbar function, or muscle strength. There were scant data on quality of life, but patients treated with riluzole remained in a more moderately affected health state significantly longer than placebo-treated patients (weighted mean difference (WMD) 35.5 days, 95% CI 5.9 to 65.0). A threefold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole treated patients than controls (WMD 2.65, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.65).
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg per day appears to be modestly effective in prolonging survival for patients with ALS.","['Miller RG', 'Mitchell JD', 'Moore DH']",2001,,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Miller RG, et al.

11679087,Ubiquitin immunoreactivity in presumed spinal interneurones in motor neurone disease.,"Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of ubiquitin-immunoreactivity (Ub-IR) as inclusions and skeins in motor neurones of both the familial and sporadic forms of motor neurone disease (MND). There is evidence that interneurones also degenerate in MND, but Ub-IR in ventral horn spinal interneurones has not been studied previously. Here, Ub-IR was investigated in 1445 presumed interneurones and 1086 presumed motor neurones counted in three random 20-microm sections of the ventral horn of the third lumbar segment of the spinal cord of each of seven controls and seven patients with MND. The ventral horn was divided into four quadrants; the dorsomedial quadrant contains almost exclusively interneurones and the ventrolateral quadrant largely motor neurones. The neurones were also classified by morphological and size criteria into presumed interneurones (< 25 microm) and presumed motor neurones (>or= 25 microm). Ub-IR was classified as inclusions, skeins and dispersed cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. Ub-IR inclusions or skeins were not observed in the controls but 6.6% of neurones (motor neurones and interneurones) showed the presence of dispersed cytoplasm staining and nuclear staining. The incidence of Ub-IR cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was significantly greater in both motor neurones and interneurones of MND patients than controls. Ub-IR was less frequent in MND cases in which a great loss of neurones was observed. Ub-IR was significantly more frequent in motor neurones than interneurones, both in patients and controls. Ub-IR inclusions and skeins were only observed in motor neurones from MND patients. Ub-IR inclusions were not observed in presumed spinal interneurones, while skeins were only seen in three out of 565 of these cells (two of them in the dorsomedial quadrant) in two out of seven patients. Thus, although presumed spinal interneurones occasionally revealed Ub-IR features similar to motor neurones, the rare staining of Ub-IR skeins and the lack of Ub-IR inclusions in interneurones in MND suggests that these neurones only occasionally form ubiquitin-protein conjugates. Neuronal size, rather than type, may be important in determining whether ubiquitin-protein conjugates form in the ventral horn neurones in MND.","['Stephens B', 'Navarrete R', 'Guiloff RJ']",2001,27,5,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Stephens B, et al.

11677001,Incidence and predictors of PEG placement in ALS/MND.,"In the Project on Death in America ALS cohort, 121 patients were followed to examine the timing of key milestones in the course of the disease, such as tracheostomy and PEG placement. During the 2- to 4-year follow-up period, 26.5% of patients received PEG, yielding a cumulative incidence of 48%. PEG placement occurred, on average, 16 months after patients received confirmation of the diagnosis at our Center. Patients who received PEG were more likely to have tracheostomies than patients not using PEG (p<0.01). In multivariate proportional hazard models that included both sociodemographic and disease indicators, the strongest predictor of PEG use was a patient's baseline preference for PEG: 57.1% of patients ""absolutely in favor"" went on to have PEG, compared to only 9.3% of those ""absolutely against"" (p<0.01). PEG users were more likely to have initiated health care proxies. These findings suggest that patients who use PEG may be consistently proactive in the face of the disease.","['Albert SM', 'Murphy PL', 'Del Bene M', 'Rowland LP', 'Mitsumoto H']",2001,191,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Albert SM, et al.

Current practice parameters recommend that the decision to begin treatment be based upon forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements. A prospective, randomized study was performed in 20 ALS patients who had an FVC of 70-100%. Patients received baseline assessments including: ALS functional rating scale-respiratory version (ALSFRS-R), pulmonary symptom scale, Short form 36 (SF-36), FVC%, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and nocturnal oximetry. Patients were randomized to receive NPPV based upon nocturnal oximetry studies suggesting oxygen desaturation <90% for one cumulative minute (""early intervention"") or a FVC <50% (""standard of care""). At enrollment, there was no significant correlation between FVC% and the ALSFRS-R, symptom score, MEP, MIP, or duration of nocturnal desaturation <90%. An increase in the vitality subscale of the SF-36 was demonstrated in 5/6 patients randomized to ""early intervention"" with NPPV. Our data indicate that FVC% correlates poorly with respiratory symptoms and suggests that MIP and nocturnal oximetry may be more sensitive measures of early respiratory insufficiency. In addition, intervention with NPPV earlier than our current standard of care may result in improved quality of life.","['Jackson CE', 'Rosenfeld J', 'Moore DH', 'Bryan WW', 'Barohn RJ', 'Wrench M', 'Myers D', 'Heberlin L', 'King R', 'Smith J', 'Gelinas D', 'Miller RG']",2001,191,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Jackson CE, et al.

11676986,The epidemiology of motor neuron diseases: a review of recent studies.,"As the incidence and mortality rates of motor neuron diseases (MNDs) have been reported to increase steadily over the 1950s-1980s decades, we compared the results of the most recent studies (1990s decade) with the ones reported for those earlier periods. The relevant literature was retrieved on a keyword basis from online medical and official death statistics databases. Fifteen European and North American studies were analyzed, for comparison with the results reported in review papers. The 1990s incidence and mortality rates of MND average at 1.89 per 100,000/year and 1.91 per 100,000/year, respectively, thus yielding increases of 46% and 57% over the 1960s-1970s decades, respectively. This increase appears mainly due to Southern Europe countries, to female gender and to patients aged 75 years and over.Thus, the results of this analysis (i) confirm that the incidence of, and mortality from, MNDs continued to increase during the 1990s and, (ii) suggest that this increase could be partly due to increased life expectancy.

11675878,Validity of hospital discharge diagnoses for the assessment of the prevalence and incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"INTRODUCTION: As amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurological disorder, many sources must be investigated for complete case ascertainment. Hospital discharge diagnoses (HDDs) are a source of administrative data for patients hospitalized for a given disease. The accuracy of HDDs was tested, to assess whether they could be used to trace patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHODS: All the HDDs referring to patients with motor neuron disease (MND) (ICD-9 code 335.2) were identified from primary hospital discharge diagnoses made during the years 1994-95 in six target provinces of the Lombardy region in Northern Italy (total population 2922920). The medical records of the patients were reviewed and each patient was then accepted or rejected according to whether he/she did or did not satisfy the El Escorial criteria for the diagnosis of ALS. The ALS discharge diagnoses filed in the study period in the neurology departments of all the regional hospitals were the 'gold standard'. Newly diagnosed patients registered during the year 1998 in the same provinces served for the calculation of the incidence of the disease. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were calculated. Data were presented separately for all the patients and those who were indicated as first hospital admissions.
RESULTS: During the study period a total of 1012122 hospital discharge records were coded in the six index provinces. The ICD-9 code 335.2 was reported in 408 of these (0.04%). These discharge diagnoses were made in 267 patients, 245 of whom were resident in Lombardy at the time of hospital admission. The hospital records of 237 cases were examined. In 95 of these the medical records showed a diagnosis other than ALS. Other motor neuron diseases were listed for 50 patients. Thirteen additional cases were traced through neurology department files. The sensitivity of the HDDs was 91.6%, the specificity 99.9%, the positive predictive value 65.4%. The corresponding values for first-hospitalized patients were 97.7, 99.9, and 37.3. The overall ALS incidence rate obtained from the HDDs was 2.1 per 100000 (95% CI 1.3-3.3). he corresponding rate calculated after exclusion of the false positives and inclusion of the false negatives was 0.8 (95% CI 0.1-2.1) and that obtained using the 1998 cases registered in the same areas was 1.6 (95% CI 0.7-2.7).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of ALS is overestimated when HDDs are used for the estimate. Nevertheless, with improved quality, administrative data could be useful for the estimate of prevalence and incidence.","['Beghi E', 'Logroscino G', 'Micheli A', 'Millul A', 'Perini M', 'Riva R', 'Salmoiraghi F', 'Vitelli E', 'Italian ALS Registry Study Group']",2001,2,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Beghi E, et al.

11673323,A clinical and pathological study of motor neurone disease on Guam.,"Despite over 40 years of intensive study, the cause of the high incidence of motor neurone disease (MND) on Guam, and the relationship between this disease and MND seen in the rest of the world are still uncertain. We present a series of 45 cases of Guamanian MND, which reaffirm the clinical similarity between this disease and MND seen in other countries. However, the occurrence of MND among the indigenous Chamorros of Guam is distinguished by four factors: (i) high prevalence; (ii) frequent familial occurrence; (iii) co-occurrence with the parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC); and (iv) association with an unusual and distinctive linear retinopathy termed Guam retinal pigment epitheliopathy (GRPE). These distinguishing factors were not present in four non-Chamorros who resided on Guam when their MND symptoms occurred. Pathologically, the classical features of MND were seen in Guamanian Chamorro cases including ubiquitin inclusions. Neurofibrillary tangles were frequently seen. The neurofibrillary tangles appeared in the same distribution as described in the PDC but, unlike classical PDC, they were not usually associated with cell loss and occurred less frequently. While neurofibrillary tangle formation and the clinicopathological syndrome of MND may occur in parallel, observations from this series suggest that pathologically classical MND on Guam may occur independently of neurofibrillary degeneration and the clinical features of PDC.","['Morris HR', 'Al-Sarraj S', 'Schwab C', 'Gwinn-Hardy K', 'Perez-Tur J', 'Wood NW', 'Hardy J', 'Lees AJ', 'McGeer PL', 'Daniel SE', 'Steele JC']",2001,124,Pt 11,Brain,"Morris HR, et al.

11668883,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: current understanding.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or motor neuron disease (MND) as it is usually termed in the United Kingdom, is a fatal degenerative disease resulting in progressive weakness and wasting of voluntary muscles. The disease is caused by degeneration of upper motor neurons in the motor cortex and of lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. This combined loss of function causes spastic paralysis, flaccid muscle weakness, wasting, and fasciculations. The disease process spares the sensory, autonomic, and oculomotor neurons. ALS is the most common of the MND syndromes in adults. Although the cause of ALS is unknown, there is evidence that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate plays an important role in neuronal cell death in the disease. Several risk factors, such as exposure to welding and soldering, inhalation of lead vapor, exposure to chemicals, and electrical trauma are postulated as contributing to the pathogenesis of ALS. About 90% of all ALS patients have the sporadic form. Approximately 20% of all familial ALS cases are associated with mutations of the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase-1 gene. What is not clear is what factors contribute to the causation of the more common sporadic cases. The drug riluzole has neuroprotective effects in ALS and is the only disease-specific treatment available to date. Riluzole has been approved by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence for use in the National Health Service of the United Kingdom. Other treatments are aimed at managing the devastating symptoms of ALS.","['Charles T', 'Swash M']",2001,33,5,J Neurosci Nurs,Charles T and Swash M.

11642685,Assessing individual quality of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) assessment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has typically involved the use of general or disease-specific health status questionnaires. This study assessed the feasibility of using a patient-centered approach to QoL measurement in ALS.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To assess the internal consistency reliability and validity of the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life (SEIQoL) as a measure of QoL in ALS. (2) To provide a brief description of QoL in ALS, and to examine the relationships between QoL, illness severity and psychological distress in this group.
METHODS: Twenty-six patients with ALS were recruited through the Irish Register for ALS/motor neurone disease (MND). Illness severity was assessed with the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS). Levels of psychological distress were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Individual QoL was assessed with SEIQoL.
RESULTS: Patients were at various stages of ALS. Mean levels of anxiety and depression were in the normal range. Twenty-one patients completed SEIQoL; five patients completed a shorter version, SEIQoL-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW). Internal consistency reliability and validity results for SEIQoL were high.
CONCLUSIONS: SEIQoL is generally acceptable for use in ALS in terms of its practical feasibility, and has high internal validity and consistency reliability in this patient group. However, patients severely disabled by ALS may not be able to complete SEIQoL; further research is required to confirm the use of SEIQoL-DW as an alternative measure of individual QoL in ALS.","['Clarke S', 'Hickey A', ""O'Boyle C"", 'Hardiman O']",2001,10,2,Qual Life Res,"Clarke S, et al.

11563638,Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study of basophilic inclusions in adult-onset motor neuron disease.,"We immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally studied basophilic inclusions (BI) in a patient with adult-onset sporadic motor neuron disease (MND). BI were frequently observed not only in degenerated anterior horn cells, such as central chromatolytic neurons, but also in normal-appearing large anterior horn neurons. They had various shapes, round, elliptical or irregular, and occasionally they had distinct basophilic rims. They also varied in size. There were no halos around them nor core in their centers. Immunohistochemically, some BI were immunostained for ubiquitin or SOD1, but BI were not immunoreactive with anti-phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI 31), phosphorylated tau, cystatin C or Golgi (MG-160) antibodies. Ubiquitin-positive skein-like inclusions (SI) were occasionally observed in the somata of anterior horn neurons. Ultrastructurally, BI consisted of filamentous structures associated with granules, which were attached to thick filaments. The thick filaments were straight without constriction or side arms and their diameter was twice that of the neurofilaments. BI occasionally contained tubular structures among the granule-associated filaments. The granulo-filamentous profiles varied from being compactly arranged to being more loosely packed. The structure of BI resembles that of the Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions (LBHI) observed in sporadic MND patients. Bundles of filaments resembling SI, which were composed of compactly packed filaments without fine granules running parallel to the longitudinal axis, were frequently observed inside or at the periphery of BI, and occasionally clustered in the perikarya. Each filament measured approximately 15-25 nm in diameter, and a bundle of these grouped filaments was sometimes surrounded by a unit membrane. We also occasionally observed in-between structures of BI and bundles of filaments resembling SI. These findings suggest a certain relationship between BI, SI and LBHI in the pathomechanism of BI development. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether sporadic adult-onset MND characterized by BI forms a different subtype of MND.","['Sasaki S', 'Toi S', 'Shirata A', 'Yamane K', 'Sakuma H', 'Iwata M']",2001,102,2,Acta Neuropathol,"Sasaki S, et al.

A monoclonal paraproteinemia is frequently described in the serum of subjects with motor neuron disease. The association between motor neuron disease (MND) and lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) could be the result of a coincidence, but LPD seems to be disproportionally frequent in patients with MND, compared to the population in general. The literature has studied the time relationship between lymphoproliferative disease and MND and has examined the different possible mechanisms, which might explain the association between MND and LPD. The presence of a slight increase in the level of IgM and kappa chains in a patient with polyneuropathy induced us to carry out an aspiration and trephine bone marrow biopsies, which revealed the presence of a lymphoplasmocytoid infiltration, compatible with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. A needle biopsy should be carried out as part of a diagnostic routine procedure in a patient with MND, especially in the presence of a monoclonal paraproteinemia.","['Di Saverio A', 'Quaglino D']",2001,92,9,Recenti Prog Med,Di Saverio A and Quaglino D.

11528013,Venous serum chloride and bicarbonate measurements in the evaluation of respiratory function in motor neuron disease.,"Respiratory failure, with or without pneumonia, is the usual cause of death in patients with motor neuron disease (MND). Forced vital capacity (FVC) is often used to monitor respiratory function in MND and is, in part, predictive of survival time. However, such volitional tests are unreliable in many patients, especially later in the disease, and access to hospital laboratories can also be a problem for some disabled patients. We assessed the use of domiciliary venous serum chloride and bicarbonate measurements in evaluating respiratory function in MND. Newly-diagnosed MND patients (n=23) were followed-up at home every 3 months for up to 15 months. Respiratory symptoms were measured using a questionnaire, and FVC was documented. Venous serum chloride and bicarbonate were also measured. One patient had symptoms of airway obstruction disease, and was excluded from the analysis. Ten patients developed abnormally low chloride (mean 95, range 88-97, reference interval 98-107 mmol/l) and an abnormally high bicarbonate (mean 33, range 31-37, reference interval 22-30 mmol/l) during follow-up, of whom eight died within the next 5 (mean 2.2, range 0.5-5) months; two were still alive at the end of the study but had developed respiratory symptoms. Twelve patients had normal chloride and bicarbonate during follow-up: all were still alive at 15 months, all had a FVC of >50% predicted, and only one had respiratory symptoms at their last assessment. Raised bicarbonate and low chloride were associated with the presence of respiratory symptoms suggesting respiratory muscle weakness. Venous serum chloride and bicarbonate potentially can provide useful information about respiratory status and prognosis in MND patients.","['Hadjikoutis S', 'Wiles CM']",2001,94,9,QJM,Hadjikoutis S and Wiles CM.

11467049,Quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the subcortical white matter in motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the authors have previously demonstrated a reduction in the N-acetyl aspartate/(creatine and phosphocreatine) (NAA/(Cr + PCr)) ratio in the motor region in bulbar-onset MND patients, attributed to neuronal loss or dysfunction leading to a reduction in NAA. We have expanded this analysis to evaluate absolute concentrations of NAA, (Cr + PCr) and choline-containing compounds (Cho) in the subcortical white matter in the motor region in 16 MND patients (8 with bulbar onset and 8 with limb onset) and 8 healthy, age-matched controls.
METHODS: Single voxel 1H-MRS was performed using a PRESS localization sequence. Metabolite concentrations were determined using the water signal as an internal standard.
RESULTS: We found no differences in the concentrations of NAA ([NAA]), (Cr + PCr) ([Cr + PCr]) or Cho ([Cho]) in the motor region on comparing the total MND group and controls (P > 0.3). No difference was found in [NAA] in the bulbar-onset group compared with the limb-onset group (P = 0.70), but [Cr + PCr] was significantly higher in the bulbar-onset group (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that [Cr + PCr] may be affected by the pathological process in MND, and this should be considered in the interpretation of metabolite peak area ratios. The elevated (Cr + PCr) may represent gliosis in the subcortical white matter in the motor cortex region.","['Ellis CM', 'Simmons A', 'Glover A', 'Dawson JM', 'Williams SC', 'Leigh PN']",2000,1,2,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Ellis CM, et al.

11465930,Examining the evidence about treatment in ALS/MND.,"The application of evidence-based medicine to the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is just beginning. A small number of systematic reviews analyzing the pertinent evidence, grading the methodology and formulating recommendations to guide clinical decision-making have begun to appear. The American Academy of Neurology practice parameters for informing the patient and managing nutritional and respiratory issues and palliative care are discussed. In addition, the first systematic review in the field of ALS/MND from the Cochrane collaboration concerns riluzole treatment and this meta-analysis is also described. Some of the most important recommendations that have the potential to significantly prolong survival and enhance quality of life are the early institution of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for patients with significant dysphagia, and the initiation of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for patients with symptoms of early respiratory insufficiency. Assertive treatment of pain and dyspnea are also strongly recommended for patients with ALS. The North American ALS patient database, ALS C.A.R.E., is also described as a methodology for measuring clinical outcomes, and some early results are presented.

11465929,Cognitive impairment in motor neuron disease with bulbar onset.,"METHODS: Twenty-three patients with bulbar onset motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS) were clinically assessed. They subsequently underwent serial neuropsychological testing, event-related potentials (ERP) and SPECT studies. Cognitive impairment was defined by clinical evidence of dementia (DSM-IV and frontal evaluation) or by significant alteration indicated by neuropsychological testing (excluding patients with depression and major anxiety), or both.
RESULTS: Eleven patients (48%) were found to be cognitively impaired. Abnormalities indicated fronto-temporal involvement, with memory impairment, alteration of judgement and reasoning, reduced speech, behavioural dyscontrol and alteration of daily living activities. This impairment correlated well with event-related potentials and SPECT studies. Event-related potentials were the most sensitive test as 100% of the impaired patients had abnormal ERP (p = 0.04). The cognitively impaired group differed from the other group mainly by gender ratio (male/female) with an important male predominance: 1.75 vs. 0.33. MND/ALS was also more severe when cognitive decline was present.
CONCLUSION: This study adds further arguments for a cognitive impairment in MND/ALS. This also reinforces the hypothesis that there is continuum between MND/ALS and fronto-temporal lobe dementia.","['Portet F', 'Cadilhac C', 'Touchon J', 'Camu W']",2001,2,1,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Portet F, et al.

The hypothesis of the existence of immunologically treatable MND was reinforced by the occasional report of MND patients responding to immune or cytostatic therapies and by the identification among those with a purely lower motor neuron syndrome (LMNS) of a motor neuropathy, presently known as multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), which almost invariably responded to immune therapies. These observations have led to several attempts to treat patients with MND or LMNS, either idiopathic or associated with the above mentioned conditions, with a number of immune or cytostatic therapies. The aim of this review is to verify whether the available data provide enough evidence to support the concept of dysimmune MND and to justify the use in these patients of potentially harmful immune cytostatic therapies.","['Nobile-Orazio E', 'Carpo M', 'Meucci N']",2001,2 Suppl 1,,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Nobile-Orazio E, et al.

11464954,Oral administration of creatine monohydrate retards progression of motor neuron disease in the wobbler mouse.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Creatine has a neuroprotective effect in mutant superoxide dismutase (G93A) transgenic mice, an animal model of motor neuron disease (MND). Treatment with creatine monohydrate enhances muscle strength in patients with neuromuscular disorders. The purpose of our study was to determine whether administration of creatine monohydrate can attenuate progressive disease in wobbler mice.
METHODS: After an initial diagnosis of disease at the age of 3-4 weeks, creatine monohydrate (5 or 50 mg/kg, po) or vehicle was given to wobbler mice daily for 4 weeks in a blinded fashion. We compared symptomatic and neuropathological assessments among the three groups.
RESULTS: Creatine levels in biceps muscles were increased by approximately 20% following administration of higher-dose creatine monohydrate. In comparison with vehicle, treatment with higher doses of creatine monohydrate potentiated grip strength, attenuated forelimb contracture and increased the weight of biceps muscles. Mice treated with higher doses of creatine monohydrate showed retarded denervation muscle atrophy in the biceps muscles and reduced degeneration of the spinal motor neurons. Thus, oral administration of creatine monohydrate delayed the progression of disease in wobbler mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that this molecule may have therapeutic potential in human motor neuropathy or MND.","['Ikeda K', 'Iwasaki Y', 'Kinoshita M']",2000,1,3,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,"Ikeda K, et al.

11464936,Positron emission tomography (PET)--its potential to provide surrogate markers in ALS.,"Positron emission tomography (PET) has enabled us to study the human brain with unrivalled sensitivity, and has already established its place in the research of neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. PET has been used as a tool in the study of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) for well over ten years now, but its potential in diagnosis and to identify surrogate markers of disease expression (phenotype) and progression has yet to be fully realized. The early studies using 2-18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to measure regional changes in cerebral metabolic rate for glucose gave the first clues to the more widespread involvement of the brain in MND. Later studies exploited the development of activation studies using 15O-containing tracers, which allowed correlation with neuropsychological measures, and the refinement of mapping techniques to delineate the extra-motor areas involved in the disease process. More recently, studies involving ligands such as 11C-flumazenil have allowed the exploration of functional reorganisation in MND, and inhibitory interneuronal pathways which may be crucial in modulation of disease expression. In the future new ligands will be applied in combination with other modalities of investigation (multimodal magnetic resonance imaging; neurophysiological studies) in order to understand the pathophysiology of this heterogeneous condition. Although the potential of PET has not yet been realized in ALS, it is likely to play a part in defining new diagnostic and surrogate markers of disease extent and severity.","['Turner MR', 'Leigh PN']",2000,1 Suppl 2,,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord,Turner MR and Leigh PN.

11460878,A review of xenobiotic metabolism enzymes in Parkinson's disease and motor neuron disease.,"The role of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes (XMEs) in disease aetiology has been under investigation by numerous researchers around the world for the last two decades. The association of a number of defects in both phase I and phase II reactions with Parkinson's disease (PD) and motor neuron disease (MND) have been extensively studied. This review of the work of the group based initially at the University of Birmingham into the functional genomics of XMEs and neurodegenerative diseases has indicated that: 1. Sub-groups of patients with PD and MND can be identified with problems in xenobiotic metabolism by in vivo or in vitro methods. 2. 38-39% of the patients with MND/PD have a defect in the S-oxidation of the mucoactive drug, carbocysteine, by an unknown cytosolic oxidase(s). The odds risk ratio for the association of this defect with these diseases was calculated to be 10.21 for MND and 10.50 for PD. 3. Patients with PD appear to have an altered substrate specificity for monoamine oxidase B substrates in an in vitro platelet assay. 4. Patients with MND have an increased capacity to S-methylate aliphatic sulphydryl compounds in an in vivo challenge as well as an in vitro erythrocyte thiol methyltransferase assay. The results of over a decade of investigations into both PD and MND indicate that these are diseases with mutifactorial origins that encompass both genetic predisposition and environmental insult.","['Steventon GB', 'Sturman S', 'Waring RH', 'Williams AC']",2001,18,2,Drug Metabol Drug Interact,"Steventon GB, et al.

11442326,Atypical motor neuron disease and related motor syndromes.,"There is an imperative need for the early diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) in the current era of emerging treatments. When evaluating the patient with ALS/MND, the neurologist must consider a number of other motor neuron disorders and related motor syndromes that may have clinical features resembling ALS/MND. The revised Airlie House-El Escorial diagnostic criteria have been established through the consensus of experts meeting at workshops. However, by definition, using these criteria a patient is likely to have fairly advanced disease at the time of a definitive ALS/MND diagnosis. The reasons for the difficulty in making an early ALS/MND diagnosis are several. No surrogate diagnostic marker currently exists for ALS/MND. ALS/MND at its onset is heterogeneous in clinical presentation, its clinical course is variable, and several clinical variants are recognized. In addition, certain motor syndromes, such as monomelic amyotrophy, postpolio muscular atrophy, and multifocal motor neuropathy, can clinically mimic ALS/MND. Therefore, not only may the diagnosis of ALS/MND be clinically missed in the early stages, but worse, the patient may be wrongly labeled as having ALS/MND. The diagnosis of ALS/MND requires a combination of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement. Motor syndromes in which the deficit is restricted to the UMN or LMN through the entire course of the disease are described as atypical MND in this review. Approximately 5% of patients with ALS/MND have overt dementia with a characteristic frontal affect. ALS/MND with parkinsonism and dementia is rare outside the western Pacific region. The clinical course of motor disorder in these overlap syndromes does not differ from that in typical ALS/MND.","['Verma A', 'Bradley WG']",2001,21,2,Semin Neurol,Verma A and Bradley WG.

11439170,Disturbances in the peripheral T-cell repertoire of patients with motor neuron disease: high levels of activation and indirect evidence of superantigen.,"Our data on peripheral blood T cells from Motor neuron disease (MND) patients indicate major immunological disturbances linked to this disease. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets display an increased fraction of cells showing activation markers compared to controls, indicating an unusually high level of activity in both populations. Likewise, an increased number of T-cell expansions were noted in MND patients compared to controls, most dramatically observed in the CD4+ T-cell subset, where 5/144 T-cell V genes analyzed in eight subjects turned out to be expanded in the peripheral blood. In the CD8+ T-cell subset, four out of eight MND patients had peripheral BV gene expansions, 9/144 V genes analyzed. However, the most interesting result was the observation that in three out eight MND patients, expansions concerning the same BV gene were present in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets (BV8S1 in two and BV12S1 in one patient). Parallel expansions of BV-gene restricted populations in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets in the same individual, in an major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted manner, are normally limited to situations where superantigens are involved. No known superantigen has to date been described with the capacity to simultaneously stimulate both BV8S1 and BV12S1, suggesting that the postulated 'MND-associated' superantigen is a hitherto undefined molecule.","['Katchar K', 'Osorio L', 'Conradi S', 'Wigzell H', 'Gigliotti D']",2001,54,1-2,Scand J Immunol,"Katchar K, et al.

11374089,"Motor neurone disease, dementia and aphasia: coincidence, co-occurrence or continuum?","Cognitive, and particularly aphasic, symptoms associated with motor neurone disease (MND) are still frequently described as rare and ""recently discovered"". This review demonstrates that the association between MND and dementia was described and recognised as an entity as early as 1929, and its close relationship to Pick's disease was postulated in 1932. Changes in language production and comprehension were also observed by early authors, although they were rarely described as aphasia. The striking similarity to the contemporary descriptions is, however, sometimes obscured by diverging terminology. The syndromes of MND/dementia and MND/aphasia are well established but represent a comparatively small subgroup of MND. In addition, subtle cognitive alterations have also been reported in non-demented MND patients; most studies have found evidence of frontal-executive dysfunction, similar in pattern, but much milder than in patients with frank MND/dementia. These findings are strengthened further by post-mortem studies demonstrating pathological changes in the frontal lobes, and functional neuroimaging studies, showing reduced frontal activation. The issue of whether memory, visuospatial skills and language are affected in non-demented subjects remains, however, controversial. Further studies are required to establish whether MND/dementia and MND/aphasia form separate disease entities or can be viewed as extreme forms of a cognitive deficit characteristic of MND in general.","['Bak TH', 'Hodges JR']",2001,248,4,J Neurol,"Bak TH and Hodges JR.

11360260,Effects of cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) in a mouse motor neuron disease.,"Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) has potent survival-promoting effects on motor neurons in vitro and in vivo and may be effective in treating motor neuron diseases (MND). We investigated the effects of CT-1 treatment in wobbler mouse MND. Wobbler mice were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneously injected CT-1 (1 mg/kg, n = 18, in two experiments) or vehicle (n = 18, in two experiments) daily, 6 times/week for 4 weeks after clinical diagnosis at age 3 to 4 weeks. Cardiotrophin-1 treatment prevented deterioration in paw position and walking pattern abnormalities. Grip strength declined steadily in the vehicle group, whereas in the CT-1 group it declined at week 1 but increased thereafter to exceed baseline strength by 5% (P = 0.0002) at week 4. Running speed was faster with CT-1 (P = 0.007). Biceps muscle twitch tension, muscle weight, mean muscle fiber diameter, and intramuscular axonal sprouting were significantly greater with CT-1 treatment than with vehicle treatment. Histometry revealed a trend that indicated CT-1 modestly increased the number of immunoreactive motor neurons, as determined by both choline acetyltransferase and c-Ret antibodies, and reduced the number of phosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactive perikarya (P = 0.05). The number of large myelinated motor axons significantly increased with treatment (206 versus 113, P = 0.01). We conclude that CT-1 exerts myotrophic effects as well as neurotrophic effects in a mouse model of spontaneous MND, a finding that has potential therapeutic implications for human MND.","['Mitsumoto H', 'Klinkosz B', 'Pioro EP', 'Tsuzaka K', 'Ishiyama T', ""O'Leary RM"", 'Pennica D']",2001,24,6,Muscle Nerve,"Mitsumoto H, et al.

11328190,Respiratory complications related to bulbar dysfunction in motor neuron disease.,"Bulbar dysfunction resulting from corticobulbar pathway or brainstem neuron degeneration is one of the most important clinical problems encountered in motor neuron disease (MND) and contributes to various respiratory complications which are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Chronic malnutrition as a consequence of bulbar muscle weakness may have a considerable bearing on respiratory muscle function and survival. Abnormalities of the control and strength of the laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles may cause upper airway obstruction increasing resistance to airflow. Bulbar muscle weakness prevents adequate peak cough flows to clear airway debris. Dysphagia can lead to aspiration of microorganisms, food and liquids and hence pneumonia. MND patients with bulbar involvement commonly display an abnormal respiratory pattern during swallow characterized by inspiration after swallow, prolonged swallow apnoea and multiple swallows per bolus. Volitional respiratory function tests such as forced vital capacity can be inaccurate in patients with bulbofacial weakness and/or impaired volitional respiratory control. Bulbar muscle weakness with abundant secretions may increase the risk of aspiration and make successful non-invasive assisted ventilation more difficult. We conclude that an evaluation of bulbar dysfunction is an essential element in the assessment of respiratory dysfunction in MND.","['Hadjikoutis S', 'Wiles CM']",2001,103,4,Acta Neurol Scand,Hadjikoutis S and Wiles CM.

There is evidence that glial cell dysfunction may contribute to motor neurone injury, but the exact role of glial cells in MND has yet to be established. The aim of this study was to determine whether expression of mutant SOD1 affects the response of glia to oxidative stress. Stable C6 glioma cells expressing mutant SOD1 and cortical astrocyte cultures from G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice were exposed to: xanthine/xanthine oxidase; hydrogen peroxide; A23187 and 3-morpholinosydonimine. Cell viability was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Neither C6 glioma cells nor cortical astrocytes expressing mutant SOD1 were more susceptible to any of the free radical generating systems compared to control cells. These results suggest that astrocytes are resistant to the toxic effects of mutant SOD1 widely reported for neuronal cells.","['Williams RE', 'Cookson MR', 'Fray AE', 'Manning PM', 'Menzies FM', 'Figlewicz DA', 'Shaw PJ']",2001,302,2-3,Neurosci Lett,"Williams RE, et al.

11268018,Role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in wobbler mouse motor neuron disease.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is neuroprotective for motoneurons undergoing degeneration, including those in natural motor neuron disease (MND) in wobbler mice. To assess the role of BDNF in this model of MND, endogenous BDNF immunoreactivity was analyzed by semiquantitative video-image analysis. Affected cervical spinal cord motoneurons had significantly greater BDNF immunoreactivity compared to motoneurons of healthy littermates (P = 0.01) and affected lumbar spinal cord motoneurons (P = 0.008 at age 4 weeks; P = 0.005 at age 8 weeks). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS) immunocytochemistry revealed increased immunoreactivity in the affected cervical spinal cord motoneurons. Exogenous BDNF treatment partially inhibited the increased NOS activity, as quantitatively measured by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry. The mean number of NADPH-d(+) motoneurons in the cervical anterior horn decreased from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 1.5 +/- 1.2 (P = 0.002). The increase in endogenous BDNF immunoreactivity in the affected spinal cord may be compensatory in diseased motoneurons, yet it appears to still be inadequate because exogenous BDNF treatment is required to suppress increased NOS activity in degenerating motoneurons. Our study indicates that BDNF is important in halting nitric oxide (NO)-mediated motor neuron degeneration, which has potential implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.","['Tsuzaka K', 'Ishiyama T', 'Pioro EP', 'Mitsumoto H']",2001,24,4,Muscle Nerve,"Tsuzaka K, et al.

All patients developed a progressive non-fluent aphasia culminating in some cases in complete mutism. In five cases, formal testing revealed deficits in syntactic comprehension. Comprehension and production of verbs were consistently more affected those that of nouns and this effect remained stable upon subsequent testing, despite overall deterioration. The classical signs of MND, including wasting, fasciculations and severe bulbar symptoms, occurred over the following 6-12 months. The behavioural symptoms ranged from mild anosognosia to personality change implicating frontal-lobe dementia. In three cases, post-mortem examination has confirmed the clinical diagnosis of MND-dementia. In addition to the typical involvement of motor and premotor cortex, particularly pronounced pathological changes were observed in the Brodmann areas 44 (Broca's area) and 45. The finding of a selective impairment of verb/action processing in association with the dementia/aphasia syndrome of MND suggests that the neural substrate underlying verb representation is strongly connected to anterior cortical motor systems.","['Bak TH', ""O'Donovan DG"", 'Xuereb JH', 'Boniface S', 'Hodges JR']",2001,124,Pt 1,Brain,"Bak TH, et al.

The results indicated that when diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal (FTD) were used as part of a questionnaire method of diagnosing dementia the incidence of dementia in MND was considerably greater than traditional estimates suggest. Through a series of logistic and multiple regressions the results demonstrated that neuropsychological test performance related well to diagnostic classifications of dementia. MND patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia were likely to demonstrate impaired new learning; poor working memory and planning; slowness in information processing and rigidity in thinking. These features, which are typical of cases of FTD, suggest that the dementia of MND is usefully characterised as a form of FTD.

However, perceived strain was greater in carers who viewed their partners' illness as having a more global impact on their lives, and was related to self-perceived control over their thoughts about their partner. Female carers anticipated experiencing less strain and distress in the following year than male carers, even though they did not differ in current strain levels. Male and female carers received similar numbers of formal services.

11090871,Development of a patient-specific dyspnoea questionnaire in motor neurone disease (MND): the MND dyspnoea rating scale (MDRS).,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive, unremitting and fatal disease. Respiratory dysfunction is common and a significant cause of morbidity. The relationship between subjective dyspnoea and objective measures of lung function have been unexplored in MND. Increasing interest in the specific treatment of respiratory symptoms in MND has highlighted the need for simple, reliable and valid measures to quantify the degree of dyspnoea in this condition. Several generic questionnaires have been developed to rate subjective breathlessness but are inappropriate for use in MND patients as they often assess dyspnoea by exercise-limitation. As yet, there are no published disease-specific measures to assess dyspnoea in MND. In order to accurately and reproducibly measure the subjective experience of dyspnoea in this patient group, we have developed and validated a novel patient-specific dyspnoea questionnaire, the MND dyspnoea rating scale (MDRS). It comprises three domains covering dyspnoea, emotion and mastery and is valid for use in MND patients at all stages of disease progression. In our cohort of 40 unselected patients with MND we have shown that the patients subjective experience of dyspnoea is closely related to emotion and psychological control over the disease. Dyspnoea is not related to objective measures of lung function such as vital capacity, irrespective of limb or bulbar presentation. In conclusion, vital capacity, although useful prognostically, is only one aspect of respiratory function in MND.

FTD is characterised by profound character change and altered social conduct, and executive deficits, reflecting focal degeneration of the frontal and temporal neocortex.

The major histological change is typically of microvacuolation of the cerebral cortex, with atrophy of the bulbar neurones and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. Ubiquitinated inclusion bodies occur in large pyramidal cortical neurones and in surviving cranial nerve nuclei and anterior horn cells. Evidence is emerging that some patients with classical MND/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), who are thought not to be demented, develop cognitive deficits in the realm of frontal executive functions. Moreover, frontal lobe abnormalities have been demonstrated by neuroimaging. The findings point to a link between FTD/MND and cMND/ALS and suggest that a proportion of patients with cMND/ALS go on to develop FTD. Patients with cMND/ALS may not be equally vulnerable.

Damaged neurons frequently undergo apoptosis mediated by the p53 cell survival regulator. We therefore studied whether motor neuron disease (MND) in mice expressing the human SOD1 mutant G93A is dependent on p53 by crossing G93A mice with p53-knockout mice. Since p53-/- mice's life expectance is usually shorter (160+/-49 days, n=11) than the time at which the G93A mice die from MND (212+/-50 days, n=7), only a few of the G93A/p53-/- double transgenics were expected to live to experience MND. Nevertheless, four of the 22 G93A/p53-/- mice succumbed to MND after 160+/-28 days, as expected under these conditions of competing death risks if the absence of p53 fails to protect from MND. Thus, MND in mice expressing G93A does not require p53. This conclusion is supported by histology: pre-symptomatic G93A mice display disease-associated vacuoles within the dendrites of motor neurons regardless of p53 status.","['Prudlo J', 'Koenig J', 'Gräser J', 'Burckhardt E', 'Mestres P', 'Menger M', 'Roemer K']",2000,879,1-2,Brain Res,"Prudlo J, et al.

Clinical pathology can be subdivided in three main neuropathological subtypes: frontal lobe dementia, Pick's disease and FTD with motor neuron disease (MND), all characterised by distinct histological features. Until recently the presence of ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions in the dentate gyrus, and the temporal and frontal cortex was usually associated with the MND type. Such inclusions were also observed in a few sporadic cases of FTD without or with parkinsonism (FTDP) in the absence of MND. We present here clinical, neuropathological and immunohistochemical data about a Swiss FTD family with FTDP-like features but without MND. Spongiosis and mild gliosis were observed in the grey matter. No neurofibrillary tangles, Pick bodies, Lewy bodies, senile plaques or prion-positive signals were present. However, ubiquitin-positive intracytoplasmic inclusions were detected in various structures but predominantly in the dentate gyrus. These observations support the existence of a familial form of FTDP with ubiquitin-positive intracytoplasmic inclusions (Swiss FTDP family).","['Kövari E', 'Leuba G', 'Savioz A', 'Saini K', 'Anastasiu R', 'Miklossy J', 'Bouras C']",2000,100,4,Acta Neuropathol,"Kövari E, et al.

Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) proposed by Lund & Manchester group is a concept that includes Pick's disease, and its ""clinical diagnostic features"" are useful because they distinguish dementia with frontal and anterior temporal involvement from Alzheimer type dementia. FTD is classified into three types, the frontal lobe degeneration (FLD) type, Pick type and motor neuron disease (MND) type, and neuropathological diagnostic features of each type are presented. In Japan, however, cases neuropathologically corresponding to the FLD type, which has mild frontal dominant degeneration with heavy heredity, have not been previously reported. Classic Japanese Pick's disease is consistent with Pick type, however, cases of Pick's disease with and without Pick body exist in nearly the same number in Japan. The latter may include heterogeneous types, which should be elucidated. MND type corresponds to Japanese cases, called Yuasa-Mitsuyama disease or dementia with motor neuron disease, and could be actually diagnosed because such patients do not exhibit severe personality change and accompany symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal progressive muscular atrophy in their clinical course. In addition, Pick syndrome includes progressive subcortical gliosis, corticobasal degeneration, basophilic inclusion body disease and fronto-temporal dementia with parkinsonism linked chromosome 17. Progressive aphasia and semantic dementia are neuropsychologically important concepts, however, they are symptom-complex and are dominated only by where the degeneration begins and how it progresses. They should not be confused with pathologically confirmed disease-entities.",['Ikeda K'],2000,102,6,Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi,Ikeda K.

10963371,Gallyas-positive argyrophilic and ubiquitinated filamentous inclusions in rapidly progressive motor neuron disease: immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies.,"In an autopsy case of sporadic rapidly progressive lower motor neuron disease (MND), Gallyas-positive argyrophilic and ubiquitinated filamentous intracytoplasmic inclusions were found in the neurons. Clinically, 7 months prior to death, a 68-year-old woman experienced a history of rapidly progressive muscle weakness of all four extremities and bulbar sign, without sensory and autonomic disturbance. Two months later, she became unable to stand or walk. Four months after onset, she needed respiratory support, and subsequently died due to cardiorespiratory arrest. Neuropathological examinations revealed neuronal loss and associated gliosis in the lower motor neurons, except for ocular motor nuclei, Clark's column, and accessory cuneate nucleus, and tract degeneration was observed in the middle root zone of the posterior column and spinocerebellar tract. No Bunina bodies or Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions were found in the anterior horns. Gallyaspositive argyrophilic filamentous inclusions were found in the lower motor neurons and in nerve cells of the Clark's column, intermediate zone, posterior horn and accessory cuneate nucleus. These were positive with anti-ubiquitin antibody but negative with anti-tau (tau-2 and AT8) and neurofilament antibodies. Electron microscopic examinations disclosed randomly arranged tubular-like filamentous profiles, with a diameter of 12-14 nm, sometimes with amorphous granules in the perikaryon. This is the first report on the Gallyas-positive argyrophilic and ubiquitinated filamentous inclusions in neurons in MND.","['Katayama S', 'Watanabe C', 'Kohriyama T', 'Yamamura Y', 'Mao JJ', 'Ohishi H', 'Nishisaka T', 'Inai K', 'Tanaka E', 'Nakamura S']",2000,100,2,Acta Neuropathol,"Katayama S, et al.

10963360,Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and 2 immunoreactivity in the spinal cord in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The spinal cord of 20 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 5 patients with lower motor neuron disease (LMND) were investigated immunohistochemically using anti-human excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) and EAAT2 antibodies which are the astrocytic transporters. The purpose of the study was to examine relationships between EAAT1 and EAAT2 immunoreactivity and degeneration of anterior horn neurons. Specimens from 20 patients without any neurological disease served as controls. In controls, spinal cord gray matter was densely immunostained by antibodies, whereas the white matter was generally not immunostained. In motor neuron disease (MND) patients, EAAT1 immunoreactivity was relatively well preserved in the gray matter despite neuronal loss of anterior horn cells. On the other hand, EAAT2 immunoreactivity in anterior horns correlated with the degree of neuronal loss of anterior horn cells: in the patients with mild neuronal depletion, anterior horns were densely immunostained by the antibody, whereas in the patients with severe neuronal loss, EAAT2 expression was markedly reduced. Degenerated anterior horn cells frequently showed a much denser EAAT1 and EAAT2 immunoreactivity around the surface of the neurons and their neuronal processes than that observed in normal-appearing neurons. There was no difference in the expression of EAAT1 and EAAT2 immunoreactivity between LMND and ALS patients. These findings suggest that in the early stage of degeneration of anterior horn cells, EAAT1 and EAAT2 immunoreactivity is preserved in the astrocytic foot directly attached to normal-appearing neurons, whereas levels of EAAT1 and EAAT2 protein rather increase in the astrocytic foot directly attached to degenerated anterior horn neurons; the latter effect most probably reduces the elevated glutamate level, compensates for the reduced function of astroglial glutamate transporters, or represents a condensation of EAAT1 and EAAT2 immunoreactivity secondary to loss of neurites and greater condensation of astrocytic processes. Thus, we demonstrate a difference in EAAT1 and EAAT2 immunoreactivity in different stages of progression in ALS, as a feature of the pathomechanism of this disease.","['Sasaki S', 'Komori T', 'Iwata M']",2000,100,2,Acta Neuropathol,"Sasaki S, et al.

10960050,Abnormal patterns of breathing during swallowing in neurological disorders.,"Swallowing momentarily inhibits breathing, and normally the great majority of apnoeas which accompany a swallow are followed by expiration (xE swallows). This swallowing-breathing interaction is regarded as one of several mechanisms by which the airway is protected from aspiration during swallowing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction of breathing and swallowing in two groups of neurological patients. Twenty-two patients with defined neurological disorders involving various structures or pathways (brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves) were studied to determine whether particular lesions resulted in breakdown of the normal breathing pattern (22 normal subjects were also assessed and their breathing-swallowing pattern was compared with that of neurological patients). Subsequently, 32 patients with motor neurone disease (MND) were studied to identify factors associated with an abnormal pattern (i.e. swallow apnoeas followed by inspiration) and to clarify whether an abnormal pattern is related to chest infections, episodes of coughing and choking during meals, and prognosis. The swallow apnoea in patients with brain, spinal cord and peripheral neurological diseases was followed by inspiration more frequently than expected [20/22 (91%) patients compared with 2/22 (9%) of normal subjects, P: < 0.001], but this was not associated with a specific site of lesion(s). However, patients with corticobulbar involvement tended to have post-apnoea inspiration more often than those without. MND patients commonly displayed an abnormal pattern during swallowing [14/32 (44%) patients] characterized by inspiration after swallow, prolonged swallow apnoea and multiple swallows per bolus. Over the period of follow-up (12-18 months) this pattern did not predict chest infections, coughing and choking episodes during meals or survival. It seems likely that post-swallowing apnoea inspiration is a non-specific concomitant of disordered swallowing and/or breathing rather than being an important mechanism of aspiration per se or of symptom production.","['Hadjikoutis S', 'Pickersgill TP', 'Dawson K', 'Wiles CM']",2000,123 ( Pt 9),,Brain,"Hadjikoutis S, et al.

10934559,Demographic characteristics and prognosis in a Flemish amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population.,"We describe the genetic and demographic characteristics of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Flanders, Belgium. Prognostic factors related to survival are examined. ALS was familial in 8.6% of all MND patients. In 6 of 8 apparently unrelated families, an SOD1 mutation was found. In sporadic ALS, mean age at onset was 57.1 years. There was a male preponderance (1.2:1) and the disease had a bulbar onset in 19%. Median survival was 32 months (95% CI 26-46). The presence of an APOE-epsilon 4 allele was not associated with a bulbar onset of ALS, an earlier age at onset or a shorter median survival. Variables examined in a multivariate analysis included age, sex, site of onset, delay from onset to diagnosis, and % forced vital capacity. Shorter survival was independently associated with higher age, bulbar onset, a short diagnostic delay, and a lower percent-predicted vital capacity at study entry. Simple clinical baseline characteristics can assist the clinician in estimating prognosis in ALS. The demographic characteristics of the Flemish ALS population do not seem to differ from those described in other parts of the world.","['Thijs V', 'Peeters E', 'Theys P', 'Matthijs G', 'Robberecht W']",2000,100,2,Acta Neurol Belg,"Thijs V, et al.

10896704,Phenotypic differences between African and white patients with motor neuron disease: a case-control study.,"There is increasing evidence that race may affect the phenotype in some neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate this in motor neuron disease a retrospective case-control study has been carried out on 15 negroid African and 45 white patients with the disease seen over 8 years. Each African was compared with three age and sex matched white patients with motor neuron disease. There were no statistically significant differences in age of onset or the mean duration of disease in the two groups. The chance of presenting with the ""flail arm"" variant of motor neuron disease was four times as high in the African group than the white group (odds ratio 4.33, p=0. 05, 95% confidence interval 0.99-18.92). Although no overall differences in survival were seen between the two groups, in those with the flail arm variant, four out of the six African patients had died whereas all six white arm patients were alive at the censoring date of 1 January 1999 (median follow up 38.5 months). It is concluded that race may influence the phenotype and progression of motor neuron disease.","['Tomik B', 'Nicotra A', 'Ellis CM', 'Murphy C', 'Rabe-Hesketh S', 'Parton M', 'Shaw CE', 'Leigh PN']",2000,69,2,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Tomik B, et al.

10861296,The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis CLN8 membrane protein is a resident of the endoplasmic reticulum.,"Progressive epilepsy with mental retardation (EPMR) is a new member of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). The CLN8 gene underlying EPMR was recently identified. It encodes a novel 286 amino acid transmembrane protein that contains an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retrieval signal (KKRP) in its C-terminus. A homozygous mutation in the orthologous mouse gene (Cln8) underlies the phenotype of a naturally occurring NCL model, the motor neuron degeneration mouse (mnd). To characterize the product of the CLN8 gene and to determine its intracellular localization, we expressed CLN8 cDNA in BHK, HeLa and CHO cell lines. In western blotting and pulse-chase analyses an approximately 33 kDa protein that does not undergo proteolytic processing steps was detected. Using CLN8 and cell organelle specific antibodies with confocal immunofluorescence microscopy the CLN8 protein was shown to localize in the ER. Partial localization to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) was also observed. The ER-ERGIC localization was not altered in the CLN8 protein representing the EPMR mutation. However, mnd mutant protein was only found in the ER. Mutations in the ER retrieval signal KKRP resulted in localization of CLN8 to the Golgi apparatus. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that CLN8 is an ER resident protein that recycles between ER and ERGIC.","['Lonka L', 'Kyttälä A', 'Ranta S', 'Jalanko A', 'Lehesjoki AE']",2000,9,11,Hum Mol Genet,"Lonka L, et al.

A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of speech disturbance slowly progressing for 2 years. On physical examination, he showed no neurological abnormalities except for non-fluent aphasia and increased deep tendon reflexes without laterality. MRI demonstrated bilateral fronto-temporal atrophy, dominating the left hemisphere. This finding was confirmed by surface anatomy scanning (SAS), showing an obvious atrophy in the left inferior frontal gyrus, compared with the right one. SPECT with 123I-IMP revealed some irregular defects in the bilateral frontotemporal region. Because he showed dementia, bulbar palsy with tongue atrophy, weakness of upper extremities and facial muscles, snout reflex, and the atrophy and fasciculation in limbs in addition to motor aphasia soon after the discharge from our hospital, he was diagnosed as having MND with dementia. At age 68, he died of a respiratory failure 3 years after the onset of the disease. MND with dementia seldom shows motor aphasia as an initial symptom.

10817899,Lower motor neuron disease associated with myelofibrosis.,"We present a patient who has signs pointing to the involvement of lower motor neurons and myelofibrosis. To our knowledge, unlike lymphoproliferative disorders, co-occurrence of myelofibrosis and lower motor neuron disease (MND) has not been reported so far. A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with the complaint of painful cramps in his neck and forearms. On physical examination marked hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were found. On neurologic examination nasal quality of the voice and slight palatal weakness were detected. There were generalised slight weakness and atrophy in both proximal and distal muscle groups. Fasciculations were observed especially in forearm muscles and it was observed that he had been avoiding head movements because of painful muscle cramps. Deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive. Nerve conduction studies were normal. By needle electromyography, giant motor unit action potentials (amplitudes up to 8 mV), fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves and fasciculation potentials were detected in all muscles which were investigated. A hypercellular bone marrow (100%) was determined by bone marrow biopsy. In addition to increased production of the myeloid and megakaryocytic lines, abnormal aggregation and grouping of megakaryocytes were seen. Reticular fibers were increased. He had some benefit of dyphenilhydantoin treatment given for the painful cramps in his neck and forearm muscles. Hydroxyurea treatment was started for myelofibrosis. Six months later, his general condition was better, and the painful cramps were completely resolved. No marked deterioration has been detected in neurologic examination and electromyography for 1 year.","['Bir LS', 'Keskin A', 'Yaren A', 'Sermez Y', 'Oğuzhanoğlu A', 'Sahiner T']",2000,102,2,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,"Bir LS, et al.

10796796,Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND).,"BACKGROUND: Riluzole has been approved for treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in some countries but not others. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost, modest efficacy and concern over adverse effects.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival, and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Search of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Register for randomized trials and enquiry from authors of trials and other experts in the field. The most recent search was conducted in June 1999.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: randomized trials
TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: adults with a diagnosis of ALS Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: per cent mortality at 12 months with riluzole 100 mg Secondary: per cent mortality as a function of time with 100 mg and with all doses of riluzole, scales of neurologic function, quality of life, muscle strength and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified two randomized trials. Each reviewer graded them for methodological quality. Data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and checked by the other two. We obtained some missing data from investigators. We performed meta-analyses with RevMan software using a fixed effects model.
MAIN RESULTS: The two eligible trials included a total of 794 riluzole treated patients and 320 placebo treated patients. The methodological quality was acceptable and the trials were easily comparable. There were significant differences between the riluzole and placebo groups of both trials, in terms of the primary outcome measure, which was per cent mortality at 12 months with the 100 mg dose of riluzole. The odds ratio for the combined studies was 0.57 (95%CI 0.41 to 0.80) at 12 months. In the secondary outcome measures, there was a survival advantage with riluzole 100 mg at six, nine, 12 and 15 months, but not at three or 18 months. Pooled data from the 50, 100 and 200mg dose groups in the larger trial showed a lower per cent mortality with riluzole compared to placebo only at 12 months (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88). There was no beneficial effect on bulbar function, or muscle strength. There were scant data on quality of life, but patients treated with riluzole remained in a more moderately affected health state significantly longer than placebo-treated patients (weighted mean difference (WMD) 35.5 days, 95% CI 5.9 to 65. 0). A threefold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole treated patients than controls (WMD 2.65, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.65).
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg per day appears to be modestly effective in prolonging survival for patients with ALS.","['Miller RG', 'Mitchell JD', 'Moore DH']",2000,,2,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Miller RG, et al.

Post-mortem examination of the spinal cord showed a severe loss of anterior horn cells, prominent dilatation of vessels, diffuse, but sparse sprinkling of microglial cells and lymphocytes, and demyelination and sclerosis of the ventrolateral columns. Neuronal depletion and marked gliosis was noted in the cochlear nucleus on both sides, while other bulbar motor nuclei were also involved. The cochlear nerve showed demyelination and axonal loss.

10766890,Coughing and choking in motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency and severity of coughing and choking episodes, possible related factors, and their association with chest infections in patients with motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: Thirty seven patients with MND and 23 healthy volunteers were studied. Cough was assessed using a questionnaire and a 3 day diary, and volitional cough quantified by peak cough flow and sound intensity. Other clinical symptoms, smoking habit, affective state, oral secretions, bulbar signs, and quantitative assessments of swallowing and respiratory function were documented.
RESULTS: Patients with MND coughed and choked significantly more often and to a greater degree than the healthy volunteers (26 of 37 patients with MND and 2 of 23 volunteers, p<0.001). Female sex, older age, abnormal speech, reduced swallowing capacity, and low forced vital capacity (FVC)% predicted were each significantly associated with excessive coughing and choking episodes in patients with MND. Smokers had significantly more severe and prolonged episodes of coughing and choking than non-smokers (p<0.05). Patients with upper motor neuron bulbar signs had a greater tendency to severe and prolonged episodes of coughing and choking than those without (p<0. 05). Chest infections were reported only rarely among the patients who coughed and choked.
CONCLUSIONS: Coughing and choking episodes are common in patients with MND but infrequently associated with overt chest infection. Upper motor neuron bulbar signs may both promote factors (for instance, dysphagia) which trigger cough and reduce volitional capacity to suppress it.","['Hadjikoutis S', 'Eccles R', 'Wiles CM']",2000,68,5,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Hadjikoutis S, et al.

10759449,Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure as a marker of respiratory function in motor neuron disease.,"Vital capacity (VC) and maximum mouth pressures are often used to monitor respiratory function in motor neuron disease (MND), but require the use of a mouthpiece. Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) is a simple and reliable means of measuring inspiratory muscle strength; it does not involve the use of a mouthpiece and might therefore be better than VC or mouth pressures for assessing patients with bulbar disease. SNIP, maximum inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory mouth pressure (MEP), VC and arterial carbon dioxide tension (Pa,CO2) were measured in 59 consecutive patients attending a specialist MND clinic. Thirty-one had bulbar involvement on clinical grounds. Both SNIP and VC were inversely related to Pa,CO2 in nonbulbar patients only. Neither MIP nor MEP were related to Pa,CO2. The 10 patients with an elevated Pa,CO2 (>6 kPa) had significantly lower SNIP and VC than normocapnic patients. Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure can be used to monitor respiratory function in motor neuron disease. It is quick and easy for patients to perform, but otherwise appears to offer little advantage over vital capacity measurement. Patients with bulbar disease are often poor at performing sniff nasal inspiratory pressure manoeuvres, possibly because of upper airway collapse or inability to close the mouth completely during the manoeuvre.","['Chaudri MB', 'Liu C', 'Watson L', 'Jefferson D', 'Kinnear WJ']",2000,15,3,Eur Respir J,"Chaudri MB, et al.

10751564,Motor neurons are rich in non-phosphorylated neurofilaments: cross-species comparison and alterations in ALS.,"The localization and distribution of non-phosphorylated neurofilaments (NP-NF) in the upper and lower motor neurons was investigated in the rat, the common marmoset, the rhesus monkey and man using the SMI-32 antibody. Within the spinal cord of all species studied, the most intense NP-NF immunoreactivity was observed within the ventral horn alpha-motor neurons. Concurrent staining for the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) demonstrated that virtually all of the ChAT-positive alpha-motor neurons contain NP-NF immunoreactivity. Although NP-NF staining was also observed in other neurons within the ventral and intermediate horns, these neurons were loosely scattered and contained a considerably lower staining intensity. The only other prominent NP-NF staining in the spinal cord occurred within the neurons of the dorsal nucleus of Clark and the intermediolateral cell column. Phosphorylated neurofilament (P-NF) immunoreactivity was found primarily in neuronal processes. Occasionally, a solitary motor neuron contained weak P-NF immunoreactivity. Within the brainstem, neurons in all cranial nerve motor nuclei contained intense NP-NF immunoreactivity. The distribution and apparent density of NP-NF immunoreactive neurons in these nuclei was virtually identical to that observed for neurons immunoreactive for ChAT. NP-NF immunoreactive neurons of relatively lower intensity were found in many other regions of the brainstem. All of the giant Betz cells of layer (L) V in the motor cortex contained dark NP-NF immunoreactivity. Within the spinal cord of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, both Nissl and NP-NF staining demonstrated the dramatic loss of alpha-motor neurons characteristic of this disorder. Some of the remaining motor neurons contained intense P-NF immunoreactivity. These observations suggest that NP-NF immunoreactivity is a good marker for motor neurons in health and disease and may be a useful tool for studies of motor neuron degeneration (MND).","['Tsang YM', 'Chiong F', 'Kuznetsov D', 'Kasarskis E', 'Geula C']",2000,861,1,Brain Res,"Tsang YM, et al.

Since this rare mutation affected a nonconserved base position and was not observed in MND or TLE materials, its relation to disease remains unclear.","['Kirches E', 'Winkler K', 'Vielhaber S', 'Michael M', 'Warich-Kirches M', 'von Bossanyi P', 'Plate I', 'Kunz WS', 'Szibor R', 'Feistner H', 'Dietzmann K']",1999,67,4,Pathobiology,"Kirches E, et al.

10717547,A morphological analysis of the macro motor unit potential.,"The technique of macro EMG is used to investigate the motor unit architecture in a number of pathological conditions. Amplitude and area are the most commonly used criteria, but these parameters alone are not sufficient to assess the complexity of the macro MUP morphology. In an attempt to examine the morphology of the macro MUP in more detail, additional measures were investigated including, (i) average power, (ii) duration, and (iii) number of phases. Macro MUP duration was defined as the time parameter that contains a particular fraction (90%) of the total power of the potential. The above mentioned parameters were evaluated for normal subjects and for patients suffering with motor neuron disease (MND), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and Becker's muscular dystrophy (BMD). It is shown that high amplitude and average power macro MUPs give shorter macro MUP duration than macro MUPs with normal amplitude. In contrast, in low amplitude macro MUPs there is a tendency towards a higher duration measure, as compared with the duration of the normal amplitude macro MUPs. Also, t-test results for the duration measure gave a significant difference between the NOR-MND, and no significant difference between the NOR-BMD and NOR-SMA groups at P<0. 05. Significant difference between the NOR and the three disease groups investigated was obtained for the parameters log amplitude, log area, and log average power. The number of phases was not significantly different between the NOR and the rest of the groups. In conclusion, the average power and duration parameters can possibly be used as additional discriminators to detect abnormalities of the macro motor unit potential in both needle and surface EMG but further investigation is necessary.","['Pattichis CS', 'Schofield IS', 'Fawcett P']",1999,21,10,Med Eng Phys,"Pattichis CS, et al.

10714932,Modelling exposure opportunities: estimating relative risk for motor neurone disease in Finland.,"This paper addresses the issues surrounding an individual's exposure to potential environmental risk factors, which can be implicated in the aetiology of a disease. We hope to further elucidate the 'lag' or latency period between the initial exposure to potential pathogens and the physical emergence of the disease, with specific reference to the rare neurological condition, motor neurone disease (MND), using a dataset obtained from the Finnish Death Certificate registry, for MND deaths between the period 1985-1995. A space-time approach is adopted, whereby patterns in both time and space are considered. No prior assumptions about the aetiology of MND are adopted. By using methods for the analysis of point processes, which preserve the continuous nature of the data, we resolve some of the problems of analysis that are often based on arbitrary areal units, such as postcode boundaries, or political boundaries. We use kernel estimation to model space-time patterns. Raised relative risk is assessed by adopting appropriate adjustments for the underlying population at risk, with the use of controls. Significance of the results is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation, and comparisons are made with results obtained from Openshaw's geographical analysis machine (GAM). Our results demonstrate the utility of kernel estimation as a visualisation tool. Small areas of elevated risk are identified, which need to be more closely examined before any firm conclusions can be drawn. We highlight a number of issues concerning the inadequacies of the data, and possibly of the techniques themselves.","['Sabel CE', 'Gatrell AC', 'Löytönen M', 'Maasilta P', 'Jokelainen M']",2000,50,7-8,Soc Sci Med,"Sabel CE, et al.

T-588 protects rat cerebellar granule cells from glutamate neurotoxicity in culture. This agent also inhibits facilitation in the crayfish neuromuscular junction and mammalian cerebellum. Clinical trials of T-588 are underway in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We attempted to determine whether T-588 treatment ameliorates neuromuscular dysfunction in the wobbler mouse, an animal model of motoneuron disease (MND). After the initial diagnosis of MND at the age of 3-4 weeks, wobbler mice were orally administered T-588 (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 4 weeks in a blinded fashion. We compared symptomatic, pathological and biochemical changes among the groups. In comparison with vehicle, T-588 administration potentiated grip strength, attenuated forelimb contracture and increased the weight of the biceps muscles. T-588-treated mice had retarded denervation muscle atrophy and elevated activities of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or lactate dehydrogenase in the biceps muscles. T-588 treatment also enhanced ChAT activities and promoted formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the cervical cord. Pharmacokinetic study also showed that T-588 was transported efficiently into the cerebrum and spinal cord following oral administration. Thus, T-588 treatment delayed the progression of wobbler murine MND. Our findings suggest that this agent has therapeutic potential in human motor neuropathy or MND.","['Ikeda K', 'Iwasaki Y', 'Kinoshita M', 'Marubuchi S', 'Ono S']",2000,858,1,Brain Res,"Ikeda K, et al.

10631656,Development and validation of a short measure of health status for individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease: the ALSAQ-40.,"In recent years there has been an increased appreciation of the importance of measuring health status from the patient's point of view, but until now no attempt has been made to develop an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-specific health status measure. The development of such an instrument is especially relevant now with the introduction of drugs that prolong life in ALS but limited data is available on the impact such treatments have on quality of life. This paper reports on the development of an ALS-specific measure, the forty item ALS assessment questionnaire (ALSAQ-40). The development of the ALSAQ-40 followed three main stages. Stage 1 consisted of in-depth, semi-structured exploratory interviews conducted on a sample of 18 patients to identify areas of salience and concern to patients with ALS. These interviews generated 78 candidate questions. In stage 2, the 78-item questionnaire was used in a postal survey to identify appropriate rephrasing/shortening and to determine the acceptability of the measure. In addition, this exercise helped identify sub-scales of the instrument addressing different dimensions of ALS. Finally in stage 3 the data collected in stage 2 was analysed to areas measured by the instrument and to remove redundant questions. The resulting measure contains forty questions measuring five areas of health status: Eating and Drinking, Communication, ADL/independence, Physical mobility, Emotional Functioning. The measure has high face, internal and construct validity and is likely to prove a useful measure in the evaluation of treatment regimes for ALS/MND.","['Jenkinson C', 'Fitzpatrick R', 'Brennan C', 'Bromberg M', 'Swash M']",1999,246 Suppl 3,,J Neurol,"Jenkinson C, et al.

10624737,Autoregressive and cepstral analyses of motor unit action potentials.,"Quantitative electromyographic signal analysis in the time domain for motor unit action potential (MUAP) classification and disease identification has been well documented over recent years. Considerable work has also been carried out in the frequency domain using classical power spectrum analysis techniques. Although MUAP autoregressive (AR) spectral analysis has been suggested as a diagnostic tool by a number of studies, it has not been thoroughly investigated yet. This work investigates the application of AR modeling and cepstral analysis for the diagnostic assessment of MUAPs recorded from normal (NOR) subjects and subjects suffering with motor neuron disease (MND) and myopathy (MYO). The following feature sets were extracted from the MUAP signal: (i) time domain measures, (ii) AR spectral measures, (iii) AR coefficients, and (iv) cepstral coefficients. Discriminative analysis of the individual features was carried out using the univariate and multiple covariance analysis methods. Both methods showed that: (i) the duration measure is the best discriminative feature among the time domain parameters, and (ii) the median frequency is the best discriminative feature among the AR spectral measures. Furthermore, the classification performance of the above four feature sets was investigated for three classes (NOR, MND and MYO) using artificial neural networks. Results showed that the highest diagnostic yield was obtained with the time domain measures followed by the cepstral coefficients, the AR spectral parameters, and the AR coefficients. In conclusion, MUAP autoregressive and cepstral analyses combined with time domain analysis provide useful information in the assessment of myopathology.","['Pattichis CS', 'Elia AG']",1999,21,6-7,Med Eng Phys,Pattichis CS and Elia AG.

Both patients are considered to be clinically categorized into the El Escorial suspected form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). At autopsy, they showed marked loss of spinal anterior horn cells accompanied by astrogliosis positively immunostained with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody at the cervical level. At the lumbosacral level, anterior horn neurons were relatively well preserved and Bunina bodies, ubiquitin-positive skein-like inclusions and Lewy body-like inclusions were observed in the remaining neurons. In one patient, brain stem motor neurons (nerves V, VII, XII) and motor cortex, including Betz cells, were also affected and the corticospinal tracts were degenerated at the level of the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. Pathological findings of this patient are consistent with those of ALS. In the other patient, the motor cortex, brain stem motor nuclei and the corticospinal tracts were well preserved, which is pathologically compatible with progressive spinal muscular atrophy. These patients with such a peculiar pattern of progressive muscular atrophy should be placed in a subgroup of ALS.","['Sasaki S', 'Iwata M']",1999,98,6,Acta Neuropathol,Sasaki S and Iwata M.

In order to research which are the most frequent nerves and segments where conduction block (CB) can be identified, we reviewed the clinical and neurophysiological data of nine patients with MMN who were studied and followed by the authors. Weakness and muscle atrophy of the dominant hand was the most frequent presentation. Lower limbs were involved later in the disease evolution. The ulnar and median nerves were the most affected nerves. They had conduction blocks mostly at the forearm and at Erb's point-elbow (or above elbow) segments. Both common peroneal and tibial nerves were frequently affected at their distal segments, but proximal segments were also probably involved. The presence of anti-GM1 antibodies was variable, and their determination was not essential for the diagnosis of MMN. Eight patients given IV immunoglobulin therapy had no disease progression. One patient was responsive to corticosteroids. The CB identification in our patients allowed us to clearly distinguish MMN from MND. The good prognosis and need for management with IV immunoglobulin, support the crucial role of a careful neurophysiological study to diagnose this clinical entity.","['Bentes C', 'de Carvalho M', 'Evangelista T', 'Sales-Luís ML']",1999,169,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Bentes C, et al.

10540010,Can amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with respiratory insufficiency exercise?,"The authors have shown in a recent paper that survival with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be increased by the use of non-invasive methods of assisted ventilation (Bipap). However, the progression of muscle weakness was not affected and the quality of life was not positively enhanced. In ALS, reduced physical activity may partially be secondary to alveolar hypoventilation syndrome. This leads to deconditioning of ALS/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) patients. The authors decided to investigate the possibility of reducing motor decline by exercising these patients to the anaerobic threshold, but simultaneously compensating the respiratory insufficiency with the Bipap STD. We conducted a controlled single blind study, exercising eight consecutive ALS/MND patients and used a control group of 12 ALS/MND patients. The patients were all evaluated during a 1 year period. Respiratory function tests (RFT) were performed at entry and then at 6 month intervals. Barthel, Functional Independent Mobility scale (FIM) and Spinal and Bulbar Norris scores were recorded every 3 months. There was a significant difference between the two groups with respect to FIM scores (P<0.03), but not Barthel scores (P<0.8). A slower clinical course (Spinal Norris score P<0.02) and a significant difference in the slope of the RFT (P<0.008) were observed in the treated group, suggesting that exercise may be beneficial in ALS patients once Bipap is used to control peripheral and muscle oxygenation.","['Pinto AC', 'Alves M', 'Nogueira A', 'Evangelista T', 'Carvalho J', 'Coelho A', 'de Carvalho M', 'Sales-Luís ML']",1999,169,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Pinto AC, et al.

10540009,Respiratory disorders in ALS: sleep and exercise studies.,"Sleep disruption in ALS/MND is related to hypoventilation and nocturnal O(2) saturation. Maximal inspiratory pressure (PI(max)) proved sensitive in predicting nocturnal O(2) saturation. However, PI(max) is highly dependent on patient collaboration; on the other hand Mouth Occlusion Pressure (MOP) is a reliable, non-volitional parameter index of central respiratory drive. Since exercise testing (ET) is also part of the assessment of ventilatory regulation the authors aimed to determine whether MOP and ET are sensitive and reliable parameters predictive of nocturnal O(2) saturation and clinical evolution. We conducted a Polysomnographic (PSG) study in two groups of 14 patients, selected according to their MOP level. Patients performed at admission an ET, Respiratory Function tests (RFT) and clinical evaluation with Norris spinal and bulbar scores (SNS and BNS). All patients in Group I (Low MOP) had decreased O(2) saturation during ET (P<0.001). Correlation study showed correlation between ET and MOP (R=0.6); PI(max) slope and PE(max) slope correlated with ET (R=-0.4; -0.6), respectively. ET also correlated with nocturnal O(2) saturation and SNS slope (R=0.8; -0.5), respectively. SNS and BNS slopes correlated with nocturnal O(2) saturation (R=-0.4; -0.7), respectively. The best correlations found were between MOP slope and BNS slope and SNS slope (R=0.8; 0.7), respectively. The high predictive values of MOP and ET at admission to nocturnal O(2) saturation (predicted value=80%) suggested the need of nocturnal pulse oximetry as a standard procedure. MOP and ET should also be used in evaluation protocols of ALS/MND.","['Pinto AC', 'Evangelista T', 'de Carvalho M', 'Paiva T', 'de Lurdes Sales-Luís M']",1999,169,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Pinto AC, et al.

Scale design was based upon patient-focused interviews which were used to explore patients' concerns. The impact the condition had upon their social interactions with others was salient for all patients and affected their overall quality of life. Using issues raised by patients, a 23-item scale was generated to specifically and quantitatively measure social withdrawal and this scale was psychometrically evaluated. The scale was administered to a sample of 23 patients at varied stages of progression of MND, and to a control group of patients with arthritis with similar levels of physical disability. For MND patients withdrawal from the community was found to be closely related to severity of physical symptoms and depression. Specific patients were identified who are particularly susceptible to withdrawal and depression. Comparison of the pattern of withdrawal in the MND and arthritis patient groups suggested that there may be differences between the factors governing social withdrawal in different patient populations.","['Rigby SA', 'Thornton EW', 'Tedman S', 'Burchardt F', 'Young CA', 'Dougan C']",1999,169,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Rigby SA, et al.

10586413,[An autopsy case of motoneuron disease with dementia of long duration].,"An autopsy case of MND with dementia, 67 years old, man, was reported. The behavioral disturbance appeared at 61 years old, and was followed by the upper limb weakness and respiratory failure. He had remained on a respirator for 56 months. The total duration of the disease was 74 months, which was far longer than mean duration of the cases previously reported, 25-30 months. The pathological findings were about essentially identical to those mentioned before, such as cortical alterations in temporal and frontal lobes, neuronal loss with gliosis in amygdaloid body and substantia nigra, and loss of lower motoneurons in anterior horn of spinal cord and in the several motor cranial nerve nuclei. There were several Bunina bodies in the remnant lower motoneurons, but no changes in the pyramidal tracts or loss of Betz cells in the precentral gyrus. Intracytoplasmic ubiquitin-immunopositive inclusions in the granule cells of hippocampal dentate gyrus were also encountered, but the number of which did not increased, compared to the preceding data. There may be frequently little correlation between the disease duration and the number of such inclusions. The regional alteration in the intermediate zone between subiculum and entorhinal cortex was revealed also at the level of the splenium of corpus callosum. It has been reported that such parahippocampal lesion may initiate at the anterior part of temporal lobe and become undiscernible at more posterior level than the lateral geniculate body. The formation of such parahippocampal lesion may be concerning with the length of disease duration. In addition, there were numerous senile plaques, diffuse or neuritic type only in the parietal lobe cortex without any other changes.","['Konno H', 'Seki H', 'Chida K', 'Nomura H', 'Okita N', 'Takase S']",1999,51,11,No To Shinkei,"Konno H, et al.

The mortality specifically by age and the adjusted age-related rates were calculated. By Poisson regression, the cohort effect of birth on the mortality by ages has been analyzed, the cohort effect also having been analyzed by graphic methods.
RESULTS: The mortality adjusted by age was declining up until 1969, as of which time it has been on the rise. Each five-year birth cohort increases the risk of dying from MND by 8.5%.

10526199,Medial temporal lobe metabolic impairment in dementia associated with motor neuron disease.,"In the course of their disease certain patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) develop clinical features compatible with a motor neuron disease (FTD-MND). Previous reports have suggested that the functional pattern is similar in FTD and FTD-MND. However, some neuropathological studies suggest greater involvement of medial temporal regions in FTD-MND than in FTD. Using statistical parametric mapping (SPM96), we compared the metabolic patterns obtained at rest with positron emission tomography in 10 FTD patients and three FTD-MND patients with those obtained from 46 healthy subjects (HS). Mean age, duration of illness and dementia stage did not differ statistically between the FTD and FTD-MND groups. In comparison with HS, both groups showed frontal and anterior temporal hypometabolism at P<0.001. When the FTD-MND group was compared to the FTD group, significant hypometabolism was only observed in bilateral amygdala, bilateral hippocampus, and bilateral enthorinal and parahippocampal regions (Brodmann's areas, BA 28/36) at P<0.005. We found no significant differences in regional glucose uptake when FTD patients were contrasted to FTD-MND patients. Our results suggest statistically comparable frontal and lateral temporal hypometabolism in both conditions but greater impairment of medial temporal lobe activity in FTD-MND.

10505649,The kinesin light chain gene: its mapping and exclusion in mouse and human forms of inherited motor neuron degeneration.,"The underlying genetic cause is known for only 10-20% of familial motor neuron disease (MND). Thus the genes involved in the aetiology of 80-90% of familial MND remain to be determined, and animal models are powerful tools for undertaking this task. We have mapped a heritable form of motor neuron degeneration in the mouse to a region that has homology to human chromosome 14q32.1-qter. This region contains the kinesin light chain gene (KLC1), which is a candidate for involvement in motor neuron degeneration because of its function in the motor-protein kinesin, and its neuronal expression. To investigate the role of KLC1 in a mouse motor neuron degeneration mutant that we are studying, we have identified mouse Klc1 gene sequences and mapped them with respect to our mutant locus. We have also investigated KLC1 in human patients with familial MND. Based on recombination and the absence of mutations in the coding region of KLC1, this gene can be excluded as a candidate gene in our mouse mutation and, where we have investigated, it is normal in human familial MND.","['Hafezparast M', 'Witherden A', 'Nicholson S', 'Bermingham N', 'Mackin J', 'ten Asbroek A', 'Ball S', 'Peters J', 'Baas F', 'Martin JE', 'Fisher EM']",1999,273,1,Neurosci Lett,"Hafezparast M, et al.

10505430,Gallyas- and tau-positive glial structures in motor neuron disease with dementia.,"We have studied Gallyas- and tau-positive glial structures in three autopsied cases of motor neuron disease with dementia (MND-D). Gallyas-positive, tau-immunoreactive thread-like structures in the neuropil and crescent/coiled inclusions in the glial cells were mainly observed in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdaloid nucleus. Double staining using Gallyas staining and carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) immunohistochemistry revealed that some crescent/coiled inclusions occurred in the CA2-immunopositive cytoplasm of the oligodendroglia. Electron microscopic study with the Gallyas-Braak method revealed that the inclusion was a reticular, partly compact mass, containing 15 nm fibrils around round or oval nuclei. Since the regions where these structures appeared exhibited neuronal loss with gliosis, these data suggest that a cytoskeletal abnormality involving tau protein in glia might be associated with the degenerative process of MND-D.","['Noda K', 'Katayama S', 'Watanabe C', 'Yamamura Y', 'Nakamura S']",1999,18,5,Clin Neuropathol,"Noda K, et al.

10463350,Electrophysiological diagnosis of motor neuron disease and pure motor neuropathy.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a group of disorders in which there is degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons to a variable degree. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most frequent form of the disease, presenting with both upper and lower motor neuron involvement. Frequently, especially in the early stages of the disease, only lower motor neuron signs are present. In these conditions, some pure motor neuropathies may resemble MND. The diagnosis is of importance because some of these motor neuropathies are ""dysimmune"" disorders and may respond to immune therapies. In such diseases the multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block appears to be the more frequent. In MND and pure motor neuropathies, the electrophysiological examination is the most decisive test. In MND, it is of diagnostic importance. In addition, it is useful in the assessment of disease severity and progression, in the evaluation of therapeutic trials and in the understanding of etiopathogenesis of the disease. In pure motor neuropathies, the presence of conduction block leads to immune treatment with good response in more than 50% of the cases.","['Bouche P', 'Le Forestier N', 'Maisonobe T', 'Fournier E', 'Willer JC']",1999,246,7,J Neurol,"Bouche P, et al.

10436342,Neurons and their dendrites in frontotemporal dementia.,"Regional and areal patterns of cell vulnerability (manifested as cell death and neuron loss) and cell sensitivity (as revealed by the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions) are described in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and FTD+ motor neuron disease (MND). This is followed by studies geared to learning about possible mechanisms involved in selective neuron loss and studies focused on recognizing the identity of vulnerable populations of local-circuit neurons and the impact of FTD on individual cells as well as on postsynaptic and presynaptic terminals in the frontal cortex. Neuron loss is not associated with increased vulnerability to nuclear DNA fragmentation, and nor is it accompanied by modifications in the expression of the proteins Bcl-2 and Bax, and transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun, thus suggesting that these proteins are probably not involved in cell death in these disorders. In the frontal and temporal cortices, glutamatergic pyramidal cells and calbindin-D28k-immunoreactive GABAergic local-circuit neurons are lost in the upper cortical layers. Parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells are preserved. In addition, reduction of putative postsynaptic sites (as inferred from the decreased numbers of dendritic branches in both pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons, and of dendritic spines in pyramidal cells) in remaining neurons of the upper layers, as well as reduction of presynaptic terminals (as suggested by the decreased expression of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, rab 3a and synapsin 1, and presynaptic plasma membrane proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1) in the upper layers of the frontal cortex, but not of the posterior parietal cortex, demonstrate the combined devastating effects of FTD on cortico-cortical connections.",['Ferrer I'],1999,10 Suppl 1,,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,Ferrer I.

10436336,"Cognition, language and behaviour in motor neurone disease: evidence of frontotemporal dysfunction.","Cognitive symptoms accompanying motor neurone disease (MND) have been recognized and described since the late 19th century. Numerous reports from Europe, North America and Japan suggest existence of a syndrome that can be described as MND/dementia. Typically, psychiatric and cognitive changes, strongly reminiscent of frontotemporal dementia, precede the occurrence of the classical signs and symptoms of MND by several months. In a small number of patients a similar picture can be heralded by a progressive aphasia leading ultimately to mutism. While the syndromes of MND/dementia and MND/aphasia constitute a comparatively small group, subtle but consistent cognitive alterations have also been observed in the majority of nondemented MND patients. Although generally much less pronounced, their pattern, affecting mostly frontal-executive functions, resembles that of MND/dementia. Postmortem examination results, describing pathological changes in the frontal lobes, and functional neuroimaging studies, showing abnormal pattern of frontal activation, add more weight to the hypothesis linking MND to the frontotemporal dementia.","['Bak TH', 'Hodges JR']",1999,10 Suppl 1,,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,"Bak TH and Hodges JR.

10400213,Motor neuron disease: usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation in improving the diagnosis.,"Clinical upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement is sometimes difficult to detect in motor neuron disease (MND). For this reason we performed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to find out whether this technique may be useful in revealing signs of pyramidal tract impairment. Fifty-five MND patients, clinically divided into 22 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 18 ALS with probable UMN signs (ALS-PUMNS), 10 pure lower motor neuron syndrome (LMNS), and 5 progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), underwent standard TMS, recording from abductor digiti minimi and flexor allucis muscles. Prolongation of cortical motor evoked potential (MEP) latency and central conduction time (CCT) and absent MEP were considered as pathologic. ALS-PUMNS and LMNS patients were clinically reclassified after 1 year. TMS was abnormal in 95.4% of ALS, 72.2% of ALS-PUMNS, 50% of LMNS and 20% of PBP. Correlations between TMS parameters and both clinical signs of UMN involvement and disease severity were highly significant. TMS showed a high sensitivity, but lacked specificity. After 1 year, 11 patients among the ALS-PUMNS group were clinically reclassified as definite ALS: all of them had shown TMS abnormalities at the first examination. In conclusion, TMS provides important diagnostic information for an early prediction of ALS in those MND patients presenting with clinically equivocal UMN impairment.","['Miscio G', 'Pisano F', 'Mora G', 'Mazzini L']",1999,110,5,Clin Neurophysiol,"Miscio G, et al.

10398212,Central motor conduction time in patients with multifocal motor conduction block.,"The finding of conduction block (CB) within short consecutive segments along a motor nerve is a key feature of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). Despite their different pathogenesis, this may be the only clinical difference between some cases of MMN and the pure spinal muscular atrophy form of motor neuron disease (MND). In 12 patients with distal atrophy and fasciculations and electrophysiological evidence of CBs in the upper limbs, we measured the peripheral and central motor conduction times (PMCT and CMCT) to hand muscles. We reasoned that patients with MMN should show an abnormally prolonged PMCT with normal CMCT, whereas an increased CMCT would suggest MND. All patients had delayed F-wave latency and increased PMCT. Three patients had increased CMCT. Follow-up showed little clinical and electrophysiological change in 7 of the 9 patients with normal CMCT, and a progressive motor deficit leading ultimately to death in 1 of the 3 patients with increased CMCT. This patient's electrophysiological follow-up showed a significant decrement of the compound motor action potential to both proximal and distal stimulation points, with disappearance of earlier CBs. Autopsy revealed loss of anterior horn cells and axons of the ventral root, and degeneration of large myelinated fibers. We conclude that determining the CMCT may help in differentiating MND from MMN. Persistence of a stable clinical picture over a span of at least 1 year and lack of electrophysiological signs of involvement of upper motor neurons should both be required before establishing the diagnosis of MMN even with electrophysiological evidence of CB.","['Molinuevo JL', 'Cruz-Martínez A', 'Graus F', 'Serra J', 'Ribalta T', 'Valls-Solé J']",1999,22,7,Muscle Nerve,"Molinuevo JL, et al.

Chest X-ray films detected no abnormalities. Blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia with normal A-aDO 2, and pulmonary function tests revealed combined ventilatory impairment. Chest fluoroscopy revealed weakness of diaphragmatic motion. No other abnormalities were found on initial examination. It was difficult to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation and identify the cause of alveolar hypoventilation. On the 60th hospital day, a neurological examination and electromyography disclosed fasciculation and denervation of the left biceps and pectoralis major muscle.

10357076,Effects of assisted feeding on Wobbler mouse motoneuron disease and on serotonergic and peptidergic sprouting in the cervical spinal ventral horn.,"The Wobbler mouse is used as a model of human motoneuron disease (MND). During the disease progress, the significant loss of motoneurons in cervical spinal cord and cranial motor nuclei leads to the progressive loss of motor function in the forelimb, head, and neck regions. The loss of cutting and chewing ability that results in the inability to feed properly might lead to a lower mean body weight (b. wt.) that is generally one-half that of the normal phenotype littermate controls. Nutritional deficit might also influence neuronal processes sprouting in the cervical spinal ventral horn. To determine whether nutritional deficits contribute to the wt. loss, and influence the progress of MND as well as its sprouting phenomenon, Wobbler and normal phenotype control littermates were dropper-fed three times daily on a regular laboratory diet of Rat Chow. Weight measurements and behavioral tests were taken to monitor the disease. Immunocytochemisty of serotonin, substance P, and leucine enkephalin were conducted in the cervical spinal cord to investigate if any alteration occurred on the previously reported values in ad lib-fed animals. Organ wts. were measured to determine where nutritional benefit was incurred. Although mean wt. loss in Wobblers was reduced, wt. differed significantly from the control values after dropper feeding. However, the progress of the disease or alteration of neurotransmitters containing neuronal processes were not affected by nutritional factors. Therefore, nutritional intake affects wt. gain, but is not a primary consideration in the progress of MND. Behavioral deficits and neurotransmitter alterations are probably directly caused by motoneuron losses.","['Bose P', 'Fielding R', 'Vacca-Galloway LL']",1999,48,4,Brain Res Bull,"Bose P, et al.

10352871,The prevalence of motor neurone disease in the Province of Alberta.,"Using data from the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan, the prevalence of motor neurone disease (MND) was estimated for the Province of Alberta, Canada. Between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1995, 208 cases of MND (125 males, 83 females) were identified from physician billing records giving a period prevalence of 7.38 (8.9 for males, 5.9 for females) per 100,000 population. On prevalence day, July 1, 1995, there were 171 cases (103 males, 68 females) of MND giving a point prevalence estimate of 6.07 (7.3 for males, 4.8 for females) per 100,000 population. Males were more likely to be diagnosed (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.1, 2.1) with MND and there was an increased risk of receiving a diagnosis with increasing age (chi 2trend = 281, p < 0.001). The mean age of the cases was 59.2 years (58.5 for males, 60.3 for females) and did not differ significantly between the sexes. Geographically, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence across regions of the Province. During the study period, 28% of the cases had died (30% of males, 25% of females).

10215924,Biochemical and pharmacological evidence of a functional role of AMPA receptors in motor neuron dysfunction in mnd mice.,"We studied ionotropic glutamate receptor subtypes and the effect of chronic treatment with NBQX [6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline-2,3-dione], a selective (rs)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, in the spinal cord of mnd mice. NBQX (8 mg/kg daily i.p. for 3 weeks starting from 24 weeks old) significantly improved the behavioural scores (hind leg extension reflex, cage rung grasping and gait) in mnd mice, measured after the last drug injection, and increased the number of mice with 'normal' gait (from 50% to 90%, P < 0.05). Receptor binding autoradiography of the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, [3H]CGP 39653, of [3H]AMPA and [3H]kainic acid in spinal cord sections, measured after 1 week of drug washout, were not significantly different in control and mnd mice, and were not modified by NBQX. GluR2/3 immunoreactivity, assessed using Western blotting, was significantly enhanced (by 59%, P < 0.01) in the spinal cord but not in the brain of 28-week-old mnd mice compared to age-matched control mice. NBQX treatment increased GluR2/3 immunoreactivity in the spinal cord of control mice and mnd mice by 327 +/- 74% (P < 0.01) and 212 +/- 52% (P < 0.01), respectively. The changes in GluR2/3 subunits may involve adaptive mechanisms of the receptor and play some role in the protective effect of NBQX. These findings suggest that selective antagonism of ionotropic non-NMDA receptors may be of value in the treatment of motor neuron disease.","['Mennini T', 'Cagnotto A', 'Carvelli L', 'Comoletti D', 'Manzoni C', 'Muzio V', 'Rizzi M', 'Vezzani A']",1999,11,5,Eur J Neurosci,"Mennini T, et al.

For this reason the purpose of the present work was to test how often sensory system involvement might be detected by somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) studies and then to verify the presence of alteration of the sensory conduction and to detect the frequency of abnormalities of somatosensory peripheral, spinal, subcortical and cortical potentials in MND. SEP were tested after median nerve stimulation at the wrist, recorded from Erb's point, Ce2, Ce7 and scalp. Pearson's correlation coefficients test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for statistical analysis. 74 patients (22 women and 52 men) were examined. Mean age of patients was 54.07 +/- 11.24 years; mean duration of the disease -19.25 +/- 15.87 months. SEP were abnormal in 39 of 74 patients (about 53%) whereas the sensory NCV in median nerve was abnormal in 14 of 74 patients (19%). The most frequent pattern of abnormalities consisted of the absence or delay of cortical responses. The mean values of SEP latencies (N9, N11, N13, N20 and P25) were significantly increased in MND patients (p < 0.05) as compared with controls. The N9 and N11 latencies correlated with the duration of the disease.

Clinically, the mutant on a C57Bl/6 genetic background shows a progressive motor abnormality starting by 6 months of age, with death prior to 12 months. When mnd is outcrossed to the AKR/J genetic background, ca. 40% of the mnd/mnd F2 progeny show early onset (onset by 4.5-5 months and death by 7 months). A congenic strain of mnd has now been produced by eight generations of backcross onto the AKR background. Mice on this background show average onset at 4 months, and most are moribund prior to 5.5 months. The early onset appears to correlate with levels of abnormal accumulating material, and should prove useful in elucidating NCL neurodegenerative mechanisms.","['Messer A', 'Manley K', 'Plummer JA']",1999,66,4,Mol Genet Metab,"Messer A, et al.

In two of these cases the clinical diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically. Characteristically, all except one patients showed a presenile beginning of the disease. The clinical course was slowly progressive with a mean duration of about 10 years. Special attention was given to additional signs and symptoms of motor neuron disease, parkinsonism and hyperorality. Six patients suffered from FLD + MND; parkinsonism (rigid-akinetic type) and a partial Klüver-Bucy-syndrome were diagnosed in 5 cases each.

9989458,Oxidative stress and motor neurone disease.,"The effects of oxidative stress within post mitotic cells such as neurones may be cumulative, and injury by free radical species is a major potential cause of the age-related deterioration in neuronal function seen in several neurodegenerative diseases. There is strong evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of motor neurone disease (MND). Point mutations in the antioxidant enzyme Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are found in some pedigrees with the familial form of MND. How mutations in this ubiquitous enzyme cause the relatively selective cell death of specific groups of motor neurones is not clear, although a number of hypotheses have been forwarded. These include (1) the formation of hydroxyl radicals, (2) the catalysis of reactions of the nitrogen centred oxidant species peroxynitrite, (3) toxicity of copper or zinc and (4) protein aggregation. Some experimental support for these different hypotheses has been produced by manipulating cells in culture to express the mutant SOD1 proteins and by generating transgenic mice which over-express mutant SOD1. Observations in these model systems are, in some cases at least, supported by observations made on pathological material from patients with similar SOD1 mutations. Furthermore, there are reports of evidence of free radical mediated damage to neurones in the sporadic form of MND. Several lines of evidence suggest that alterations in the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system may also play a key role in the injury to motor neurones in sporadic MND. There are several important subcellular targets, which may be preferentially impaired within motor neurones, including neurofilament proteins and mitochondria. Future research will need to identify the aspects of the molecular and physiological phenotype of human motor neurones that makes them susceptible to degeneration in MND, and to identify those genetic and environmental factors which combine to cause this disease in individuals and in familial pedigrees.","['Cookson MR', 'Shaw PJ']",1999,9,1,Brain Pathol,Cookson MR and Shaw PJ.

9924601,Health professionals' responses to multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease.,"This study compares the responses of health professionals to multiple sclerosis (MS) and motor neurone disease (MND) in order to determine similarities and variations in responses to the two disorders and the issues critical to caring for patients with these conditions. Health professionals were more negative about MND compared with MS in terms of the amount they felt able to offer patients, their confidence in managing patients and their ability to convey hope. For a number of issues concerning the management of patients, the level of difficulty experienced by health professionals was similar for both MS and MND. These were resource issues, the health professionals' ability to remain positive in the face of progressive disability, interdisciplinary team problems and difficulties regarding patient care. The main concern of health professionals, for both conditions, was the effect of progressive disability on the patient. For MND, management issues which health professionals found comparatively more difficult than for MS were patients' short prognosis and impending death, communication problems and progressive disability. Issues which were comparatively more difficult for MS than MND were changes in patients' affect, cognition and personality, problems with planning care because of the disorder's unpredictable course, problems with diagnosis such as making and disclosing the diagnosis, and the tendency for patients to be difficult or demanding. Some notable differences in responses between health professionals in different health care settings were found. The findings have implications for changing health professionals' conceptualization of 'hope', developing ways of improving communication between health professionals in different health care settings so as to enable them to learn from each other's expertise and experiences and redressing gaps in service provision, especially for young people with MS.","['Carter H', 'McKenna C', 'MacLeod R', 'Green R']",1998,12,5,Palliat Med,"Carter H, et al.

9918704,"Onset and progression of motor deficits in motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mice are unaltered by the glycine/NMDA receptor antagonist L-701,324 or the MAO-B inhibitor R(-)-deprenyl.","NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity and oxidative stress have been implicated in the etiology of a number of degenerative diseases including motor neuron disease. The present study examined the effect of chronic administration of the glycine/NMDA receptor antagonist L-701,324 and the monoamine oxidase B inhibitor (r)-deprenyl on the onset and rate of progression of neurological impairment in the motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse, a murine model of neurodegeneration. Neurological assessment of mnd mice revealed an onset of motor deficits at 6 months of age as observed by the loss of hindlimb reflex extension. By 7 months, balance was also markedly impaired as measured by deficits in rotarod performance and ability to remain on balancing beams. At 8 months of age mnd mice exhibited gross abnormalities in walking pattern; animals were unable to flex their hindlimbs and tended to walk in small labored movements. Daily administration of L-701,324 (10 mg/kg p.o.) or r(-)-deprenyl (1 mg/kg p.o.) to mnd mice from 4 to 8 months of age failed to delay the onset of symptoms or slow the rate of deterioration of motor performance. These findings suggest that excessive activation of NMDA receptors may not be involved in the pathological process leading to motor neuron dysfunction in mnd mice and do not suggest a protective effect of deprenyl on motor neurons in these mice.","['Boyce S', 'Webb JK', 'Carlson E', 'Rupniak NM', 'Hill RG', 'Martin JE']",1999,155,1,Exp Neurol,"Boyce S, et al.

9854965,Dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease: an underrecognised association?,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and nature of global cognitive dysfunction and language deficits in an unselected population based cohort of patients with motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: A battery of neuropsychological and language tests was administered to patients presenting consecutively over a 3 year period to a regional neurology service with a new diagnosis of sporadic motor neuron disease.
RESULTS: The 18 patients could be divided on the basis of their performance into three groups: Three patients were demented and had impaired language function (group 1); two non-demented patients had an aphasic syndrome characterised by word finding difficulties and anomia (group 2). Major cognitive deficits were therefore found in five of the 18 patients (28%). The remaining 13 performed normally on the test battery apart from decreased verbal fluency (group 3).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.","['Rakowicz WP', 'Hodges JR']",1998,65,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,Rakowicz WP and Hodges JR.

9854959,Geographical epidemiology of residence of patients with motor neuron disease in Lancashire and south Cumbria.,"OBJECTIVES: To seek objective evidence for geographical clustering of places of residence of patients with motor neuron disease (MND).
METHODS: A complete residential history from birth to onset of disease was obtained from a cohort of 130 patients with MND from Lancashire and south Cumbria presenting to the Department of Neurology in Preston between 1 January 1989 and 31 December 1993. These data were compared with population based reference data from the 1991 UK Census.
RESULTS: Some areal units showed a greater, others a lesser, number of MND patient residences than expected. The results suggest that the background population incidence of MND is relatively low and that the overall incidence figures previously quoted have been skewed upwards by areas in which the incidence of MND is relatively increased. These findings were further tested by Poisson modelling. The Poisson model provided a poor fit for the data at postcode district and sector levels confirming that patients with MND were significantly more likely to have lived in some areas than others after allowing for variation in population of the different areal units and for variation in duration of residence.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the results of previous work, much of which has been qualitative rather than quantitative. The results presented here suggest a low background incidence of MND in the context of generally quoted overall incidence figures. This low background incidence is, however, skewed upwards by some areal units with a relatively high incidence, thus achieving overall incidence rates comparable with generally quoted figures. We conclude that there is prima facie evidence of spatial patterns in the distribution of places of residence of patients with MND. Further examination of occupational and environmental factors in the lives of the patients with MND is required to obtain a better understanding of the importance of these findings.","['Mitchell JD', 'Gatrell AC', 'Al-Hamad A', 'Davies RB', 'Batterby G']",1998,65,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Mitchell JD, et al.

9851665,Service provision for patients with ALS/MND: a cost-effective multidisciplinary approach.,"Optimal management of patients with ALS/MND requires a team approach, with early referral to paramedical services for clinical assessment and prompt intervention. As the condition progresses, a flexible approach to management must be adopted by the medical team, with an ability to intervene at very short notice. We have developed an efficient multi-disciplinary clinic that services the ALS/MND population of Ireland by combining the existing infrastructure of community services with a hospital-based specialist clinic. The clinic operates on a weekly basis, and is staffed by a core team including a neurologist, a liaison nurse, and the director of the ALS/MND Association. On-site and same-day physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy is available, as is pulmonary evaluation. All patients utilising the clinical services are automatically included on the Irish Register of Motor Neurone Disease, and are tracked by the liaison nurse. The core members of the clinic interact regularly with paramedical staff within the community, ensuring that necessary community services are made available within 1-2 weeks of the clinic visit. Equipment necessary for the patient's well being is made available free of charge by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, following an appropriate request from the regional para-medical staff. We have thus demonstrated that an effective multi- disciplinary care service for ALS/MND can be developed at modest cost by close personal liaison between the existing health care structures and core members of a multidisciplinary team.","['Corr B', 'Frost E', 'Traynor BJ', 'Hardiman O']",1998,160 Suppl 1,,J Neurol Sci,"Corr B, et al.

9851664,Building a care and research team.,"The provision of high quality care for people with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is challenging. The physical and psychological health needs experienced in this progressively disabling disease necessitate input from many disciplines. In order to integrate the delivery of care, the preferred model for MND is a disease-specific team. Such teams can offer a coordinated range of skills, expertise and clinical experience in a setting of interprofessional support. Teams may adopt several formats; multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary. In multidisciplinary teams the different professions work to individually set goals and meet to discuss their progress. In interdisciplinary teams goals are first agreed by the team, whose members then coordinate their input to the common treatment plan. In transdisciplinary teams, not only goals but skills are shared. Teamwork allows the coordination of input and the sharing of skills and experience in solving complex clinical problems. Greater flexibility and integration of work make best use of resources. Disease-specific teams act as an educational resource and stimulate awareness of the condition. Teams should undertake clinical research, to strengthen their practice and demonstrate their effectiveness. Effective teamwork, whether in a clinical or research team, requires issues of responsibility, leadership, interprofessional rivalry and communication to be addressed.",['Young CA'],1998,160 Suppl 1,,J Neurol Sci,Young CA.

Physical disability and impact of the illness on aspects of everyday functioning were related to levels of anxiety and depression in the patients; psychological coping strategies adopted depended to some extent on symptom duration. Carers also demonstrated signs of anxiety and depression, with the latter correlating with aspects of the patients' functional impairment. Perceived strain in carers over caring for the patient correlated with a loss in intimacy in their relationship, which in turn was predicted by patients' cognitive/behavioural and communication changes. Changes in patients' social performance also correlated with the extent to which carers felt that the illness was affecting other areas of their life, the extent to which their partner dominated their thoughts and the extent to which they could control their reactions when thinking about the patient. Satisfaction with formal services and the number of social groups to which carers belonged correlated with carers' self-predicted future ability to cope.","['Goldstein LH', 'Adamson M', 'Jeffrey L', 'Down K', 'Barby T', 'Wilson C', 'Leigh PN']",1998,160 Suppl 1,,J Neurol Sci,"Goldstein LH, et al.

9851650,Mood disturbances in motor neurone disease.,"This study explores the severity of depression and anxiety experienced by patients suffering from motor neurone disease and seeks to link this to illness progression, recent life events and personality factors. The 18 patients who participated in the study were assessed for the presence of psychiatric symptoms using the Beck Depressive Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The severity of the illness and the life events during the course of the illness were measured using the Norris scale and the Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale. A personality assessment was made using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Only four out of these 18 patients (23%) in the study suffered depression and of these three (17%) were mild and one (6%) was of moderate severity. A further six patients (33%) were rated as borderline depression. Only two patients suffered from an anxiety state and both had concurrent mild depression. No correlations of depression were found with the life events or illness progression. Only the L sub-scale of the EPQ (15.6+/-4.9) exceeds values expected for the general population. Despite the severity and frequency of life events during the course of the illness, most patients do not develop a depressive illness. The reason for this unexpected result is unclear. Depression is believed to result from underactivity of the serotonergic neurotransmitter system. However, in MND this system is relatively unaffected in contrast to dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders. The patients' high L scores suggest that many may cope with their illness by widespread use of denial as a psychological defence.","['Moore MJ', 'Moore PB', 'Shaw PJ']",1998,160 Suppl 1,,J Neurol Sci,"Moore MJ, et al.

This study has assessed nine MND subjects on a range of standardised language assessments and compared their performance to that of nine control subjects. Although this is a small experimental sample of subjects, the results of this study indicate that language impairment is present in some patients with MND. The deficits are subtle and only exposed on formal testing. It is not possible to define the nature of the language impairment from this restricted set of data, but there was evidence of some deficits in a sub-group of MND patients on tasks involving naming, auditory comprehension of complex sentences, some semantic tests and spelling.

The female patient and one male patient developed weakness in the small feet muscles as initial symptom and they complained of paresthesia along dermatomes L5S1 and of severe pain. The other five patients developed wasting of the hands muscles. They had a rather mild pain in the cervical spine and early morning paresthesia as well as severe causalgia along dermatomes C5C6 or C6C7. After the diagnosis of compressive radiculopathy in all patients, they underwent surgical treatment and very soon developed very severe progression of muscle wasting which included muscles of limbs, trunk and bulbar innervated muscles with signs and symptoms of lower and upper motor neuron lesion.

9851642,ALS/MND and the perspective of health economics.,"In health care, choices are constantly being made about alternative uses of scarce resources, and health economics offers a framework for analysing these choices and for improving resource allocation. In cost-effectiveness analysis, the costs and consequences of alternatives are systematically measured and compared, with the objective of achieving maximum health gain with the available resources. Treatment options for patients with ALS/MND are severely limited, but riluzole has been shown to offer modest improvements in survival. However, decision-makers are likely to want convincing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of this therapy before recommending widespread adoption. Here, some initial estimates of cost-effectiveness are provided, using published effectiveness data and considering only the costs of therapy and of tracheostomy. Compared with placebo, the incremental cost per life year gained of 50 mg/day of riluzole is pound sterling 45630, and of 100 mg/day is pound sterling 44890. Increasing the estimated costs of tracheostomy reduces the cost per life year gained of 50 mg/day to pound sterling 34940. However, if quality of life during the increased period of survival is 80% of full health, the cost per quality adjusted life year gained of 50 mg/day becomes pound sterling 57040. These cost-effectiveness ratios are well in excess of the range that is normally considered to be acceptable in UK health technology assessment. However, the comparatively small number of ALS/MND patients and the lack of treatment alternatives should also be considered. Meanwhile, better information on costs is required in order to produce more precise estimates of cost-effectiveness.",['Gray AM'],1998,160 Suppl 1,,J Neurol Sci,Gray AM.

Stained material increased linearly up to 8 months of age. A quantitative immunoassay was used to measure levels of mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit 9 in brain and liver of mnd/mnd mice. Levels of subunit 9 increased progressively throughout the lifespan of mnd/mnd mice reaching levels approximately 5-fold higher than in control animals.

9767379,The expression of the glial glutamate transporter protein EAAT2 in motor neuron disease: an immunohistochemical study.,"Emerging evidence suggests that a disturbance of the glutamate neurotransmitter system may be a contributory factor to motor neuron injury in motor neuron disease. Previous autoradiographic and immunoblotting studies have suggested that there may be reduced expression of glutamate transporter proteins in pathologically affected areas of the CNS in motor neuron disease. This study further explores the possible alteration in expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter protein EAAT2 in MND, by examining the protein expression in situ, in frozen sections, using immunohistochemistry. The aim of the study was to compare the distribution and density of EAAT2 in the motor cortex and spinal cord of MND cases (n = 16) compared with neurologically normal controls (n = 12), matched for relevant parameters. A novel, previously characterized, monoclonal antibody to EAAT2 was employed. EAAT2 immunoreactivity in motor neuron disease and control cases was compared using relative optical density measurements generated by computerized image analysis. In the motor cortex, EAAT2 immunoreactivity was laminated comprising a superficial intense band (corresponding to layers 1 and 2); a paler middle band (layer 3 and part of 5) and a more intense deep layer (layers 5 and 6). In the spinal cord, the ventral horn showed strong immunoreactivity with dense perisomatic staining around motor neuron cell bodies, the substantia gelatinosa showed moderate diffuse staining and the intermediate spinal laminae showed weak staining. This general pattern of immunoreactivity was preserved in the motor neuron disease cases. However, in the motor neuron disease cases compared with controls, the optical density values for EAAT2 immunoreactivity were significantly reduced in all grey matter regions of the lumbar spinal cord (P < 0.001) and were increased in the middle laminae of the motor cortex (P < 0.05). This study indicates that glutamate transporter pathology in motor neuron disease may be a more complex phenomenon than previously recognized.","['Fray AE', 'Ince PG', 'Banner SJ', 'Milton ID', 'Usher PA', 'Cookson MR', 'Shaw PJ']",1998,10,8,Eur J Neurosci,"Fray AE, et al.

Patients with bulbar onset were no more likely to be malnourished than patients with limb onset.

9741394,Oxidative damage to nucleic acids in motor neurons containing mercury.,"Heavy metals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic motor neuron disease (MND). We were interested to see if inorganic mercury leads to oxidative damage in motor neurons since free radicals have been suspected to be involved in MND, so a method to examine oxidatively-damaged DNA in situ was used to examine individual motor neurons. Mice were exposed to 500 microg/m3 of mercury vapour for 2 h. Two, five, or ten days later sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks of cervical spinal cord were incubated in avidin-FITC. Sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope and photographs of pairs of mercury-exposed and control spinal motor neurons were analysed semi-quantitatively for the amount of fluorescence using an image analysis program. Avidin fluorescence was seen in the perikaryon of both control and mercury-exposed motor neurons. In each control-mercury pair (four pairs per group) significantly more perikaryal fluorescence was seen in mercury-containing than in control motor neurons (Mann-Whitney testing). Mercury within the motor neuron perikaryon therefore leads to increased avidin binding, an indicator of oxidative damage to DNA. The findings support the hypothesis that an environmental toxin such as mercury can enter and damage motor neurons.","['Pamphlett R', 'Slater M', 'Thomas S']",1998,159,2,J Neurol Sci,"Pamphlett R, et al.

As tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is implicated in autoimmune diseases, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and can be neurotoxic, we studied TNF production in a proposed animal model of ALS, the mnd mouse. These mice develop symptoms (progressive weakness of the limbs) as late as at 7 months of age. We measured TNF in serum, brain and spinal cord of mnd mice at 3 and 7 months of age. TNF was detectable in the brain and spinal cord (but not in the serum) at 7 months, while no TNF was detected in mnd mice at 3 months (asymptomatic) or in control mice of the same genetic background and the same age. Immunohistochemistry confirmed localization of TNF-alpha in motor neurons situated in the ventral horn of the spinal cord of 7-month old mnd mice.

9642676,Neurochemical changes in the spinal cord in degenerative motor neuron diseases.,"Human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a typical motor neuron disease, is characterized pathologically by selective degenerative loss of motoneurons in the CNS. We have demonstrated significant reductions of neurotransmitter-related factors, such as acetylcholine-(ACh)-synthesizing enzyme activity and glutamate and aspartate contents in the ALS, compared to the non-ALS spinal cord obtained at autopsy. We have also shown considerable reductions in activities of cytochrome-c oxidase (CO), an enzyme contributing to aerobic energy production, and transglutaminase (TG), a Ca(2+)-dependent marker enzyme for tissue degeneration, in the ALS spinal cord. We found marked increases in fragmented glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a filamentous protein specifically associated with reactive astrocytes, in the ALS spinal cord relative to non-ALS tissue. These biochemical results corresponded well to pathomor-phological neuronal degenerative loss and reactive proliferation of astroglial components in the ALS spinal cord tissue. However, these results only indicate the final pathological and biochemical outcomes of ALS, and it is difficult to follow up cause and process in the ALS spinal cord during progression of the disease. Therefore, we used an animal model closely resembling human ALS, motor neuron degeneration (Mnd) mutant mice, a subline of C57BL/6 that shows late-onset progressive degeneration of lower motor neurons with paralytic gait beginning around 6.5 mo of age, to follow the biochemical and pathological alterations during postnatal development. We detected significant decreases in CO activity during early development and in activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant enzyme, in later stages in Mnd mutant spinal cord tissue. TG activity in the Mnd spinal cord showed gradual increases during early development reaching a maximum at 5 mo, and then tending to decrease thereafter. Amounts of fragmented GFAPs increased continuously during postnatal development in Mnd spinal cord. These biochemical changes were observed prior to the appearance of clinical motor dysfunctions in the Mnd mutant mice. Such biochemical analyses using appropriate animal models will be useful for inferring the origin and progression of human ALS.","['Nagata Y', 'Fujita K', 'Yamauchi M', 'Kato T', 'Ando M', 'Honda M']",1998,33,3,Mol Chem Neuropathol,"Nagata Y, et al.

That retroviral infections may cause motor neuron pathology by various mechanisms in animals and humans is known. Neurological symptoms potentially attributed to damage of lower motor neurons are often described during the course of HIV-1 infection and AIDS, however, it is often difficult to establish whether the disorder is primarily affecting the perikarya of lower motor neurons, or whether it is due to a focal proximal axonopathy, or to a dying-back process. We report a 30-year-old heroin abuser, HIV-1 positive, who presented a rapidly progressive limb weakness, muscle wasting, and bulbar signs, in absence of sensory loss of cerebellar and pyramidal signs. Imaging studies were negative. CSF showed increased protein content, negative cytology, and no oligoclonal bands. Serum protein electrophoresis, urinary heavy metal, and viral researches were negative. CD4 cells were counted 340 mm3 with a CD4-CD8 ratio equal to 0.4. Electrophysiology showed acute and chronic neurogenic changes, confirmed by muscle biopsy. Conduction studies along motor and sensory nerves fell within normal range. Biopsy of sural nerve revealed mild myelinated and unmyelinated fiber loss, occasional degeneration and regeneration, unremarkable inflammation. Despite treatment with AZT, zalcitabine, and steroids, the patient died after 3-month illness. Neuropathology showed normal cortical cell Betz's, and hemispheric white matter. Brain stem motor nuclei (inferior olival, dorsal motor of the vagus, hypoglossal) showed atrophy and intracytoplasmatic lipofuscin accumulation. Vacuolization, central chromatolysis, and neuronophagia were rarely seen. As associated pathology, in the fourth ventricle there were two small subependymal foci of demyelination, with reactive astrocytes and vascular proliferation. A possible crucial role of the HIV-1 infection in the development and progression of our patient's illness is considered in view of the known altered immunity proved in MND and ALS cases.","['Galassi G', 'Gentilini M', 'Ferrari S', 'Ficarra G', 'Zonari P', 'Mongiardo N', 'Tommelleri G', 'Di Rienzo B']",1998,17,3,Clin Neuropathol,"Galassi G, et al.

The median oral morphine dose was 60 mg/24 h, with a median duration of 51 days and the median parenteral dose was 180 mg/24 h with a median duration of use of three days.

9526038,Increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein fragments in the spinal cord of motor neuron degeneration mutant mouse.,"We analyzed protein fractions extracted from the spinal cord of the motor neuron degeneration (Mnd) mouse, a mutant that exhibits progressive degeneration of lower spinal motor neurons, by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) after solubilization of the tissue with medium containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-urea during growth of the animal, in comparison with those of age-matched controls (C57BL/6). Several protein spots were detected around a region of pI 5.6-6.0 and molecular mass of 35-50 kDa in Mnd spinal cord tissue on the two-dimensional PAGE separation profile with Coomassie brilliant blue staining, while only a few spots around the same region were found in the control spinal cord. These spots were all immunoreactive with an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a cytoskeleton filamentous protein specific to astroglial cells. The protein spot with molecular mass of 50 kDa showed immunoreactivity with anti-GFAP antibody, had a blocked amino-terminus, and is assumed to be intact GFAP. Several protein spots with slightly smaller molecular masses of 35 to 48 kDa lacked the head domain of the GFAP molecule as a result of cleavage at the 29th and 56th residues from the amino terminus. In Mnd spinal cord tissue, the densities of the immunoreactive GFAP bands with smaller molecular masses increased with development, and became dominant at the time of the appearance of behavioral paralytic gait around 6 to 7 months of age. These results suggest that the increased GFAPs devoid of head domains are related to the degenerative loss of motor neurons in the Mnd spinal cord. Histopathological and GFAP immunohistochemical examination of Mnd spinal cord preparation demonstrated progressive degenerative loss of motor neurons, and considerable increases in number of GFAP-stained astrocytes in the ventral horn at 7 to 9 months of age. These processes of degenerative loss of motor neurons and proliferation of reactive astrocytes with increased levels of fragmented GFAP in the Mnd spinal cord during development seem to be characteristic and preceded the deterioration of motor activities in this animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","['Fujita K', 'Yamauchi M', 'Matsui T', 'Titani K', 'Takahashi H', 'Kato T', 'Isomura G', 'Ando M', 'Nagata Y']",1998,785,1,Brain Res,"Fujita K, et al.

9527894,Olfactory disorder in motor neuron disease.,"In Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease there is profound disorder of olfaction. The extent to which this modality is involved in motor neuron disease (MND) has been studied little. To address this further we assessed olfaction by three methods-a smell identification test (""UPSIT"") in 58 patients and 135 controls; olfactory-evoked response (OEP) to H2S in 15 patients, and pathological examination of olfactory bulbs obtained from 8 cadavers. It was found that smell identification compared with the controls was slightly worse overall in the MND group as a whole, but only the bulbar patients scored significantly less on the UPSIT. Patients displayed a subtle defect in cheese odor recognition. OEPs were normal in 9 subjects and delayed in 1 subject. The remaining 5 OEPs were unsuccessful. Histopathological studies of olfactory bulbs showed excess lipofuscin deposition in all 8 cases examined, indicating subclinical neuronal damage. Olfactory neurons with a degree of antioxidant defect may be more susceptible to cellular damage than other neuronal groups because of their direct relationship to environmental agents. Overall we found the degree of olfactory dysfunction in MND to be mild and in contrast with the marked changes described by others.","['Hawkes CH', 'Shephard BC', 'Geddes JF', 'Body GD', 'Martin JE']",1998,150,2,Exp Neurol,"Hawkes CH, et al.

9600738,"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (nclf), a new disorder of the mouse linked to chromosome 9.","The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) comprise a set of at least 6 distinct human and an unknown number of animal diseases characterized by storage of proteolipids in lysosomes of many cell types. By unknown mechanisms, this accumulation leads to or is associated with severe neuronal and retinal degeneration. The genes for 3 human NCLs, infantile, late infantile, and juvenile, have been cloned. The first murine form of NCL, the motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse, has been described and mapped to proximal Chromosome 8. Here we describe a second genetic variant of NCL in the mouse, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, nclf. These mice exhibited a phenotype that was almost exactly the same as that observed in mnd/mnd mice. Homozygous nclf mice developed progressive retinal atrophy early in life and become paralyzed at around 9 months of age. They accumulated luxol fast blue staining material in cytoplasm of neurons and many other cell types. Ultrastructurally, affected lysosomes had a ""finger print pattern"" with membranous material arranged in ""pentalaminar"" patterns. Affected mice developed severe cerebral gliosis in late stages of their disease. They also had severe Wallerian degeneration of long tracts in spinal cord and brain stem, lesions that accounted for the distinctive upper motor neuron signs displayed by both nclf/nclf and mnd/mnd mice. By crossing nclf/nclf mice with CAST/Ei mice, linkage analysis of nclf with respect to SSLP markers was performed, showing that nclf is located on Chromosome 9 between D9Mit164 and D9Mit165, in a region that is homologous with human Ch 15q21, where the gene for one variant of late infantile NCL, CLN6, recently has been mapped. The genes for two proteolipids known to be stored in lysosomes of animals and people with NCL were also mapped in this study and found not to map to the mnd or nclf loci nor to any mouse locus homologous to any known human NCL disease locus.","['Bronson RT', 'Donahue LR', 'Johnson KR', 'Tanner A', 'Lane PW', 'Faust JR']",1998,77,4,Am J Med Genet,"Bronson RT, et al.

9600674,Spinal cord GLT-1 glutamate transporter and blood glutamic acid alterations in motor neuron degeneration (Mnd) mice.,"This study characterizes for the first time neurochemical mechanisms in Mnd mice, initially described as a model of motor neuron disease and more recently proposed as a model for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. A selective decrease (-30%) of [3H]glutamate uptake was found in spinal cord but not cortical synaptosomes of Mnd mice aged 28 weeks, when they show histopathological alterations, complete blindness and moderate neurological deficits. In spite of the widespread presence of stored material in neurons in many brain regions and spinal cord, the active transport of [3H]serotonin, [3H]dopamine and depolarization-induced [3H]serotonin release were not affected. Spinal EAAC1 glutamate transporter protein was significantly decreased in some but not all aged mice by 36% on average, possibly due to the loss of motor neurons. GLT-1 immunoreactivity was reduced by 34% in 28-week-old Mnd mice, while GLAST immunoreactivity was not affected. In Mnd mice aged 14 weeks, when there was no apparent alteration of motor function, the defect in the glial transporter protein GLT-1 was similar to that in 28-week-old mice (25%). Blood glutamic acid concentration was increased in Mnd mice aged 14-22 weeks. We suggest that the early decrease of GLT-1 protein might raise the extrasynaptic glutamic acid concentration, and contribute to the loss of motor neurons in affected mice, resulting in low [3H]glutamate uptake, low EAAC1 immunoreactivity and neurological deficits.","['Mennini T', 'Bastone A', 'Crespi D', 'Comoletti D', 'Manzoni C']",1998,157,1,J Neurol Sci,"Mennini T, et al.

9591222,Radiological evidence of subclinical dysphagia in motor neuron disease.,"Dysphagia in motor neuron disease (MND) may lead to dangerous complications such as cachexia and aspiration pneumonia. Functional evaluation of the oropharyngeal tract is crucial for identifying specific swallowing dysfunctions and planning appropriate rehabilitation. As part of a multidisciplinary study on the treatment of dysphagia in patients with neuromuscular diseases, 23 MND patients with different degrees of dysphagia underwent videofluoroscopy, videopharyngolaryngoscopy and pharyngo-oesophageal manometry. The results of the three instrumental investigations were analysed in order (1) to define the pattern of swallowing in MND patients complaining of dysphagia; (2) to evaluate whether subclinical abnormalities may be detected; and (3) to assess the role of videofluoroscopy, videopharyngolaryngoscopy and manometry in the evaluation of MND patients with deglutition problems. Correlations between the instrumental findings and clinical features (age of the patients, duration and severity of the disease, presence and degree of dysphagia) were also assessed. The results of our study showed that: (1) The oral phase of deglutition was compromised most often, followed by the pharyngeal phase. (2) In all patients without clinical evidence of dysphagia, subclinical videofluoroscopic alterations were present in a pattern similar to that found in the dysphagic group. (3) Videofluoroscopy was the most sensitive technique in identifying oropharyngeal alterations of swallowing. Impairment of the oral phase, abnormal pharyngo-oesophageal motility and incomplete relaxation of the upper oesophageal sphincter were the changes most sensitive in detecting dysphagia. Videofluoroscopy was also capable of detecting preclinical abnormalities in non-dysphagic patients who later developed dysphagia. Practical guidelines for the use of instrumental investigations in the assessment and management of dysphagia in MND patients are proposed.","['Briani C', 'Marcon M', 'Ermani M', 'Costantini M', 'Bottin R', 'Iurilli V', 'Zaninotto G', 'Primon D', 'Feltrin G', 'Angelini C']",1998,245,4,J Neurol,"Briani C, et al.

In the general population, no homozygous SMNt deletion has been found, whereas 5% of centromeric SMN (SMNc) deletions can be observed. Although SMNt deletions appear causal for infantile and at least some adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (type IV), the respective role of SMN deletions remains unclear in adult-onset MNDs. We studied SMN gene in three different groups of patients with adult-onset MNDs. In sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; n = 177) and familial ALS (n = 66), no SMNt deletion had been found, and the frequency of SMNc deletions was not increased. Conversely, among the 14 patients with sporadic pure lower MND (LMND), we found 2 patients with homozygous SMNt deletions (14%) and 5 patients with homozygous SMNc deletions (36%). These data suggest that (1) SMNt deletions do not account for the major part, if any, of adult-onset LMND cases; and (2) SMNc deletions act as a susceptibility factor for LMNDs in adults. The clinical and genetic heterogeneity of LMND cases, including SMA type IV, are yet to be unexplained. Further studies on large groups of adult-onset LMND patients are warranted to refine its nosology.","['Moulard B', 'Salachas F', 'Chassande B', 'Briolotti V', 'Meininger V', 'Malafosse A', 'Camu W']",1998,43,5,Ann Neurol,"Moulard B, et al.

During the study period, four emigrants from Kozagawa had developed MND one to four decades after leaving the focus. Although the remarkable clustering of MND was thought to have disappeared, the southern Kii Peninsula remains a high-risk area for MND, especially if one interprets the data so as to include the emigrants.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of patients with terminal MND who were treated and died at the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei from March 1986 through April 1996. Patients' characteristics, management, length of survival and cause of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (M/F, 17/6) were included. The median age of onset was 59 years (range, 24-69). The median interval from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was nine months (range, 2-36). Seventeen patients received mechanical ventilation for an average median of six months. Nineteen patients had dysphagia, 17 received long-term nasogastric tube feeding, one had gastrostomy and one was treated with cricopharyngeal myotomy. Pain over the neck, trunk or limbs was reported by 18 patients; none received narcotics. Only two patients received respiratory exercise training and two had a cervical collar for stabilization. Electronic communication aids were not available. The median survival from onset of symptoms was 36 months (range, 7-99). The causes of death included sepsis (n = 13), respiratory failure (n = 7), heart disease (n = 2) and MND-related cachexia (n = 1). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 12 patients.

In the present study, we analyzed the in situ mRNA expression of calpain I and II and their endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin, in the motor neuron degeneration (Mnd) mutant mouse, which exhibits progressive dysfunction of the spinal cord and brain. As the disease progresses, the mutants show increasingly pronounced motor abnormalities which coincide with swelling of the spinal motor neurons, neocortex, hippocampal CA regions and cerebellar Purkinje cells. In situ hybridization studies show that the Mnd mice have a significantly higher level of calpain I, calpain II and calpastatin than the congenic controls in the following brain regions and cell types: hippocampal CA3 region, pyramidal cells, cerebellar Purkinje cells and spinal cord motor neurons. However, no differences in calpain or calpastatin mRNA levels are observed in glial and cerebellar granule cells of Mnd and control mice. Western blots and competitive RT-PCR analyses of brain and spinal cord homogenates are confirmative.

9528303,Frequency of motor neuron diseases in a Mexico City referral center.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the incidence and clinical characteristics of MND (Motor Neuron Diseases) in a Mexican institution.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: It was a retrospective study, of 274 definitive MND patients seen in a neurological reference hospital of Mexico City during the period of 1965-1995 (248 as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, 15 as Progressive Bulbar Palsy, 8 as Primary Lateral Sclerosis and 3 as Progressive Spinal Atrophy).
RESULTS: The frequency of MND increased gradually in our institution in the 31 years revised. The mean age of onset in our series was approximately 48 years in contrast to a higher age found in other series. The clinical features are similar to those found elsewhere.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the frequency of MND is increasing in Mexico in a similar fashion to that observed in the rest of the world. This makes conceivable that the incidence of MND in Mexico may also resemble the figures reported worldwide. Prospective population studies are required to establish the incidence of MND in Mexico.","['Otero-Siliceo E', 'Arriada-Mendicoa N', 'Corona-Vázquez T']",1997,49,6,Rev Invest Clin,"Otero-Siliceo E, et al.

Twenty-two percent of the patients were heterozygous, 2% homozygous for the CNTF mutation. Since the gene defect is per se not linked to MND, the identification of additional gene defects occurring simultaneously with this mutation could be informative for the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of MND.","['Giess R', 'Goetz R', 'Schrank B', 'Ochs G', 'Sendtner M', 'Toyka K']",1998,21,2,Muscle Nerve,"Giess R, et al.

9462467,CNS tissue Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutations in motor neurone disease (MND).,"DNA extracted from CNS tissue of 79 cases of motor neurone disease (MND) was screened by single strand conformation analysis (SSCA) and heteroduplex analysis (HA) for mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene. The aims were to determine whether somatic mutations of SOD1 may underlie some cases of MND and to characterize the genetic abnormalities by sequencing, for subsequent correlation with the molecular pathological phenotype. In 3 cases a point mutation was found in exon 4: E100G in one familial case, and I113T in two cases (one familial, one sporadic). Two cases had previously undescribed mutations in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of SOD1 and one case had a single base substitution in the intronic sequence upstream from exon 2. None of these patients had a positive family history. Non-CNS tissue was available for 3 out of the 6 cases in whom changes were found. In all 3 the same changes were consistently found in both CNS and non-CNS tissue, excluding the presence of somatic mutations in SOD1. We investigated many MND blood samples and normal controls for the presence of the 3'UTR deletions. We found the 4 bp deletion in 1/90 sporadic MND patients and 1/209 non-MND controls. If the 3'UTR deletions are pathogenic, they would have to operate via a loss of the function mechanism, and further work is necessary to define their significance.","['Shaw PJ', 'Tomkins J', 'Slade JY', 'Usher P', 'Curtis A', 'Bushby K', 'Ince PG']",1997,8,18,Neuroreport,"Shaw PJ, et al.

HTLV tax-rex DNA and antibodies in idiopathic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. J. Neurol. Sci. 129 (Suppl.) 140-144) that human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) tax-rex sequences are detectable in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 40% of patients with motor neurone disease (MND). In an attempt to confirm this we employed a highly sensitive 'nested' polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, capable of detecting single molecules of HTLV proviral DNA, to look for tax-rex sequences in the PBMCs of 43 patients with MND. We were unable to detect the presence of HTLV tax-rex in any of 43 MND patients tested, using three different PCR primer sets under both high and low stringency conditions. Using the same DNA samples we were able to detect the presence of the single-copy pyruvate dehydrogenase gene, thus demonstrating that the extracted DNA was indeed amplifiable by PCR. To further exclude the possibility that the extracted DNA samples contained unrecognised inhibitory factors we conducted spiking experiments with trace amounts (approximately 10 copies) of HTLV proviral DNA. Spiked samples yielded PCR products of the expected size. We are therefore unable to confirm the presence of HTLV tax-rex sequences in this disease.","['Andrews WD', 'Al-Chalabi A', 'Garson JA']",1997,153,1,J Neurol Sci,"Andrews WD, et al.

The mutation is a heteroplasmic 5-bp microdeletion located in the 5' end of the COI gene, leading to premature termination of the corresponding translation product. Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and single-fiber polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a tight correlation between COX defect, COX I expression, and percentage of mutation. COX subunits II, III, and IV were decreased as well, suggesting a defective assembly of COX holoenzyme. The mutation was associated with a clinical phenotype unusual for a mitochondrial disorder, that is, an isolated motor neuron disease (MND) with some atypical findings, including early onset, preferential involvement of the upper motor neuron, and increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content. MND may arise from impaired scavenging and overproduction of free oxygen radicals, a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Our observation suggests that OXPHOS impairment could play a role in the pathogenesis of some MND cases.","['Comi GP', 'Bordoni A', 'Salani S', 'Franceschina L', 'Sciacco M', 'Prelle A', 'Fortunato F', 'Zeviani M', 'Napoli L', 'Bresolin N', 'Moggio M', 'Ausenda CD', 'Taanman JW', 'Scarlato G']",1998,43,1,Ann Neurol,"Comi GP, et al.

9450673,Expression of the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2 in the human CNS: an immunohistochemical study.,"Glutamate transporters play an essential role in terminating the excitatory glutamatergic signal at post-synaptic receptors and in protecting neurones from excitotoxic effects, as well as replenishing the neurotransmitter supply at glutamatergic synapses. The distribution and density of glutamate transporters may be important determinants of vulnerability to glutamate-mediated injury. There is emerging evidence that glutamate transporter dysfunction may be present in motor neurone disease (MND). In this study, a monoclonal antibody, suitable for immunohistochemistry (IHC) in human post-mortem tissue, was produced to the human astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT2 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2). Western blotting of homogenates of human cortical tissue with the EAAT2 antibody produced a discrete band at 66 kDa. Detailed IHC analysis of the expression of the EAAT2 protein in the human CNS was undertaken. EAAT2 was exclusively localised to astrocytes, with preferential expression in the caudate nucleus, nucleus basalis of Meynert, spinal ventral horn, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but with lower levels of expression throughout many other CNS regions. Motor neurone groups vulnerable to neurodegeneration in MND appeared distinctive in being surrounded by extensive, coarse, strongly immunoreactive perisomatic glial profiles. Motor neurone groups which tend to be spared in MND, such as those present in the oculomotor nucleus, showed a lower expression of EAAT2, with fewer perisomatic profiles. The EAAT2 antibody will provide a useful tool for increasing our understanding of the role of EAAT2 in excitatory neurotransmission in health and disease states.","['Milton ID', 'Banner SJ', 'Ince PG', 'Piggott NH', 'Fray AE', 'Thatcher N', 'Horne CH', 'Shaw PJ']",1997,52,1,Brain Res Mol Brain Res,"Milton ID, et al.

9419059,Assessment of depression in patients with motor neuron disease and other neurologically disabling illness.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is a severely disabling, relentlessly progressive neurological condition with a marked reduction in life expectancy which might be expected to be associated with significant depression and psychological dysfunction following diagnosis. There is very little data on the incidence of depression in MND and most of the published evidence would suggest that depression is rare in patients with MND, especially when compared to other neurologically disabling illnesses. We have studied 40 patients with MND and compared them to a group of 92 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) attending a neurology clinic. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Index (BDI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). There was no difference in incidence or severity of depression in these two patient groups. For the whole study group there was no difference in depression scores when compared by age, gender or marital status. Depression scores showed a weak association with increasing physical disability measured by the SF36 Physical Function scale for the MS group but there was no association between depression levels and SF36 physical function for the MND group. The MND group did, however, show a significant association between depression scores and pain measured by the SF36 scale. Anxiety levels (HAD scale) were shown to be significantly higher in females and married (versus single, widowed or divorced) subjects for the group as a whole. We conclude that depression is at least as common in MND patients as other neurologically disabled patients with MS and may often be associated with significant pain. Physicians and others involved in the care of patients with MND should be aware that depression and pain may be significant problems irrespective of the level of physical disability.","['Tedman BM', 'Young CA', 'Williams IR']",1997,152 Suppl 1,,J Neurol Sci,"Tedman BM, et al.

9419054,MR spectroscopy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.,"Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) have been used to identify neuronal dysfunction and/or loss in vivo in patients with various neurological diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND). Both long and short echo time (TE) proton spectroscopy reveal the brain metabolites choline (Cho), creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr), and N-acetyl (NA) groups. Because NA groups are localized to mature neurons and Cr is homogeneously distributed throughout the brain, the NA/Cr ratio is considered an index of neuronal integrity. Long TE proton spectroscopic studies have revealed significantly decreased NA/Cr values in the sensorimotor cortex and brainstem of patients with ALS, consistent with neuronal dysfunction and/or loss. The amount of NA/Cr decrease appears to be directly proportional to the degree of clinical upper motor neuron deficit. Short TE 1H-MRS and 1H-MRSI also reveal other metabolites such as glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln), which have been implicated in the ALS/MND disease process. Preliminary results of short TE 1H-MRSI of the medulla in patients with ALS/MND have revealed significantly decreased NA/Cr values and abnormally elevated Glu+Gln/Cr ratios, compared to control individuals. The latter values were higher in patients with more rapid disease. Although it is unclear whether the elevation of Glu+Gln/Cr precedes or follows the neuronal (and axonal) degeneration in the medulla of these patients, its occurrence provides in vivo evidence of abnormal glutamate metabolism in the CNS parenchyma of patients with ALS/MND.",['Pioro EP'],1997,152 Suppl 1,,J Neurol Sci,Pioro EP.

9382875,Neurofilaments and orthograde transport are reduced in ventral root axons of transgenic mice that express human SOD1 with a G93A mutation.,"Mice engineered to express a transgene encoding a human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) with a Gly93 --> Ala (G93A) mutation found in patients who succumb to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) develop a rapidly progressive and fatal motor neuron disease (MND) similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Hallmark ALS lesions such as fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and neurofilament (NF)-rich inclusions in surviving spinal cord motor neurons as well as the selective degeneration of this population of neurons were also observed in these animals. Since the mechanism whereby mutations in SOD1 lead to MND remains enigmatic, we asked whether NF inclusions in motor neurons compromise axonal transport during the onset and progression of MND in a line of mice that contained approximately 30% fewer copies of the transgene than the original G93A (Gurney et al., 1994). The onset of MND was delayed in these mice compared to the original G93A mice, but they developed the same neuropathologic abnormalities seen in the original G93A mice, albeit at a later time point with fewer vacuoles and more NF inclusions. Quantitative Western blot analyses showed a progressive decrease in the level of NF proteins in the L5 ventral roots of G93A mice and a concomitant reduction in axon caliber with the onset of motor weakness. By approximately 200 d, both fast and slow axonal transports were impaired in the ventral roots of these mice coincidental with the appearance of NF inclusions and vacuoles in the axons and perikarya of vulnerable motor neurons. This is the first demonstration of impaired axonal transport in a mouse model of ALS, and we infer that similar impairments occur in authentic ALS. Based on the temporal correlation of these impairments with the onset of motor weakness and the appearance of NF inclusions and vacuoles in vulnerable motor neurons, the latter lesions may be the proximal cause of motor neuron dysfunction and degeneration in the G93A mice and in FALS patients with SOD1 mutations.","['Zhang B', 'Tu P', 'Abtahian F', 'Trojanowski JQ', 'Lee VM']",1997,139,5,J Cell Biol,"Zhang B, et al.

However, with the development of a new hybrid, the C57BL/6J x New Zealand Black (B6NZB) wr/wr mouse, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to establish the preclinical diagnosis. We compared the clinical and histological features of MND and the effects of neurotrophic factor cotreatment between the hybrid B6NZB-wr/wr and the congenic C57BL/6J-wr/wr mice. Clinical assessments of body weight, grip strength, running speed, paw position, and walking pattern were made weekly from age 2 weeks through 8 weeks (n = 10, B6NZB-wr/wr; n = 15, C57BL/6J-wr/wr). Survival was analyzed (n = 7, each strain) as was C5 and C6 spinal cord motoneuron morphology and ventral root histometry (n = 7, each strain). For cotreatment, 8 B6NZB-wr/wr and 7 C57BL/6J-wr/wr mice received subcutaneous ciliary neurotrophic factor (1 mg/kg) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (5 mg/kg) on alternate days, 6 days/week for 4 weeks. B6NZB-wr/wr mice could be distinguished from C57BL/6J-wr/wr mice at age 3 weeks by a more abnormal paw position (P < 0.01) and walking pattern (P < 0.05) and lower grip strength (P < 0.001) and running speed (P < 0.001). After 3 weeks, the changes continued to be greater in B6NZB-wr/wr mice. Although B6NZB-wr/wr mice were more severely affected early in the disease, their survival was comparable to C57BL/6J-wr/wr mice. Anterior horn cell vacuolar degeneration and myelinated fiber histometry were similar in both strains. The clinical response to CNTF/BDNF cotreatment was marked in both groups although it was weaker in B6NZB-wr/wr mice. Thus, the hybrid B6NZB-wr/wr mice have a more severe clinical phenotype and offer a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of presymptomatic motor neuron degeneration and the effects of therapeutic agents for human MND.","['Ishiyama T', 'Klinkosz B', 'Pioro EP', 'Mitsumoto H']",1997,148,1,Exp Neurol,"Ishiyama T, et al.

9363524,Differential features of motor neuron disease mortality in Spain.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to describe the temporal and spatial patterns of motor neuron disease (MND) in Spain.
METHODS: We studied data where MND was stated as the principal cause of death in official statistics from Spain. Time trends were analysed for age-, sex-specific and age-adjusted rates for the period 1951-1990. Age-adjusted mortality and relative risk, obtained by Poisson regression adjusting for age, were calculated for each province from deaths during the period 1975-1988. Maps were constructed using log transformed rates. Statistical significance of spatial aggregation was assessed using the Ohno et al. test.
RESULTS: The 1951-1990 mortality rate, age- and sex-adjusted to the European population, for the population aged > or = 40 years was 1.49 per 100,000; 1.90 and 1.21 for males and females respectively. In general, mortality increased with age. Age-adjusted rates rose until 1960, dropped by 70% during the 1960s and declined slightly over the 1951-1990 period as a whole. From 1970 onwards MND mortality rose evenly, particularly in the 60-69 age group. A North-South gradient was suggested for both sexes with statistically significant clustering in the Northern coastal regions and--for males alone--in the Midwest provinces.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from MND in Spain displayed a magnitude and recently rising temporal trend similar to that described in several other countries. Specific traits were: a decrease during the 1960s, which has been described for Japan only, as well as spatial heterogeneity and a predominant recent increase among the 60-69 age group. The determinants of these unusual MND mortality patterns are unknown.","['Veiga-Cabo J', 'Almazán-Isla J', 'Sendra-Gutiérrez JM', 'de Pedro-Cuesta J']",1997,26,5,Int J Epidemiol,"Veiga-Cabo J, et al.

A number of different treatments to decrease the progression of neuronal cell loss have been proposed; these include: Bcl-2 (B-cell leukaemia oncogene-2), neurotrophic factors, glutamate receptor inhibitors and Ca2+ channel antagonists. In this review Yves Sagot, Richard Vejsada and Ann C. Kato focus on the effects of neurotrophic factors and Bcl-2, both of which have been shown to prevent cell death in various experimental paradigms. Studies performed in animal models of MND have confirmed the potential of these molecules to support motoneurone survival. Some of them have been shown to act in synergy and these results are discussed in the context of molecular mechanisms leading to collaborative and synergistic activities, and also with respect to presumptive subpopulations of motoneurones, which express diverse receptors for neurotrophic factors. Finally, the current status of clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using neurotrophic factors will be discussed, as well as recent reports that neurotrophic factors can exert adverse effects on neuronal survival.","['Sagot Y', 'Vejsada R', 'Kato AC']",1997,18,9,Trends Pharmacol Sci,"Sagot Y, et al.

With respect to the underlying mechanisms of SIADH in the cases, we considered two factors; 1) dysfunction of the feedback system in ADH secretion via intrathoracic volume receptors caused by changes in intrathoracic circulation, and 2) primarily functional abnormalities in the limbic system which could influence hypothalamic osmoreceptors.

A total of 110 cases were studied and they constituted 0.11% of all neurological cases seen in the general OPD. Of 110 cases, amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS) constituted 43.6%, progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) 10.9%, post-polio progressive muscular atrophy (PPMA) 1.8%, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) 20%, atypical form Madras pattern of MND (MMND) 0.9% and monomelic amyotrophy (MMA) 22.7% of cases. Disease is more common in males than females and average duration of symptoms before presentation varied from 1 to 12 months. Most of the patients were either agricultural labourers or manual workers in ALS variety whereas MMA variety was evenly distributed in both hard labourers and sedentary workers. Most of the patients in MMA and SMA groups presented before 30 years of age whereas ALS and PMA group presented after 30 years. Trauma was the commonest antecedent event in ALS and MMA followed by electrocution in the same two groups. Family history was found to be absent in SMA group though the disease is considered as a hereditary one. Weakness of the limbs and wasting of the muscles were common presenting symptoms and signs. Bulbar symptoms and signs were found only in the ALS group. EMG showed neurogenic pattern and mixed pattern in most of the patients in all groups. Only a few patients showed myopathic pattern.

The findings were compared with those of the previously reported case groups: n-hexane polyneuropathy (HPNP), inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDP), and motor neuron disease (MND). Muscle responses elicited by magnetic stimulation had very high rates of amplitude and area loss in the neck-axilla segments of the 6 SP patients. This, along with the other electrophysiological findings, suggested the presence of segmentally demyelinating plexus lesions. In NTOS patients, magnetic stimulation findings were not significantly different from those of the controls. Neck-axilla segment amplitude and are reduction rates in SP and IDP patients were significantly higher than those found in NTOS, HPNP, and MND groups, implying that magnetic nerve root stimulation may have a role in the demonstration of segmentally demyelinating lesions involving proximal nerve segments.","['Oge AE', 'Boyaciyan A', 'Gürvit H', 'Yazici J', 'Değirmenci M', 'Kantemir E']",1997,20,7,Muscle Nerve,"Oge AE, et al.

9219739,British motor neuron disease twin study.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cause of sporadic motor neuron disease (MND) by twin study, so allowing (1) estimation of the genetic contribution, and (2) collection of matched pairs for a case-control study of possible environmental factors.
METHODS: 10872 death certificates bearing the diagnosis MND were collected from 1979 to 1989 inclusive. Inspection of individual birth entries allowed identification of potential twins. The status of each co-twin was determined and contact made through the National Health Service Central Register (NHS-CR) and their general practitioner (GP). The diagnosis of MND was verified via the co-twin and relatives, and medical records where available. Zygosity was assessed using a recognised questionnaire. Details concerning environmental exposures and health were gathered by interview of cotwin and relatives using a semistructured questionnaire. Heritability (h2) of MND was estimated, and the environmental information was analysed by conditional logistic regression modelling.
RESULTS: Seventy seven probands were identified, of whom 26 were monozygotic and 51 dizygotic. Four monozygotic probands were concordant, but two probands came from a family known to have familial MND. The estimated heritability was between 0.38 and 0.85. Most environmental risk factors were not significant. Regular vehicle maintenance (odds ratio (OR) = 7.0; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.3-89.9) and occupational paint usage (OR = 3.75; 95% CI 1.0-17.1), however, occurred significantly more often in the affected cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This ""death discordant"" method for twin collection has proved to be viable, and has allowed the ascertainment of a large population sample in a rare disease. The genetic role in sporadic MND is substantial, and higher than expected. Exposure to industrial chemicals, particularly constituents of petrochemicals and paints, may contribute to the aetiology of MND.","['Graham AJ', 'Macdonald AM', 'Hawkes CH']",1997,62,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Graham AJ, et al.

9189033,Motor neuron syndromes in cancer patients.,"Previous reports indicate that motor neuron disease (MND) may rarely be associated with systemic cancer. We have encountered 14 patients with MND and cancer who formed three distinct groups. Group 1: Three patients developed a rapidly progressive MND, less prominent symptoms of involvement of other areas of the nervous system, and anti-Hu antibodies. Group 2: Five women developed signs of upper motor neuron (UMN) disease, initially resembling primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), and breast cancer. In 4, symptoms of UMN occurred within 3 months of cancer diagnosis or tumor recurrence. They had no metastases or spinal cord compression. Serum anti-neuronal antibodies were negative. Three patients are alive (follow-up of 156, 15, and 12 months), and 2 remain without lower motor neuron signs. Group 3: Six patients developed MND resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis between 47 months before and 48 months after their cancer diagnosis. In group 1, the MND associated with the anti-Hu antibody is unequivocally paraneoplastic. In group 2, the proximate onset of MND with the diagnosis of cancer or its recurrence, its pure or long-lasting UMN signs, and its association with breast cancer, suggest that the disorder may be paraneoplastic. Although for most cancer patients who develop MND the occurrence of both disorders is probably coincidental, in some patients with MND a careful search for an underlying cancer is warranted (ie, patients in groups 1 and 2).","['Forsyth PA', 'Dalmau J', 'Graus F', 'Cwik V', 'Rosenblum MK', 'Posner JB']",1997,41,6,Ann Neurol,"Forsyth PA, et al.

9106116,Immunocytochemical study of the distribution of the free radical scavenging enzymes Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1); MN superoxide dismutase (MN SOD) and catalase in the normal human spinal cord and in motor neuron disease.,"Interest in free radical-mediated mechanisms of motor neuron injury has arisen following the discovery of point mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene in a proportion of cases of familial motor neuron disease (MND). Evidence is emerging which indicates that oxidative stress may contribute to the pathophysiology of sporadic MND. Free radical scavenging enzymes form a major component of the anti-oxidant defense system. The aim of this study was to compare the distribution and density of immunoreactivity to Cu/Zn SOD. Mn SOD and catalase in the spinal cord of sporadic MND cases (n = 10) compared to normal controls (n = 8). There was abundant expression of Cu/Zn SOD, Mn SOD and catalase in spinal motor neurons, suggesting important roles for these enzymes in neuroprotective pathways in this cell group. In MND cases, there was no evidence in surviving motor neurons of a consistent alteration in the protein expression of any of these enzymes. There was evidence of increased expression of these enzymes in glial cells present in the ventral and intermediate grey matter and degenerating descending motor pathways of the spinal cord in MND cases. The changes observed were more marked in the cervical compared to lumbar spinal segments. Further investigation is required to determine whether these findings represent a compensatory response to a pathophysiological process involving oxidative stress.","['Shaw PJ', 'Chinnery RM', 'Thagesen H', 'Borthwick GM', 'Ince PG']",1997,147,2,J Neurol Sci,"Shaw PJ, et al.

Whether monoclonal gammopathies play a role in the pathogenesis of MND is unclear but is la possible that patients might have antibodies against motor neurons.

9111507,"Oxidative stress, mutant SOD1, and neurofilament pathology in transgenic mouse models of human motor neuron disease.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem. About 10% of all ALS cases are familial (FALS), inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. One fifth of FALS patients carry mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, and several lines of transgenic mice have been engineered to express mutant forms of the SOD1 gene that are linked to FALS. Significantly, many of these transgenic lines of mice develop a motor neuron disease (MND) that resembles human FALS. Oxidative stress induced by human SOD1 mutations is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of FALS and the FALS-like MND seen in the mutant SOD1 transgenic mice. For example, two lines of these mice showed prominent degeneration of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in spinal cord neurons. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that neurofilament (NF)-rich spheroids. Lewy body-like NF inclusions, altered ubiquitin immunoreactivity, and Golgi fragmentation occur in the spinal cord motoneurons of these mutant SOD1 transgenic mice. Because these lesions recapitulate hallmark abnormalities of human ALS, mutant SOD1 transgenic mice provide a useful model for studies designed to elucidate the pathogenesis of ALS. Furthermore, transgenic mice that overexpress NF proteins also develop a clinical and pathologic phenotype similar to human MND, and polymorphisms in an NF gene have been linked to patients with ALS. Collectively, these observations implicate NF protein abnormalities in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Accordingly, this review summarizes recent insights into mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS that have emerged from studies of these new animal models of this neurodegenerative disease.","['Tu PH', 'Gurney ME', 'Julien JP', 'Lee VM', 'Trojanowski JQ']",1997,76,4,Lab Invest,"Tu PH, et al.

We examined the spectra acquired from a 20 x 20 x 20-mm3 voxel placed in the motor cortex and in the cerebellum from seven patients with clinically probable or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) according to the El Escorial criteria, from three patients with suspected ALS (progressive muscular atrophy), and from eight normal control subjects. We estimated the concentrations of the metabolites using the water signal as an internal standard. The concentrations of Cho and Cr/PCr in both brain regions, as well as the concentration of NAA in the cerebellum, were unaltered in the MND patients compared with the controls. Only MND patients with both upper and lower motor neuron signs had a significantly decreased concentration of NAA (9.13 +/- 0.28 mM, mean +/- SEM) in the primary motor cortex when compared with healthy controls (10.03 +/- 0.22 mM). In conclusion, the slightly decreased concentration of NAA in the primary motor cortex from ALS patients may represent a loss of neurons in this region.","['Gredal O', 'Rosenbaum S', 'Topp S', 'Karlsborg M', 'Strange P', 'Werdelin L']",1997,48,4,Neurology,"Gredal O, et al.

9098676,Diagnostic value of recruitment order in routine EMG.,"In this report a new technique of recording, employed for the first time in routine clinical electromyography (EMG) is described. Conventional analysis is extended to the order of recruitment pattern, and relates the new electrophysiological features to current data about anatomical reorganization of all active motor units (MUs) and their functional effectiveness in neuromuscular disorders. This new concept was tested in four groups of patients (two different myopathic disorders), and (two neuropathies), which were compared to normal subjects. The data obtained confirmed that in normal subjects isometric muscle contraction from weak to maximal effort, was characterized by recruitment of MUs in an orderly pattern according to the ""size principle"". In polymyositis patients representing the myopathy model a nearly normal range of functioning MUs was found, but their sizes were reduced to a greater extent in the low threshold population. Irrespective of their increased firing rate and variability, the orderly recruitment pattern was still maintained. A different picture was seen in patients with Duchenne dystrophy where the range of functioning MUs and their sizes were reduced with the characteristic lack of high amplitude MUs, (probably high threshold). In the neurogenic groups the range of functioning MUs was reduced but increased in size, and the pattern of recruitment evidently became disorderly. We also found a difference in the manner of disorderly recruitment between motor neuron range disease (MND) and polyneuropathy patients. In the MND group the surviving MUs create very narrow and probably only high threshold MUs with a tendency to their synchronization seen evidently during maximal effort. In the peripheral neuropathy group, the functioning MUs represented wider range of very different sizes, and they were often recruited asynchronously during maximal effort, giving lower amplitudes and rather higher density of record not proportional to the number of MUs lost.",['Kopeć J'],1997,37,2,Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol,Kopeć J.

9052809,The reorganization of motor units in motor neuron disease.,"We studied 78 patients with motor neuron disease (MND) using concentric needle electromyography. Analysis on weak and maximal effort was performed using our own, fully automated, computer method, EMG-LAB. In addition to the conventional parameters of single motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) and interference pattern, new criteria were applied: the range of the acting motor units and the functional recruitment order. A total of 375 muscles of MND patients and 120 control muscles were investigated. The electromyographic data were analyzed separately in five groups of muscles, classified A, B, C, D, and E according to their clinical condition. Those results allowed us to discern six neurophysiological stages (N(0,1,2,3,4,5)) from the early to the most advanced phase. It has been confirmed that reinnervation in MND is adequate to compensate for the loss of over 50% of motor neurons but it is only a transitory phase in the morbid course. At stages N(O-5), the electrophysiological data reflect structural and functional integrity of the functioning motor units. Evaluation of not only single MUAPs but also of the full range of acting motor units and their recruitment order allowed a deeper look into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.","['Emeryk-Szajewska B', 'Kopéc J', 'Karwanska A']",1997,20,3,Muscle Nerve,"Emeryk-Szajewska B, et al.

9245501,The motor neuron degeneration (mnd) gene acts intrinsically in motor neurons and peripheral fibroblasts.,"In motor neuron degeneration (mnd/mnd) mice, multiple cell types develop cytopathology and motor neurons degenerate prematurely. Here, to investigate whether the expression of mnd within affected cells is responsible, we analyzed the evolution of cellular pathology in aggregation chimeras containing cells of both mnd/mnd and +/+ genotypes. In addition, skin fibroblasts were maintained in vitro in the absence of other cell types and examined for their disease manifestation. In the chimeras, neuronal genotype was identified by expression of an unrelated transgene. Consistent with an intrinsic action of mnd, the genotype and phenotype of motor neurons correlated perfectly. In addition, abnormal lipopigment accumulation, signifying the disease phenotype, evolved in the cultured fibroblasts. We conclude that neurons and fibroblasts develop pathological abnormalities in response to intrinsic expression of the mnd mutation. Further, as cellular pathology is not attenuated in the chimeric environment, it is unlikely that mnd and its human counterparts, neuronal caroid lipofuscinoses, will be responsive to a treatment strategy involving transplantation of normal cells.","['Porter JC', 'Messer A', 'Peterson A']",1997,9,3,Mol Cell Neurosci,"Porter JC, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty patients with MS, twenty with MND and sixty-four apparently normal control were studied, to evaluate the use of MEP in such patients. Bilateral recordings were made from the abductor pollicis brevis and tibialis anterior. The variables studied were: cortical latency, radicular latency, central conduction time, motor excitation threshold coefficients of amplitude, duration and number of phases.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in most variables when the control group and the patients were compared, and also between the two subgroups of patients (Wilk's lambda = 0.4197; p < 0.05). CA analysis significantly increased the sensitivity of the study (90.4%) with respect to analysis of latencies and central conduction times (70.4%). When analysis of the coefficients of duration and of phases was included, specificity increased by approximately 30% in both groups of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The great sensitivity of MEP as a neurophysiological diagnostic tool in investigation of corticospinal bundle lesions was demonstrated.","['Gómez-Fernández L', 'Macías-González RJ', 'Mustelier R', 'Estrada R', 'Gámez-Morales L', 'Paz-Sendín L']",1996,24,136,Rev Neurol,"Gómez-Fernández L, et al.

While accumulation of proteolipid in the hippocampus of chimeric mice composed of mnd and +/+ cells was found to be proportional to the contribution of mnd in the brain, accumulation within individual cells was the same for cells from chimeric and age-matched mnd mice. Bone marrow transplantation was used to altering the milieu of circulating factors to determine whether this might modify the disease phenotype in mnd mice. Transplantation of bone marrow in neonatal or young mice did not reduce the age-associated accumulation of proteolipid within hippocampal neurons.

Motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mutant mice display adult onset symptoms reflecting progressive motor debilitation and provide a model in which to test the hypothesis that CNTF can prevent the loss of these motor functions. We generated mnd mice that harbor a genomically integrated transgene, resulting in overexpression of the encoded CNTF protein in these mice. In contrast to the beneficial effects of CNTF in preventing motor neuron degeneration in other experimental paradigms, we report that overproduction of CNTF increased the rate of onset of motor disease symptoms in mnd mice and the presence of the transgene correlated with low adult body weight in mnd and wild-type genetic backgrounds.","['Winter CG', 'Saotome Y', 'Saotome I', 'Hirsh D']",1996,31,3,J Neurobiol,"Winter CG, et al.

DESIGN: Medical chart review.
SETTING: University medical center.
PATIENTS: Thirteen patients, identified by computer-assisted search, who had diagnoses of both parkinsonism and MND.
RESULTS: Median age was 68 years. There were 7 men and 6 women. All had clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. One or more clinical manifestations of parkinsonism were observed in all patients either before the diagnosis of MND (n = 2), at the time of initial evaluation (n = 10), or after the diagnosis of MND (n = 1). The median time from symptom onset to presentation was 18 months. Improvement was seen in 5 of the 11 patients treated with levodopa. Dementia and autonomic dysfunction were absent in all patients. Postmortem neuropathological evaluation, available in 1 patient, demonstrated degeneration of the substantia nigra with Lewy bodies, mild pallor of the medullary pyramids, and neurogenic atrophy of the skeletal muscle.
CONCLUSION: The onset of MND and parkinsonism within a relatively short period in most of our patients favors a common pathogenic mechanism over coincidental occurrence of 2 unrelated diseases.

8899668,Identification of brain metabolites by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in MND/ALS.,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has provided a novel means of studying the brain biochemistry of motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS) patients in vivo in situ. Previous studies have demonstrated changes in the ratios of areas under specific spectral peaks in MND/ALS patients (Jones et al., 1995). However, the significance of such findings cannot be fully elucidated without first ascertaining the biochemical identity of each peak. Each peak in a MRS spectrum corresponds to the resonance of specific protons in a particular chemical environment. Many biochemicals contain similar protons in similar environments so it is possible that a single spectral peak could represent protons from more than one biochemical. In this study of major brain MRS peaks we have demonstrated that peaks are potentially composed of a number of protons from different chemicals. For example, the peak at chemical shift 2.01 ppm, conventionally recognised as the neurotransmitter N-acetyl aspartate, may actually be a result of the protons of the N-acetyl moiety (Frahm et al., 1991). We have consequently shown that other N-acetylated compounds such as N-acetyl glutamate are also capable of producing a peak here, whereas their non-acetylated derivatives are not. We have also shown GABA is capable of producing a peak at chemical shift 3.00 ppm, a peak which is generally assigned to creatine/phosphocreatine. These findings have important implications in the identification of spectral peaks in MRS studies and in the interpretation of spectral differences between MND patients and controls.","['Knight JM', 'Jones AP', 'Redmond JP', 'Shaw IC']",1996,139 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,"Knight JM, et al.

8899664,Serotonergic neurotransmission in the spinal cord and motor cortex of patients with motor neuron disease and controls: quantitative autoradiography for 5-HT1a and 5-HT2 receptors.,"Serotonin 5-HT is a potent modulator of motor neuron excitability in the spinal cord. Serotonergic neurotransmission, because of its effects on glutamatergic excitation, may be relevant to the pathogenesis and therapy of motor neuron disease (MND). The human motor system was studied at two levels, spinal cord and motor cortex, by autoradiography for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor subclasses. In addition, biochemical estimations of indole metabolites were performed in the spinal cord. Post mortem tissue from control cases and MND patients showed a reduction in 5-HT1A receptor binding in the cervical (p < 0.01) but not lumbar ventral horn in MND. 5-HT2 receptors were preserved in the ventral horn at both levels and were focally abundant around motor neuron somata. Tissue levels of 5-HT were unchanged in the spinal cord in MND. The metabolite 5-HIAA was increased in the cervical spinal cord in MND as was the molar ratio of 5HIAA:5-HT, implying that there may be an increased turnover of 5HT. In the motor cortex and premotor cortex the 5-HT1A receptor remained unchanged in MND. There was a 20% reduction in 5-HT2 receptor binding sites (p < 0.05) across all the cortical laminae with preservation of the normal pattern of laminar binding. These changes in two levels of the motor system in MND most likely represent physiological adaptations in the spinal cord and motor cortex rather than primary involvement of the serotonergic system in the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Forrest V', 'Ince P', 'Leitch M', 'Marshall EF', 'Shaw PJ']",1996,139 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,"Forrest V, et al.

8899663,Glycine effects on glutamate-receptor elicited acetylcholinesterase release from slices and synaptosomes of the spinal ventral horn.,"To study the mechanisms by which glutamate-elicited acetylcholinesterase release (GEAR) might play a part in the pathogenesis of excitotoxically triggered motor neurone disease, and to investigate the interaction of GEAR with spinal glycinergic mechanisms, we measured acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and cholinergic markers, after stimulating ventral horn slices and synaptosomes from the mouse spinal cord, with both glutamate- and glycine-receptor agonists. Glutamate (GLU), kainate and AMPA, as well as glycine (GLY) evoked dose-related, calcium-dependent liberation of soluble forms of AChE from both slices and synaptosomes. GLY-evoked AChE release showed remarkable age-related postnatal changes. In the immature slice of the ventral horn. GLY potentiated the GEAR response in the presence of strychnine, suggesting N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor involvement, and was also able to evoke a strychnine-sensitive AChE release in the absence of exogenous GLU. After the 28th postnatal day, nearly all the AChE secreted was released either after the activation of non-NMDA glutamate receptors or by strychnine-sensitive GLY-evoked AChE release mechanisms. Both GEAR and GLY-evoked AChE release might impair the negative feedback loop which modulates the overactivation of motor neurones, and cause prolonged extracellular rises of soluble AChE. These effects might augment the vulnerability of motor neurones to excitotoxic stress, promote fiber outgrowth, and eventually accelerate the metabolic exhaustion of lower motor neurones. It is possible that the mechanisms described are operative at the spinal cord of ALS/MND patients.","['Rodríguez-Ithurralde D', 'Olivera S', 'La Paz A', 'Vincent O', 'Rondeau A']",1996,139 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,"Rodríguez-Ithurralde D, et al.

8899657,The control of oral secretions in bulbar ALS/MND.,"For the bulbar ALS/MND patient with dysphagia, the accumulation of oral secretions is a distressing problem. The control of these secretions, particularly the thick mucus form, is very difficult. In approaching this problem it is important to realise that the source of these secretions is not just from the oral salivary glands. The nose and lungs also contribute a constant flow of serous and particularly mucoid fluids. The neural control of these different forms of secretion is of importance in controlling them. Stimulation of cholinergic receptors produces thin serous secretions whereas beta adrenergic receptors produce thick protein and mucus-rich secretions. Therefore 16 bulbar ALS/MND patients were treated with beta antagonists after maximising other therapy. 75% of this group had fast and significant relief from their thick secretions. It is therefore proposed to perform a large controlled trial of beta blockers in the control of thick oral secretions in ALS/MND based on these promising pilot data.","['Newall AR', 'Orser R', 'Hunt M']",1996,139 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,"Newall AR, et al.

8899656,Relationships between motor-unit number estimates and isometric strength in distal muscles in ALS/MND.,"Measurement of progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) is useful for charting the natural history and assessing efficacy in drug trials. Common measures are maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) which mainly focuses on-proximal muscles, and electrophysiologic measures of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and motor-unit number estimation (MUNE) which focus on distal muscles. We have undertaken a study to compare the relationships between MVIC, CMAP and MUNE recorded in intrinsic hand muscles of 10 subjects with ALS/MND. Grip and pinch (between the first and fifth digits) MVIC were recorded. The CMAP and MUNE (determined by the multipoint stimulation technique) were recorded from thenar and hypothenar muscle groups. To facilitate comparisons between strength and electrophysiologic measures, the MUNE values and the CMAP values from the thenar and hypothenar muscle groups were each summed. Test-retest correlations were high for all measures (r = 0.75-0.99). Pinch and grip MVIC were highly correlated (r = 0.83). However, MVIC measures showed weaker correlations with summed MUNE values (pinch r = 0.56, grip r = 0.64) and summed CMAP values (pinch r = 0.58 and grip r = 0.65). The weak correlations between MVIC and electrophysiologic measures are due to two factors. First, grip and pinch MVIC are correlated through co-activation of agonist muscle groups, for we recorded strong concomitant muscle activity from forearm flexor muscles during pinch. In contrast, CMAP and MUNE reflect measurement from isolated muscle groups in the hand. Second, MVIC and the CMAP are affected by collateral reinnervation and only indirectly assess motor-unit loss, while MUNE is uninfluenced by reinnervation and directly addresses the degree of motor-unit loss. These factors determine the information available from endpoint measures. We offer guidelines for choosing useful measures based upon the goals of a given study.","['Bromberg MB', 'Larson WL']",1996,139 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,Bromberg MB and Larson WL.

8899653,Role of SOD-1 and nitric oxide/cyclic GMP cascade on neurofilament aggregation in ALS/MND.,"A number of free radicals such as superoxide and nitric oxide may cause damage to motor neurons but the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. A potent free radical, peroxynitrite, is readily formed from superoxide and nitric oxide, which captures superoxide three times faster than SOD-1. Peroxynitrite may nitrate tyrosine residues of light neurofilaments (NF-I), thereby altering NF assembly and causing NF accumulation in motor neurons. To test this hypothesis we have probed the massive NF aggregates which are histopathological hallmarks of ALS/MND with immunohistochemistry. We investigated localization of reaction products related to SOD-1, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclic GMP activities. Our studies show colocalization of NF aggregates with SOD-1/b-NOS/calmodulin /citrulline/cGMP and nitrotyrosine in upper motor neuron conglomerates (Cgl) and lower motor neutron axonal spheroids (Axs). This strongly supports the notion that peroxynitrite deranges NF phosphorylation and assembly, by nitrating tyrosine residues in NF-L. Impaired phosphorylation of NF subunits, either at NF-I or at NF-H, may affect the slow axonal transport culminating in proximo-distal accumulation of NF and slowly progressive motoneuron death.","['Chou SM', 'Wang HS', 'Taniguchi A']",1996,139 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,"Chou SM, et al.

Common features of all three syndromes were: frontotemporal atrophy, involvement of subcortical nuclei, and swollen chromatolytic cells. Ubiquitin (Ub)-positive and tau-negative inclusions in cortical, hippocampal, and motor neurons were found in MND/D and DFT cases, suggesting a common pathogenesis of MND/D and DFT. MND/D showed the same cytoskeletal alterations in motor nuclei as MND without dementia: Bunina bodies and skein-like, Ub-positive inclusions. DFT differed from PD in the preponderance of histopathological changes in upper cortical layers, the sparseness of chromatolytic cells, and the absence of tau-positive Pick bodies (PBs). There were, however, two transitional cases showing Pick-type histology but no PBs, thus linking DFT and PD. PBs expressed chromogranin B and secretoneurin strongly, but chromogranin A only weakly. They were negative for the 70-kDa heat-shock protein, metallothionein, and glutathione-S-transferase.","['Bergmann M', 'Kuchelmeister K', 'Schmid KW', 'Kretzschmar HA', 'Schröder R']",1996,92,2,Acta Neuropathol,"Bergmann M, et al.

8759783,Ultrastructural study of the synapses of central chromatolytic anterior horn cells in motor neuron disease.,"This report deals with an ultrastructural investigation of the synapses on the somata of central chromatolytic anterior horn neurons of seven patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and four patients with lower motor neuron disease (LMND) who had no upper motor neuron or corticospinal tract involvement. Specimens from 24 age-matched individuals who died of non-neurological diseases served as controls. We examined a total of 171 anterior horn neurons with central chromatolysis (51 from ALS, 42 from LMND and 78 from controls), and 174 normal-appearing anterior horn neurons as controls. The cross-sectional area, the number of synapses, and the length of active zone were significantly reduced in the chromatolytic neurons of both patients and controls as compared with normal-appearing neurons of the controls (p < 0.0001). However, regarding chromatolytic neurons, no significant differences were seen in the number of synapses, length of each individual synapse, and length of its active zone between patients and controls and also in the frequency of presynaptic alterations on the somata. There was no overall difference between ALS and LMND patients in any of these parameters. Our findings suggest that the flow of electrophysiological information from afferent fibers to the somata may be greatly impaired in central chromatolytic neurons of both control individuals and patients with motor neuron disease (MND), and that the observed synaptic alterations may reflect pathological events resulting from anterior horn neuron degeneration. It may represent a compensatory mechanism of the synapses for diminished synaptic function that synapses were relatively well preserved on the somata of central chromatolytic neurons of the MND patients as compared with those of the chromatolytic neurons of the controls despite of markedly reduced cross-sectional area in the former. It also suggests that the pathomechanism involved in central chromatolysis differs between normal individuals and patients with MND.","['Sasaki S', 'Iwata M']",1996,55,8,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Sasaki S and Iwata M.

8836549,Coadministration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble IL-6 receptor delays progression of wobbler mouse motor neuron disease.,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a multipotential cytokine, initiates signal transduction pathways similar to those of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These molecules share the signal transducing receptor component, gp130. IL-6 triggers homodimerization of gp130, whereas CNTF and LIF induce heterodimerization of gp130 and LIF receptor. Although CNTF or LIF treatment attenuates motor deficits in wobbler mouse motor neuron disease (MND), neuroprotective effects of IL-6 on this animal have not yet been clarified. Here we studied whether simultaneous treatment with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) can ameliorate symptomatic and neuropathological changes in wobbler mouse MND. After clinical diagnosis at postnatal age 3-4 weeks, wobbler mice received subcutaneous injection with human recombinant IL-6 (1.0 mg/kg), human sIL-6R (0.5 mg/kg), IL-6 + sIL-6R or vehicle, daily for 4 weeks in a blind fashion. Compared to vehicle, coadministration with IL-6 and sIL-6R potentiated grip strength, attenuated muscle contractures in the forelimbs, reduced denervation muscle atrophy and prevented degeneration of spinal motor neurons. Single administration with IL-6 or sIL-6R did not retard the symptomatic and neuropathological progression, although IL-6-treated mice did not raise anti-IL-6 antibodies. Treatment with IL-6 + sIL-6R, but not with IL-6 or sIL-6R alone delayed progression of wobbler mouse MND. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective mechanism for IL-6/sIL-6R on wobbler mouse MND differs from that of CNTF or LIF alone. We hypothesize that IL-6/sIL-6R complex may function on motor neurons through activation and homodimerization of gp130.","['Ikeda K', 'Kinoshita M', 'Tagaya N', 'Shiojima T', 'Taga T', 'Yasukawa K', 'Suzuki H', 'Okano A']",1996,726,1-2,Brain Res,"Ikeda K, et al.

8733944,Oxidative damage and motor neurone disease difficulties in the measurement of protein carbonyls in human brain tissue.,"It has been suggested in the literature that elevated oxidative protein damage, measured as protein carbonyls, is present in the nervous system of patients with sporadic motor neurone disease (MND). However, the actual reported levels of brain protein carbonyls vary over a wide range. We show here that this is probably due to the use of the different protocols for the carbonyl assay; results differ depending on when the dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent is added and at what stage in the procedure protein is assayed for the calculation of carbonyls on a unit protein basis. Using a range of different procedures, we were unable to confirm reports of elevated protein carbonyls in motor cortex from brains of patients with MND. We also measured thiobarbituric acid-reactive material in the brain samples using an HPLC-based TBA test in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene. In general, there was no significant elevation of TBARS in MND motor cortex. However, four patients showed values higher than any of the control patients (both 'normal' control and 'disease control'). There was no correlation of TBARS with protein carbonyl values. We suggest that oxidative damage in motor cortex in sporadic MND, if it occurs, may be confined to a small group of patients and may affect different molecular targets in each patient.","['Lyras L', 'Evans PJ', 'Shaw PJ', 'Ince PG', 'Halliwell B']",1996,24,5,Free Radic Res,"Lyras L, et al.

8965106,Ecological correlates of motor neuron disease mortality: a hypothesis concerning an epidemiological association with radon gas and gamma exposure.,"This study investigates variations in motor neuron disease (MND) mortality rates between the counties of England and Wales from 1981 to 1989, and their relationship with gamma-ray dose rates, indoor radon gas concentrations and enhanced general life expectancy. A strong correlation was confirmed between age-adjusted rates of MND mortality and life expectancy. Weaker, but statistically significant, associations were observed between indoor radon gas concentrations, terrestrial gamma radiation and marginal variations in MND mortality. Life expectancy and radon gas concentrations were positively associated with MND mortality rates whilst gamma radiation was negatively associated. The negative correlation of gamma radiation with MND mortality may be understood with reference to its negative effects on overall population life expectancy. Radon gas concentrations seemingly account for a small elevation in MND mortality, amounting to at most 4% of total deaths. Further research is required to investigate this association.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'Rose FC']",1996,243,4,J Neurol,"Neilson S, et al.

8815186,Synaptophysin expression in the anterior horn of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease.,"This report concerns the study of synaptophysin (SP) expression in the anterior horn in four cases of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease (WHD). All patients had distinct anterior horn cell degeneration, and died before the age of one year. Normal spinal cords from five age-matched children served as controls. Five cases of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (S-ALS), three cases of lower motor neuron disease (L-MND), three cases of peripheral neuropathy with axonal reaction, and six adult cases with normal spinal cords were included for comparison. Immunohistochemical techniques were used throughout. The results show that normal spinal cords of children have similar SP immunoreactivity patterns as those of normal adults. We also found that despite relatively preserved or slightly increased SP immunoreactivity on the surface of the cell body and proximal processes of the remaining neurons, there was a diffuse decrease of immunoreaction product deposits in the anterior horn neuropil of the WHD cases. The ballooned neurons in the anterior horns of patients with WHD, S-ALS, L-MND, and axonal reaction had few SP immunoreactive dots or granules around the cell bodies and proximal processes. The perikarya of some ballooned neurons of the children with WHD was diffusely stained for SP. There was no SP immunoreactive structures within the empty cell beds of these patients. The observed decrease in SP expression around ballooned neurons in these disorders is indicative of a disconnection of presynaptic terminals of afferent fibers from the proximal portion of the swollen degenerated anterior horn cells.","['Ikemoto A', 'Hirano A', 'Matsumoto S', 'Akiguchi I', 'Kimura J']",1996,136,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Ikemoto A, et al.

Neurological examination revealed a motor neuron syndrome with paresis, fasciculations and atrophy. Electrophysiological studies showed multiple motor conduction blocks. The anti-GM1 IgM titer was elevated. The patient was thought to have a multifocal motor neuropathy. Despite intravenous cyclophosphamide treatment, however, she died with respiratory insufficiency. On postmortem examination, the brachial plexus showed patches of demyelination underlying different areas of motor conduction block. The spinal cord, however, revealed severe neuronal loss in the ventral horn and axonal loss in the corticospinal tract, indicative of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Demyelination of peripheral nerves could have been responsible for the other conduction blocks in this patient. The prominent degeneration of motor neurons, however, must also have played a role in the clinical picture. Some patients with the syndrome of a multifocal motor neuropathy may have MND rather than, or in addition to, a demyelinating peripheral motor neuropathy.","['Veugelers B', 'Theys P', 'Lammens M', 'Van Hees J', 'Robberecht W']",1996,136,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Veugelers B, et al.

8801281,Absence of serological evidence for foamy virus infection in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Foamy virus (FV) infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic motor neuron disease (MND) by means of serological assays. To confirm these results we tested serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 23 cases of clinically verified non-familial MND and 11 cases of suspected non-familial MND for the presence of FV infection as determined by Western blot (WB) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Using the same tests we also screened sera from 87 healthy chimpanzees for the presence of FV antibodies. None of the human samples in question tested positive. However, the testing revealed that 84 of 87 chimpanzees (96.6%) were seropositive for FV, indicating that combined WB and IFA are suitable methods for the serodiagnosis of FV infection. Given these results an association of FV infection and sporadic MND is highly improbable. Furthermore a suggested therapeutic trial with anti-retroviral drugs appears unjustified.","['Rösener M', 'Hahn H', 'Kranz M', 'Heeney J', 'Rethwilm A']",1996,48,3,J Med Virol,"Rösener M, et al.

8867065,Neuroprotective effect of various cytokines on developing spinal motoneurons following axotomy.,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a multipoietic factor, on a variety of neurons, prevents axotomy-induced motoneuron loss and can improve the outcome of murine motor neuron disease (MND). We carried out a study to determine whether other cytokines rescue spinal motoneurons from axotomy-induced cell death. Unilateral sciatic nerve was transected in neonatal rats. Two doses of recombinant murine cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor (CDF/LIF), recombinant rat CNTF, recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), recombinant human interleukin-6 (IL-6), recombinant human tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF beta), or vehicle were administered daily for 2 weeks by intraperitoneal injection. After treatment, the number of spinal motoneurons was determined at the level of L4-5 segments. In comparison with vehicle, the higher doses of CDF/LIF, CNTF, and IL-6, and the lower doses of CDF/LIF and IL-6 significantly retarded the loss of motoneurons. G-CSF and TNF beta failed to inhibit motoneuron death. CDF/LIF and IL-6 rescued motoneurons from the retrograde death following axotomy, in a similar manner to CNTF. These results provide evidence that several cytokines may have therapeutic potential in human axonopathy or MND.","['Ikeda K', 'Iwasaki Y', 'Shiojima T', 'Kinoshita M']",1996,135,2,J Neurol Sci,"Ikeda K, et al.

In healthy adults, age, sex and height accounted for 44.3% and 55.6% of the variance of log average volume per swallow and log swallowing capacity, respectively. Symptoms and signs were more prevalent in the MND group and were associated with reduced swallowing capacity and reduced average volume per swallow; repeatability studies on these two indices in both groups showed that the median difference between the mean of two recordings on successive days and the mean of all recordings (6-15 over 3 days) was < 5% (maximum third quartile 12.8%, indices expressed as percent predicted according to age and sex). Using this simple bedside test, swallowing function can be quantified on a ratio scale and expressed as percent of that predicted by age and sex; such information may improve the predictive value of clinical assessment and provides a practical way of monitoring change in patients with dysphagia.","['Hughes TA', 'Wiles CM']",1996,89,2,QJM,Hughes TA and Wiles CM.

8708642,Avoiding false positive diagnoses of motor neuron disease: lessons from the Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency and characteristics of those patients initially registered with the Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register (SMNDR) but who subsequently had a diagnosis other than MND made (false positives), to analyse the features which led to a revised diagnosis, and to draw conclusions which might improve routine neurological practice.
METHODS: The Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register is a community based, prospective disease register to identify and follow up all incident cases of motor neuron disease in Scotland. Fifty three patients out of a total of 552 registered are presented, who, after initial registration, were later excluded because they failed to satisfy the register's diagnostic criteria.
RESULTS: Seven of these patients were labelled as ""MND plus"" syndromes and may represent a distinct subset of MND. The remaining 46 patients had an alternative diagnosis made (false positive group), accounting for 8% of the total. In half of these cases, potentially beneficial therapies are available. The predominant reasons which lead to a diagnostic revision were: failure of symptom progression, development of atypical clinical features for MND, and investigation results.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MND should undergo thorough and relevant investigations at presentation with the emphasis on neuroradiological imaging and neurophysiology; all patients should be followed up by an experienced neurologist, particularly those in whom symptoms and signs are restricted to either the bulbar or spinal muscles; failure of symptom progression or development of atypical features should lead to an early reassessment; finally, patients should be informed of the diagnosis only when it is secure.","['Davenport RJ', 'Swingler RJ', 'Chancellor AM', 'Warlow CP']",1996,60,2,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Davenport RJ, et al.

8544551,Association of apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele with bulbar-onset motor neuron disease.,"BACKGROUND: Variants of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene influence the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease. APOE may influence the presentation of other neurological diseases. We investigated the relationship between the allelic variants of apolipoprotein E and clinical presentation in motor neuron disease.
METHODS: 123 patients with motor neuron disease and 121 controls were studied. Diagnosis, location of onset and date of onset were recorded prospectively. Genotyping was performed blind to clinical information.
FINDINGS: Possession of at least one epsilon 4 allele was significantly more common in patients with bulbar onset motor neuron disease (14/33, 42%) than in limb onset patients (20/90, 22%) and controls (26/121, 21%) (chi 2 = 4.93, p = 0.026 and chi 2 = 5.91, p = 0.015, respectively).
INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele may influence the pattern of motor neuron loss in motor neuron disease and that it may affect neuronal function in ways unrelated to the deposition of beta-amyloid or accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles.","['al-Chalabi A', 'Enayat ZE', 'Bakker MC', 'Sham PC', 'Ball DM', 'Shaw CE', 'Lloyd CM', 'Powell JF', 'Leigh PN']",1996,347,8995,Lancet,"al-Chalabi A, et al.

Angiotropic large cell lymphoma, a rare and aggressive type of lymphoma, has been associated with MND only once (to our knowledge) prior to this report. There are more than 35 cases of MND associated with lymphoma or monoclonal gammopathy reported in the literature. The nature of this association remains disputable.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the association between some MNDs and certain hematologic disorders is coincidental or pathogenetically related.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical and neuropathologic findings in a case involving a 70-year-old man with a rapidly progressive lower MND who at autopsy also exhibited angiotropic large cell lymphoma without ischemic lesions in the nervous system.
CONCLUSIONS: This case supports the notion that the association between some MNDs and certain hematologic disorders is not coincidental but pathogenetically related. A 2-hit hypothesis is proposed in which an initial abnormal glycosylation in motoneurons would require the production of an appropriate autoantibody for disease expression.","['Rubio A', 'Poole RM', 'Brara HS', 'Taylor N', 'Powers JM']",1997,54,1,Arch Neurol,"Rubio A, et al.

Mortality statistics was provided by the Census and Statistics Department. A total of 84 cases were identified with a male preponderance of 1.98:1. The average annual period incidence was 0.31/100,000 and the point prevalence on December 31, 1992, was 0.95/100,000. The mean age at onset was 55.5 years (range 19-81) with a peak observed from 55 to 65 years. The clinical features are similar to other reported series of MND.

8841960,Frontal lobe dementia and motor neuron disease.,"Frontal lobe dementia (FLD) (syn. frontotemporal dementia and dementia of frontal type) is a generic term that describes a clinical syndrome in which patients manifest a profound breakdown in personality and social conduct, together with adynamic spontaneous speech, culminating in mutism. This pattern of cognitive impairment implicates bilateral frontal lobe dysfunction, an assumption supported by functional neuroimaging findings of anterior cerebral abnormality. Patients with FLD can go on to develop motor neuron disease (FLD-MND), although the clinical features of MND may accompany or occasionally precede the onset of dementia. The emergence of MND is responsible for death within 3 years of onset. Frontotemporal lobar pathology in FLD-MND is characterized by loss of large cortical neurons, spongiform change and mild astrocytic gliosis. Ubiquitinated (but not tau-positive) inclusions are present within the frontal cortex. There is severe nigral cell loss (without Lewy bodies), and marked hypoglossal and spinal motor neuron degeneration, together with ubiquitinated (but not tau-positive) inclusions within the spinal neurons. Some authors suggest that FLD-MND is a separate disease entity, whereas others suggest it represents an interface between FLD and ""classic"" (non-dementing) motor neuron disease (CMND). An association with CMND is supported by findings in these patients of failure in tasks sensitive to ""frontal lobe"" dysfunction, and patterns of functional neuroimaging abnormality which are identical in distribution, but less severe than those encountered in FLD-MND. However, the nosological status of FLD-MND remains enigmatic in the absence of defined pathological and molecular markers.",['Talbot PR'],1996,47,,J Neural Transm Suppl,Talbot PR.

We compared the sociodemographic, physical and psychological status of 18 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND) patients on ventilatory support for 1 to 120 months with that of 126 nonventilatory-supported ALS/MND patients. Patients filled out a comprehensive data form and completed ten psychological tests. A composite psychological status score was computed, representing a continuum from psychological distress to psychological well-being. Mann-Whitney and chi 2 tests were used to compare the two groups. There were no significant differences in sociodemographic makeup, depression, hopelessness, overall quality of life or psychological well-being. However, ventilatory-supported patients had a more internal health locus of control. Many patients on ventilatory support were able to live high quality lives. When ventilatory support is an option, we suggest that medical professionals be supportive of the patient's choices and recognise that a decision for ventilatory support is probably the best predictor of an acceptable quality of life on a ventilator.","['McDonald ER', 'Hillel A', 'Wiedenfeld SA']",1996,10,1,Palliat Med,"McDonald ER, et al.

This study examined patients' views of being given the diagnosis and of how it was communicated. Fifty people who had been diagnosed with MND more than six months previously were interviewed about their experience of the diagnosis. The majority reported positive aspects of being told, especially having a label for their condition. The most frequently mentioned critical aspect of how they were told was the directness and clarity with which they were given the information. Patients were more critical if the diagnosis was worse than expected (as it was for most patients) and more satisfied if they felt they had been able to ask questions. There was no evidence that unsatisfactory communications were associated with later mood disturbance. A longitudinal study is recommended to overcome limitations in this cross-sectional design.","['Johnston M', 'Earll L', 'Mitchell E', 'Morrison V', 'Wright S']",1996,10,1,Palliat Med,"Johnston M, et al.

Whilst the crude mortality rate fell by 54% during the decade 1960-1969, there was a net increase of 26% over the entire period. The influence of three sets of variables-the increasing mean age of the population, changing environmental factors, and changing competition between diseases-upon mortality rates were investigated through Gompertzian analysis of crude and age-adjusted mortality rates. The increased mean age of the population contributed significantly to the overall rise in mortality from MND over the whole period, a feature that has previously been demonstrated to occur in the majority of industrialised countries. The unusual pattern of a decline and subsequent rise in mortality appears to be due to the influence of changing environmental factors on a sub-population susceptible to the disease.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'de Pedro-Cuesta J', 'Veiga-Cabo J']",1996,15,4,Neuroepidemiology,"Neilson S, et al.

ALS, known also as motor neuron disease (MND) in the UK, maladie de Charcot in France and Lou Gehrig's disease in the US, is usually sporadic, but between 5 and 10% of all cases are hereditary, usually inherited as autosomal dominant. Previously thought to be untreatable, as well as incurable, just in the last 3 years ALS has been the greatest clinical application of recent exciting break-throughs in preclinical neurobiology research.

However, the mechanisms underlying this cognitive deterioration and its relationship with the relatively selective involvement of motor neurons remains elusive. We used histo- and immunocytochemical labeling methods to study the nitrogen monoxide (NO; a.k.a. nitric oxide) synthase (NOS)-/NADPH diaphorase-containing neurons (NOSN) in three patients with MND and dementia (MND+D), two patients with MND without dementia, and 19 controls that included patients with Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer dementias. Patients with MND+D, but not those with MND without dementia, exhibit numerous dystrophic perikarya and neurites throughout all sensory, motor, association, and limbic neocortices examined. Interestingly, affected NOSN appear to correspond to some subtypes (smooth stellate and spiny neurons), while other neurons containing the same molecular phenotype (such as layer I local circuit neurons and layer II granule cells) are either spared or significantly less affected. These observations indicate that cognitive impairment and dementia in MND may be due, at least in part, to a pancortical involvement of certain types of NOSN. Consequently, the elucidation of the factors that make NOSN vulnerable in MND, and the prevention or pharmacological palliation of their loss, may eventually help to prevent or ameliorate cognitive impairment in MND and may also shed some light on the nature of the insult that targets motor neurons.","['Kuljis RO', 'Schelper RL']",1996,55,1,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Kuljis RO and Schelper RL.

9208569,[Study on animal models of immune mediate motoneuron disease].,"Swine motoneurons (SMN) were isolated from fresh spinal cords of pigs. Homogenates of these SMN or fresh anterior horns of pigs (SAH) as immunogens were inoculated to guinea pigs or Lewis rats and Wistar rats respectively. The impairments of motion were observed in the immunized guinea pig four months after the fifth inoculation of SMN, in the immunized Lewis rats after the first or second inoculation of SAH and in the Wistar rat after the third inoculation of SAH respectively. Degeneration and loss of motoneurons in the spinal cords of these symptomatic animals were found histologically. Antibodies against motoneurons of guinea pig and rat can be detected in sera of these symptomatic animals with immunocytochemical method respectively. In control guinea pigs, Lewis rats and Wistar rats there were no symptom, and did not found degeneration of motoneurons in the spinal cords of these control animals. Antibodies against motoneurons can not be detected in the sera of these control animals. The results indicated immune mediate guinea pig or rat models for MND can be established with pure SMN or impure SMN as immunogens. It was shown the conservative homology between antigenic structures of lower motoneurons in pigs and guinea pigs or rats. The pathogenesis in immunized animals with SAH is faster than that in immunized animals with SMN at least in terms of the appearance of symptoms. The Lewis rats produced symptoms first and the incidence ratio of symptomatic animals in Lewis rats was the highest. The immunized Wistar rats produced symptoms a little bit slower.","['Wei Y', 'Wan X', 'She H']",1995,17,6,Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao,"Wei Y, et al.

Despite intensive research into environmental agents associated with the onset or course of the disease, there is no single factor that can be confidently linked over time with regional, national or international variations in mortality rates. However, unusual variations in MND mortality rate in Japan from 1950-1990 were found to correlate highly significantly with variations in radioactive fallout released by atmospheric weapons testing in the Pacific. This association could be explained by the ingestion of alpha-emitting radionuclides acting upon a pre-existing susceptible subpopulation, a hypothesis which is consistent with recent research on the epidemiology and pathology of MND. However, it is likely that radiation is only one of many factors that act singly or in combination to accelerate the condition in subpopulations susceptible to MND.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'Rose FC']",1995,134,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Neilson S, et al.

The mnd mutation causes adult-onset motor dysfunction, and produces abnormal ubiquitous accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment, with retinal degeneration and late-onset motor neuron degeneration. The neurofilament H-beta-galactosidase fusion protein causes endogenous neurofilament subunits to precipitate in perikarya, but shows neither significant neuronal degeneration nor behavioral changes until advanced age. In mnd/mnd-transgenic animals, neurological symptoms, lipopigment accumulation, and motor neuron loss were substantially accelerated. Newly vulnerable populations of neurons also degenerated, including cerebellar Purkinje cells and dorsal roots. This study exemplifies a synergistic interaction between a neuron-specific and a ubiquitous defect, leading to significant neurological consequences. It further indicates that cytoskeletal abnormalities similar to those observed in late-onset human neurodegenerative disorders can interact with other cellular defects and contribute to pathogenesis.","['Plummer J', 'Peterson A', 'Messer A']",1995,6,6,Mol Cell Neurosci,"Plummer J, et al.

We performed symptomatic and neuropathological assessments in both groups. The treatment was fulfilled at 7-8 weeks of age. In comparison with vehicle, bFGF treatment potentiated grip strength (p < 0.008), attenuated forelimb contracture (p < 0.003), and increased weight of the biceps muscle (p < 0.008). bFGF-treated mice retarded denervation muscle atrophy (p < 0.001) and degeneration of spinal motoneurons (p < 0.001).

We investigated the possibility that focal or diffuse cortical deficits, already demonstrated in MND, were present in XBSN. The global CBF values of the patients, when compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, were found reduced, but no focal rCBF alterations, nor increased regional side-to-side asymmetry were observed.

8580727,Search for persistent infection with poliovirus or other enteroviruses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-motor neurone disease.,"A longstanding hypothesis proposes that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-motor neurone disease (ALS-MND) is a late consequence of subclinical poliovirus (PV) infection. In this study, RNA extracts of CNS tissue from 28 patients with ALS-MND and 7 controls were assayed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the enterovirus (EV) genome which is highly conserved between EVs including PV, echovirus and coxsackie viruses. The integrity of RNA extracted from either archival paraffin-embedded or frozen CNS tissue was assessed by detection of constitutive Ableson tyrosine kinase (ABL) mRNA by PCR. Of 63 tissue samples assayed, 81% (51/63) were ABL-positive corresponding to 78% (22/28) of the ALS-MND cases and all controls. None of the 27 ALS-MND cases (i.e. 21 ABL+ and 6 ABL-) in which paraffin-embedded tissue was used nor any of the age and sex matched controls were positive for specific PV/EV RNA. Moreover, CNS tissue from 14 different locations obtained from one patient < 2 hrs after death and immediately frozen, showed no evidence of PV/EV at any site by PCR. Disease duration, degree of tissue autolysis and duration of tissue storage were all excluded as factors which may predispose to negative results. The sensitivity of the PV PCR was determined to be 40-400 copies (12.5 - 125 ag) of synthetic EV RNA transcripts in 1 microgram of cellular RNA and the assay was shown to detect all types of PV and and other EVs tested. Thus it seems unlikely that a persistent PV or related EV infection is implicated in ALS-MND unless there has been alteration in the 5'-UTR of the virus genome.","['Swanson NR', 'Fox SA', 'Mastaglia FL']",1995,5,6,Neuromuscul Disord,"Swanson NR, et al.

Deterioration of upper and lower motor neurones leads to progressive weakness, and disability and death usually occur within 5 years. The symptoms of MND are many and varied, and lead to progressive loss of function and potential loss of dignity. Professionals may wrongly give the impression that little can be done for patients with this devastating disease. However, symptom relief is of paramount importance in maintaining quality of life in MND. Patients may suffer from pain and immobility, speech and swallowing problems, emotional difficulties, bowel and bladder problems, dyspnoea and ventilatory failure. Nurses and therapists involved in palliative care will have met many of these symptoms in other diseases and are well placed to extend their expertise to patients with MND and their families.","['Barby TF', 'Leigh PN']",1995,1,4,Int J Palliat Nurs,Barby TF and Leigh PN.

7666056,Quantitative study of synaptophysin immunoreactivity of cerebral cortex and spinal cord in motor neuron disease.,"Synaptophysin immunoreactivity can be quantified by image analysis to evaluate loss of presynaptic terminals in human neurodegenerative diseases. The extent and regional distribution of such loss is reported in motor neuron disease (MND). Autopsy samples of spinal cord and cerebral cortex were examined from 28 cases of MND and 28 age and sex matched controls. The MND group included individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (17[ALS]), and progressive muscular atrophy (11[PMA]). In the spinal cord, there was significant reduction of presynaptic terminals in the lateral ventral horn (15%) in both the ALS (p < 0.01) and PMA (p < 0.05) groups. Perisomatic synaptophysin profiles on lower motor neurons are preserved late in the disease and are not related to corticospinal innervation. Less marked presynaptic loss was demonstrable more widely in the medial ventral, intermediate and dorsal spinal grey matter (10%) in both ALS (p = 0.03) and PMA (p = 0.05). In the cerebral cortex no synaptic loss was demonstrated in motor or anterior cingulate regions in any of the MND cases. Spinal degeneration in MND is associated with loss of presynaptic terminals in all grey matter regions. It is most marked in the limb motor neuron area and is independent of corticospinal tract degeneration. The cerebral pathology of ALS is not associated with significant loss of presynaptic terminals in the cortical areas studied.","['Ince PG', 'Slade J', 'Chinnery RM', 'McKenzie J', 'Royston C', 'Roberts GW', 'Shaw PJ']",1995,54,5,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Ince PG, et al.

8550273,Twin study using mortality data: a new sampling method.,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the success of a novel approach to twin studies using death discordant twin pairs in a disease of low prevalence.
METHOD: A population study based on all registered deaths at the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys of England and Wales, classified under the ICD code 335.2 (motor neuron disease [MND]) for the period 1979-1989 inclusive. From the above database of 10,872 people, individuals born after 31 December 1899 were traced in the Birth Indices for England & Wales to enable identification of possible twins. In all 131 twin pairs were found and the co-twin details were sent to the National Health Service Central Register (NHS-CR) to enable location of the relevant Family Health Services Authority and thence the co-twin's general practitioner (GP). A letter requesting access was sent to the family practitioners. If given, the co-twin can be approached and interviewed.
RESULTS: The search produced: 54 living co-twins; 31 who died as adults; 29 infant deaths; 5 emigrated; 3 incorrectly diagnosed index twins; and 9 untraceable co-twins. Among the adult deaths two concordant pairs were identified. This has created the largest twin population sample worldwide for MND.
CONCLUSION: This new twin study method is clearly viable, and has produced a large unbiased sample compared to that possible using traditional methods. It relies heavily on the accuracy of death certificates and zygosity reporting by living co-twins, but is possibly the only way of collecting twins in rare conditions.","['Graham AJ', 'Hawkes CH']",1995,24,4,Int J Epidemiol,Graham AJ and Hawkes CH.

7655892,Motor neuron disease. Studies of the corticospinal excitation of single motor neurons by magnetic brain stimulation.,"The responses to magnetic brain stimulation of 57 motor units (MUs) in the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 33 patients with sporadic motor neuron disease (MND), and 44 MUs of 15 healthy control subjects have been compared. Thresholds for MU excitation both in the resting state and during tonic activity have been measured and the modulation of MU discharge by series of magnetic stimuli has been determined from peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs). Abnormalities in the MND MUs have been correlated with the physical signs of impaired hand muscle function. Motor units from hands showing pure lower motor neuron (LMN) signs fired at increased frequency when recruited, had normal or reduced thresholds for activation by magnetic scalp stimuli and had normal or large primary excitatory peaks with normal inter-subpeak intervals on PSTHs. Occasionally muscles with pure LMN signs also had fasciculations that could be driven by cortical stimuli. In contrast, MUs from hands showing pure upper motor neuron (UMN) signs fired at reduced frequency when recruited, had raised thresholds for excitation by cortical stimuli, had prolonged primary peaks with wide inter-subpeak intervals and had large secondary peaks on PSTHs. The rise times and amplitudes of the underlying post-synaptic potentials released by cortical stimuli in spinal motor neurons have been deduced from measurements of the peaks in PSTHs. This analysis suggests that in some MUs from muscles showing pure LMN signs, stimuli evoke larger than normal excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs), probably resulting from abnormalities in central motor fibres. It is proposed that a major cause of the changes found in MND MUs from hands showing either pure UMN or pure LMN signs may be an abnormality in the motor cortex leading to faulty initiation of the descending corticospinal volley from magnetic stimuli.",['Mills KR'],1995,118 ( Pt 4),,Brain,Mills KR.

7494601,Ultrastructural abnormalities with inclusions in Onuf's nucleus in motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).,"This study describes an ultrastructural examination focused on motor neurons in Onuf's nucleus in the spinal cord of four control patients without neurological disease (45-70 years) and six motor neuron disease (MND) patients (38-79 years; duration 8 months-19 years) who showed no somato-vesical dysfunction. Prompted by recent studies suggesting some sphincteric motor neurons may succumb to MND, this study sought to determine whether the wider population of neurons in Onuf's nucleus display ultrastructural cytopathology which is normally undetectable in histological preparations. Spinal cords were removed 3-20 h after death, and 1 mm slices of cord rapidly fixed in modified Karnovsky medium were processed for both light- and electronmicroscopy. 'Control motor neurons' had intact neuronal and nuclear membranes. Nissl bodies chiefly comprised ordered structures of alternate lamellae of rough endoplasmic reticulum and arrays of polyribosomes. The Golgi complexes consisted of multilamellated curvilinear stacks of ER. No intraneuronal filamentous or Bunina body inclusions were observed, but occasional axonal spheroids were seen in the neuropil. In MND, histological evidence of sparing in Onuf's nucleus was associated with abnormal ultrastructure of the motor neurons. Some sphincteric neurons were atrophic, whereas in the others, Nissl bodies were reduced in number, showed loss of structural organization or comprised polyribosomal aggregates. Golgi complexes had disrupted lamellated organization or consisted solely of distended ER. Intraneuronal filamentous Lewy-body or skein-like inclusions and Bunina bodies were identified in Onuf's nucleus of three subjects (duration of MND 8 months-2 years). The results of the present study indicate that Onuf's nucleus is vulnerable in MND, and preservation of sphincter function with qualitative histological evidence of 'sparing' does not necessarily imply a corresponding lack of ultrastructural cytopathology in this nucleus.","['Pullen AH', 'Martin JE']",1995,21,4,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,Pullen AH and Martin JE.

Few studies have reported comprehensively on individuals who demonstrate a neurodegenerative 'overlap' syndrome, comprising idiopathic parkinsonism, dementia, and motor neuron dysfunction. We describe clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological features in six patients with neurodegenerative 'overlap' syndrome. All had cardinal features of PD (duration 6-26 years), and any mixture of dementia (slowly advancing), fasciculations, hyperreflexia, Babinski signs and mild atrophy and weakness of distal muscles (slowly progressive). EMG often demonstrated a lack of denervation in conjunction with abnormal MEPs (high thresholds). Patients had either 6FD-PET or pathological studies consistent with PD. Pathological studies also demonstrated moderate numbers of neurofibrillary tangles and plaque formation, typically with sparing of motor neurons in the spinal cord. We conclude that neurodegenerative 'overlap' syndrome may represent forme frustes of traditionally accepted diagnostic categories. Patients with parkinsonism, fasciculations, hyperreflexia and mild atrophy are unlikely to demonstrate active denervation on EMG; their prognosis is better than for classical MND.

METHODS: A total of 45 right-handed patients were investigated (13 with dementia of Alzheimer type, 6 with multi-infarct dementia, 4 with progressive dementia with motor neuron disease (MND), 3 with transient global amnesia, 5 with other diseases and 14 control subjects). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the parietal cortex and hippocampus was evaluated by high-resolution SPECT technique with HMPAO in all subjects.
RESULTS: The rCBF measurements in the bilateral parietal cortices and hippocampus were lower in dementia of Alzheimer type and multi-infarct dementia patients than in controls. Hypoperfusion in the hippocampus was a more sensitive marker than hypoperfusion in the parietal cortex in diagnosing dementia of Alzheimer type. Hippocampal hypoperfusion was observed in demented patients regardless of etiology and in patients having memory disturbance without dementia, such as transient global amnesia. Finally, hippocampal hypoperfusion reflected the severity of dementia and memory disturbance regardless of etiology.
CONCLUSION: The rCBF image with high-resolution SPECT system may be useful in assessing the extent of dementia and memory disturbance in patients with neuropsychiatric diseases.","['Ohnishi T', 'Hoshi H', 'Nagamachi S', 'Jinnouchi S', 'Flores LG', 'Futami S', 'Watanabe K']",1995,36,7,J Nucl Med,"Ohnishi T, et al.

When mnd is outcrossed to the AKR/J genetic background, ca. 40% of the mnd/mnd F2 progeny show early onset (onset by 4.5-5 months and death by 7 months.) This accelerated timing effect seems to be strain-specific, and unlinked to the mnd gene itself. Our current working hypothesis is that the timing effect is due to 2 or 3 unlinked dominant genes with incomplete penetrance at any single locus. In a combined RFLP/PCR fragment genetic analysis, the strongest deviation from the expected ratio of AKR vs B6 alleles occurs with markers on proximal half of chr 1. Additional loci on chrs 5 and 10 may also be involved. The mechanism of interaction of these modifying genes with the primary mnd gene may offer new therapeutic avenues.","['Messer A', 'Plummer J', 'MacMillen MC', 'Frankel WN']",1995,57,2,Am J Med Genet,"Messer A, et al.

7583686,CSF and plasma amino acid levels in motor neuron disease: elevation of CSF glutamate in a subset of patients.,"Fasting plasma and/or CSF amino acid levels have been measured in a group of 37 patients with motor neurone disease (MND) and in 35 neurological control patients undergoing lumbar puncture prior to myelography. There were no significant differences in the plasma levels of 22 amino acids between the two groups. In CSF, there was a significant elevation of the glutamate level in the MND patients (P = 0.008). However, the MND group were heterogeneous with regard to CSF glutamate: 19/31 (61%) had levels within the normal range; eight (26%) had levels more than twice the upper limit of normal (> or = 10 mumol/l) and five (16%) had levels more than seven times normal (> or = 30 mumol/l). In a subset of seven MND patients there was a significant inverse correlation (rs = -0.775, P < 0.03) between CSF glutamate levels in life and the density of pre-synaptic glutamate re-uptake sites in the lumbar spinal cord measured in a post-mortem autoradiographic study. A possible interpretation of these findings is that an abnormality of glutamate transport may underlie the increase in CSF glutamate. The identification of a subgroup of MND patients with high CSF glutamate levels may be important in evaluating the clinical response to antiglutamate therapeutic agents.","['Shaw PJ', 'Forrest V', 'Ince PG', 'Richardson JP', 'Wastell HJ']",1995,4,2,Neurodegeneration,"Shaw PJ, et al.

Psychological tests assessing language, perceptuospatial, memory, and ""frontal lobe"" functions were given to patients with cMND and test scores were compared with those of normal control subjects. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT was performed on patients with cMND, FTD and motor neuron disease (FTD/MND), FTD alone, and normal control subjects. Regional cerebral blood flow indices (rCBFi) were determined in 36 cortical regions, and differences between grouped rCBFi data were investigated by canonical discriminant analysis. There were significant group differences in the scores of picture sequencing and token tests in patients with cMND compared with normal controls. Regional CBFi data showed frontal and anterior temporal reductions in patients with cMND compared with normal controls. A similar pattern of SPECT abnormality was seen in patients with FTD/MND and FTD alone, but to a more pronounced degree than in patients with cMND. Neuropsychological and SPECT findings in cMND, FTD/MND, and FTD showed a common pattern of cerebral involvement, most pronounced in the second two conditions.

A further limited series of studies have been made for similar groups of volunteers and MND patients using a STEAM 20 ms sequence (stimulated echo). Analysis of the SE 135 ms spectra indicates there are statistically significant differences in the ratios of N-acetyl-aspartate to creatine and N-acetyl-aspartate to choline between controls and MND patients. Furthermore, metabolites identified using the STEAM 20 ms may be of great importance in the investigations of free radical mediated mechanisms, which have been postulated as being important contributors to the disease process. Preliminary results indicate that 1H MRS may provide important data to help understand the disease processes in MND and it could form a useful method for monitoring the effects of future trial treatment regimens.","['Jones AP', 'Gunawardena WJ', 'Coutinho CM', 'Gatt JA', 'Shaw IC', 'Mitchell JD']",1995,129 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,"Jones AP, et al.

Recently, ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions have been found in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, indicating that in some cases there may be extensive extra-motor involvement. We have observed that some cases of MND with dementia (MND-D), had ubiquitinated inclusions in the amygdala. In order to study this systematically, we examined 18 cases of 'typical' MND, 4 cases of MND-D and 12 neurologically normal and abnormal controls, using antibodies against ubiquitin and a range of cytoskeletal proteins. In addition to standard neuropathological examination, we examined in detail the anterior thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and the amygdala. We found ubiquitin immunoreactive inclusions in the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus in more than 30% of MND cases, most of whom were not known to have significant cognitive impairment. These inclusions did not react with antibodies against tau or with phosphorylated neurofilaments. They thus differ from the inclusions of Alzheimer's disease, and they do not have the appearance or immunocytochemical features of cortical Lewy bodies. In parallel studies we have found selective cognitive impairments in about 25% of our patients with typical MND, and PET activation studies show impaired activation in the anterior thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus and medial frontal regions. Since the amygdala is an important source of afferents for the limbic system, its involvement may be one of the factors underlying both cognitive changes and PET abnormalities.","['Anderson VE', 'Cairns NJ', 'Leigh PN']",1995,129 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,"Anderson VE, et al.

7595620,Disease progression and perceptions of health in patients with motor neurone disease.,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a useful paradigm for many progressive disabling neurological disorders and serves as a particularly opposite model for the study of patients' responses to progressive and irreversible disability. We studied the progression of disability and the patients' perception of their health in a group of MND patients (n = 14) for 6 months from diagnosis or soon after. A comparison group of similar age, gender ratio and initial disability on Barthel index were Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, admitted because of poor response to outpatient drug therapy and increasing disability (n = 22). MND patients showed rapid deterioration in all aspects of self care and mobility, as assessed by Barthel Index. 32% PD patients showed a significant improvement in disability during their admission. For both groups, perception of their physical health on the SF36 was very poor at recruitment compared to age- and sex-matched population norms. However for patients in both groups the SF36 could not be used to monitor changes in perception of health because of floor effects. In those in whom change could be assessed, there was a trend for MND patients to deteriorate and PD patients to improve. We conclude that loss of independence in self care and failing mobility may occur more rapidly than current medical and social services can accommodate. There is a need for planning and proactive intervention to support patients and careers. The patients' perception of their physical health is poor from time of diagnosis as assessed by the SF36, but this scale cannot be used to monitor patients with MND or late stage PD over time.","['Young CA', 'Tedman BM', 'Williams IR']",1995,129 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,"Young CA, et al.

All patients were also submitted to respiratory functional testing (RFT). Ten of these patients were treated with palliative management (group I), the remaining ten patients received Bipap support (group II). Clinical evolution curves and clinical parameters were not statistically different in both groups, except for the percentage of actual predicted value of vital capacity (p < 0.03), showing a more advanced disease in group II patients. Analog scale of life satisfaction showed improvement in the group II, even after the beginning of respiratory insufficiency, though without significance probably due to the small sample size (p < 0.1). Since 6 patients in group II are still alive survival rates were compared with log rank test considering cumulative survivals with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Total survival and survival from diurnal abnormalities in gas exchange (survival 1) were significantly longer for group II (p < 0.006 and p < 0.0004, respectively).

In this study, we examined the effects of exogenous BDNF on the progression of wobbler mouse motor neuron disease (MND). After clinical diagnosis at age 3 to 4 weeks, 20 affected mice received subcutaneous injections of recombinant human BDNF (5 mg/kg, n = 10) or vehicle (n = 10), three times a week for 4 weeks. In a separate experiment done to conduct a histometric analysis of the C-5 and C-6 ventral roots and to determine the number of myelinated nerve fibers, 7 wobbler mice received identical BDNF treatment. In the 10 BDNF-treated wobbler mice, grip strength declined at a slower rate (p < 0.03) and was twice as great as that of vehicle-treated animals at the end of treatment (p < 0.01). In vivo biceps (p < 0.01) and in vitro muscle twitch tensions (p < 0.02) were also greater than those of vehicle-treated mice. The biceps muscle weight was 20% greater (p < 0.05) and the mean muscle fiber diameter was significantly larger in BDNF-treated mice (p < 0.001) because the number of small (denervated) muscle fibers was markedly reduced. The number of myelinated motor axons at the cervical ventral roots studied in the additional 7 affected mice was 25% greater with BDNF treatment (p < 0.0001). This study establishes that exogenous BDNF administration can retard motor dysfunction in a natural MND and diminish denervation muscle atrophy and motor axon loss.","['Ikeda K', 'Klinkosz B', 'Greene T', 'Cedarbaum JM', 'Wong V', 'Lindsay RM', 'Mitsumoto H']",1995,37,4,Ann Neurol,"Ikeda K, et al.

The density of corticomotoneurons was measured in 18 MND and 9 control cases using 10-microns horizontal sections of motor cortex in the hand/arm region. The density of spinal motor neurons was measured in 10-microns transverse sections of the lower cervical spinal cord. Corticomotoneuron and spinal motor neuron densities were decreased in MND cases compared to controls, but in MND cases there was poor correlation (r2 = 0.06) between corticomotoneuron and spinal motor neuron densities.

We have performed AR gene molecular analysis in several members of a large family with KD as well as in 25 sporadic patients suffering from heterogeneous motoneuron disease (MND).

There was only one possible exception, one young male with initial signs of the disease, who had an apparent normal length allele. An increased pathological allele was also found in 3 patients with MND.

This is particularly true for certain pathological and therapeutic studies that are impractical or impossible to perform in human patients. Nonetheless, postmortem ALS tissue remains the ""gold standard"" against which pathologic findings in animal models must be compared. Four natural disease models have been most extensively studied, including three mouse models: motor neuron degeneration (Mnd), progressive motor neuronopathy (pmn), wobbler, and one canine model: hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy (HCSMA). The wobbler mouse has been the most extensively studied of these models with analyses of clinical, pathological (perikaryon, axon, muscle), and biochemical features. Experimentally induced ALS animal models have allowed controlled testing of various neurotoxic, viral and immune-mediated mechanisms. Molecular techniques have recently generated mouse models in which genes relevant to the human disease or motor neuron biology have been manipulated. The most clinically relevant of these is a transgenic mouse overexpressing the mutated SOD1 gene of FALS patients, which has already provided significant insights into mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in this disease. Because no single animal model perfectly reflects all the clinical and pathological characteristics of ALS, study of selected features from the most relevant models will contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and/or etiology of this disease.","['Pioro EP', 'Mitsumoto H']",1995,3,6,Clin Neurosci,Pioro EP and Mitsumoto H.

9021252,Overview of motor neuron disease: classification and nomenclature.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although a disease that has been well recognized for nearly 150 years, still causes problems of diagnosis and management, as there is no definitive diagnostic test, and the disease is pleomorphic. Research criteria were developed for the categorization of definite, probable, and possible ALS at the El Escorial Workshop (published in 1994). The principal features are upper and lower motor neuron signs at several levels of the neuraxis, without involvement of other neurological systems. Separation of ALS or motor neuron disease (MND) from the spinal muscular atrophies or hereditary spastic paraplegia can be difficult. The relatively rapid progression to death in an average of 5 years is one of the hallmarks of ALS. However, some cases are relatively more benign. The recent finding that mutations of the SOD1 gene underlie about 20% of familial cases of ALS has allowed the recognition that all phenotypes can occur in different members of the same family with the same mutation, clarifying earlier suggestions that different phenotypes represent different diseases. Until the cause and cure of ALS are found, neurologists and rehabilitation specialists must continue to provide essential support for patients with this devastating disease.",['Bradley WG'],1995,3,6,Clin Neurosci,Bradley WG.

7796835,Motor neuron disease and monoclonal gammopathy.,"In a study to determine the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) among patients with motor neuron disease (MND), 6 out of 56 (10.7%) were found to have a monoclonal paraprotein. Of these 6 patients, 4 had an IgG and 2 had an IgA paraprotein. The clinical syndromes consisted of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2 patients, lower motor neuron syndrome with preserved reflexes in at least one limb in 3 patients, and motor neuropathy with multifocal conduction block in 1 patient. The presence of gammopathy appears to correlate with the absence of marked upper motor neuron involvement and with elevated CSF protein concentration. An underlying malignant disorder was ruled out in all 6 patients, and they were considered to have MG of undetermined significance (MGUS). In a control group of 121 age-matched patients with other neuroimmunological disorders, 5 patients (4.13%) had MG. Four of these had gammopathy associated with malignant myeloma, and 1 had MGUS. These results support previous reports of increased prevalence of MGUS in patients with MND and suggest that an autoimmune mechanism may play a role in the disease.","['Lavrnić D', 'Vidaković A', 'Miletić V', 'Trikić R', 'Marinković Z', 'Rakocević V', 'Nikolić J', 'Wirguin I', 'Sadiq SA', 'Apostolski S']",1995,35,2,Eur Neurol,"Lavrnić D, et al.

Neuropathological correlations were sought in postmortem studies from a woman with these associated conditions. Cerebral blood flow imaging and autopsy showed cortical abnormalities in the frontal and temporal lobes, but typical argyrophilic Pick's bodies were absent and ubiquitin-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were rare. However, hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed eosinophilic, granular, central cytoplasmic 'clearing' in most neurons of the substantia nigra and in cervical anterior horn cells. Electron microscopy showed that these neurons contained a central cytoplasmic zone cleared of neuromelanin and normal cytoplasmic organelles containing small mitochondria with matrix inclusions and randomly oriented filamentous material. A mitochondrial dysfunction or defective transport of mitochondria into axonal processes needs to be studied as a potential cause for the coassociation of MND and FTD.","['Chang L', 'Cornford M', 'Miller BL', 'Itabashi H', 'Mena I']",1995,6,1,Dementia,"Chang L, et al.

7572072,Motor neuron disease with neurofibrillary tangles in a non-Guamanian patient.,"Neurofibrillary tangles are described in Guamanian and post-encephalitic forms of motor neuron disease (MND) but not in sporadic MND. We report the neuropathological findings in a 79-year-old man who died after a 1-year history of MND without extrapyramidal features or dementia. There was no family history of neurological disease and he had not visited Guam. The spinal cord showed loss of anterior horn cells, and skeletal muscle typical changes of denervation. The brain appeared macroscopically normal but histology revealed many neurofibrillary tangles, particularly in medial temporal lobe structures, insula, nucleus basalis, hippocampus, oculomotor nucleus, raphe nuclei and locus ceruleus. Neurofibrillary tangles were not seen in the primary motor cortex, which appeared histologically unremarkable. Occasional tangles were present in the substantia nigra and pontine nuclei. None were seen in the cerebellum, medulla or spinal cord. The tangles were argyrophilic, and, in sections stained with thioflavin-S, both the intracellular and the extracellular tangles fluoresced strongly under ultraviolet light. The intracellular neurofibrillary tangles reacted strongly with an antibody to tau protein, and only occasional tangles showed weak ubiquitin immunoreactivity. Scattered neuropil threads were present in the cortex in the areas of neurofibrillary tangle formation. No plaques were present in any part of the brain and no A4/beta protein immunoreactivity was detected. Ultrastructural examination revealed Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary tangles composed of paired helical filaments. The present findings further extend the spectrum of diverse neurological disorders associated with neurofibrillary tangles.","['Hilton DA', 'Love S', 'Ferguson I', 'Newman P']",1995,90,1,Acta Neuropathol,"Hilton DA, et al.

The striatal efferent terminals of the GP and SN were visualized immunohistochemically using antibodies to met-enkephalin (MEnk) and substance P (SP). In specimens from patients with sporadic ALS and normal subjects there was intense immunostaining for MEnk and SP throughout the external and internal segments of the GP, respectively. By contrast, a marked reduction of MEnk- and SP-positive striatal efferents was seen in the ventrocaudal portions of both GP segments from the MND/BIs patients. Moreover, while MEnk-positive striosomes was readily detected in the putamen of normals and sporadic ALS patients, there was significant reduction in MEnk immunoreactivity, and no evidence of striosomal organization in the putamen of MND/BIs patients. In addition, whereas the SN of patients with sporadic ALS expressed SP, the ventrolateral SN portion of the MND/BIs patient tested had reduced immunoreactivity. The present findings on patients with MND/BIs may represent a reflection of the topographic striatum degeneration in this disease and appear to provide additional evidence for the heterogeneity of MND.","['Ito H', 'Kusaka H', 'Matsumoto S', 'Imai T']",1995,89,6,Acta Neuropathol,"Ito H, et al.

9316691,Can nimodipine affect progression of motor neuron disease? A double-blind pilot study.,"Recently, there has been some evidence suggesting that exposure to neuroexcitotoxic amino acids, culminating in excessive neuronal calcium influx, may cause nerve cell destruction in motor neuron disease (MND). We therefore hypothesized that central calcium channel blockade with nimodipine might slow-down progression of MND. Two patients with sporadic MND were treated in a double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study with oral nimodipine (120 mg/day) for 5 months. Disease progression was assessed by repeated computerized measurements of isometric force from 20 muscle groups, and calculation of global force score. Global force deterioration slopes during the 5-month periods of nimodipine or placebo therapy were highly linear and almost identical. Nimodipine therefore does not seem to be effective in changing the course of MND. The observed remarkable linearity of disease course also confirms that cross-over methodology and serial measurements of muscle force are constructive tools in the clinical evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.","['Ziv I', 'Achiron A', 'Djaldetti R', 'Abraham M', 'Melamed E']",1994,17,5,Clin Neuropharmacol,"Ziv I, et al.

We examined premotor (superior frontal gyrus), primary motor (precentral gyrus), primary sensory (postcentral gyrus), and parietal (superior parietal gyrus/precuneus) neocortical regions of 12 patients with MND and six normal control subjects. Patients with MND were representative of three syndromes: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with definite lower motor neuron and upper motor neuron signs, MND with probable upper motor neuron signs (PUMNS), and progressive spinal muscular atrophy (PSMA) with lower motor neuron signs only. Compared with healthy controls, ALS patients had a significant decrease in NA/Cr resonance intensity ratios, most prominently in the primary motor cortex (p < 0.001) but also, to varying degrees, in primary sensory (p < 0.01), posterior premotor, and parietal (p < 0.05) regions. Patients classified as ALS-PUMNS showed less prominent reduction in NA/Cr ratios in the same regions; patients with PSMA had normal cortical NA/Cr ratios. Sequential studies in one patient suggested that 1H-MRSI could document progression of the NA/Cr abnormality. Decreased NA/Cr ratios on 1H-MRSI provide an index of cortical motor neuron loss and/or dysfunction in MND patients. Clinical applications of 1H-MRSI could include documenting the extent of upper motor neuron involvement, aiding diagnosis of syndromes presenting with an ALS-like picture, and monitoring disease progression.","['Pioro EP', 'Antel JP', 'Cashman NR', 'Arnold DL']",1994,44,10,Neurology,"Pioro EP, et al.

Most positive patients had antibody titers of 1:200 or 1:2000 while higher titers were only found in seven patients with MND, one with chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy, two with MS, two with non-neural immune diseases and one with stroke. The reacting protein had a higher molecular mass than P0 and was only faintly bound by an anti-P0 antiserum, but had the same N-terminal amino acid sequence of P0. The difference in molecular mass between P0 and the 35-kDa protein and the IgG reactivity of one patient's IgG with the 35-kDa protein persisted after its deglycosylation and dephosphorylation. Although there is no evidence that these antibodies are pathogenic, their frequent occurrence in MND and other immune-mediated conditions supports the hypothesis of an activation of the immune system in MND.","['Nobile-Orazio E', 'Manfredini E', 'Sgarzi M', 'Spagnol G', 'Allaria S', 'Quadroni M', 'Scarlato G']",1994,53,2,J Neuroimmunol,"Nobile-Orazio E, et al.

7847054,Rising mortality from motor neurone disease in Sweden 1961-1990: the relative role of increased population life expectancy and environmental factors.,"Recent studies of mortality from motor neurone disease (MND) in Sweden have demonstrated rising levels of mortality from the disease, especially amongst older age groups. Case-control investigations have suggested that certain environmental factors are significantly related to variations in mortality from the disease, and are associated with a probable individual susceptibility to MND. This study applies an innovative epidemiological technique to longitudinal and cohort analysis of Swedish mortality from MND during the period 1961 to 1990. Survival modelling shows that a subpopulation susceptible to MND exists in Sweden, as has been demonstrated in other countries. The increased life expectancy of the Swedish population since 1961 has resulted in more of that susceptible population living to the ages at which MND is expressed, explaining the majority of the increase in mortality from the disease. However, environmental factors may play a role in accelerating the course of MND and may affect the timing of death within the susceptible sub-population.","['Neilson S', 'Gunnarsson LG', 'Robinson I']",1994,90,3,Acta Neurol Scand,"Neilson S, et al.

7812773,[3H]D-aspartate binding sites in the normal human spinal cord and changes in motor neuron disease: a quantitative autoradiographic study.,"The distribution and density of glutamate transporter sites was determined in human cervical and lumbar spinal cord, by quantitative autoradiography using [3H]D-aspartate. In the normal human spinal cord (n = 8) there was specific binding of [3H]D-aspartate throughout the spinal grey matter, with the highest levels observed in the substantia gelatinosa and central grey matter. In the ventral horns, particularly at the L5 level, focal hot spots of binding were observed in a distribution corresponding to that of lower motor neuron somata. Comparison of motor neuron disease (MND) cases (n = 12) with normal controls showed a reduction in the density of [3H]D-aspartate binding in the intermediate grey matter and the substantia gelatinosa of the lumbar cord. These changes were more marked in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) compared to the progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) subgroup, and may be due to loss of glutamatergic terminals of the corticospinal tract. The changes observed in the cervical cord were milder and did not reach statistical significance. No differences were found between [3H]D-aspartate binding in the spinal cords of the normal controls and a neurological disease control group (n = 6), suggesting that the changes observed in MND are disease specific.

In the motor cortex of MND cases, an increased density of [3H]kainate binding sites was observed which was most marked in the deep layers. No significant differences were observed in [3H]CNQX binding in the motor cortex between MND and control cases. In the spinal cord significantly increased densities of both [3H]CNQX and [3]kainate binding sites were found in the substantia gelatinosa and the intermediate grey matter in the MND group. The changes in [3H]kainate binding were observed only in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) subgroup of MND, while the changes in [3H]CNQX binding in the spinal cord were more marked in ALS compared to progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) cases. These findings provide evidence in support of a disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission in MND and suggest that there may be an increased excitatory drive to motor neurons via non-NMDA receptors. It is unclear at present whether the changes observed represent a compensatory response to loss of motor neurons in MND or a pathophysiological phenomenon contributing to motor neuron degeneration.

7807144,Excitotoxicity and motor neurone disease: a review of the evidence.,"Excitotoxic mechanisms have a well established role in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury following acute CNS insults such as ischaemia and trauma. Their role in the selective cell death which occurs in chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as motor neurone disease (MND) is more speculative. The traditional classification of glutamate receptor subtypes which mediate excitotoxicity requires modification in the light of new molecular data. There is much greater structural and functional diversity in this receptor family than previously envisaged and it is quite possible that specific populations of neurones will be characterised by a unique profile of glutamate receptor subtypes which may be a factor determining their selective vulnerability. The molecular mechanisms underlying excitotoxic neuronal injury are still being elucidated but it is clear that the cascade of events resulting from elevation of intracellular free calcium is likely to play a major role. As well as being a primary mechanism of neuronal injury, excitotoxicity can secondarily damage neurones whose energy metabolism is impaired from some primary pathological process. The 8 lines of evidence that primary or secondary excitotoxic mechanisms may be involved in the selective neuronal injury of MND are discussed. The evidence, while still circumstantial, is sufficient to warrant further research effort in this field, not least because the emergence of pharmacological agents which modify specific aspects of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission offer the possibility of therapeutic intervention in MND.",['Shaw PJ'],1994,124 Suppl,,J Neurol Sci,Shaw PJ.

The manganese content in 24-h food in Hohara was significantly (P < 0.01) higher than that in the remote control areas. The incidence of MND in Hohara was well explained by the two parameters, manganese content in food and the magnesium concentration in drinking water (r2 = 0.99), suggesting that MND in this focus can be understood as a result of excess intake of manganese from food coupled with low intake of magnesium from drinking water. The reference to epidemiology and occupational medicine supports this conclusion. The crude annual MND incidence per 10(5) population in other foci may be predicted as MND = e alpha ln[beta(Mn in food)gamma/(Mg in water)], where alpha is 5.389-5.748, beta is 0.170-0.166, and gamma is 1.239-1.226.","['Iwami O', 'Watanabe T', 'Moon CS', 'Nakatsuka H', 'Ikeda M']",1994,149,1-2,Sci Total Environ,"Iwami O, et al.

This paper analyses the consistent trend of rising ALS mortality in France over the years 1968-1990, a period during which crude mortality rose from 400 deaths in 1968 to 950 deaths in 1990. The findings indicate that age-specific mortality rates have risen at ages older than 54 years for men and 53 years for women and decreased slightly at younger ages. The evolving ALS mortality pattern is attributable to changing inter-disease competition resulting from the increased life expectancy of the French population, rather than to changing environmental aetiopathogenic factors or to substantial artefact effects.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'Alperovitch A']",1994,241,7,J Neurol,"Neilson S, et al.

8160780,Accumulation of the adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit C in the mnd mutant mouse. A model for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.,"The motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mutant mouse, initially described as an autosomal semidominant model of motor neuron disease, is characterized by progressive loss of motor activities and the accumulation of lipofuscin-like material in the cytoplasm of neurons in many regions of the nervous system. The stored material is composed of granular, multilamellar, fingerprint, and curvilinear profiles and degenerating mitochondria. These inclusions are associated with the accumulation of subunit c of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase in an age-dependent pattern. These abnormalities first appear in neurons of the thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex and eventually involve virtually all nerve cells, including those in the retina and enteric nervous system. This type of neuropathology and the presence of subunit c in neurons of mnd mutant mice are characteristic features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). The murine disease resembles Batten's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common NCL in humans. The mnd mouse should be of great value for investigations of the genetics of NCL, for studies designed to delineate the mechanism that lead to neuronal degeneration in these disorders, and for testing novel therapeutic approaches.","['Pardo CA', 'Rabin BA', 'Palmer DN', 'Price DL']",1994,144,4,Am J Pathol,"Pardo CA, et al.

8144516,"Two related proteolipids and dolichol-linked oligosaccharides accumulate in motor neuron degeneration mice (mnd/mnd), a model for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.","In this study, we show that two biochemical markers of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are present in a mutant mouse (mnd/mnd) that exhibits symptoms of the disease. Subunit c of the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase, a proteolipid that accumulates in storage bodies of most forms of NCL and several animal models, is dramatically increased in mnd/mnd mouse brain, kidney, liver, heart, and pancreas. Interestingly, another related proteolipid, subunit c of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, also accumulates in several mnd/mnd tissues. The molar ratio of the vacuolar subunit c to the F1F0 subunit c is approximately one to two in enriched storage bodies from brain. The relative accumulation of the vacuolar subunit c correlates with its abundance in normal tissues. It appears in decreasing amounts in brain, kidney, and liver and is not detected in heart or pancreas. Aged mice and two mutant mouse lines, juvenile bare (jb) and mucopolysaccharidosis, type VII (gusmps), did not accumulate either of these proteolipids. Dolichol-linked oligosaccharides also accumulate in NCLs and are increased 17-fold in mnd/mnd mouse brain. Thus, mnd/mnd mice seem to be an excellent model for NCLs since they not only share clinical signs and histopathology, but also two biochemical markers. The accumulation of the vacuolar subunit c in this model may prove to be a marker for distinguishing different forms of NCLs.","['Faust JR', 'Rodman JS', 'Daniel PF', 'Dice JF', 'Bronson RT']",1994,269,13,J Biol Chem,"Faust JR, et al.

8021698,"Longitudinal analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mortality in Norway, 1966-1989: evidence for a susceptible subpopulation.","Mortality from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Norway has increased substantially over the last two or three decades, as it has in other Western nations. The reasons for this general increase are not clear, but the rise has been attributed to increasing exposure to a broad range of environmental agents. Our previous research has indicated that another explanation for the substantial rise in ALS mortality is more likely to be valid. In particular, the mortality rate curve for ALS is consistent with deaths being confined to an inherently susceptible subpopulation. The size of susceptible subpopulations and mortality rates within them have been shown to be consistent in England and Wales, Japan and the United States. The same methods have been used to analyse Norwegian mortality data. The analysis demonstrates that the rise in ALS mortality is real and that the cause of the increase is almost entirely attributable to the increasing life expectancy of the Norwegian population. Increased life expectancy, a consequence of decreasing general mortality, allows ALS susceptible individuals to survive to the ages at which ALS is expressed. As in other national populations, it is expected that mortality from the disease will continue to increase with continuing increases in life expectancy.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'Nymoen EH']",1994,122,2,J Neurol Sci,"Neilson S, et al.

In the motor cortex specific [3H]kainate binding was present in all cortical laminae with the highest density in laminae and II and the upper part of III and lower densities in the middle and deep laminae. In the premotor cortex a band of high density was found in laminae V and VI as well as in the superficial laminae. In the normal brainstem kainate receptors had a heterogeneous distribution. Brainstem motor nuclei which tend to be affected in motor neuron disease (MND) had very low densities of binding sites, whereas the oculomotor nucleus had a higher density.

8125718,Retinal degeneration in motor neuron degeneration: a mouse model of ceroid lipofuscinosis.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the retinal degeneration of the motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse, and to confirm its inheritance pattern and gene location.
METHODS: In screening the mnd/mnd mouse for ocular disease, a retinal degeneration was found that was evaluated by serial electroretinography, histology, electron microscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and genetic and linkage analysis.
RESULTS: In homozygous mnd mice, photoreceptor and outer nuclear layers show cell loss by 5 weeks after birth. By 2 months, the peripheral retina is preferentially thinner than central retina, and by 6 months the entire retina is reduced in thickness. The electroretinogram was extinguished by 6 months. Transmission electron microscopy at 3 and 6 months showed distinct cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of the curvilinear profiles seen in human ceroid lipofuscinosis. Genetic analyses show that the retinal degeneration in mnd mice is inherited as a single autosomal gene with recessive expression, and a three-point cross placed the retinal degeneration at the mnd locus on the proximal end of mouse chromosome 8. Crosses with other known strains with retinal degeneration were normal. CONCLUSIONS. The mnd mouse model is similar to the juvenile onset Spielmeyer-Vogt form of ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease), and provides a good model for the retinal degeneration found in these patients.","['Chang B', 'Bronson RT', 'Hawes NL', 'Roderick TH', 'Peng C', 'Hageman GS', 'Heckenlively JR']",1994,35,3,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,"Chang B, et al.

All patients studied had anterior horn cell degeneration without neuropathological evidence of corticospinal tract degeneration. Spinal cords from six patients with no neurological disease served as controls. Immunocytochemical techniques were used. The results show that in L-MND there is decreased SP immunoreactivity of the anterior horn neuropil, but preservation of immunoreactive dots around the cell body and proximal processes, and the presence of some residual neurons in the affected gray matter that are surrounded by a dense accumulation of immunoreaction products. These findings resemble those of classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), indicating similarities in the distribution patterns of presynaptic terminals in the anterior horn of L-MND and classical ALS.","['Ikemoto A', 'Kawanami T', 'Llena JF', 'Hirano A']",1994,53,2,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,"Ikemoto A, et al.

SLIs were not detected in two cases of adult-onset MND with basophilic inclusions. This may indicate that adult-onset MND with basophilic inclusions is a distinct nosological entity of classical ALS and some relationship to juvenile ALS with basophilic inclusions is suggested.","['Matsumoto S', 'Kusaka H', 'Ito H', 'Yamasaki M', 'Imai T']",1993,33,11,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Matsumoto S, et al.

8282470,Birthplace as a risk factor in motor neurone disease and Parkinson's disease.,"A proportional mortality study was conducted to determine if state of birth is a risk factor associated with motor neurone disease (MND) and Parkinson's disease (PD) using US death certificate information for 1981. State of birth was used as a surrogate variable for location of early childhood environment. A gradient of risk by geographical area in the US was found for MND and PD. Cerebral vascular accident (CVA) deaths served as a comparison group. Multiple sclerosis (MS) deaths were analysed to validate the methods used. A geographical relationship between latitude proportional mortality ratios for MND, PD and MS by state of birth, and a geographical relationship between latitude and proportional mortality ratios for MND and MS by state of birth were found. Statistical modelling was used to compare the deaths from MND, PD, MS, CVA to all other deaths in the US by state of birth. The resulting models were evaluated to determine if any individual states were not well represented by the model for each disease. As predicted, no pattern was evident for CVA. The geographical gradient observed for MS was as predicted by other studies. The geographical pattern found for MND has a northwest to southeast gradient and the pattern found for PD has a west to east gradient.","['Betemps EJ', 'Buncher CR']",1993,22,5,Int J Epidemiol,Betemps EJ and Buncher CR.

Levels at baseline and 1.5 h after loading did not differ, but at 4 h, plasma glycine levels in MND patients remained significantly higher than in normal and neurological controls (P < 0.013). Cerebrospinal fluid glycine levels, which were maximal at 2.5 h, were also significantly higher in MND patients than neurological controls (P < 0.04).

8302713,Motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis--lessons from ubiquitin.,"Ubiquitin is a stress protein implicated in the degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. In a neuropathological study of 43 cases with motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS) and 44 control cases the distribution and specificity of Bunina bodies and ubiquitin-reactive inclusions (UBRI) were investigated. The primary motor area showed nerve cell loss in 67%, Bunina bodies in Betz cells (10%) and UBRI in small pyramidal cells (17%). Degeneration of anterior horn cells in all cases coincided with Bunina bodies (84%) and UBRI (98%) in the same location; the motor nuclei of the caudal brain stem were also involved almost to the same degree. More resistant nuclei like the oculomotor nuclei or the Onuf's nucleus showed no degeneration but UBRI in 11% and 18% of cases, respectively. Like the degenerative process, the formation of UBRI was not confined to motor nuclei but also involved the brain stem reticular formation, substantia nigra, and Clarke's nucleus showing that MND/ALS is a multiple system degeneration. UBRI were found in only one control case in the anterior horn cells and in one case in the hypoglossal nucleus showing that UBRI, although not being absolutely specific for MND/ALS, have practical value for the neuropathological diagnosis of that disease. The pathogenetical implications of UBRI in MND/ALS are discussed.",['Bergmann M'],1993,189,8,Pathol Res Pract,Bergmann M. Motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis--lessons from ubiquitin.

I believe that MMN is simply a multifocal, predominantly motor variant of CIDP. Furthermore, the highly touted resemblance of MMN to MND has been exaggerated; these syndromes are only superficially similar and can readily be distinguished on clinical and electrophysiologic grounds. MMN is rare but is probably more common than initially believed; certainly, the literature is replete with reports of cases. Further studies are needed to clarify fully the relationship between CIDP and MMN and the role of glycolipid antibodies in MMN and other motor syndromes.",['Parry GJ'],1993,13,3,Semin Neurol,Parry GJ.

8263553,Oculomotor abnormalities in motor neuron disease.,"To determine whether there are oculomotor abnormalities in motor neuron disease (MND), electro-oculographic recordings were performed prospectively in 16 MND patients and the results compared with age-matched healthy controls. Parameters analysed included random and fixed saccades (latency, velocity and accuracy), smooth pursuit (gain, total harmonic distortion and number of saccadic intrusions) and optokinetic nystagmus (maximal and mean slow component velocity). Increased saccadic latencies and decreased smooth pursuit gain were the main alterations in the MND group. Correlation with clinical variables showed a positive relationship between smooth pursuit saccadic intrusions and the bulbar clinical score and the rate of progression and a lower optokinetic nystagmus maximal velocity in patients with pseudobulbar syndrome. Our results demonstrate the presence of subclinical supranuclear abnormalities in MND, and support the notion that MND is not merely a degeneration of the motor system.","['Marti-Fàbregas J', 'Roig C']",1993,240,8,J Neurol,Marti-Fàbregas J and Roig C.

Patients were divided into four groups according to the results of SPECT. Group 1 consisted of four patients with reduced isotope uptake in the frontal lobe, including the motor area, and in the anterior part of the temporal lobe; group 2 consisted of two patients with reduced isotope uptake in the motor area spreading to the adjacent frontal lobe; group 3 consisted of eight patients with reduced isotope uptake confined to the motor area; and group 4 consisted of four patients without reduced isotope uptake. We found dementia in group 1, borderline dementia in group 2, and no cognitive deficit in group 3 or four.

8257974,The effect of ventilatory muscle training on respiratory function and capacity in ambulatory and bed-ridden patients with neuromuscular disease.,"Most patients with neuromuscular disease develop muscle weakness, including the ventilatory muscles leading to respiratory difficulty and, at times, respiratory insufficiency. We studied the effect of ventilatory muscle training on the ventilatory function and capacity of patients with various types of neuromuscular disease. The ambulatory patients were divided into three major groups. Group I (n = 6) patients with motor neuron disease (MND), such as amyotrophic latera sclerosis; Group II (n = 11) patients with myoneural junction disease (MNJ), such as myasthenia gravis and: Group III (n = 7) patients with muscle diseases such as progressive muscular disease. Patients were evaluated for their neuromuscular diagnosis and status of the disease. A complete physical examination and the various neuromuscular tests were performed. A complete respiratory evaluation was applied: pulmonary function tests (PFT), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). Patients then started ventilatory muscle training by resistive breathing, as a prophylactic treatment, for 10 min, three times daily, with a resistance which would induce fatigue. All tests were repeated every six weeks, and the results were as follow: forced vital capacity (FVC) changed from 38.8 +/- 12.3 to 53.2 +/- 9.6% (NS) of predicted value in group I, from 49.8 +/- 8.7 to 66.1 +/- 7.5% (p < 0.002) in group II, and from 47.0 +/- 7.5 to 53.3 +/- 7.6% (p < 0.04) in group III. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 34.8 +/- 11.0, 46.3 +/- 5, and 45.1 +/- 9% for the three groups, respectively, and did not change with training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Gross D', 'Meiner Z']",1993,48,4,Monaldi Arch Chest Dis,Gross D and Meiner Z.

8232749,Parvalbumin and calbindin D-28k in the human motor system and in motor neuron disease.,"Calbindin D-28k and parvalbumin are neuronal calcium binding proteins of interest in relation to neurodegenerative diseases. Expression of calbindin and parvalbumin may be one of the determinants of selective vulnerability in these disorders. The distribution of these proteins was surveyed in the normal human motor system and in motor neuron disease (MND) using immunocytochemistry in formalin fixed post-mortem tissues. CNS tissues from 14 MND patients (mean age 61.2 years, mean post-mortem delay 24.6 h) and seven controls (mean age 62.6 years, mean post-mortem delay 25.3 h) were studied. Preliminary studies on the effects of fixation were performed. In normal cases upper and lower motor neurons showed absent expression of both proteins. Several neuronal groups characteristically spared in MND showed varying patterns of immunoreactivity: oculomotor neurons showed parvalbumin staining of the perikaryon; the thoracic preganglionic sympathetic neurons showed calbindin staining in perikarya. Onuf's nucleus showed calbindin staining in the neuropil only. In motor neuron disease a loss of ventral horn interneurons and calbindin immunoreactive processes was observed with no other disease related changes in the spinal cord, brain-stem, or motor cortex. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the distribution of these proteins is one determinant of selective vulnerability to the neurodegenerative processes in MND acting via disturbance of neuronal calcium homeostasis.","['Ince P', 'Stout N', 'Shaw P', 'Slade J', 'Hunziker W', 'Heizmann CW', 'Baimbridge KG']",1993,19,4,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Ince P, et al.

They probably represent one extreme of the ALS spectrum rather than a distinct subtype. Familial ALS (FamALS) was diagnosed in 7%. It developed earlier in life but ran a slightly longer course, which suggests a different disease process. Overall there was a statistically significant predominance of males, especially in 17 cases (2%) of progressive muscular atrophy (PMA).

However, in Japan mortality appears to have fallen significantly since the late 1960s, especially amongst women. Studies of the cause of both the worldwide rise, and the unique decline in MND mortality in Japan, have largely failed to substantiate the role of any single factor, or group of factors in these phenomena. Modelling the relationship between age and mortality using gompertzian analysis has already shown that the rise in MND mortality in England and Wales, and the United States, is mainly the result of increased longevity and decreasing competition from other causes of death amongst a susceptible subpopulation. Employing the same techniques on Japanese mortality data from 1950 to 1990 demonstrates that an unusual and accelerated increase of mortality occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, probably caused by an earlier unknown but extremely potent environmental agent or agents. This premature depletion of the susceptible subpopulation resulted subsequently in a lower than expected mortality rate. Mortality is now rising slowly to expected levels as the size of the susceptible subpopulation recovers to reach the ages at which MND is normally expressed. Further substantial rises in mortality are anticipated in future decades.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'Kondo K']",1993,117,1-2,J Neurol Sci,"Neilson S, et al.

8374156,The functional and psychological status of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: some implications for rehabilitation.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), known as motor neurone disease (MND) in Britain, poses special problems in rehabilitation by virtue of its nature, trajectory and the age of patients with the disease. Many practical difficulties of ALS are well known, but there has been little research on the psychological parameters of the disease. This study of 181 ALS patients, from a national register in England and Wales, indicates that, contrary to some previous research, psychological distress (measured by the General Health Questionnaire) is widespread among patients at all stages of the disease. Severity of functional impairment is significantly related to psychological distress, but explains only a small part of the variance. Rehabilitation in relation to ALS must take account of the high incidence of psychological difficulties, as well as the considerable functional problems associated with the disease.","['Hunter MD', 'Robinson IC', 'Neilson S']",1993,15,3,Disabil Rehabil,"Hunter MD, et al.

Patients were examined three times during an 8 week treatment period, using a summated score for several manually and functionally tested muscles (sum score), myometry, jitter, fibre density (FD), macro motor unit potential (MUP), and supramaximal evoked muscle action potentials. No differences were found between Org 2766 and placebo treated patients. In an open 1 yr follow-up study, 5 out of 13 patients treated with Org 2766 died; the others showed continued progression of weakness. The methods used for assessment of muscle function were compared. The highest interest reliability was obtained in the sum score and myometry. Mean differences that might be detectable were relatively small for the sum score and myometry, and large for FD and MUP.

8492954,Risk factors associated with equine motor neuron disease: a possible model for human MND.,"Equine motor neuron disease (EMND), a newly described neurodegenerative disease, bears a striking resemblance to progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) in humans. We present a comparison of the equine and human diseases and the results of a case-control study conducted to identify intrinsic factors associated with EMND. Cases included all horses with a confirmed diagnosis of EMND diagnosed in the United States since 1985 (32 cases). Controls included horses diagnosed with either cervical stenotic myelopathy, equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy, or protozoan myelitis at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University (153 controls). Logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with the risk of EMND. Risk factors considered were age, sex, and breed of the horse. Most cases of EMND (30 of 32) have been sporadic. There was a breed association with the risk of EMND. Quarter horses were at a high risk for developing EMND (odds ratio [OR] = 12.7; 95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 49.6); thoroughbred horses were at increased risk (OR = 2.9, 0.8 to 10.4). There was also an age association with the risk of EMND. The risk increased with age, peaked at 16 years, and then declined, a pattern similar to that for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in humans. There was no sex association with the disease. Despite the breed association, equine lymphocyte antigen studies have not revealed a systematic pattern, suggesting that genetic factors influencing susceptibility to EMND may be outside the major histocompatibility complex.","['Mohammed HO', 'Cummings JF', 'Divers TJ', 'Valentine B', 'de Lahunta A', 'Summers B', 'Farrow BR', 'Trembicki-Graves K', 'Mauskopf A']",1993,43,5,Neurology,"Mohammed HO, et al.

In an attempt to determine characteristics of the pathology of motor neurons, three cases of MND with dementia were examined and compared with 16 cases of sporadic classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with light and electron microscopes. All these cases with dementia showed loss of motor neurons, chromatolysis, spheroids, and Bunina bodies. Quantitative analyses of the 5th lumbar anterior horns showed no significant differences in incidences of chromatolysis and Bunina bodies between cases with and without dementia.

8389815,Cytoplasmic inclusions in spinal neurons of the motor neuron degeneration (Mnd) mouse. I. Light microscopic analysis.,"The motor neuron degeneration (Mnd) mutation in the mouse is a late onset, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease in which ventral horn neurons have been shown to contain numerous, large cytoplasmic inclusions. Histochemical and immunocytochemical studies performed on spinal cord from Mnd/Mnd mice in late stages of the disease showed the inclusions to contain protein, lipid and carbohydrate moieties. Spinal neurons, especially those in spinal lamina IX, contained increased beta-glucuronidase activity in the form of large cytoplasmic inclusions. Such inclusions also contained increased acid phosphatase and trimetaphosphatase activity. When immunostained with antiubiquitin antibodies, intracellular ubiquitin deposits were present as accumulations of varying size; some were amorphous while others contained small granules. Extraneuronal ubiquitin deposits were detected in the neuropil. Immunostaining with monoclonal antibody ML30, used here to assay for the presence of a mitochondrial epitope in the inclusions, was widespread and punctate in white and grey matter from Mnd/Mnd and age-matched control spinal cords. The overall pattern of staining was similar for both tissue sources and did not correspond to any of the other probes which reacted with the inclusions in Mnd neurons. The presence of increased levels of lysosomal hydrolases and ubiquitinated molecules suggests that the two general systems for intracellular digestion are activated in Mnd/Mnd spinal neurons.","['Mazurkiewicz JE', 'Callahan LM', 'Swash M', 'Martin JE', 'Messer A']",1993,116,1,J Neurol Sci,"Mazurkiewicz JE, et al.

8326268,Utility of Scottish morbidity and mortality data for epidemiological studies of motor neuron disease.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of (1) hospital discharge data and (2) death certificates, coded as motor neuron disease (MND).
DESIGN: Comparison of data from The Scottish Motor Neuron Disease Register (SMNDR) with routinely collected Scottish Hospital In-Patient Statistics (SHIPS) and death certificate coding.
SETTING: Scotland UK.
PATIENTS: 1) 379 adults (> 15 years) discharged for the first time from a Scottish hospital in 1989-90 and (2) 281 deaths in the same period assigned to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, category 335 (MND).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The sensitivity and positive predictive value of a diagnosis of MND as retrieved by (1) the Information and Statistics Division of the Common Services Agency for the Scottish Health Service for morbidity data and (2) the Registrar General's office for mortality data, using the SMNDR as the 'gold standard'.
RESULTS: (1) Thirty per cent of adult patients identified as having MND by SHIPS did not have this disease and 23% of patients with MND did not appear on SHIPS. The sensitivity of a diagnosis of MND, as retrieved by SHIPS, was 84% and the positive predictive value was 70% overall. Miscoding of patients with pseudobulbar palsy caused by cerebrovascular disease was the major source of false positive error. The incidence of adult onset sporadic MND was over estimated by SHIPS by a factor of 1.6. (2) Mortality data were more accurate, with a false negative rate of 6% and a positive predictive value of 90%.
CONCLUSIONS: Coded hospital discharge data are an inaccurate record of a diagnosis of MND and cannot, in their present form, be used as a reliable measure of disease incidence in Scotland. Greater care is required in the preparation of discharge summaries and coding if these data are to be useful for health care planning and epidemiological research. SHIPS is, however, an important source of information to achieve a complete sample of patients with MND. There is also a problematic false positive rate for mortality data but this source more closely approximates true incidence.","['Chancellor AM', 'Swingler RJ', 'Fraser H', 'Clarke JA', 'Warlow CP']",1993,47,2,J Epidemiol Community Health,"Chancellor AM, et al.

8095977,Synaptosomal glutamate uptake declines progressively in the spinal cord of a mutant mouse with motor neuron disease.,"It has been suggested that the degeneration of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a consequence of excitotoxicity resulting from a loss of synaptosomal glutamate uptake. The role of synaptosomal glutamate uptake in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease was studied in the Mnd mouse. Glutamate uptake in spinal-cord synaptosomes declined in parallel with the onset of behavioral deficits in Mnd mice but lagged considerably behind the appearance of pathology in motor neurons. Glutamate uptake did not decline significantly in corpus striatum, and GABA uptake did not change significantly in either spinal cord or striatum. The presence of pronounced histopathological changes before the loss of glutamate uptake suggests that the decline of glutamate uptake is a consequence rather than the primary cause of motor neuron disease in the Mnd mouse.","['Battaglioli G', 'Martin DL', 'Plummer J', 'Messer A']",1993,60,4,J Neurochem,"Battaglioli G, et al.

Ultrastructurally, the inclusions have the pentalaminar structure characteristic of some form of human neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and of canine and ovine models of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Similar inclusions are observed in many somatic organs and in the retina, which develops photoreceptor degeneration. This mutation, previously considered a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, may be a useful model for molecular and genetic studies of human neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis because mice have been well characterized genetically. Since they are inexpensive to breed and maintain, they can also be used to test therapeutic interventions.","['Bronson RT', 'Lake BD', 'Cook S', 'Taylor S', 'Davisson MT']",1993,33,4,Ann Neurol,"Bronson RT, et al.

8475687,Rising mortality from motor neurone disease: an explanation.,"There is considerable debate about the increasing mortality from motor neurone disease (MND). However, examination of the relationship between increased life expectancy (through decreased general mortality) and increased mortality in both England and Wales and the United States indicates a close association between the two variables. Using a statistical model, defined sub-populations susceptible to MND can be identified in both countries. The size of such a sub-population has been estimated from the 1989 mortality data to be approximately 160,000 people in England and Wales. The proportion of this sub-population dying from MND has increased over the last 30 years, rather than, as previously, dying at an earlier age from other conditions. On this basis, deaths from MND are expected to increase by a further 20% in this sub-population between 1991-2021 because of continuing changes in life expectancy. MND is a condition made increasingly visible in mortality statistics through decreased general mortality, rather than one in which the underlying population at risk has substantially changed. Aetiological extrapolations from the data indicate that susceptibility to the disease is acquired early in life, and that it is unlikely, given the relative stability of the underlying sub-population, that either changed environmental circumstances or artifactual factors can account in themselves for the rise in mortality.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'Clifford Rose F', 'Hunter M']",1993,87,3,Acta Neurol Scand,"Neilson S, et al.

8383290,Patterns of sensory nerve conduction abnormalities in demyelinating and axonal peripheral nerve disorders.,"The pattern of an abnormal median-normal sural (AMNS) sensory response is associated with acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP and CIDP) and considered unusual in other types of neuropathy, although specificity and sensitivity of this pattern have not been evaluated. We compared sensory responses (patterns and absolute values) in patients with AIDP, CIDP, diabetic polyneuropathy (DP), and motor neuron disease (MND). Using strict criteria, the AMNS pattern occurred more frequently in recent onset AIDP (39%) compared with CIDP (28%), DP (14%-23%), or MND (22%) patients. This pattern was found in 3% of control subjects. The extreme pattern of an absent median-present sural response occurred only in AIDP and CIDP patients and in no other groups. Abnormalities of both nerves were more common in long-standing polyneuropathies such as CIDP and DP compared with AIDP or MND. Median nerve amplitudes were reduced significantly in AIDP, CIDP, and DP patients compared with MND patients, whereas sural nerve amplitudes were significantly reduced only in DP and CIDP patients. These findings may reflect early distal nerve involvement particularly in AIDP patients which is highlighted by differences in median and sural nerve recording electrode placement. We conclude that, in the appropriate clinical setting, the AMNS pattern, an absent median-present sural response pattern, or a reduced median amplitude compared with the sural amplitude supports a diagnosis of a primary demyelinating polyneuropathy.","['Bromberg MB', 'Albers JW']",1993,16,3,Muscle Nerve,Bromberg MB and Albers JW.

The glucose uptake was elevated by 34% in the presence of plasma from MND patients (n = 21) when compared with age matched controls (n = 28; p < 0.001). The uptake of glucose was not influenced by gender or any age dependent variations. The relationship of this effect to glucose under-utilisation in the CNS needs to be explored.","['Karim AR', 'Virk PK', 'Rossi ML', 'Williams AC', 'Sturman SG']",1993,8,2,Funct Neurol,"Karim AR, et al.

There were no sensory impairment and amyotrophy was observed in only one case. This picture suggested the diagnosis of motor neuron disease (MND). However, neurophysiologic examination demonstrated the presence of multifocal conduction blocks (CB) of the motor axons which were preferentially located in the proximal nerve segments and always at points atypical to nerve compression. The peripheral sensitive conductions and the somatosensory evoked potentials were normal, even through the nerve segments where the CB were located. Since this is a treatable potentially reversible syndrome, this motor neuropathy with CB should be included in the differential diagnosis of MND.","['Traba A', 'Esteban A']",1993,8,2,Neurologia,Traba A and Esteban A.

8445403,"Antiglycolipid antibodies, immunoglobulins and paraproteins in motor neuron disease: a population based case-control study.","The role of humoral autoimmune factors in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease (MND) is currently under considerable scrutiny. In particular, there have been many reports of abnormal serum immunoglobulin patterns and elevated titres of anti-ganglioside antibodies in patients with MND. However, many of these studies may be biased by the selection criteria for patients and controls. In order to carefully address this issue we obtained 82 blood samples from consecutive MND patients identified through a national MND register in combination with 82 community controls matched for age, sex and geographical area. We used these samples to determine the frequency of monoclonal immunoglobulins (mIgs) and measure the levels of serum immunoglobulins and anti-GM1 ganglioside antibodies in sporadic cases of MND in comparison with normal controls. Serum mIgs detected using high resolution and immunofixation agarose electrophoresis were present in 1.2% of MND patients and 2.4% of controls. Using a highly sensitive isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting method, monoclonal or oligoclonal immunoglobulins were found in 28% of MND patients and 27% of controls. Anti-GM1 antibodies were present in 26% of MND patients and 18% of controls (odds ratio = 1.5, 95%, CI 0.7-3.6) with no significant differences in titres between the 2 groups. Mean immunoglobulin G, A and M levels were equal in 2 groups. Thus, although alterations in these parameters were identified, we were unable to demonstrate any significant difference between MND patients and controls. We conclude that the majority of sporadic cases of MND are unlikely to have an autoimmune basis as judged by the lack of abnormalities in these parameters.","['Willison HJ', 'Chancellor AM', 'Paterson G', 'Veitch J', 'Singh S', 'Whitelaw J', 'Kennedy PG', 'Warlow CP']",1993,114,2,J Neurol Sci,"Willison HJ, et al.

Findings were quantified and compared with those in control nerves. Lymphocytes in chronic and acute axonal degeneration were studied in sural nerve biopsy and animal material. Signs of demyelination were studied in MND and controls with infiltrates of T cells. A few T lymphocytes were scattered diffusely within the fascicles. The numbers did not differ between MND and controls. About half of the T cells was positive for CD45RA, the other half being positive for CD45RO. T cells were negative for CD25, CD54 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class II. There were hardly any B lymphocytes. The numbers of lymphocytes in nerves with and without axonal degeneration did not differ. Increased MHC class II expression was present on denervated Schwann cells and macrophages in MND and in sural nerves with axonal degeneration. Macrophages were increased in number and in size, both in MND and in control material with axonal degeneration. No signs of demyelination were present either in MND or in controls. It is concluded that a T cell-mediated process in peripheral nerves in MND is very unlikely.","['Kerkhoff H', 'Troost D', 'Louwerse ES', 'van Dijk M', 'Veldman H', 'Jennekens FG']",1993,85,5,Acta Neuropathol,"Kerkhoff H, et al.

8469015,Static and dynamic models of interdisease competition: past and projected mortality from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.,"Longitudinal Gompertzian analysis is an effective method for determining both the pure probability of death for a given condition and the size of inherently susceptible subpopulations [1]. Gompertzian analysis has been used in this study to provide the parameters necessary to construct a stationary population lifetable (static model) of mortality for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and for multiple sclerosis (MS). The static model demonstrates the relative effect of changing general mortality upon the mortality from each specific disease in a situation where interdisease competition is continuously changing. In order to represent mortality in a real population more closely (where age structure is not the result of mortality rates alone) a dynamic model was constructed for both conditions using the age distributions of the population of England and Wales. The quality of the model was verified by comparison of estimated mortality with historical data from the last three decades. The dynamic model has then been used to estimate mortality from each condition over the next three decades on the basis of population projections made by the Central Statistical Office [2], assuming no major change in the factors which lead to either condition. This analysis demonstrates both the theoretical applicability and practical capabilities of Gompertz-derived mortality models for analysing changing mortality patterns.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'Hunter M']",1993,66,3,Mech Ageing Dev,"Neilson S, et al.

Some institutions are concerned about accepting patients who may need long-term care. Some see 'respite' care as simply a short residential stay with little nursing or medical input being necessary. Others, however, feel that respite offers the potential for palliative care and should be provided within the spectrum of a hospice service. This retrospective study examines that group of MND patients requesting respite care in terms of demographic details, problems identified and medical and nursing interventions made during respite admissions. The results indicate a great need for symptom management in these patients as well as co-ordination of future community care. Most patients were discharged home after respite admissions and the median stay in the hospice (15 days) was identical to that of cancer patients.

MND is more common in men at all ages. Age-specific incidence rises steeply into the seventh decade but the incidence in the very elderly is uncertain. A rise in mortality from MND over recent decades has been demonstrated wherever this has been examined and may be real rather than due to improved case ascertainment. Comparison of incidence studies in different places is complicated by non-standardised methods of case ascertainment and diagnosis but there appear to be differences between well studied populations. In developed countries in the northern hemisphere there is a weak positive correlation between standardised, age-specific incidence and distance from the equator. There is now strong evidence for an environmental factor as the cause of the Western Pacific forms of MND. A number of clusters of sporadic MND have been reported from developed countries, but no single agent identified as responsible.","['Chancellor AM', 'Warlow CP']",1992,55,12,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Chancellor AM and Warlow CP.

A questionnaire about occupational exposures, medical history, lifestyle factors etc was given to all cases in the age range 45-79 and to a random sample of 500 population controls in the same age range. The questionnaires were answered by 92 cases and 372 controls, a response rate of 85% and 75% respectively.

Heritability with regard to a neurodegenerative disease or thyroid disease seemed to predispose to a risk of developing MND (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.0-4.3). The highest OR was found for the combination of such heritability, exposure to solvents, and male sex (OR = 15.6, 95% CI 2.8-87.0), a combination that occurred for seven cases and three controls.

1383424,Isolated bovine spinal motoneurons have specific ganglioside antigens recognized by sera from patients with motor neuron disease and motor neuropathy.,"The gangliosides GM1 and GD1b have recently been reported to be potential target antigens in human motor neuron disease (MND) or motor neuropathy. The mechanism for selective motoneuron and motor nerve impairment by the antibodies directed against these gangliosides, however, is not fully understood. We recently investigated the ganglioside composition of isolated bovine spinal motoneurons and found that the ganglioside pattern of the isolated motoneurons was extremely complex. GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b, which are major ganglioside components of CNS tissues, were only minor species in motoneurons. Among the various ganglioside species in motoneurons, several were immunoreactive to sera from patients with MND and motor neuropathy. One of these gangliosides was purified from bovine spinal cord and characterized as N-glycolylneuraminic acid-containing GM1 [GM1(NeuGc)] by compositional analysis, fast atom bombardment mass spectra, and the use of specific antibodies. Among seven sera with anti-GM1 antibody activities, five sera reacted with GM1(NeuGc) and two did not. Two other gangliosides, which were recognized by another patient's serum, appeared to be specific for motoneurons. We conclude that motoneurons contained, in addition to the known ganglioside antigens GM1 and GD1b, other specific ganglioside antigens that could be recognized by sera from patients with MND and motor neuropathy.","['Yoshino H', 'Miyatani N', 'Saito M', 'Ariga T', 'Lugaresi A', 'Latov N', 'Kushi Y', 'Kasama T', 'Yu RK']",1992,59,5,J Neurochem,"Yoshino H, et al.

High concentrations of ChAT-mRNA were detected in 4 main regions of spinal cord, layer IX of the ventral horn, layer III of the dorsal horn, the intermediate grey matter and layer X around the central canal. ChAT mRNA was most highly concentrated in layers IX and III. Substantial decreases in ChAT mRNA were detected in ventral grey matter (layer IX) of cervical and lumbar cord in all cases of MND. Smaller and more variable changes in ChAT mRNA were seen in MND in other regions of spinal cord which indicates that these changes may arise as secondary processes.

Sporadic MND is occasionally associated with Parkinsonism. The aim of this study was to determine whether neuronal loss occurs in the substantia nigra of MND patients. Case records and pathological material from 14 patients with MND were reviewed. No patient had Parkinsonism documented. Sections of substantia nigra from the patients and 14 age/sex matched controls were analysed by neuronal and macrophage quantitation. The mean number of pigmented neurones at one standard level of substantia nigra was 863 in cases and 1094 in controls (p < 0.02); on average 21% (95% CI, 7-35%) fewer in the cases. The mean number of macrophages containing neuromelanin in cases was 106 and in controls 45 (p < 0.02). The results indicate that patients with MND have degeneration of the substantia nigra. Thus MND should be considered as a type of multiple system atrophy in which the motor neurone bears the brunt of the disease. The implication of this to the relationship between classical MND and MND with Parkinsonism-Dementia of the Western Pacific is discussed.","['Burrow JN', 'Blumbergs PC']",1992,22,5,Aust N Z J Med,Burrow JN and Blumbergs PC.

1327304,"Motor neuron diseases and viruses: poliovirus, retroviruses, and lymphomas.","The viral theory of motor neuron disease (MND) has been rejuvenated in the last 5 years for several reasons. First, it is now recognized that enteroviruses and picornaviruses similar to poliovirus can persist and induce immune-mediated diseases. In some picornavirus animal models, the immune-mediated disease can occur and continue long after the infectious virus has been cleared, and in some cases of human MND an immune-mediated disease may occur. Second, the human retroviruses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) have caused isolated MND syndromes. Neither of these two specific viruses appear to be 'the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) retrovirus', because they cause a plethora of neurologic syndromes unrelated to MND. Retroviruses of mice, however, can cause MND and lymphomas, and because there is an increased incidence of lymphomas in ALS patients, it has been suggested that retroviruses are another possible viral agent of human MND.",['Jubelt B'],1992,5,5,Curr Opin Neurol Neurosurg,"Jubelt B.

The incidence of paraproteins in 6 cases (11.3%) of patients with MND exceeds values found with cellulose acetate membrane supports in reported populations (below 1%), even when age was also considered. Monoclonal components were IgG (33%), IgM (33%) and IgA (33%). In six cases, four showed typical changes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other two patients were spinal progressive muscular atrophy (SPMA) in autopsy. No malignancy was detected in all cases. These results corroborate the concept of a probable association between MND and benign monoclonal gammopathy (plasma cell dyscrasia).

There was no significant difference in anti-GM1 antibodies between ALS group and LMND group, while anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in DN group, especially in GBS group, were significantly elevated (p < 0.001). High levels of anti-GM1 IgM antibodies (greater than the mean level plus 3 standard deviations of controls) were detected in 9 patients (6 with ALS and 3 with LMND) with MND (16.4%) and 16 patients (11 with GBS and 5 with CIDP) with DN (36.4%). Serum antibodies to GM1 reacted with GD1b ganglioside in only one patient with MND and 10 patients (8 with GBS and 2 with CIDP) with DN.

1416804,Motor inhibition and excitation are independent effects of magnetic cortical stimulation.,"We administered magnetic cortical stimulation (MCS) during voluntary contraction of intrinsic hand muscles to 8 patients with motor neuron disease (MND), 5 patients with pure lower motor neuron syndromes (LMN), a patient with severe subacute sensory neuropathy (SSN), and 10 healthy volunteers. Patients with MND had clinical evidence of upper MND and elevated thresholds for (3 patients) or absence of (5 patients) motor evoked potentials (MEPs). MCS during sustained contraction inhibited electromyographic activity in 6 of 8 patients with MND, without preceding MEPs. MCS had no effect on the electromyogram (EMG) of the other 2 patients with MND. In normal subjects and patients with LMN, inhibition of EMG was never seen without a preceding MEP, regardless of stimulus intensity. In the patient with SSN, MCS elicited normal MEPs and inhibited the EMG in a pattern similar to normal subjects, whereas supramaximal electrical stimulation of median and ulnar nerves failed to inhibit the EMG despite normal M and F responses. Our findings indicate that the inhibitory effects of MCS on EMG are not dependent solely on changes in afferent feedback caused by the muscle twitch produced by the MEP, or on Renshaw cell inhibition. We suggest that some of the inhibitory and excitatory effects of MCS on the motor system are mediated by distinct cortical elements, which may have different susceptibilities to pathophysiological processes in MND.","['Triggs WJ', 'Macdonell RA', 'Cros D', 'Chiappa KH', 'Shahani BT', 'Day BJ']",1992,32,3,Ann Neurol,"Triggs WJ, et al.

Neurons in specified locations within Onuf's nucleus of control subjects ranged between 17.8 and 71.7 microns diameter (mean 38.6 microns). Analyses of synaptology revealed five ultrastructural classes of presynaptic terminal synapsing with the neuronal surface membrane. When classified by size, vesicle morphology, and synaptic site structure these conformed to the S, F, T, M and C-terminals defining somatic motoneurons. No terminals characteristic of autonomic motoneurons were found. In MND subjects, neurons in Onuf's nucleus at S2 were preserved despite a paucity of neurons in medial and lateral motor nuclei and were of similar size range to those in control subjects. The morphological classes of pre-synaptic terminal found in controls, also characterized sphincteric motoneurons in MND subjects, including the C-type terminal. The presence of C-terminals indicates (i) that sphincteric motoneurons are somatic alpha-motoneurons, and (ii) that hypotheses explaining the survival of sphincteric motoneurons in MND on the basis of Onuf's nucleus being an extension of the pre-ganglionic parasympathetic nucleus, or having intrinsic autonomic properties are incorrect.","['Pullen AH', 'Martin JE', 'Swash M']",1992,18,3,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Pullen AH, et al.

1630157,"Longitudinal Gompertzian analysis of ALS mortality in England and Wales, 1963-1989: estimates of susceptibility in the general population.","Mortality statistics in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which is more commonly and generally termed motoneurone disease (MND) in the United Kingdom, have been shown to reflect the incidence of previously diagnosed cases of the disease in a more complete way than in other conditions [1,2]. An analysis of changing patterns of mortality may therefore be a particularly appropriate way of tracing the underlying trends in the disease and is in principle a useful way of investigating the relationship between environmental and genetically controlled factors in the genesis of the condition. The majority of analyses so far have concentrated on the crude rise in reported mortality rates evident in recent decades in a number of countries [2-5], on the uneven geographical distribution [6,7] and on the complex range of plausible causes for these reported rises. Debates have centred on whether the increases represent 'real' or 'artifactual' changes, with no apparent resolution of the issue [8,3]. Recently Riggs [9] proposed a novel way of analysing this issue by using a Gompertzian model and provided evidence of the existence of an inherently susceptible subset of the US population. Riggs indicated that while the rise in ALS mortality is real, it is for the most part the result of an increase in the size of this inherently susceptible sub-population due to greater longevity. In order to examine the wider applicability of a Gompertzian model to ALS the technique has been replicated with the mortality rates for England and Wales for the 27-year period from 1963 to 1989. The technique has been developed and extended to produce an estimate of the size of the inherently susceptible sub-population (both male and female) over the entire period.","['Neilson S', 'Robinson I', 'Hunter M']",1992,64,1-2,Mech Ageing Dev,"Neilson S, et al.

1508230,Single motor unit H-reflex in motor neuron disorders.,"The latency fluctuation of single motor unit potentials (MUPH) in the H-reflex is greater than the latency fluctuation of MUPs in the direct (MUPM) and recurrent (MUPF) responses. This has been attributed to the variability in the impulse generation at the site of nerve stimulation, and to the variation in the synaptic delay at the anterior horn cell. We studied the latency fluctuation of single motor unit H-reflex in patients with motor neuron disorders (MND) in comparison with normal subjects. The mean jitter of the H-reflex was 264.3 +/- 17.8 microseconds (mean +/- SEM) in 30 MUPH recorded from 10 patients with ALS, 302.7 +/- 25.2 microseconds in 16 MUPH from 6 patients with chronic motor neuron diseases, as compared with 137.4 +/- 7.3 microseconds in 34 MUPH recorded from 10 normal subjects. This difference, which persisted even after the correction for the latency variation of MUPM, cannot be explained on the basis of an enhanced reciprocal inhibition. Thus, the increased latency fluctuation of the single motor unit H-reflex in patients with MND may reflect changes in the motoneuron pool excitability that may be secondary to altered intrinsic electrophysiological properties of motoneurons, or to an abnormal temporal and spatial summation of synaptic inputs on motoneurons.","['Soliven B', 'Maselli RA']",1992,15,6,Muscle Nerve,Soliven B and Maselli RA.

We also examined ocular pursuit, the slow phases of optokinetic nystagmus, and the ability to suppress the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) with visual fixation of a head-mounted target. Five of the subjects with MND had pronounced parkinsonian features on neurologic examination. The nonparkinsonian MND subjects had normal ocular motor function for all measures. Most subjects suppressed the VOR completely. The parkinsonian-MND patients had impairment of both saccadic and pursuit eye movements, and one parkinsonian-MND patient with poor pursuit was unable to suppress the VOR. We conclude that ocular motor function is generally spared in MND. The occasional appearance of ocular motor dysfunction probably reflects the incidence of secondary abnormalities such as parkinsonism.","['Gizzi M', 'DiRocco A', 'Sivak M', 'Cohen B']",1992,42,5,Neurology,"Gizzi M, et al.

1458722,[Studies on motor neuron disease with cranial magnetic resonance imaging].,"The present study was performed to examine the pyramidal tracts of the brain in both 51 normal subjects (21 male and 30 female subjects; mean age of 43.5 +/- 16.1 years) and 12 patients with motor neuron disease (6 male and 6 female patients; mean age of 57.4 +/- 7.9 years), using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 12 patients with motor neuron disease (MND) comprised 7 suffering from spinal progressive muscular atrophy (SPMA) and 5 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The MRI used in this study was of both short spin echo and long spin echo sequence. Of the 52 normal subjects, 24 of them (47%) had the T2 prolonged small areas (high signal intensity areas) at the posterior limb of internal capsule. These findings were not found in the normal subjects over fifty years old. No similar finding was detected in the pyramidal tracts except the posterior limb of internal capsule. On the other hand, 8 patients with MND (67%) proved to have the high signal intensity areas in the pyramidal tracts. Moreover, these high intensity areas were extended from the crus cerebri to corona radiata in 7 patients (58%). In all patients with ALS, these areas were extended in whole areas of the pyramidal tracts, and the similar findings were also found in two patients with SPMA. These findings were demonstrated to be more extensive than those in the normal subjects. The results thus obtained warrant us to conclude that cranial MRI is useful to detect the degeneration of the pyramidal tracts of MND patients.","['Mitsui Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Nakamura Y', 'Kitaguchi M', 'Yagi Y']",1992,32,5,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Mitsui Y, et al.

We showed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique, that anti-GM1 IgM antibodies were often present at a low level in normal controls in contrast to anti-GD1b antibodies, which were never detected in control sera. We evidenced that several steps of the ELISA technique were critical such as the nonaddition of detergent in buffer solutions used for dilutions and for washing and the choice of the ELISA plates. We studied 50 cases of motor-neuron diseases, among which 40 typical cases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, only a few had high anti-GM1 antibodies levels, which were always confirmed by immunodetection on thin-layer chromatography. These antibodies were generally directed against the oligosaccharide epitope present also in asialoGM1. No correlation has been as yet established in relation to the clinical state of the patients. In a few cases of polyneuropathies associated with IgM gammopathies, antiganglioside antibodies have been reported.

No neurotoxic activity was found when comparing neuronal survival at 1 and 3 days in MND and control group. To examine the influence of the clinical MND status on neuronal survival, we used the following parameters: age at onset, sex, months from onset of disease to sera sampling, MND form, rhythm of progression, and scoring with Appel scale. No effect was noted for any of these factors. Sera from the same patient obtained at different clinical stages did not allow any conclusion of a fixed behavior for the same patient.

During the 20 years 1968-1987, 16,077 deaths were reported as being primarily due to MND in England and Wales with a male/female ratio of 1.22. There has been an increase in MND deaths from 3,185 in 1968-1972 to 5,241 in 1983-1987. The increase occurred in the death rates in both sexes and in all age groups, but particularly over the age of 65. In contrast, there was no increase in MS deaths and the MS death rates fell below the age of 55 but increased over this age, evidence that MS patients are living longer. A similar but more marked increase in MND mortality, and a considerable fall in MS mortality, occurred in the Republic of Ireland. The increase in MND mortality is not due to an increase in the number of neurologists, as there has been little increase in their numbers. The highest MND mortality was in Social Class IIIN males - skilled non-manual workers.","['Elian M', 'Dean G']",1992,11,4-6,Neuroepidemiology,Elian M and Dean G.

1817798,[Antiganglioside antibodies in motor neuron disease and motor dominant neuropathies].,"Serum antiganglioside antibodies were investigated in motor neuron disease (MND) and in chronic or acute immune-mediated motor-dominant neuropathies. IgM antibody binding to GM1 and GA1, reacting with Gal beta 1-3GalNAc epitope, was seen in 5 out of 26 cases of MND. IgM antibody binding to Gal beta 1-3GalNAc epitope was also detected in 3 out of 3 cases with motor dominant neuropathy with multifocal conduction block (MNMCB). The IgM M-protein in a case with motor dominant neuropathy bound to GM1, GD1b, GM2 but not to GA1. This M-protein may recognize carbohydrate epitope including sialic acid. Antiganglioside antibodies were detected in 11 out of 16 cases with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Among them, anti-GM1 antibodies were detected in 6 cases. Gal beta 1-3GalNAc epitope was recognized in 3 cases, and GM1 was monospecifically recognized in 3 cases. Thus the binding specificities of anti-GM1 antibody in motor dominant neuropathies were varied. The titers of anti-GM1 antibodies in 1 case with MNMCB and in 6 cases with GBS were more than 1:160, whereas those in MND were less than 1:80. The high titers of antibody in MNMCB and GBS decreased in association with clinical improvement, suggesting that they are closely related with the disease process.

The second tested the likelihood and consistency of diagnosis in a series of case summaries representing the clinical data of 10 patients with clinically and pathologically documented motor neuron disease. There was a wide measure of agreement concerning the common clinical features of the disease, especially regarding fasciculation of the tongue, fasciculation associated with weakness seen in more than one limb, and dysphagia. In the case summaries, however, there was clear variation in the ranked likelihood of the diagnosis of MND and in the consistency of diagnostic behaviour in the different groups of neurologists.

1659924,[Macro electromyography in motor neuron disease].,"Macroelectromyography (macroEMG) is a technique that provides information about the size of a motor unit which the conventional EMG is not able to. We used macroEMG to study 11 cases of motor neuron disease (MND), presenting with upper extremities symptoms (no lower extremities symptoms). Muscles we selected to study were the biceps brachii and the tibialis anterior. Amplitude, area and fiber density (FD) were analysed. The controlled groups consisted of 11 cases of myasthenia gravis (MG) and 11 normal subjects. Our study demonstrated that in the MND group, amplitude, area and FD of both muscles were significantly increased over those of the normal subjects. We also found that the amplitude and area of biceps brachii in patients who had clinical symptoms less than 2 years, were significantly higher than those over 2 years. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups of the tibialis anterior. This was probably due to the fact that the disease process was not severe enough to cause significant differences. Further follow up studies are necessary to clarify this question. In MG, amplitude, area and FD were not significantly different than those of the normal subjects. Increased amplitude, area and FD in MND provides information regarding the reinnervation process of the disease. As the disease progresses, the above findings may decrease because the motor neurons can no longer support the enlarged motor unit. All of the MND patients in our study, had no symptoms in the lower extremities; however, we found there were significant changes in the macro-EMG findings of the tibialis anterior. This indicates that macro-EMG can detect early electrophysiological changes in the motor unit before clinical symptoms develop.","['Goh MH', 'Chiu HC']",1991,48,4,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Goh MH and Chiu HC.

The SLIs were thready linear or tubular structures which immunostained with antiubiquitin antibodies. They were detected on hematoxylin and eosin preparations as eosinophilic thread-like structures often surrounded by pale areas. SLIs were occasionally present as networks of threads or tubules. Sometimes, they were aggregated and formed larger pale inclusions. Ultrastructurally, the SLIs were bundles of filaments which appeared thicker than neurofilaments. The SLIs tended to have central hollow spaces which were devoid of filaments. When the SLIs were clustered, fuzzy thick filaments were randomly and loosely arranged among the individual SLIs. The SLIs were histologically and ultrastructurally distinct from other inclusions such as Bunina bodies and hyaline inclusions.

An immunocytochemical analysis of the neurofilament distribution in spinal motor neurons in Mnd mice from all stages of the disease, including the presymptomatic, was performed using antibodies to different neurofilament subunits with different degrees of phosphorylation. Perikarya that stained with antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilaments were present in Mnd and control spinal cords, but the number of stained perikarya in Mnd was not significantly different from controls. There was a marked redistribution of neurofilaments within the cytoplasm of some motor neurons in Mnd cords. In Mnd but not controls, the immunoreaction product appeared marginated, leaving areas in the cytoplasm absent of immunostaining. These areas were observed in all stages of the disease, but less predictably in presymptomatics. Both the size of the areas and the number of motoneurons containing these areas appeared to increase with the severity of the disease.

The result showed EMG examination was of much vale in helping to ascertain an accurate diagnosis which clinically could be made in only about 1/4 of the series of cases. The ages of onset ranged from 4 months to 10 years with an average of 36.8 years. 56.8% under 40 years. There was a higher male preponderance, the male/female ratio being 3.2:1. It was 1.6:1 in a report from a western country. 123 cases showed only one limb involvement clinically while the EMG findings were also abnormal in the other three limbs. Fibrillation potentials were found to be at more than two sites in one muscle in 84.5% in this series, where as they occurred in 95-100% of the infantile and juvenile cases. Abundant fibrillation potentials were found in 37.1% of the cases within 3 years after the onset and in 13.6% in those with a longer duration.

1904280,"Development of a radioimmunoassay for RX77368 (pGlu-His-3,3-dimethyl proline amide)--a stable analogue of thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH).","The recent interest in RX77368 for the treatment of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) has led to the requirement for an assay (RIA) capable of detecting the peptide at low levels in plasma. Several drug conjugates were prepared in which RX77368 was covalently linked to larger proteins, e.g. bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet haemocyanin or bovine thyroglobulin, the best yield being obtained with the bis-diazotized benzidine reaction (BDB) linking RX77368 to KLH. The latter conjugate was injected into sheep and ultimately produced an antibody of sufficiently high titre to be used. This combined with an iodinated radiolabel formed the basis of the radioimmunoassay. Cross-reactivity studies using similar analogues and RX77368 metabolites showed that the antibody was specific for RX77368. The greatest cross-reactivity was exhibited by the pGlu-His-monomethylProNH2 peptide (RX74355), but, not being a natural metabolite, this did not interfere with the assay. The RIA was used to measure RX77368 in MND patients in a recent clinical study, where RX77368 was administered both by the intravenous and oral routes. High plasma concentrations of RX77368 were found in the patients given intravenous drug by infusion. The oral route exhibited much lower levels, but had a sustained duration of action of up to 12 h.","['Lynn AG', 'Bennett GW']",1991,9,1,J Pharm Biomed Anal,"Lynn AG and Bennett GW.

CGRP immunoreactivity was observed in the posterior horns, especially in the laminae I and II, of all the spinal cords examined. In MND cases, in addition, a considerable number of spheroids in the anterior horns were labelled with the antibody. In some spheroids, their entire area was homogeneously immunostained, whereas in others the immunoreactivity was confined to a focal area(s) within the profile of the spheroids and between these two forms of staining several variations of the staining patterns were seen. The anti-Nf intensely and homogeneously labelled all spheroids and there was no appreciable difference in the Nf-immunoreactive pattern between CGRP-positive and -negative spheroids. It is possible that the accumulation of CGRP in spheroids may result from entrapment of CGRP during the anterograde axonal transport, causing loss of CGRP at the neuromuscular junction and producing weakness and atrophy of the muscles.","['Kato T', 'Katagiri T', 'Hirano A', 'Kawanami T', 'Shikama Y', 'Kurita K', 'Sasaki H', 'Arai S']",1991,82,4,Acta Neuropathol,"Kato T, et al.

All HI contained large amounts of ubiquitin and some HI were stained at the core or the center with anti-neurofilament antibody, with the surrounding halo unstained. No HI were stained with antibodies raised against cytoskeletal proteins such as high-molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins and phosphorylated tau. Ultrastructurally, HI were chiefly composed of filaments measuring about 20 nm in diameter thicker than neurofilaments, and contained fine granules and frequently one or more of four characteristic profiles, i.e., small electron-dense materials resembling Bunina bodies, bundles of tubular filaments measuring approximately 20 nm in diameter, large electron-dense cores, and focal accumulations of randomly arranged neurofilaments. Hyaline inclusions can be regarded as one of the characteristic markers for sporadic MND as well as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Hyaline inclusions have a markedly heterogeneous ultrastructure and, therefore, differences in immunoreactivity with antineurofilament antibodies are not unexpected.","['Sasaki S', 'Maruyama S']",1991,82,4,Acta Neuropathol,Sasaki S and Maruyama S.

The present study investigates the relationship between the temporal-acoustic parameters of the speech of 15 individuals with MND as they relate to the progression of the disease and clinicians' judgments of dysarthria severity. When temporal-acoustic parameters are used to predict the progression of MND, it becomes apparent that victims provide compensatory gestures to mark voicing distinctions. When the same acoustic parameters are used to predict clinician judgments of severity, it is found that clinicians tend to use the same temporal cues that mark actual disease progression.

We report here three patients initially suspected to have MND, who later were diagnosed as a Lewis-Sumner syndrome. One of them showed a remarkable clinical improvement after immunoglobulin therapy. The definitive diagnosis of this syndrome rests upon nerve conduction studies, uncovering multiple sites of persistent conduction block. Technically, it is important to exclude insufficient stimulus which may lead to an erroneous impression of conduction block. Magnetic stimulation, as compared to electric current, elicited larger responses possibly because of deeper current penetration. We found this mode of stimulation useful especially in testing focal demyelination requiring full activation of a diseased nerve at a most proximal segment.","['Mezaki T', 'Kaji R', 'Hamano T', 'Kimura J', 'Kameyama M']",1990,30,11,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,"Mezaki T, et al.

Spinal anterior horns in MND showed various kinds of morphological changes in nerve cells, and a significant decrease in cellular, nuclear and nucleolar cross-sectional areas in normal and abnormal cells. Microdensitophotometry revealed a significant decrease in the cellular RNA content, of both large cells and small cells, and also of histologically normal appearing cells and abnormal cells. Those findings point to an abnormality of RNA synthesis which precedes the earliest light microscopic changes seen in nerve cells. The cross-sectional areas of myelinated fibers and axons of spinal ventral roots in MND cases showed a significant decrease in the numbers of both total myelinated fibers and large axons.

The markers used for LLR were: V1-2 peak Latency (the latency between the V1 and V2 peaks); V2 peak-P24 Latency (the latency between the V2 peak and P24 of a somatosensory evoked potential); V2 Amplitude, and V2 Square (the area of the V2 wave). V1-2 peak Latency was significantly longer, and V2 Amplitude was significantly lower than the control in SCD. We attributed these alterations of the LLR to cerebellar ataxia, since all SCD cases had cerebellar ataxia, and extrapyramidal symptoms were only present in one SCD case; the MND cases with motor neuron disturbance showed no significant difference from the control. TRH injection resulted in an increase in V2 Square and a decrease in V2 peak-P24 Latency in SCD and other neurological disease patients. We regarded these changes as activation of the LLR by TRH. With TRH therapy, activation of the LLR coincided with improvement of cerebellar ataxia in SCD. Symptomatic improvement, however, was not observed and the LLR changes were not stable in MND. These results suggest that TRH-induced activation of LLR is caused by the activation of cerebellar function, and indirectly concerns with upper motor neurons because V2 Square increased in MND without pyramidal tract signs.","['Touge T', 'Takeuchi H', 'Yamada A', 'Miki H', 'Nishioka M']",1990,30,3,Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol,"Touge T, et al.

2325701,Far-field and cortical somatosensory evoked potentials in motor neuron disease.,"We examined median somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in 26 patients with sporadic motor neuron disease (MND). SEPs were recorded with multiple scalp derivations, using both the midfront and the earlobe as references for each subject. Central conduction time (CCT) was abnormal in three patients, but only when using the midfront reference. Moreover, an exclusive alteration of the early prerolandic potentials (absent or delayed P20 and/or P22) was noted using the earlobe reference in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in progressive bulbar palsy (54% and 50% of patients, respectively) but not in progressive muscular atrophy. These findings correlated with clinical evidence of upper motor neuron signs and with the severity of the disease. In agreement with recent views regarding the sources of the early anterior cortical responses, neuronal loss in the motor cortex may be considered as affecting the generator sites of these potentials.","['Zanette G', 'Polo A', 'Gasperini M', 'Bertolasi L', 'De Grandis D']",1990,13,1,Muscle Nerve,"Zanette G, et al.

Twenty-three of them were classified as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and seven as bulbospinal muscular atrophy, and two were unclassified. One hundred healthy persons for bedside examination and twenty-two for EOG were investigated as controls. Findings by bedside examinations were as follows; 1) Slight limitations of upward only, up & downward and upward & horizontal gaze were observed in 5 cases (15.6%), 1 case (3.1%) and 1 case (3.1%), respectively. 2) Incomplete convergence was observed in 11 cases.

Monoclonal antibodies which recognize phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes diffusely labelled a proportion of normal and MND anterior horn cells, but did not permit differentiation between normal and MND tissue. However, in some MND and control anterior horn cells, dense 'floccular' accumulations were labelled by antibodies recognizing phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes. These accumulations of phosphorylated neurofilaments suggest abnormalities of cytoskeletal regulation, but were neither a common nor a specific feature of MND. Axonal spheroids, which were as common in normal as in MND tissue, were labelled by all antineurofilament antibodies. Normal-appearing axons, but not spheroids, in MND and control tissue were identified by an antiactin antibody, indicating that actin may be absent from the cytoplasmic domain which gives rise to spheroids. In summary, we have not found specific posttranslational changes of cytoskeletal proteins in MND and, in particular, phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes are common to both MND and control anterior horn cells.","['Leigh PN', 'Dodson A', 'Swash M', 'Brion JP', 'Anderton BH']",1989,112 ( Pt 2),,Brain,"Leigh PN, et al.

Geographic variability within Kentucky was evident for three intervals, 1964-1967, 1968-1978, and 1979-1984, with a more marked pattern among females than among males. There was a shifting age pattern of MND mortality with a higher proportion of cases in older ages for the most recent time period. Again, this pattern was more marked among females. Furthermore, there was a slight increase in total average annual age adjusted ALS/MND mortality rates over the three intervals. The increase is slight, but with the previous stability of reported rates and the shifting geographic and age patterns, there is evidence to support the need for incidence studies targeted at specific environmental exposures.","['Stallones L', 'Kasarskis EJ', 'Stipanowich C', 'Snider G']",1989,8,2,Neuroepidemiology,"Stallones L, et al.

In motorneurone disease (MND), no benefit was reported with MK771 and DN1417. Focal, transient, and slight improvements in weakness and spasticity were described with CG3509. A controlled trial with a single intravenous dose of RX 77368 showed improvements in dysarthria, tongue movements, respiration, swallowing, and spasticity lasting up to 72 hours. Changes in muscle force were of no functional significance. There was an acute 25-30% increase in mean corrected fiber density and in mean macro-EMG parameters in biceps, but no change in amplitude or area of single macro-EMG motor units followed during the 2-hour infusions. An acute, direct or indirect, central effect of RX77368 on recruitment order or on activation threshold of pathological motor units is suggested. In a subacute open trial with repeated intravenous infusions of RX77368 (median 2 weeks), improvement in bulbar function in 8 of 12 responders, cramps (5 of 9), and spasticity (5 of 8) were maintained for medians of 18, 14, and 7 days, respectively.

3208132,A comparison of the distributions of eight peptides in spinal cord from normal controls and cases of motor neurone disease with special reference to Onuf's nucleus.,"The distributions of 8 peptides were studied in the 4 major segmental levels (cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral) of the spinal cord in 52 neurologically normal cases. Similar regions from 36 cases of motor neurone disease (MND) were compared using the same procedures to determine possible changes in the distribution of peptides in areas associated with sensory, motor and autonomic function. In normal spinal cords, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-, the C-flanking peptide of neuropeptide Y (CPON)-, enkephalin-, galanin-, neurokinin-like-, somatostatin- and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-immunoreactive fibres were abundant in the dorsal horn. Numerous somatostatin-immunoreactive cell bodies were also present. In the ventral horn, immunoreactive fibres were less abundant. Most motoneurones were closely apposed by fibres immunoreactive for enkephalin, neurokinin, somatostatin and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH). A subpopulation of motoneurones, most notable in lumbar segments, displayed CGRP immunoreactivity. In common with autonomic nuclei, Onuf's nucleus, which is thought to innervate perineal striated muscle and external urethral and anal sphincters, was densely innervated with CPON-, enkephalin-, and in particular somatostatin-immunoreactive fibres, thus suggesting Onuf's nucleus may have an autonomic component. In the diseased cords, there was a reduction in the area of the ventral horn and numbers of motoneurones as revealed by conventional histological staining and immunostaining of neurofilament triplet proteins. No changes in the distribution of peptides was noted in the dorsal horn or autonomic nuclei. By contrast, in the ventral horn, neurokinin-, enkephalin-, somatostatin- and TRH-immunoreactive fibres, which are normally found associated with motoneurones, were absent. Therefore, not only are motoneurones lost in MND, but also the fibres which innervate them. CGRP-immunoreactive motoneurones were not observed, a finding consistent with the proposed role of this peptide as a muscle-trophic factor. In contrast to the large motoneurone groups in the ventral horn, the neuronal integrity of Onuf's nucleus and the peptides associated with it were spared. These data further imply that Onuf's nucleus is not a typical motor nucleus and it is not purely somatic. The coincident loss of peptide immunoreactivity and motoneurones from the large motor nuclei and sparing of Onuf's nucleus and its peptide-containing constituents in the diseased state suggests that peptides contribute to maintenance of neural integrity.","['Gibson SJ', 'Polak JM', 'Katagiri T', 'Su H', 'Weller RO', 'Brownell DB', 'Holland S', 'Hughes JT', 'Kikuyama S', 'Ball J']",1988,474,2,Brain Res,"Gibson SJ, et al.

These inclusion bodies appeared to be closely associated with classical Bunina bodies and immuno-electron microscopy suggested that they were based on arrays of straight 10-15 nm filaments together with some granular material. These observations link the protein ubiquitin with a chronic neurodegenerative disease and extend previous observations of a close association between filamentous inclusion bodies and ubiquitin.

HLA-DR expression was monitored using immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibody and showed that similar numbers of monocytes in all patient and control groups expressed this antigen. Thus, while high monocyte 5'NT activity was found principally in patients with active relapsing MS and in some patients with RA, the monocytes from patients with MS were, in addition, exquisitely sensitive to stimulation with gamma-IFN.","['Armstrong MA', 'Shah S', 'Hawkins SA', 'Bell AL', 'Roberts SD']",1988,24,1,Ann Neurol,"Armstrong MA, et al.

3404186,Comparison of sporadic and familial disease amongst 580 cases of motor neuron disease.,"A review of 580 hospital case notes of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) revealed 20 families in which more than one case had been reported. For 27 of the cases in these families full medical records were available, and a history of a further 37 affected family members were obtained. The cases in these 20 families are termed familial and the remainder sporadic. Parent to child transmission occurred in 16 of the 20 families of the familial cases, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. In three families there was involvement of siblings only, and in one family two cousins were affected. The sex ratio for the documented familial case records seen was 0.8:1 (M/F = 12:15), for the total (documented and historical) it was 1.06:1 (33:31), but in sporadic cases it was 1.6:1 (341:212) and more frequent occurrence of sensory features at presentation was reported in the familial cases (15% in the familial cases and 5% in the sporadic cases). However, none of these differences reached statistical significance. Familial cases also differed from sporadic cases in having a younger age of onset (a mean of 52 years in the familial cases compared with 56 years in the sporadic) and in the shorter median reported duration of illness (1.1 year in the familial cases; 2.6 years in the sporadic). However, in only one fifth of sporadic cases was the age at onset and death known, although this was known for 22 of the 27 familial cases, so that the data on survival and age of onset are too incomplete to test formally.","['Li TM', 'Alberman E', 'Swash M']",1988,51,6,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Li TM, et al.

The annual incidence of MND was 1.01 per 100,000 inhabitants and the prevalence rate was 3.52 per 100,000. The male to female ratio was 1.78:1. Age-specific incidence rates increased with advanced age, with a maximum between 60 and 69 years for males and over 70 years for females. The median age at onset was 60.5 years. The average interval between the onset symptoms and diagnosis was 11 months. Fifty-three per cent of the patients had conventional or pseudopolyneuritic ALS, 36% had PBP and 11% had PMA. There were three familial cases. Two PMA patients had had acute poliomyelitis. The mean duration of the disease was 26.6 months and was significantly longer in males aged under 60 years.

3447070,Muscle morphometry in motor neuron disease.,"It has previously been suggested that the pathological abnormalities seen in muscle biopsies from patients with motor neuron disease (MND) are of predictive value in relation to the rate of progression of the disease. In this study, quadriceps muscle biopsies from 19 patients with MND and 20 age matched controls were prepared for histochemistry and analysed morphometrically. Pathological features of denervation and reinnervation were observed in all MND patients although considerable variation between patients was noted. Motor neuron disease biopsies also showed increased connective tissue, an increased variation in fibre size, and a random fibre type distribution. Several of these abnormalities were more severe in female patients. Many of these 'abnormalities' were also frequent, albeit to a milder degree, in control biopsies and emphasize the need for age matched controls. The morphometric data was not related to the age of the patient, disease duration, type of MND or muscle strength, thus suggesting that the progression and severity of MND and its prognosis cannot be judged on the basis of quadriceps muscle pathology alone.","['Froes MM', 'Kristmundsdottir F', 'Mahon M', 'Cumming WJ']",1987,13,6,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,"Froes MM, et al.

Thirty-five patients with MND were evaluated whether there were any factors correlated to the severity of ACT. Among various factors, A1 showed the most significant change to the severity of ACT. Therefore, it was suggested that A1 was best correlated with the rate of prognosis of the disease process. Probably involvement of the motor neuron innervating type I muscle fibers takes place in the earlier stage than that of the neurons of type II, or there might be some difference of innervation ratio between type I and type II fibers. Further investigation is necessary to evaluate the relationship between the actual prognosis of these patients and their ACT by follow up study.","['Iwasaki Y', 'Kinoshita M']",1987,26,3,Jpn J Med,Iwasaki Y and Kinoshita M.

There is a dramatic degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons, more severe in the lumbosacral than in the other regions, as well as variable pathology in the lower cranial nerves. Upper motor neurons of the red nucleus, reticular formation of the pons and medulla, and restricted areas of the cerebral cortex are also affected. Degenerating motor neurons share many characteristics seen in the human disease amyotropic lateral sclerosis, including loss of Nissl substance, increases in lipofuscin and abnormal cytoplasmic inclusions.

In MND patients, F-response frequency varied between 5% and 96% with a median of 39% which was significantly lower than controls (p less than 0.001), and showed a significant rank correlation with the M-response amplitude (r = 0.62, p less than 0.004). Identical responses occurred more frequently than in controls (median 30.8%, p less than 0.001). F-response frequency was normal in CS patients (median 76.3%, range 35% to 97%), but the frequency of identical responses (median 6.3%) was higher than normal (p less than 0.01). Reduced F-response frequency in MND was thought to reflect loss of lower motor neurons, while the presence of spasticity was probably the major factor underlying the increased frequency of identical responses in both disorders. F-response shape tended to be simpler in MND and rather more complex in CS patients than controls.","['Peioglou-Harmoussi S', 'Fawcett PR', 'Howel D', 'Barwick DD']",1987,50,5,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Peioglou-Harmoussi S, et al.

Area of first symptom is in the lower extremity is 36 per cent of cases, in the upper extremity in 32 per cent, and 25 per cent of patients have a bulbar onset. Motor cranial nerves in the lower brain stem from cranial nerve nuclei or corticobulbar tract degeneration are affected. This results in symptoms of speech and swallowing difficulty and emotional lability in up to 60 per cent of cases. One hundred per cent of cases have motor weakness, over 90 per cent have muscle atrophy and fasciculations, and 47 per cent have spasticity. There seems to be a pattern of progression of ALS signs and symptoms based on area of onset with LLE involvement tending to follow RLE weakness, LUE weakness following RUE onset, and RUE involvement following next in patients whose onset is bulbar. Significant numbers of ALS patients had sparing of involvement of parts of the body for follow-up times approaching 3 years. Although the majority of patients experience a deterioration that is significantly linear, seven of 28 patients or 25 per cent achieved a plateau lasting a minimum of 9 months.

In the 72 families, 329 members were known to be affected. Observations were compared with the sporadic and Mariana forms of MND. Clinical and laboratory examinations of all three forms were similar in clinical course and findings, but there were minor variations in age at onset, sex ratio, survival, and the frequency with which onset occurred in the lower extremities. Recognition of the familial form still depends on diagnosis of the disease in more than one member of a family.","['Mulder DW', 'Kurland LT', 'Offord KP', 'Beard CM']",1986,36,4,Neurology,"Mulder DW, et al.

Corresponding significant differences were not shown by assays based upon incorporation of [3H]uridine or of lactate release. Lymphocytes from 4 out of 14 motor neurone disease patients showed a blastogenic response to membranes from rat spinal cord cells, compared with those from 0 out of 9 normal controls.

2429495,Degeneration of Betz cells in motor neuron disease. A Golgi study.,"A morphological study using a modified Golgi impregnation technique was carried out on Betz cells in the motor area of eight patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and age-matched controls without abnormal neuropathological findings during routine examination. Betz cells were categorized as normal (type I), or those with moderate (type II) or marked (type III) degeneration of dendrites. Types II and III Betz cells tended to be dominant in the cases of MND, whereas type I Betz cells constituted the highest percentage in most of the control cases. The frequently observed morphological alterations of Betz cells in MND were accumulation of lipofuscin, degeneration or loss of dendrites, and reactive astrocytic gliosis around the Betz cell soma. It was suggested that Betz cell changes in MND are not only due to aging but also to evident pathological processes, since the above-mentioned findings were more extensive in the MND cases than in the control cases. Also, the so-called lower motor neuron disease belongs to one basic disease termed ""motor neuron disease"", because the pathological changes of Betz cells were observed even in cases of spinal progressive muscular atrophy alone or associated with progressive bulbar palsy, which are devoid of pyramidal tract degeneration and signs of upper motor neuron lesion.","['Udaka F', 'Kameyama M', 'Tomonaga M']",1986,70,3-4,Acta Neuropathol,"Udaka F, et al.

SEPs were affected in 17 patients (57%), with a higher incidence of abnormality in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and bulbar palsy than in progressive muscular atrophy. In a majority of patients, simultaneous bilateral stimulation of the median nerve revealed a delay or absence of scalp-recorded central N32 and/or N60, leaving the earlier peaks intact. In the remaining cases, the N19 peak was asymmetrically prolonged. These findings suggest common involvement of somatosensory pathways in MND, either at cortical or subcortical levels, and correlate with neuropathologic reports of neuronal degeneration beyond the primary motor system.","['Bosch EP', 'Yamada T', 'Kimura J']",1985,8,7,Muscle Nerve,"Bosch EP, et al.

3873517,Morbidity and mortality in motor neuron disease: comparison with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease: age and sex specific rates and cohort analyses.,"The cause of motor neuron disease (MND) remains unknown although recent reports have suggested a possible rise in mortality rate. The present account describes age-specific patterns in morbidity rate and cross-sectional and cohort analyses of mortality rate, and compares these with those in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. First hospital admission rate for motor neuron disease (a proxy for incidence rates) rose steadily with age in males and females until the age of 75 years or more, but then fell, but only in females. This irregular pattern suggested the possibility of an environmental effect on certain older birth cohorts. The validity of the results was supported by a similar pattern in the two hospital regional authorities studied and the difference between this pattern and that found in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Age-specific mortality rates of motor neuron disease between 15 and 64 years for males and females in England and Wales from 1940 to 1982 rose steadily with age. Mortality rates after the age of 65 fell in all female cohorts studied, but only in the earlier male cohorts. Unlike Parkinson's disease there was no strong birth cohort effect. However an analysis of Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (Registrar General) reports has revealed a slight increase in the age-specific mortality rate in both males and females aged 65 and over for successive birth cohorts born since 1900. Neither changes in ICD coding or in diagnostic habits could account for this pattern, which differed from that seen in Parkinson's disease. No such effect was seen in multiple sclerosis.","['Li TM', 'Swash M', 'Alberman E']",1985,48,4,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Li TM, et al.

Nevertheless both life-tables showed a similar pattern with a rapidly fatal outcome in the first 3 years after diagnosis and a slower death rate in the following years. In each curve, the slopes suggested the presence of 2 subgroups with different prognosis. It is to be stressed that a percentage of PMA patients (25.7%) showed a rapidly fatal outcome and that a subgroup of ALS patients (26.6%) showed a relatively benign course.

Fourteen of the patients had elevated thresholds (greater than or equal to 95th percentile): 7 showed elevated thresholds of sensitive points, 5 an increased number of insensitive grid points, and 2 a combination of these criteria. Therefore, raised vibration thresholds occur more frequently in MND patients than in controls (p less than 0.001). A detection threshold abnormality was not demonstrated for touch-pressure or for thermal cooling. These results are in keeping with the demonstrated increased cutaneous myelinated fiber degeneration in this condition and with evidence of sensory neural system involvement at postmortem examination.

6288185,Regional distribution of cholinergic neurons in human spinal cord transections in the patients with and without motor neuron disease.,"Regional distribution of enzymic activities in acetylcholine (ACh) metabolism was examined on thinly-sectioned transverse slices of human spinal cords obtained during autopsy of 5 motor neuron disease (MND) and 5 control patients without MND. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was highly concentrated in the ventral horn regions (gray and white matters) of cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord of non-MND patients. This enzyme activity was found to be remarkably low in the ventral gray and white matter of MND patients compared with that of the controls. Although the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was found to be high in both ventral and dorsal gray matter of the spinal cord, little difference was observed between each corresponding region of MND and control patients, except relatively low enzyme activity in the cervical ventral horn region of MND patients. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors, examined as specific [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate ([3H]QNB) binding, was also highly concentrated in the ventral and dorsal gray matter of the control spinal cord, and was strongly reduced in the ventral horn region of MND patients, indicating a quite similar distribution pattern of ChAT activity. These biochemical changes of cholinergic transmission system may be paralleled to the morphological degeneration of the spinal lower motor neurons in MND patients. Activity of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a marker enzyme of central myelin structure, was evenly distributed throughout the whole spinal cord section, without regard to the gray and white matter, of both MND and control patients.","['Nagata Y', 'Okuya M', 'Watanabe R', 'Honda M']",1982,244,2,Brain Res,"Nagata Y, et al.

6983824,Epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Motor neuron disease (MND) is used in this paper as the generic label, encompassing the clinical variants of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), progressive myelopathic muscular atrophy (PMMA), and progressive bulbar palsy (PBP). ALS is limited to instances of anterior horn cell plus pyramidal tract involvement. When only anterior horn cell lesions are inferred, either PMMA or PBP is used, depending on the levels of involvement; when both cord and brain stem are affected. PBP is the designation. Mortality data on MND have been available for a number of countries since 1949. The coding used under international rules has varied considerably over this interval. Before 1969, hereditary muscular atrophies were included. Since 1979, no subdivision by type of MND is possible. International death rates for MND have all been rather close to 1 per 100,000 population per year, though perhaps nearer to 1.4 on the average in recent years. There has been an increasing proportion of MND deaths coded to ALS between 1949 and 1977. There is no notable geographic variation among countries, nor within countries such as the U.S. and Denmark. A slight upward trend in death rates over time in the U.S. is matched by a slight decrease in Denmark. Death rates from all sources indicate a male preponderance for ALS or MND as a whole, at about 1.5 to 1, male to female. There is also a consistent predilection by age, with few deaths under age 50 or so and a clear maximum in age-specific death rates at about age 70. This holds for both sexes. In the U.S., there is also a white-nonwhite difference, with a ratio of about 1.6:1 but with age and sex differences similar to whites. Average annual incidence rates from among white occidental populations range mostly between 0.6 and 1.8 per 100,000 population for MND and about 0.8 and 1.5 per 100,000 for ALS. Again a male predilection is seen. There is a clear maximum in age-specific incidence rates at about age 65 in all surveys except that of Rochester, Minnesota, where the age-specific rate for those 75+ years of age is apparently higher than that for those age 65 to 74. Incidence rates, then, are quite similar one land to another. A reported deficit in Mexico may reflect case-selection bias. An excess among Filipinos on Hawaii seems more a function of population age-distributions than a true racial or ethnic difference. Prevalence rates from outside the Orient range from about 1 to 7 per 100,000 population for MND and about 2 to 7 for ALS. Those surveys more likely to be reasonably complete provide ALS prevalence rates of about 4 to 6, and an overall estimate of ALS prevalence of some 5 per 100,000 population is a reasonable figure. In the Orient, most of the MND prevalence rates fall within the same range as in the occident, except for two areas of the Kii peninsula of southern Honshu, Japan, where the reported prevalence rates are some 100 to 200 per 100,000 population. These cases are similar to the Guamanian ALS, both clinically and pathologically...",['Kurtzke JF'],1982,36,,Adv Neurol,Kurtzke JF. Epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

7247763,Neurotransmitter abnormalities in patients with motor neuron disease.,"In 22 patients with motor neuron disease (MND), the mean concentration of serotonin (5HT) in platelets was slightly increased, platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity was significantly increased, and plasma concentrations of total and both free and bound tryptophan were significantly decreased. Though platelet MAO activity was positively correlated with concentrations of 5HT, independent causal mechanisms are probable. When patients were rated according to severity, highest values of platelet 5HT and MAO activity were found in the most severely affected group, whereas concentrations of both total and protein-bound tryptophan were most decreased. Changes in concentrations of 5HT and tryptophan may reflect compensatory changes in response to degeneration of motor neurons or to interruption of their monoaminergic innervation.","['Belendiuk K', 'Belendiuk GW', 'Freedman DX', 'Antel JP']",1981,38,7,Arch Neurol,"Belendiuk K, et al.

7235610,Repeat study of antecedent events in motor neuron disease.,"Recently we applied case control methods to the investigation of motor neuron disease (MND) with surprising results: MND patients have greater exposure to lead and mercury and drink more milk than either diseased or normal age- and sex-matched control patients. Because of the implications of these findings as possible environmental influences in the pathogenesis of MND, we repeated the earlier study using a larger population and a more standardized interview technique. This time the MND patients reported more exposure to mercury or to the combination mercury or lead than either control group. As adults and at age 18, more MND patients drank in excess of three glasses of milk daily. We conclude that exposure to lead or mercury and excessive milk ingestion are possible antecedent events predisposing to MND.","['Pierce-Ruhland R', 'Patten BM']",1981,13,2,Ann Clin Res,Pierce-Ruhland R and Patten BM.

All patients showed repair of decrement immediately after exercise. The mean amplitude of the compound muscle action potential was significantly lower in both the rapid-disease (2.9 plus or minus 0.9 mV) and slow-disease (5.2 plus or minus 1.6 mV) groups than in controls (14.5 plus or minus 1.2 mV). For individual patients, there was no correlation between amplitude of the compound muscle action potential and decrement. These data indicate that decrement in MND relates to activity of disease of the motor neuron.","['Bernstein LP', 'Antel JP']",1981,31,2,Neurology,Bernstein LP and Antel JP.

7425574,Muscle metals in motor neuron disease.,"To investigate the role of metallic elements in motor neuron disease (MND), we used a photon-excited, energy-dispersive x-ray analytical system to measure the metal content of muscle biopsies from 21 patients with MND and compared the results with those obtained from biopsies from neurologically diseased control patients matched for age, sex, and muscle biopsied. By t test analysis, the MND patients did not differ significantly from controls in the average muscle biopsy concentrations of lead, mercury, arsenic, manganese, aluminum, or any of the other ten elements measured. Subgroup analysis showed that women with MND had less barium (p < 0.05) and iron (p < 0.01) in their muscles than controls, a finding probably an artifact of the multiple statistical analyses done on the data. Metallic content of muscle, for unknown reasons, tends to decrease with age in MND, but increases with age in controls. The evidence indicates that the muscle content of heavy metals in patients with MND does not differ from that in matched controls and that in MND, muscle does not store toxic metals for retrograde transport to anterior horn cells, as has been postulated by others.","['Pierce-Ruhland R', 'Patten BM']",1980,8,2,Ann Neurol,Pierce-Ruhland R and Patten BM.

Specimens were taken from the cervical and lumbar enlargements of 7 patients who died of MND and the results compared with those found in 12 control patients. Anterior horn lead levels were elevated in MND patients compared to controls (mean, 40.7 micrograms/gm versus 14.6 micrograms/gm; p less than 0.05) and lead levels correlated with the duration of illness (r = +0.84, p less than 0.05). Only 2 MND patients had detectable manganese levels (72.3 and 132.2 micrograms/gm) whereas 1 control had detectable manganese (14.3 micrograms/gm). One MND patient had 244 micrograms/gm selenium, but 3 controls had levels of 180, 58, and 62. Patients with the histories of greatest environmental exposure to metals during life exhibited the highest tissue levels of metals after death; despite chelation therapy for about a year, high lead levels remained in their tissue.","['Kurlander HM', 'Patten BM']",1979,6,1,Ann Neurol,Kurlander HM and Patten BM.

To determine the cause of the increased uptake in CMT, studies of single fiber leucine incorporations have been undertaken. The results of this study indicate that the increased incorporation is into those muscle fibers which are undergoing regeneration following reinnervation.

588852,Motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis among immigrants to Britain.,"Hospital discharge rates for various immigrant groups resident in Greater London and the West Midlands were studied to compare the incidence of two diseases of the nervous system-motor neurone disease (MND) and multiple sclerosis (MS). For both these conditions immigrants from Europe, Ireland, America and from the old commonwealth countries of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand had discharge rates that were similar to those for people born in the United Kingdom. In contrast, immigrants from the new commonwealth countries of Asia, Africa, America (including the West Indies), and Europe (Gibraltar, Malta, and Gozo) had a greatly reduced risk of MS but a very similar risk of MND compared with those born in the United Kingdom. MS but not MND was rare among immigrants of Asian or African ethnic origin and uncommon among immigrants from the West Indies. Deaths attributed to MS and MND have also been studied. During a three-year period there were no deaths reported for MS among immigrants of Asian and African ethnic origin and 14 were expected. There were two deaths from MND among these immigrants and five were expected. Among the immigrants from the West Indies two deaths were attributed to MS and 13 were expected, and there were three deaths attributed to MND and four were expected. The contrast between MND and MS in hospital morbidity and mortality confirms that MS among immigrants to Britain is rare in those of Asian and African ethnic origin.","['Dean G', 'Brady R', 'McLoughlin H']",1977,31,3,Br J Prev Soc Med,"Dean G, et al.

In Charcot-Marie Tooth disease muscle there is a significantly increased uptake into cytoplasmic elements and a normal uptake into structural protein. In motor neuron disease the uptake into cytoplasmic elements appears normal but is reduced into structural proteins. The abnormal uptake in C.M.T. could be explained as a product of regenerative efforts associated with reinnervation.

The mean age of onset was 55 years and mean duration of life from onset was 3 years 5 months. These figures are comparable with those from the USA and UK and Japan although the onset in Australia was later and the duration longer. The case history of 1 patient who is still living 38 years after the onset of the disease is described as there is no longer survival time recorded in the literature to our knowledge. Attention is drawn to muscle aches and cramps mentioned spontaneously by 27 of the 70 patients. These symptoms occurred at the onset of MND and often correlated with the site of onset of weakness. Weight loss averaged 1.6lb (0.7kg) per month in those patients in whom weight was recorded. The CSF protein was greater than 45mg/100ml, ranging up to 110mg/100ml, in 9 of 37 patients.

In 25 normal subjects the F-wave velocity increased proceeding proximally, reaching the maximum values in the central tract (64.86 +/- 2.23 m/sec in ulnar nerve). In 11 patients affected by motor neurone disease and 11 patients affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the F-wave velocity decreased significantly proceeding proximally and the minimum values were found in the central tract (52.51 +/- 2.15 m/sec in MND and 48.64 +/- 5.60 m/sec in ALS).

Some differences were observed between MND patients and normal subjects, namely: increase of WBC and gamma-globulin in MND patients. However, such differences were not observed between MND patients and pathological controls, and therefore are probably due to a higher frequency of infectious complications in MND patients in respect to normal controls. The capacity of the immune system to respond to an adequate stimulus was normal, and no precipitating anti-CNS antibodies were detected in MND sera. Furthermore, no sex-linked differences were observed and the CSF abnormalities observed in 2 out of 16 MND patients were probably reflecting only destruction of CNS cells.

4714102,Possible neurogenic factor in muscular dystrophy: its similarity to denervation atrophy.,"Muscle biopsy specimens from 179 cases of muscular dystrophies and from 140 cases of anterior horn cell disorders (from a total of 1,348 biopsied patients) were examined histologically. There were 72 cases of Duchenne type muscular dystrophy (DMD), five of Becker type MD, four girls with myopathy resembling DMD, 40 with limb-girdle, 10 with facioscapulohumeral, seven with late onset, 13 with congenital, and 28 with unclassifiable muscular dystrophies. Groups of small atrophied muscle fibres were encountered in 42 (23%) of the cases in this group, most frequently in patients with limb-girdle, facioscapulohumeral, and least frequently with DM dystrophy. In the second group there were 25 cases of infantile, 38 of juvenile, and 39 of adult spinal muscular atrophy (SMA); there were 21 patients with motor neurone disease (MND), six with poliomyelitis, and 11 with an unclassifiable type of anterior horn cell disorder. Pseudomyopathic changes were encountered in 43 (30%) of all cases in this group. They were most frequently present among patients with juvenile and adult SMA and in those with MND. The presence of group atrophy in muscular dystrophy is considered significant myopathological evidence of a denervation process. On the other hand, pseudomyopathic changes, variation in fibre size, rounding, central nuclei, and increase in connective tissue occurring in various anterior horn cell disorders are seen not to be specific `myopathic' changes. Thus there was an overlap of pathological reactions in muscles from the dystrophies and the neurogenic atrophies. Comparably atrophied fibres (much less than 2 SDs below the normal mean diameter) and hypertrophied fibres (much more than 2 SDs above the normal mean diameter) were encountered in both dystrophy and neurogenic atrophy, considering the large muscles of the limb. Likewise, the mean fibre diameters were comparable in DMD and in juvenile SMA. The fourth evidence of a neurogenic factor in muscular dystrophy was derived from an examination of SDH preparations of muscle. There was a preponderance of type I muscle fibres in dystrophic muscles compared with specimens from controls, suggesting depletion of type II fibres. It appears that the concept of muscular dystrophy as a primary muscle disease needs to be re-examined.","['Dastur DK', 'Razzak ZA']",1973,36,3,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,Dastur DK and Razzak ZA.
