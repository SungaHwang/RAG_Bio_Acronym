37893465,Particularities of Urinary Tract Infections in Diabetic Patients: A Concise Review.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that, untreated or poorly controlled, can lead to serious complications, reducing life expectancy and quality. Diabetic patients are more likely to develop infections, including many common infections, but also pathognomonic ones such as emphysematous pyelonephritis, malignant otitis externa, mucormycosis and Fournier's gangrene. Considering the fact that diabetic patients experience more frequently urinary tract infections (UTIs) with a worse prognosis than non-diabetic people, we conducted a review study based on data in the literature, following the particularities of UTIs in this group of patients, the risk factors, the mechanisms involved and the challenges in their management. The findings highlight that UTI in diabetic patients have some particularities, including a more frequent evolution to bacteremia, increased hospitalizations, and elevated rates of recurrence and mortality than non-diabetic patients. The possible risk factors identified seem to be female gender, pregnancy, older age, UTI in the previous six months, poor glycemic control and duration of diabetes. The mechanisms involved are related to glucosuria and bladder dysfunction, factors related to bacterial strains and host response. The bacterial strains involved in UTIs in diabetic patients and their antibiotic susceptibility profile are, with some exceptions, similar to those in non-diabetic people; however, the antimicrobial agents should be carefully chosen and the duration of the treatment should be as those required for a complicated UTI. The data related to the risk of developing UTIs in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors, a new class of oral hypoglycaemic agents with cardiovascular and renal benefits, are controversial; overall, it was evidenced that UTIs occurred at the initiation of the treatment, recurrent infection was uncommon and the majority of UTIs responded to treatment with standard antibiotics. Moreover, interruption or discontinuation of SGLT-2 inhibitor as a result of UTI was rare and SGLT-2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of severe infections such as urosepsis and pyelonephritis.","['Confederat LG', 'Condurache MI', 'Alexa RE', 'Dragostin OM']",2023,59,10,Medicina (Kaunas),"Confederat LG, et al.

37889464,Identification of bacteria associated with canine otitis externa based on 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing.,"Bacteria are regarded as predisposing and perpetuating factors causing otitis externa (OE), whereas auricular anatomy is a predisposing factor. This study aims to investigate bacterial populations in the external auditory canals of healthy dogs and dogs with OE. Four categories of ear swabs included healthy erect-ear dogs, erect-ear dogs with OE, healthy pendulous-ear dogs and pendulous-ear dogs with OE. After bacterial DNA extraction, 16S rDNAs were amplified using specific primers within a V3/V4 region. Following DNA library construction, high-throughput sequencing was performed on MiSeq (Illumina). CLC Microbial Genomics Module was used to determine the rarefaction curve, bacterial classification, relative abundance, richness and diversity index. The results demonstrated that healthy dogs had higher bacterial richness and diversity than the dogs with OE. Comparable with culture-dependent methods described previously, this study revealed predominant Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Proteus spp. in OE cases. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing might disclose some potential emerging pathogens including Tissierella spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Achromobacter spp., which have not been reported in previous canine OE cases. Nevertheless, larger sample sizes are further required for an extensive evidence-based investigation.","['Saengchoowong S', 'Jitvaropas R', 'Poomipak W', 'Praianantathavorn K', 'Payungporn S']",2023,,,Braz J Microbiol,"Saengchoowong S, et al.

37881401,Rare Cause of Skull Base Osteomyelitis: A Challenging Diagnosis and Management With a Literature Review.,"This is a case of skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) caused by a rare fungal species, Scedosporium apiospermum. This is a clinical case report with a review of the literature. SBO is a potentially life-threatening infection of the temporal bone. The patient presented to our hospital with a two-month history of left otalgia, otorrhea and reduced hearing, after failed initial intravenous antibiotic therapy. Thorough examination and further investigation confirmed the diagnosis of SBO caused by a rare fungal species, S. apiospermum. The patient was subsequently started on a long-term course of antifungals which led to an improvement of symptoms. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and considering early antifungal treatment in patients with persistent otalgia and otorrhea, particularly in those who have failed to respond to intravenous antibiotics. Further research is needed to better understand the optimal timing and duration of antifungal therapy in these patients.","['Hussain SZM', 'Haq II', 'Arshad Z', 'Ekunola A', 'Das S']",2023,15,9,Cureus,"Hussain SZM, et al.

An a posteriori analysis of a peculiar case of necrotizing otitis externa.,"KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Large language models have made artificial intelligence readily available to the general public and potentially have a role in healthcare; however, their use in difficult differential diagnosis is still limited, as demonstrated by a case of necrotizing otitis externa.
ABSTRACT: This case report presents a peculiar case of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) with skull base involvement which proved diagnostically challenging. The initial patient presentation and the imaging performed on the 78-year-old patient suggested a neoplastic rhinopharyngeal lesion and only after several unsuccessful biopsies the patient was transferred to our unit. Upon re-evaluation of the clinical picture, a clinical hypothesis of NOE with skull base erosion was made and confirmed by identifying ","['Pugliese G', 'Maccari A', 'Felisati E', 'Felisati G', 'Giudici L', 'Rapolla C', 'Pisani A', 'Saibene AM']",2023,11,9,Clin Case Rep,"Pugliese G, et al.

37727503,Prevalence of the microbiological causes of canine otitis externa and the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacterial strains.,"Otitis externa is a canine disease of multifactorial etiology in which bacteria plays a significant role. Due to the predominant bacterial etiology otitis is usually treated with antibiotics. However, non-prudent use of antibiotics promotes the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria thus compromising the therapy effectiveness. Currently, the increase of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to global health. For this reason, the aim of the study was to investigate prevalence of the microbiological causes of canine otitis externa and the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacterial strains. The research and sampling were conducted at Veterinary Clinics for small pets in Serbia. Samples were sent to laboratory for bacteriological and mycological testing. Additionally, the sensitivity of the isolated bacteria to antibiotics was evaluated using disc diffusion method. Sixty dogs with otitis externa clinical symptoms were included in the study. Out of a total of 53 positive samples for pathogen presence, bacteria were present in 40. The most prevalent bacteria was Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp., while Malassezia pachydermatis was the only isolated yeast pathogen occurring in 36 samples. Generally, the lowest resistance against all bacteria showed enrofloxacin. On the contrary, high resistance to penicillin and amoxicillin was a common finding for G+ and G- bacteria. These results indicate the need for laboratory testing in terms of isolation, identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing, not only in the case of otitis externa in dogs, but in all diseases when it is possible, in order to enhance antimicrobial stewardship and consequently to contribute AMR reduction.","['Tesin N', 'Stojanovic D', 'Stancic I', 'Kladar N', 'Ružić Z', 'Spasojevic J', 'Tomanic D', 'Kovacevic Z']",2023,26,3,Pol J Vet Sci,"Tesin N, et al.

37721867,Genetic diversity of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from ear infections in Iran: Emergence of CC8/ST239-SCCmec III as major genotype.,"Increase in antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from ear infection is a serious public health problem. The objective of this investigation was to determine the antibacterial resistance profile and genetic variability of the S. aureus isolated from adult patients with otitis externa (OE) and otitis media (OM) infections, Tehran- Iran. The disk diffusion was employed to detect the susceptibility of 45 S. aureus strains. Biofilm production was evaluated by microtiter plate assay. Genetic diversity of the isolates was determined by staphylococcal cassette SCCmec, spa, and MLST techniques. Resistance to mupirocin and vancomycin were identified in 40 and 2.2% of isolates. Out of the 45 S. aureus isolates, 41 (91.2%) strains were considered as positive biofilm strains at different levels. According to our results, S. aureus isolated from OM (44.4%, 20/45) were including CC8/ST239-SCCmecIII corresponded to spa types t860, t030, t037, t234, t421 (70%, 14/20) and CC/ST30-SCCmecIV corresponded to spa types t605 and t019 (30%, 6/20) while S. aureus isolated from OE (55.6%, 25/45) were including CC/ST30-SCCmecIV corresponded to spa types t605, t345 and t1130 (52%, 13/25), CC/ST22-SCCmecIV corresponded to spa type t790 (20%, 5/25), CC8/ST8-SCCmecIV corresponded to spa type t008 (16%, 4/25), and CC/ST45-SCCmecIV corresponded to spa types t004 and t038 (12%, 3/25). This study highlighted genetic variability and strong biofilm formation ability among our isolates revealing its crucial role in enhancing the resistance of this bacteria to drugs. Thus, it is necessary to continue the epidemiological analysis to improve the control of ear infections related to S. aureus.","['Rahmani Z', 'Hosseini SS', 'Bagheri P', 'Goudarzi M']",2023,70,3,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung,"Rahmani Z, et al.

Compounded solutions of enrofloxacin are commonly used in practice to treat bacterial OE; however, the tolerability of different concentrations of this antibiotic in the ear canals of dogs has not been evaluated. The objective of this study is to determine if a higher concentration of enrofloxacin applied to the external ear canal is clinically tolerated in dogs with healthy ears. Sixteen client-owned dogs with bilateral healthy ears and no previous history of OE were enrolled. Injectable enrofloxacin 2.27% diluted with sterile sodium chloride in 1:1 (11.35 mg/mL) and 2:1 (15 mg/mL) ratios were applied into the dogs' right and left ears, respectively, q 12 hr for 14 days. Based on video otoscopic examination, clinical score for canine OE (OTIS3) results before application were ≤1 for all dogs. During the study and at the conclusion, all scores remained ≤2, which is considered normal. No cytologic inflammatory cells were seen in any of the dogs' ears throughout the study. Different concentrations of enrofloxacin solution applied topically were well tolerated by dogs with healthy ears and can be considered for the treatment of dogs with bacterial OE.","['Clegg J', 'Souza C', 'Brame B']",2023,59,5,J Am Anim Hosp Assoc,"Clegg J, et al.

37668755,Aspergillus infections of lateral skull base: a case series.,"PURPOSE: While extensive research with accurate classification has been done in mycoses of the paranasal sinuses and anterior skull base, a similar understanding of lateral skull base fungal pathologies is lacking due to relative rarity and diagnostic difficulties. We introduce a series of eleven cases and two different invasive entities of Aspergillus temporal bone diseases-fungal skull base osteomyelitis (SBO)/malignant otitis externa (MOE) and chronic invasive granulomatous fungal disease (CIGFD).
METHODOLOGY: A retrospective observational study was conducted at the neuro-otology unit of a tertiary care referral center between July 2017 and November 2022. Diagnosed cases of lateral skull base osteomyelitis with atypical symptoms and lack of response to culture-directed antibiotics were evaluated for fungal origin. Patient data, including history, laboratory findings, serum galactomannan assay, CT and MRI imaging findings, clinical examination findings, and co-morbidities, were analyzed. The treatment course and response were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 11 cases were included in the study. Of these, 9 were cases of Aspergillus-induced skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) and 2 of Aspergillus-induced chronic invasive granulomatous fungal disease (CIGFD). CIGFD presented with persistent ear discharge and slowly progressive post-aural swelling, while all patients of fungal SBO had lower cranial nerve palsies. CIGFD responded to excision and antifungals, while SBO responded well to conservative anti-fungal treatment.
CONCLUSION: In cases of lateral SBO not responding to antibiotic therapy, the possibility of fungal etiology should be considered. Aspergillus spp. seems to be the major fungal pathogen.","['Muraleedharan M', 'Keshri A', 'Rao RN', 'Mehrotra A', 'Das KK', 'Dubey A', 'Hameed N', 'Chidambaram KS', 'Aqib M', 'Kumar R', 'Manogaran RS']",2023,,,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Muraleedharan M, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical case series; single referral hospital.
ANIMALS: Forty-two rabbits with naturally occurring OM.
METHODS: Medical records (2011-2021) of rabbits with CT-confirmed OM undergoing surgery were reviewed for outcomes, complications, bacteria cultured from middle ears, and AST.
RESULTS: Surgery was performed on 48 ears, and outcomes determined 21 days postoperatively. All rabbits survived the procedure. Otitis externa resolved in all lop-eared rabbits. Of 29 ears with OM-associated head tilt, eight (28%) resolved, nine (31%) improved, seven (24%) remained unchanged and five (17%) worsened. Outcome was not associated with head tilt duration nor OM severity. Postoperative complications occurred in 12 (25%) cases, seven of which had wound margin dehiscence that healed by 21 days. The most frequent bacteria isolated were Pasteurella multocida (16%), Bordetella bronchiseptica (14%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14%). Bacteria were sensitive to azithromycin, marbofloxacin or enrofloxacin and resistant to penicillin.
CONCLUSION: LECARBOM is a well-tolerated surgical procedure to treat OM. It also improved or stabilized 83% of cases with head tilt and resolved all cases with otitis externa.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: LECARBOM with administration of an AST-sensitive antibiotic, or azithromycin when no AST is performed, should be effective in rabbits with OM. Postsurgically, it resolves or alleviates most secondary conditions such as otitis externa, head tilt and facial nerve paralysis.","['Monge E', 'Donnelly TM', 'Coutant T', 'Bennett RA', 'Pignon C']",2023,,,Vet Surg,"Monge E, et al.

37622925,Comparative Analysis of Cartilage Conduction Hearing Aid Users and Non-Users: An Investigative Study.,"Clinical findings on cartilage conduction hearing aids (CCHAs) have gradually become clear; however, few reports include a large number of cases. This study included 91 ears from 69 patients who underwent CCHA fitting in our hospital. Their ears were divided into six groups (i.e., bilateral aural atresia or severe canal stenosis, unilateral aural atresia or severe canal stenosis, chronic otitis media or chronic otitis externa with otorrhea, sensorineural hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, and conductive hearing loss) according to their clinical diagnosis and type of hearing loss. Most clinical diagnoses were aural atresia or meatal stenosis (bilateral, 21.8%; unilateral, 39.6%). The purchase rate of CCHAs was higher in the closed-ear group (bilateral, 77.3%; unilateral, 62.5%). In the bilateral closed-ear group, air conduction thresholds at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz and aided thresholds with CCHAs at 4000 Hz were significantly lower in the purchase group than the non-purchase group. No significant difference was observed between the purchase and non-purchase groups in the unilateral closed-ear group. In the bilateral closed-ear group, air conduction thresholds and aided thresholds were associated with the purchase rate of CCHAs. In the unilateral closed-ear group, factors other than hearing might have affected the purchase rate of CCHAs.","['Sugimoto S', 'Yoshida T', 'Fukunaga Y', 'Motegi A', 'Saito K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Sone M']",2023,13,4,Audiol Res,"Sugimoto S, et al.

37622535,Potential Toxicity of Boric Acid Powder Otic Insufflation.,"OBJECTIVE: Boric acid (BA) powder is commonly used to treat otologic conditions, such as mastoid bowl inflammation and chronic otitis externa. Exposure to 50 mg per day is thought to cause systemic toxicity in humans. Inflamed skin and mucosal surfaces readily absorb BA. The aim of this study was to measure the doses of BA commonly used in clinical otology and alert the otolaryngology community to BA's underappreciated potential source of systemic toxicity.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, controlled.
SETTING: Laboratory.
METHODS: BA dose administration was measured by weighing the BA generated by common insufflators: accordion bellows, House-Sheehy insufflator, DeVilbiss insufflator, and pneumatic powder blower. Manual insufflation was performed with 3 compressions of the bulb. The pneumatic blower was sprayed for 1 second. Measurements were repeated 10 times.
RESULTS: The DeVilbiss insufflator delivered the lowest mean BA dose, 6.1 mg (SD 3.4, range 2.1-13.7), followed by the House-Sheehy 8.9 mg (SD 8.4, range 1.6-27.8), the pneumatic blower 192.8 mg (SD 38.3, range 150.0-261.7), and the accordion, 284.1 mg (SD 215.0, range 37.8-730.8).
CONCLUSION: BA dose delivery is highly variable by insufflator type, and doses thought to cause systemic toxicity are commonly generated. Awareness of and further investigation into the potential toxicity of otic administration of BA seems warranted.","['Smith SH', 'Antonelli PJ']",2023,,,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Smith SH and Antonelli PJ.

37580811,Comparison between clinical evaluations and laboratory findings and the impact of biofilm on antimicrobial susceptibility in vitro in canine otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: In canine otitis externa (OE), biofilm-producing bacteria are frequently present but biofilm may be underdiagnosed clinically.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to investigate an association between clinical and cytological findings with bacteriological data from dogs with OE, to establish, through Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) examination, whether the presence of biofilm in vivo can be predicted and to evaluate the impact of biofilm on antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six dogs showing clinical signs of OE were enrolled. One cotton swab each was collected for ESEM, bacterial culture and susceptibility testing and for cytology. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (n = 42, 48.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 26, 30.2%) were tested for their ability to form biofilm. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC), Minimal Biofilm Inhibitory Concentrations (MBIC) and Minimal Biofilm Eradication Concentrations (MBEC) towards enrofloxacin, gentamicin, polymyxin B and rifampicin were determined.
RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was positively associated with the biofilm clinical evaluation (p < 0.01) and neutrophils (p < 0.05), nuclear streaks (p < 0.01) and rods bacteria (p < 0.01) on cytology. S. pseudintermedius was associated with a low presence of neutrophils. There was a statistical correlation between clinical and cytological biofilm presence (p ≤ 0.01), but none with the biofilm production assay nor ESEM biofilm detection. No differences were found comparing the results of MIC and MBIC. MBEC results showed higher values than MIC and MBIC for all antimicrobials tested (p ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biofilm presence in OE was often underdiagnosed. Even if there is no specific clinical or cytological pattern related to biofilm, its presence should always be suspected.","['Luciani L', 'Stefanetti V', 'Rampacci E', 'Gobbi P', 'Valentini L', 'Capuozzo R', 'Passamonti F']",2023,,,Vet Dermatol,"Luciani L, et al.

37580173,Refractory otitis media and otitis externa in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) treated with total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy.,"BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report fully describing the surgical and medical management of otitis media and otitis externa in the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) treated by total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy.
CASE REPORT: An adult male koala captured as part of a monitoring project in South East Queensland was diagnosed with chlamydial cystitis. Purulent discharge from the right ear was also observed; diagnostic imaging was consistent with otitis media and otitis externa. Yokenella regensburgei was repeatedly cultured from the site. Clinical signs resolved with topical antibiotic therapy; however, recrudesced following cessation of antibiotics. A total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy was performed, followed by an extended period of systemic antibiotic therapy. Mild facial nerve paresis was observed for 4 weeks postoperatively and resolved spontaneously. The koala remained clinically healthy for the 6 months it was monitored following release.
CONCLUSION: Total ear canal ablation combined with lateral bulla osteotomy appears to be an appropriate surgical intervention for otitis media combined with otitis externa refractory to medical management in the koala. Transient postoperative facial nerve paresis is a possible complication, as documented in other species. To the authors' knowledge this is the first case of Yokenella regensburgei infection outside of humans and American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis); the clinical significance of this pathogen in the koala remains unknown.","['Swaffield MJ', 'Liberts M', 'Gillett AK', 'Moses PA']",2023,,,Aust Vet J,"Swaffield MJ, et al.

37575545,"The risks of rejection vs. infection: Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Gradenigo syndrome, and varicella meningoencephalitis in a heart transplant patient.","BACKGROUND: Orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients are at increased risk for varicella zoster reactivation, and severe complications may arise due to their immunosuppressive regimens. Managing immunosuppression in acute infection is difficult, and specific guideline recommendations or evidence from the literature are lacking. However, patient care must involve weighing the risk of transplant rejection with the consequences of worsening infection.
CASE SUMMARY: An OHT patient with a history of multiple episodes of acute rejection, latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, and recent completion of anti-viral prophylaxis presented with unilateral facial droop and pain, abducens nerve palsy, crusting facial rash, and ear swelling. Imaging revealed necrotizing otitis externa, with associated otitis media, and petrous apicitis concerning for Gradenigo syndrome. A VZV-positive viral panel confirmed our suspicion for Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS). The patient's mentation continued to decline, and subsequent lumbar puncture also revealed VZV meningoencephalitis. The patient's mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was suspended, with continuation of tacrolimus, and initiation of intravenous acyclovir. The patient demonstrated gradual resolution of his infection, without developing any signs of acute rejection.
DISCUSSION: Varicella zoster virus reactivation is common in OHT patients, particularly when viral prophylaxis is discontinued; however, cardiologists should be aware of the rarer manifestations that can manifest in these immunocompromised patients. This is the first documented case of simultaneous RHS, Gradenigo syndrome, and VZV meningoencephalitis in any patient, regardless of transplant status. We demonstrate that even in patients at very high risk of rejection, MMF can be safely discontinued and host immunity maintained with temporary tacrolimus monotherapy.","['Benavente K', 'Kozai L', 'Silangcruz K', 'Banerjee D']",2023,7,8,Eur Heart J Case Rep,"Benavente K, et al.

37553272,Fungal Infections of the External Auditory Canal and Emerging Pathogens.,"Fungal infections of the external auditory canal can range from common (otomycosis) to life threatening (necrotizing otitis externa). Proper identification of fungal pathogens is necessary to guide appropriate therapy, and a high index of suspicion for fungal causes of ear canal disease is critical. Fungal pathogens may be an especially important cause of ear canal disease in certain populations, including patients with diabetes, patients recently treated with antibiotics, and immunosuppressed patients. Opportunistic fungal infections of the ear canal are an emerging concern.","['McCarty Walsh E', 'Hanson MB']",2023,56,5,Otolaryngol Clin North Am,McCarty Walsh E and Hanson MB.

37550850,Antibiotics versus non-antibiotic treatments for acute otitis externa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is a condition causing inflammation of the outer ear canal, which presents with itching, discharge and pain. Most cases of acute otitis externa are caused by bacterial infection and are thus treated with antibiotics. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials aims to assess the effectiveness of topical non-antibiotic treatments compared to topical antibiotic treatment for the treatment of acute otitis externa.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis databases searched: Cochrane Library including ClinicalTrials.gov; MEDLINE; World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Web of Science to identify randomised clinical trials evaluating topical antibiotics and topical non-antibiotic agents in adults and children with acute otitis externa. Non-antibiotic therapeutics for comparison with topical antibiotics included antiseptics, steroids, non-pharmaceuticals and astringents.
RESULTS: Seventeen trials were eligible for inclusion, with 10 combined in meta-analysis. Data could be pooled comparing antiseptic and steroid monotherapies with topical antibiotic agents. There were no significant differences in cure rates in any pairwise comparisons. Individually, the majority of studies favoured topical antiseptics or steroids over antibiotics, however these differences were not significant when pooled in meta-analysis.
CONCLUSION: Antiseptic, steroid and antibiotic monotherapies are all effective for the management of acute otitis externa. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that topical antiseptic or steroid agents are superior or inferior to topical antibiotics.","['Di Traglia R', 'Tudor-Green B', 'Muzaffar J', 'Borsetto D', 'Smith ME']",2023,48,6,Clin Otolaryngol,"Di Traglia R, et al.

37529764,Online Self-Triage of Ear or Hearing Concerns in a Patient Portal: Comparison of Subsequent Diagnoses and Hospitalizations to National Emergency Department and National Ambulatory Ear or Hearing Visits.,"BACKGROUND: Although online self-triage is easily accessible, little is known about the patients who use self-triage or their subsequent diagnoses. We compared ear/hearing self-triage subsequent diagnoses to ear/hearing visit diagnoses in emergency departments (ED) and ambulatory clinics across the United States.
METHODS: We compared International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD10) coded diagnoses following online self-triage for ear/hearing concerns with those from national ED and ambulatory clinic samples. We used data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) and National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for comparison. Using matched ear/hearing diagnostic categories for those aged 1 and over, we compared self-triage diagnosis frequencies with national ED and ambulatory diagnosis frequencies.
RESULTS: Following ear/hearing self-triage, there were 1092 subsequent office visits with a primary diagnosis code. For five frequently diagnosed ear/hearing conditions (i.e., suppurative and nonsuppurative otitis media [OM], otalgia, otitis externa, and cerumen impaction), there was a strong correlation between diagnosis counts made following self-triage and estimated counts of national ED visit diagnoses (r = 0.94; CI 95% [0.37 to 0.99]; 
CONCLUSION: The strong correlation of ear-related self-triage diagnoses with national ED diagnoses and the low hospitalization risk for these diagnoses suggests that there is an opportunity for self-triage of ear/hearing concerns to decrease ED visits for these symptoms.","['North F', 'Jensen TB', 'Pecina J', 'Miller NE', 'Duvall M', 'Nelson EM', 'Thompson MC', 'Johnson BJ', 'Crum BA', 'Stroebel R']",2023,10,,Health Serv Res Manag Epidemiol,"North F, et al.

37525417,Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced mitochondrial dysfunction inhibits proinflammatory cytokine secretion and enhances cytotoxicity in mouse macrophages in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent way.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa belongs to the genus Pseudomonas and is a common Gram-negative, exclusively aerobic, conditionally pathogenic bacterium with the characteristics of easy colonization, mutation, and multidrug resistance (Deng et al., 2015; Azam and Khan, 2019; Jurado-Martín et al., 2021). It is mainly distributed in the air, soil, water, intestinal tract, and skin surface of humans and domestic animals and can cause complications such as ulcerative keratitis, otitis externa, skin and soft tissue infections, respiratory infections, sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and urinary tract infections in burned or immunocompromised patients (Azam and Khan, 2019; Chai and Xu, 2020; Voth et al., 2020). P. aeruginosa is a naturally drug-resistant bacterium that is resistant to a wide range of antibiotics, making it one of the major opportunistic pathogens leading to in-hospital infections (Pang et al., 2019; Chai and Xu, 2020; Reynolds and Kollef, 2021). According to the surveillance report of the China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (CARSS, http://www.carss.cn), Gram-negative bacteria accounted for more than 70% of all bacterial infections, and P. aeruginosa accounted for 12.4%, 12.0%, and 12.2% in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Therefore, P. aeruginosa infection has become an important concern in public health care, and it is particularly important to gain insight into the means of host immune defense against P. aeruginosa infection.","['Yang H', 'Wang Y', 'Fan H', 'Liu F', 'Feng H', 'Li X', 'Chu M', 'Pan E', 'Teng D', 'Chen H', 'Dong J']",2023,,,J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,"Yang H, et al.

ANIMALS: 32 client-owned dogs diagnosed with otitis externa.
METHODS: A sample of otic debris from each patient was collected and plated onto a fresh Sheep's Blood Agar plate in the hospital. After bacterial growth was confirmed, 4 wells were created, numbered randomly, and treated with saline (placebo), DEY, Coptis, and Zymox Otic Enzymatic Solution with 1% Hydrocortisone (Zymox). After 24 hours of incubation, the diameter of the zone of inhibition (dZOI) of each treatment was measured and recorded, and compared among treatments. A sample of the bacterial colonies grown was submitted to an outside lab for bacterial identification.
RESULTS: The mean ± SD dZOI values for saline, DEY, Coptis, and Zymox treated wells were 0.25 ± 1.41, 12.47 ± 3.92, 14.25 ± 7.12, and 3.22 ± 5.12, respectively. Post hoc multiple comparisons test revealed that (1) saline-treated wells had significantly smaller dZOI values than the other 3 groups (all P < .001), (2) Zymox treated wells had significantly smaller dZOI values than either herbal treated groups (both P < .001), and (3) DEY treated wells had significantly smaller dZOI values than those treated with Coptis (P = .0042).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results from this in vitro study suggested that both DEY and Coptis could be effective treatments in inhibiting the growth of bacteria in dogs with otitis externa.

CASE SUMMARY: A 5-month-old male neutered Russian Blue cat was evaluated for progressive stertorous upper airway sounds, acute onset vestibulopathy and abnormal laryngeal anatomy. Endotracheal intubation was only able to be achieved using videoscopic guidance and identified concern for severe nasopharyngeal stenosis. A computerized tomography scan revealed otitis interna, narrowed nasopharynx and no definitive cause for the stertorous breathing. The cat recovered very slowly from anaesthesia due to concern for airway obstruction following extubation. It was discharged the following day and then passed away at home 2 weeks later. Necropsy revealed that the epiglottis was obscured by 2 cm of redundant mucosal tissue extending from the base of the tongue to the larynx resulting in epiglottic entrapment. Also noted was chronic, severe otitis interna and externa. Upper airway obstruction is suspected to be the cause of sudden death.

The medial two third is bony, and the skin is devoid of these skin appendages and its secretions. It also has outward migratory property which makes the ear self-cleansing. Here we present an exceeding rare case of hair in the tympanic membrane causing distressing symptom of scratchy sensation, tinnitus, and otalgia. We hypothesize, it is the distortion of migratory pattern medially due to repeated otitis externa caused by abuse of cotton bud that led to presence of hair in the tympanic membrane.","['Adhikari TR', 'Jamtsho S']",2023,11,,SAGE Open Med Case Rep,Adhikari TR and Jamtsho S.

37384389,Rigid normograde rhinoscopy-assisted traction-avulsion removal of small middle ear polyps from the auditory tube in five cats.,"CASE SERIES SUMMARY: This study aims to describe a novel minimally invasive technique for the removal of small middle ear polyps from the auditory tube openings in cats. Five cats with clinical signs of otitis externa and/or otitis media, and/or upper respiratory tract inflammation were included. All cats underwent pharyngolaryngoscopy under anaesthesia, CT scan of the head, neck and thoracic cavity, video-otoscopic examination, retrograde nasopharyngoscopy and normograde rhinoscopy. The five cats described in this study were all found to have significant respiratory tract inflammation (rhinitis, sinusitis, nasopharyngitis, otitis media) with small polypous protrusions from the auditory tube openings. A normograde rhinoscopy-assisted traction-avulsion (RATA) removal of these small polyps was performed in all cases without complications. The rostral nasopharynx was visualised by a unilaterally normograde advanced rigid endoscope passing the choana, and polyps were removed using a grasping forceps introduced in the contralateral nostril. Telephone follow-up revealed clear improvement in all cases. One of the cases was re-evaluated with a CT scan and endoscopy 4 weeks after treatment. The CT scan showed a significant improvement with no abnormalities in both external ear canals and air opacity in both tympanic bullae. Video-endoscopic examination revealed intact tympanic membranes with mild chronic abnormalities and patent auditory tube openings upon normograde rhinoscopy.
RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: Rigid normograde RATA is a novel, minimally invasive and effective technique for the removal of small middle ear polyps from auditory tube openings in cats with otitis media.","['Oorsprong CW', 'Ter Haar G']",2023,25,6,J Feline Med Surg,Oorsprong CW and Ter Haar G.

Some skin diseases, such as skin fold dermatitis, are directly associated with the abnormal anatomic conformation of brachycephalic dogs, while for others, such as atopic dermatitis and viral pigmented plaques, there is an underlying genetic basis or a general predisposition. Anatomic alterations associated with brachycephaly, leading to fold formation of the skin and stenosis of the ear canal, together with primary immunodeficiencies described in some breeds, favor the development of pyoderma, ","['Hobi S', 'Barrs VR', 'Bęczkowski PM']",2023,13,12,Animals (Basel),"Hobi S, et al.

37367633,Tympanoplasty Healing Outcomes With Use of Postoperative Otic Quinolones.,"OBJECTIVE: Tympanoplasty usually results in tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) closure, but healing may be suboptimal (e.g., excess scarring). Factors that have been linked to impaired TM healing have become widely adopted (especially, postoperative use of quinolone ear drops). The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of suboptimal tympanoplasty healing with the use of otic quinolones postoperatively.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Tertiary care facility.
PATIENTS: One hundred patients undergoing tympanoplasty for TMP.
INTERVENTIONS: Tympanoplasty +/- canalplasty.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healing complications (e.g., granulation tissue, TMP, myringitis, bone exposure, lateralization, anterior blunting, medial canal fibrosis, and canal stenosis) and hearing loss.
METHODS: Charts were reviewed for postoperative healing issues and hearing outcomes at 1 to 2 years postoperatively.
RESULTS: TMP closure was found in 93.2%, but 34.2% had healing issues at 1 to 2 years postoperatively, with 20.6% having adverse healing outcomes (perforation (6.9%), granulation tissue (6.9%), medial fibrosis (4.1%), and myringitis, bone exposure, and webbing (all 1.4%). Another 13.7% had notable postoperative issues, such as protracted otorrhea (11.0%), otitis externa (9.6%), otitis media (1.4%), and atelectasis (2.7%). No medical, surgical, or patient factors impacted outcomes. Average air-bone gap at 1 to 2 years did not differ between patients with and without healing issues and patients with other postoperative issues ( p = 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal healing is common after tympanoplasty. There may be significant opportunity to improve post-tympanoplasty healing beyond improving the TMP closure rate.","['Kolb CL', 'Dirain CO', 'Antonelli PJ']",2023,44,7,Otol Neurotol,"Kolb CL, et al.

37366442,Clinical Spectrum and Treatment Response of Malignant Otitis Externa Patients: A Rural Tertiary Care Centre Experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is an invasive external ear infection that has a tendency to spread through the temporal bone and can further progress to involve intracranial structures. Though the prevalence of MOE is rare, high morbidity and mortality are often associated. Complications of advanced MOE include cranial nerve involvement, most commonly facial nerve, and intracranial infections such as abscesses and meningitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective case series of nine patients diagnosed with MOE, demographic data, clinical presentations, laboratory data, and radiological findings were reviewed. All patients were followed up for a minimum period of three months after discharge. Outcomes were measured in terms of reduction in obnoxious ear pain (Visual Analogue Scale), ear discharge, tinnitus, need for re-hospitalization, recurrence of disease, and overall survival.
RESULTS: In our case series of nine patients (seven males and two females), six underwent surgery, and three patients were managed with a medical line of treatment. All patients had a significant reduction in otorrhea, otalgia, random venous blood sugars, and improvement of facial palsy implicating good response to treatment.
CONCLUSION: Prompt diagnosis of MOE warrants clinical expertise and aids in preventing complications. A prolonged course of intravenous anti-microbial agents is the mainstay of treatment, but timely surgical interventions in treatment-resistant cases can prevent complications.","['Ausekar S', 'Prasad KC', 'Babu P', 'Joseph L', 'G I']",2023,15,5,Cureus,"Ausekar S, et al.

37362478,A Child With Retroauricular Tenderness: Is It Really Mastoiditis?,"The presence of retroauricular tenderness and erythema has always been closely linked to a diagnosis of acute mastoiditis (AM), a condition that has become less common over the years given the advent of antibiotics and pneumococcal vaccination. However, other etiologies such as retroauricular cellulitis can also present similarly. We present the case of a 10-year-old patient who presented with outward and downward protrusion of the left ear with retroauricular tenderness and erythema and was initially presumed to have a diagnosis of AM and admitted for intravenous antibiotic management. Imaging was negative for any evidence of AM, and in retrospect, the patient was diagnosed with retroauricular cellulitis secondary to acute otitis externa. Being familiar with this differential of retroauricular pain and tenderness can lead to more cost-effective patient care and a different approach with antibiotic management.","['Saeed A', 'Maharjan R']",2023,15,5,Cureus,Saeed A and Maharjan R.

37325339,Bacterial meningitis secondary to otogenic infection in 10 French bulldogs: A retrospective case series.,"BACKGROUND: There is limited published information to guide the clinical management of bacterial meningitis/encephalitis in dogs.
METHODS: This was a retrospective case series comprising 10 French bulldogs from two referral centres. The cases were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis/encephalitis suspected secondary to otogenic infection based on detection of abnormal fluid/soft tissue opacity within the middle/inner ear, associated meningeal/intracranial involvement through MRI, the findings of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) analysis suggestive of sepsis and/or clinical improvement following antibiosis.
RESULTS: Ten dogs were included (three female and seven male), with a median age of 60 months. Dogs presented with acute onset (median 2 days), progressive history of vestibular signs and/or intra-oral or cervical pain. Five dogs had gross signs of concurrent otitis externa. Common MRI findings included material within the tympanic bulla with adjacent meningeal enhancement. Analysis of CSF documented pleocytosis in all eight dogs, intracellular bacteria seen in three with positive bacteriological culture in two dogs. One dog was euthanised following diagnosis. Nine remaining dogs received antimicrobial therapy and six underwent surgical management. Three dogs treated surgically were neurologically normal within 2 weeks and the remaining three improved. Two dogs treated medically improved and one had complete resolution reported within a 4-week follow-up period. Study limitations include its retrospective nature and small sample size with minimal longer term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial meningitis/encephalitis in French bulldogs can require both medical and surgical treatment to achieve a favourable outcome.","['Butterfield S', 'Whittaker D', 'Tabanez J', 'Carrete JC', 'Pitchford C', 'Mattias CRJ', 'Crawford A', 'Rusbridge C']",2023,10,1,Vet Rec Open,"Butterfield S, et al.

37272640,Management and Clinical Outcomes of 37 Patients with Necrotizing Otitis Externa: Retrospective Review of a Standardized 6-Week Treatment Pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing otitis externa is an invasive infection, affecting older patients, with significant associated morbidity. Despite this, there are no randomized controlled trials that address management, and therefore, treatment approaches may vary considerably. We describe the management and outcomes of 37 patients managed using a multidisciplinary treatment pathway for necrotizing otitis externa over a 5-year period. The pathway is based on a standardized antibiotic regime of 3 weeks of intravenous ceftazidime plus oral ciprofloxacin, followed by a further 3 weeks of ciprofloxacin.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with necrotizing otitis externa since the introduction of our pathway in 2016. We include data on patient demographics, comorbidities, microbiology, length of stay, and length of antimicrobial treatment. Outcome data, including mortality, relapse and treatment failure, and adverse effects of treatment, are presented.
RESULTS: The median age of our patients was 82 years. About 54% of patients had diabetes mellitus or another cause of immunocompromise. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 68%. The median duration of inpatient stay was 9 days, and median treatment duration was 6 weeks. Of 37 patients, 32 were cured (86%), and of the remaining 5 patients, there were 2 mortalities unrelated to necrotizing otitis externa and 3 patients with recurrent infections due to anatomical abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: We note favorable treatment outcomes when using a standardized multidisciplinary pathway and a 6-week course of antibiotic therapy.","['Dhariwal A', 'Manjaly JG', 'Patel B', 'Morris-Jones S', 'David K', 'Khetarpal P', 'Beale T', 'Mehta N', 'Logan S']",2023,19,3,J Int Adv Otol,"Dhariwal A, et al.

37272635,Is Facial Nerve Decompression Justified in Malignant External Otitis? Literature Review and Own Experience.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to present the indications for facial nerve decompression in malignant external otitis, to analyze the results of such treatment, and to describe own experience in that field.
METHODS: A search in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for English language articles published between 1968 and May 2022 was performed. We focused on papers describing patients with malignant external otitis and facial nerve palsy treated by decompression. Moreover, retrospective analysis of 24 consecutive patients with malignant external otitis hospitalized in our department in the past 10 years was performed.
RESULTS: In the literature, 48 cases with malignant external otitis and facial nerve paresis treated by decompression were identified. In total, 41 patients recovered (85.42%), 4 died (1 due to exacerbation of the disease, 2 for pneumonia, and 1 for heart failure), and in 3 cases the final outcome was not presented. In most cases (24; 50%), facial nerve function did not improve after decompression, in 8 patients (16.67%) partial recovery was observed, in 11 cases (22.92%) full improvement was observed, and data were not given for 5 patients. In only one case, the spread of infection and deterioration of local and general patient states were noted. In our material, we identified 13 patients with malignant external otitis and facial nerve palsy. Two of them were treated surgically, of which only one had facial nerve decompression. Partial improvement of facial nerve function was observed after 6 months of rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION: The management of malignant external otitis is still difficult and not well defined. Facial nerve decompression seems justified in selected cases of malignant external otitis not responding to conservative treatment.","['Marszał J', 'Wierzbicka M', 'Bartochowska A']",2023,19,3,J Int Adv Otol,"Marszał J, et al.

37259166,"Demography, common disorders and mortality of Boxer dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK.","BACKGROUND: The Boxer is a popular dog breed with a distinctive appearance. However, the breed has been linked with several health conditions, some of which have been associated with its moderately brachycephalic conformation and its white colouration. Anonymised primary-care veterinary clinical records were explored to extract data on the demography, common disorders and mortality of Boxers in the UK in 2016.
RESULTS: The study population of 336,865 dogs included 3,219 (0.96%) Boxers, of which 10.71% were recorded as white. The mean adult bodyweight was 30.43 kg (SD 5.73 kg). Annual disorder counts did not differ statistically between the sexes or between white and non-white Boxers. The most prevalent fine-level precision disorders were otitis externa (n = 230, 7.15%), epulis (188, 5.84%), corneal ulceration (161, 5.00%) and periodontal disease (149, 4.63%). Of the 34 most common fine-level disorders, none differed in prevalence between white and non-white dogs. The most prevalent disorder groups were skin disorder (n = 571, 17.74%), neoplasia (457, 14.20%) and ear disorder (335, 10.41%). White Boxers had higher prevalence than non-white Boxers for two disorder groups: dental disorder and brain disorder. The median longevity of 346 Boxers that died during the study was 10.46 years (IQR 9.00-11.98, range 2.76-18.00). Median longevity did not differ statistically between the sexes or between white and non-white Boxers. The most common grouped causes of death were death - unrecorded cause (n = 73, 21.10%), neoplasia (43, 12.43%) and brain disorder (33, 9.54%).
CONCLUSIONS: There was minimal evidence of substantial health differences between white and non-white Boxers. Among the four most common disorders recorded in Boxers, two were typically common across all types of dogs (otitis externa and periodontal disease) while two suggested strong predispositions for the Boxer breed (epulis and corneal ulceration), showing the value of eliciting breed-specific disorder patterns for insights for potential health reforms. The overall longevity of Boxer dogs was consistent with other breeds of similar body size.","[""O'Neill DG"", 'Skipper AM', 'Barrett K', 'Church DB', 'Packer RMA', 'Brodbelt DC']",2023,10,1,Canine Med Genet,"O'Neill DG, et al.

37206775,Fungal otitis externa and tympanic membrane perforation.,"INTRODUCTION: Otomycosis is a fungus-causing superficial infection of the external auditory canal that is common in otolaryngology practice. Though it is a worldwide infection, but is more prevalent in warm and humid regions. There has been rise in the occurrence of otomycosis in the last few years because of the extensive usage of antibiotic eardrops. Other influencing reasons for the occurrence of otomycosis is swimming, an immunocompromised host (e.g.: DM, AIDs) pregnancy, post-canal wall down mastoidectomy, tympanic membrane perforation, hearing aids and self-inflicted injuries.
METHODS: Approval from the institutional ethics committee and penned informed agreement from all patients involved in the examination were obtained. 40 patients were included in the study, starting from 1stAugust to 30th September 2021, which emphasized on otomycosis infection with central tympanic membrane perforation. Physical findings such as whitish ear discharge and the presence of hyphae in the EAC, the ear drum, the middle ear mucosa were used to diagnose otomycosis.
RESULT: 20 patients of patched group and 20 patients of non-patched group did not visit for follow up. Data here is for patients who followed-up for 3 weeks. Any significant observation regarding statistical variation in the age, size of perforation, mycological analysis and pure tone audiometry among the two groups were not seen.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, we state that treatment with clotrimazole solution in patched group is safe in managing otomycosis with tympanic membrane perforation. Otomycosis is a fungus causing surface infection of the external auditory canal that otolaryngologists routinely diagnose by medical examination. In acute otomycosis, overgrowth of the fungus in the external auditory canal is due to increased humidity.","['Singh Gill GP', 'Panchal V', 'Bakshi R']",2023,75,Suppl 1,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Singh Gill GP, et al.

37202773,Demography and disorders of English Cocker Spaniels under primary veterinary care in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: The English Cocker Spaniel (ECS) is a common family dog in the UK. This study aimed to describe demography, morbidity, and mortality in ECS under primary veterinary care in the UK during 2016 using data from the VetCompass™ Programme. This study hypothesised that the prevalence of aggression is higher in male than female ECS, and higher in solid-coloured than bi-coloured ECS.
RESULTS: English Cocker Spaniels comprised 10,313/336,865 (3.06%) of dogs under primary veterinary care during 2016. The median age was 4.57 years (inter-quartile range (IQR) 2.25-8.01) and the median adult bodyweight was 15.05 kg (IQR 13.12-17.35). The annual proportional birth rate was relatively stable between 2.97-3.51% from 2005-2016. The most common specific diagnoses were periodontal disease (n = 486, prevalence 20.97%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 19.31-22.62), otitis externa (n = 234, 10.09%, 95% CI: 8.87-11.32), obesity (n = 229, 9.88%, 95% CI: 8.66-11.09), anal sac impaction (n = 187, 8.07%, 95% CI: 6.96-9.18), diarrhoea (n = 113, 4.87%, 95% CI: 4.00-5.75), and aggression (n = 93, 4.01%, 95% CI: 3.21-4.81). The prevalence of aggression was higher in males (4.95%) than in females (2.87%) (P = 0.015) and in solid-coloured (7.00%) than in bi-coloured dogs (3.66%) (P = 0.010). The median age at death was 11.44 years (IQR 9.46-13.47) and the most common grouped causes of death were neoplasia (n = 10, 9.26%, 95% CI: 3.79-14.73), mass-associated disorders (n = 9, 8.33%, 95% CI: 4.45-15.08), and collapse (n = 8, 7.41%, 95% CI: 3.80-13.94).
CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal disease, otitis externa, and obesity are identified as the most common health issues for ECS, and neoplasia and mass-associated disorders as the most common reasons for death. The prevalence of aggression was higher in males and solid-coloured dogs. The results can aid veterinarians in giving evidence-based health and breed choice information to dog owners and highlights the importance of thorough oral examination and body condition score evaluation during routine veterinary examination of ECS.","['Engdahl KS', 'Brodbelt DC', 'Cameron C', 'Church DB', 'Hedhammar Å', ""O'Neill DG""]",2023,10,1,Canine Med Genet,"Engdahl KS, et al.

37183531,Changes in antimicrobial resistance in acute otitis media and otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVES: Acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis externa (OE) are common ear infections which may warrant antibiotic therapy. For many infections, there is a rise in antimicrobial resistance, which is associated with treatment failure, morbidity, prolonged hospitalisation and mortality. This study aimed to identify longitudinal changes in microbiology and antimicrobial resistance in aural swabs taken from patients with AOM or OE.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational analysis.
SETTING: Aural samples processed at Manchester Medical Microbiology Partnership Laboratories between January 2008 and December 2018 were analysed to record organism isolated and antimicrobial sensitivity.
PARTICIPANTS: Individual aural swabs from 7200 patients.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in the incidence of organisms and antimicrobial resistance between two time periods (2008-2012 and 2013-2018) were compared using the chi-squared test (alpha = 0.05).
RESULTS: From 7200 swabs, 2879 (40%) were from children. The most frequently isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.4%), yeast (9.1%), mixed anaerobes (7.9%) and Haemophilus influenzae (6.1%). In children aged 0-4 years, H. influenzae had particularly high incidence (25%). Overall, the incidence of P. aeruginosa decreased significantly with time (p = 0.05). Isolates displaying resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents increased significantly in number in the second time period for P. aeruginosa (p = 0.04) and H. influenzae (p =  0.03). There was increased resistance to amoxicillin for P. aeruginosa (p = 0.01) and to erythromycin for H. influenzae (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Variations in type and frequency of organisms with increasing age likely result from differences in the preponderance of AOM compared to OE in children versus adults. We found increasing antimicrobial resistance for two organisms commonly isolated from AOM and OE infections, suggesting that aspects of current UK treatment practices and national recommendations may need to be revised.","['Nawaz S', 'Smith ME', 'George R', 'Dodgson K', 'Lloyd SKW']",2023,48,5,Clin Otolaryngol,"Nawaz S, et al.

37128636,Influence of extreme brachycephalic conformation on perioperative complications associated with total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy in 242 dogs (2010-2020).,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of extreme brachycephalic conformation on presenting signs, imaging findings, intraoperative and perioperative complications following total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy (TECA-LBO).
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective study.
ANIMALS: A total of 306 (n = 242 dogs) TECA-LBOs (extreme brachycephalic breeds [EBB] = 81, other breeds [OB] = 225).
METHODS: Medical records of patients undergoing TECA-LBO at a single referral institution (2010-2022) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Extreme brachycephalic breeds most commonly presented acutely, at a younger age with oto-neurological signs (46/81, 56.8%). Chronic otitis externa without neurological signs (171/225, 76.0%) was most common in OBs. Extreme brachycephalic breeds preoperatively presented more frequently with facial nerve paresis (p = .001), vestibular syndrome (p = .001), and Horner's syndrome (p = .002) compared to OBs. On diagnostic imaging, bilateral changes (p = .038), aural masses (p = .045), para-aural abscesses (p = .011), otitis interna (p = .001), and brainstem changes (p = .001) were more common in EBBs. The apparent difference in intraoperative complication rate between EBBs (9/81, 11.1%) and OBs (12/225, 5.3%) did not reach statistical significance (p = .078). Perioperative complications occurred in 85/306 (27.8%) of TECA-LBOs with no difference in perioperative complication rate between EBBs (19/81, 23.5%) and OBs (66/225, 29.3%) (p = .586).
CONCLUSION: Extreme brachycephalic breeds are more likely to present for TECA-LBO acutely, with neurological signs and more advanced diagnostic imaging abnormalities. Intra- and perioperative complication rates did not differ between EBBs and OBs.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Despite being subjectively more technically challenging, TECA-LBO did not result in more surgical complications in EBBs. Reported data are useful for effectively informing clients of the specific risks of TECA-LBO surgery.","['Banks C', 'Beever L', 'Kaye B', 'Foo M', 'Ter Haar G', 'Rutherford L']",2023,52,5,Vet Surg,"Banks C, et al.

37094768,A case of fungal otitis externa caused by coinfection of Candida auris and Aspergillus flavus.,"Fungal otitis externa is a disease encountered occasionally and is caused mostly by Aspergillus or Candida spp. We report a woman with fungal otitis externa who also had typical findings in the external auditory canal. The results of a culture showed coinfection with Candida auris and Aspergillus flavus. Identification of both species was performed by sequencing analysis of the 26S rDNA (D1/D2) and β-tubulin regions. Additionally, the newly developed CHROMagar™ Candida Plus medium was a useful tool for the easy and rapid identification of C. auris. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of fungal otitis externa caused by coinfection with C. auris and A. flavus. This case showed good susceptibility to many antifungal drugs and fortunately had a good clinical course with 1% bifonazole cream, which was applied to the fungal coinfection. Notably, C. auris is a multidrug-resistant yeast-like fungus. The increase in drug-resistant fungi and co-infections caused by these pathogens can make the diagnosis and treatment more complex and difficult. To solve these problems, performing rapid and accurate identification and susceptibility testing using chromogenic medium and molecular biological analysis would be useful.","['Ito Y', 'Inoue N', 'Kaneko N', 'Otsuka M', 'Yamasaki S', 'Yoshikawa M']",2023,29,8,J Infect Chemother,"Ito Y, et al.

37090887,Cranial nerve palsy prevalence and associated factors in patients with malignant otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of cranial nerve (CN) palsy and its associated factors in malignant otitis externa (MOE).
METHODS: In a retrospective study, records of MOE patients from 2011 to 2014 were reviewed. MOE and CN involvement were evaluated based on patient demographics, clinical, and paraclinical data.
RESULTS: Overall, 119 MOE patients with a mean age of 65.9 ± 11.3 were included. 69.7% were male, and 63.0% had a history of diabetes. The most common symptoms and signs were otalgia (97.5%), otorrhea (44.5%), and ear canal erythema/edema (24.4%). Thirty-three patients (27.7%) had CN involvement. The facial nerve was mostly involved (26.1%). Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) was present in 59 patients. When excluding patients younger than 30 and older than 80, age decade was correlated with CN palsy. 66.9% of patients with CN palsy and 65.6% without CN palsy were male, which was significantly different. The following factors were not significantly different between patients with and without CN palsy: Comorbidities, signs and symptoms, diagnostic delay, erythrocyte sedimentation rate level, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c level, antifungal therapy, hospitalization duration, and SBO on imaging. Tinnitus was correlated with SBO evidence on imaging (specificity: 96.7%).
CONCLUSION: CN involvement occurs in about three out of 10 MOE patients. Male gender and advanced age may be related to a higher incidence rate of CN palsy. Tinnitus can be a specific indicator of SBO. These findings could help in better decision-making for early interventions.

37088888,Comparison of the quantity and antimicrobial activity of host defence peptides in ear canals between healthy and atopic dogs: A preliminary study.,"BACKGROUND: Host defence peptides (HDPs) are involved in cutaneous immune defence. The secretion of HDPs in the ears of healthy normal and noninfected atopic dogs has not been measured.
HYPOTHESES/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantify the concentrations of β-defensins (cBD3)-like and cathelicidin (cCath) HDPs in ears of healthy and atopic dogs without infectious otitis, additionally to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of the HDPs obtained.
ANIMALS: Ten healthy and 20 atopic dogs with mild inflammatory, noninfectious otitis were included.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Absence of infection was determined by cytological evaluation, and the severity of clinical signs, if present, was assessed by a previously validated score (Otitis Externa Scoring System for Clinical Study, OTIS-3). The left ear canal of each dog was rinsed with 2 mL of sodium phosphate buffer. The solution obtained was analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantify HDPs. Additionally, aural secretions were incubated with two concentrations (5 × 10
RESULTS: There was a significantly lower concentration of HDPs from atopic ears when compared with those from normal healthy dogs (cBD3-like: p = 0.0007; cCath: p = 0.049). There was minimal to variable antimicrobial activity in the aural secretions of both groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study showed, for the first time, that the ear canals of atopic dogs with mild noninfectious otitis contain a lower concentration of cBD3-like and cCath HDPs than those of healthy dogs with normal ears.

37026784,Cytotoxicity of Tetracyclines in Human Tympanic Membrane Fibroblasts.,"HYPOTHESIS: Tetracyclines are less cytotoxic to tympanic membrane (TM) fibroblasts than quinolones.
BACKGROUND: Use of quinolone ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement and for acute otitis externa has been linked to an increased risk of TM perforation. This has been verified in animal models. Cell culture studies have shown quinolones to be highly toxic to TM fibroblasts. Tetracyclines are a potential alternative to quinolones as they have been used to treat acute otitis externa and are thought to be nontoxic to the inner ear. We aimed to determine if tetracyclines are cytotoxic to TM fibroblasts.
METHODS: Human TM fibroblasts were treated with 1:10 dilutions of ofloxacin 0.3%, ciprofloxacin 0.3%, doxycycline 0.3 and 0.5%, minocycline 0.3 and 0.5%, tetracycline 0.3 and 0.5%, or dilute HCl (control), twice within 24 hours or four times within 48 hours. After 2 hours of treatment, cells were returned to growth media. Cells were observed with phase-contrast microscopy until cytotoxicity was measured.
RESULTS: Fibroblasts had lower survival with ciprofloxacin 0.3% and doxycycline 0.5% treatment compared with the control after 24 and 48 hours (all p < 0.0001). Fibroblasts treated with minocycline 0.5% had increased cell survival after 24 hours. Minocycline 0.3 and 0.5% showed increased TM fibroblast survival after 48 hours (all p < 0.0001). Phase-contrast images mirrored the cytotoxicity findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Tetracyclines are less toxic to cultured TM fibroblasts than ciprofloxacin. Fibroblast tetracycline toxicity is drug and dose specific.

37019436,Managing recurrent otitis externa in dogs: what have we learned and what can we do better?,"Recurrent otitis externa is a common problem in dogs. Topical treatment for each flare is successful in the short term, but repeated cycles of inflammation and infection lead to chronic inflammatory changes, pain and aversion, and antimicrobial resistance. These make the flares more frequent and harder to control. Eventually, the changes become irreversible and require a total ear canal ablation/lateral bulla osteotomy or ablative laser surgery. Most ear canal surgery is avoidable if recurrent otitis is properly managed at an earlier stage. This requires a different mindset and approach to these cases, taking advantage of recent research and clinical findings. Most importantly, clinicians must appreciate that all recurrent ear infections in dogs are secondary. To achieve a good long-term outcome, it is essential that all the underlying factors in each case are diagnosed and managed using the primary, secondary, predisposing, and perpetuating framework. This means that the primary condition must be diagnosed and managed, the secondary infection treated, predisposing risks identified and corrected, and the perpetuating factors reversed. Treatment is in 2 phases: induction to get the ears in remission and then long-term maintenance therapy to prevent relapses. Treatment should be appropriate to each dog but will typically involve ear cleaning, topical antimicrobial therapy, and topical or systemic glucocorticoids. Novel treatments for infection and inflammation will offer additional options in the future. Understanding the triggers for recurrent otitis in dogs will help clinicians plan effective management regimens that will make a huge difference to the quality of life of their patients and their owners.",['Nuttall T'],2023,261,S1,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Nuttall T.

37005355,Fungal infections in Algeria.,"INTRODUCTION: Invasive and superficial fungal infections are increasingly reported in Algeria, testifying to the increase in their frequency in parallel with the increase in risk factors and the availability of diagnostic means, at least in university hospitals (CHU). The latter, located in the major northern cities, are equipped with high-performance diagnostic tools compared to hospitals in the interior of the country.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of published and grey literature was undertaken. Prevalence and incidence of discrete fungal diseases were estimated using a deterministic modelling approach based on populations at risk. Population (2021) and major underlying disease risk groups were obtained from UNAIDS, WHO Tuberculosis and the international transplant registries as well as published data for asthma and COPD. The health service profile was summarised from national documentation.
RESULTS: Among the 43.6 million, including 12.9 million children, living in Algeria, the most prevalent fungal diseases are tinea capitis (>1.5 million), recurrent vaginal candidiasis (>500,000) and allergic fungal lung and sinus disorders (>110,000) and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (>10,000). Life-threatening invasive fungal infection incidence includes 774 Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS, 361 cryptococcal meningitis, 2272 candidaemia and 2639 invasive aspergillosis cases. Fungal keratitis probably affects >6000 eyes each year.
CONCLUSIONS: Fungal infections are underestimated in Algeria because they are sought in patients with risk factors only after bacterial infections when they should be sought in parallel. The diagnosis is only accessible in hospitals in large cities and the work carried out in mycology is rarely published, making the estimation of the burden of these conditions difficult.","['Aissat FZ', 'Denning DW']",2023,66,7,Mycoses,Aissat FZ and Denning DW.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa and diabetes mellitus are factors commonly involved in the pathogenesis of MEO. Although its treatment has changed considerably during the last decades, morbidity and mortality of the disease remain high. Our aim was to review basic aspects of MEO, a disease unknown until 1968, which attracts great interest among Ears, Nose and Throat (ENT), diabetes and infectious diseases specialists.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this narrative review we mainly include relevant papers written in English or with an English abstract. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar, using the keywords malignant external otitis, malignant otitis externa, necrotizing external otitis, skull base osteomyelitis, diabetes mellitus and surgery up to July 2022. Some of the most recent articles, with specific references to earlier articles and a book reference regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of MEO and its relationship to diabetes mellitus, were included.
CONCLUSION: MEO is not an uncommon disease and is principally treated by ENT surgeons. Nevertheless, diabetes specialists should be aware of the disease presentation and management, since they will often encounter patients with undiagnosed MEO or will need to manage glucose levels in patients hospitalized with the disease.","['Tsilivigkos C', 'Avramidis K', 'Ferekidis E', 'Doupis J']",2023,14,4,Diabetes Ther,"Tsilivigkos C, et al.

36879281,"Into the large ears: otitis externa associated with nematodes, mites, and bacteria in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus).","BACKGROUND: The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), which is an endangered species, harbors several parasites. Among the ectoparasites that it harbors, ear mites of the genus Loxanoetus have the potential to cause external otitis, an inflammation that may also be associated with the presence of other microorganisms. We assessed the relationships between ear mites, nematodes, yeast, bacterial rods, and cocci sampled from the ears of captive Asian elephants in Thailand. In addition, we discuss the possibility that dust-bathing behavior may be triggered by ear mite infestation, and that this in turn may lead to contamination of the ears with soil microorganisms.
METHODS: Legally owned captive Asian elephants (n = 64) were sampled. Ear swabs were individually collected from both ears and microscopically examined for the presence of mites, nematodes, yeast, bacterial rods, cocci, and host cells. Mites and nematodes were identified to species level using morphological and molecular methods.
RESULTS: Loxanoetus lenae mites were present in 43.8% (n = 28/64) of the animals (19 animals with mites in one ear and nine animals with mites in both ears). Nematodes of the genus Panagrolaimus were detected in 23.4% (n = 15/64) of the animals (10 with nematodes in one ear and five with nematodes in both ears). In adult elephants (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0278) and female elephants (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0107), the presence of nematodes in both ears was significantly associated with the presence of mites. In addition, higher categorical burdens of nematodes were also significantly associated with the presence of mites (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0234) and epithelial cells (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0108), and marginally significantly associated with bacterial cocci (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0499).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of L. lenae mites in the ear canals of the Asian elephants was significantly associated with the occurrence of other microorganisms, such as soil nematodes, bacteria and yeasts. The presence of mites in their ears may increase the dust-bathing behavior of elephants which, if confirmed, represents a further paradigmatic example of a parasitic infestation affecting animal behavior.","['Bezerra-Santos MA', 'Mendoza-Roldan JA', 'DiGeronimo PM', 'Ward E', 'Noden B', 'De Luca F', 'Fanelli E', 'Valenzano D', 'Lia RP', 'Otranto D']",2023,16,1,Parasit Vectors,"Bezerra-Santos MA, et al.

36820154,Long-term complications of the transmeatal approach (Open Transcanal) in cochlear implants: A follow-up study.,"OBJECTIVE: Multiple alternative approaches of cochlear implant surgery have been described, such as the suprameatal approach, transcanal approach, transmeatal approach and middle cranial fossa approach. Transmeatal (open trnascanal) approach has not been adapted since first described in the clinical field. we aimed to assess the long-term complications of the transmeatal approach in a series of 131 patients at our center between 2004 and 2008.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective case series of all patients who underwent cochlear implants with the transmeatal (open transcanal) approach from May 2004 to December 2008 at King Faisal Specialist and Research Hospital (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia), which were conducted by the same surgeon.
RESULTS: Complications were observed often with various combinations-recurrent otitis externa, posterior tympanic membrane perforation, electrode extrusion, cholesteatoma, and chronic mastoiditis. The overall long-term complication rate was 16% (21/131). The gap between the implantation and the diagnosis of a complication ranged from <1 year to 11 years. Major complications were as follows: cholesteatoma in 5 (3.8%) patients, extrusion of the electrode in 5 (3.8%) patients, and tympanic membrane perforation or deep retractions in 5 (3.8%) patients. Minor complications were as follows: recurrent mastoiditis with/without concomitant temporary facial nerve palsy in 4 (3%) patients, recurrent otitis externa infections in 7 (5%) patients, and weakness of the posterior canal wall in 1 patient.
CONCLUSION: The transmeatal approach posed an high rate of complications on long-term follow-up such as cholestetoma formation, extrusion of electrode or perielectrode reaction formation to tympanic membrane and external auditory canal.","['Almofada HS', 'Almutairi NK', 'Timms MS']",2023,18,1,J Otol,"Almofada HS, et al.

36791445,Acute Otitis Externa: Rapid Evidence Review.,"Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.","['Jackson EA', 'Geer K']",2023,107,2,Am Fam Physician,Jackson EA and Geer K.

36759841,Physicochemical properties of otic products for Canine Otitis Externa: comparative analysis of marketed products.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is a commonly diagnosed dermatological disorder in canines. The pathogens primarily involved in canine otitis externa (COE) include Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Malassezia pachydermatis. As COE tends to be superficial, medications delivered topically are often effective and practical in managing the condition. As such, there is a wide variety of approved topical products currently available in the market. The efficacy of topical dosage forms can be dependent on various factors such as the pharmacology of active constituents and the physicochemical properties of the formulation, including pH, viscosity, spreadability, and bio-adhesion. Currently, there is a lack of published literature available on the optimal properties of topical COE products. In this study, we compared the physicochemical properties of nine commercially available otic veterinarian products in Australia used clinically to manage COE.
RESULTS: Based on our comparative analysis, the pH (6.26 ± 0.04) of an aqueous-based product was similar to a healthy dog's external auditory canal. Products containing polymers exhibited higher viscosity and bio-adhesion. Spreadability was inversely related to viscosity and Osurnia ® a product with high viscosity demonstrated the lowest spreadability. Aqueous-based otic products showed better syringebility whereas oil-based systems required higher force to expel the products. Variability in droplet size was noted. Derm Otic, Baytril Otic, and Aurizon Ear Drops had the lower standard deviation which indicates they would give a more consistent dose.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this work provide considerations for industry researchers or formulation scientists working in the area of otic dosage formulations.","['Song Y', 'Abdella S', 'Afinjuomo F', 'Weir EJ', 'Tan JQE', 'Hill P', 'Page SW', 'Garg S']",2023,19,1,BMC Vet Res,"Song Y, et al.

36759416,Systematic review of the diagnosis and management of necrotising otitis externa: Highlighting the need for high-quality research.,"OBJECTIVES: To present a systematic review and critical analysis of clinical studies for necrotising otitis externa (NOE), with the aim of informing best practice for diagnosis and management.
DESIGN: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched from database inception until 30 April 2021 for all clinical articles on NOE. The review was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020128957) and conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS: Seventy articles, including 2274 patients were included in the final synthesis. Seventy-three percent were retrospective case series; the remainder were of low methodological quality. Case definitions varied widely. Median patient age was 69.2 years; 68% were male, 84% had diabetes and 10% had no reported immunosuppressive risk factor. Otalgia was almost universal (96%), with granulation (69%) and oedema (76%) the commonest signs reported. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 62%, but a range of bacterial and fungal pathogens were reported and 14% grew no organism. Optimal imaging modality for diagnosis or follow-up was unclear. Median antimicrobial therapy duration was 7.2 weeks, with no definitive evidence for optimal regimens. Twenty-one percent had surgery with widely variable timing, indication, or procedure. One-year disease-specific mortality was 2%; treatment failure and relapse rates were 22% and 7%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: There is a lack of robust, high-quality data to support best practice for diagnosis and management for this neglected condition. A minimum set of reporting requirements is proposed for future studies. A consensus case definition is urgently needed to facilitate high-quality research.","['Takata J', 'Hopkins M', 'Alexander V', 'Bannister O', 'Dalton L', 'Harrison L', 'Groves E', 'Kanona H', 'Jones GL', 'Mohammed H', 'Andersson MI', 'Hodgson SH']",2023,48,3,Clin Otolaryngol,"Takata J, et al.

36756788,Perioperative complications and outcomes following partial ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy in pet rabbits: 20 cases (2009-2021).,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perioperative complications and outcomes of rabbits undergoing partial ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy for treatment of chronic otitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical logbooks were searched to identify rabbits that underwent partial ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy between December 2009 and September 2021. Data collected included signalment, history, clinical signs, historical and current medical management, physical examination findings, preoperative diagnostic imaging and aural bacterial culture results, surgical procedure information, duration of hospitalisation, complications and final outcome.
RESULTS: Twenty rabbits with chronic, medically unresponsive otitis underwent 27 partial ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomies. Ten rabbits had pre-existing neurologic deficits and 17 had an ear base abscess at the time of surgery. A total of 13 (65%) rabbits developed at least one complication, either in the perioperative period or between discharge and recheck. Three of these rabbits (15%) underwent revision surgery for persistent or recurrent ear base abscess. Complete resolution of clinical signs ultimately occurred in 12 (60%) rabbits. Three (15%) rabbits showed improved but not completely resolved clinical signs (three facial asymmetry). Five (25%) rabbits died of causes potentially related to chronic otitis and/or partial ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy; two of these rabbits had undergone revision surgery.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although this study reports a high complication rate (65%), most complications resolved, with 15 (75%) rabbits having a good to excellent final outcome. Since the majority of rabbits in this study had chronic and severe ear disease, further studies are required to determine if surgical intervention earlier in the disease process could result in a lower complication rate.","['Dobberstein REA', 'Brisson BA', 'McMillan S', 'Oblak ML', 'Singh A', 'Dutton CJ', 'Zhang M']",2023,64,5,J Small Anim Pract,"Dobberstein REA, et al.

RESULTS: There were 10 patients in antibiotic-steroid pack group and 10 patients in glycerine group. There was female predominance in both the treatment groups and disease was most common in age group 12-20 years. There was no statistical significant decrease in pain and oedema in both the groups. But early reduction in sign and symptoms was noted in antibiotic-steroid group than glycerine group.
CONCLUSIONS: Since the control of pain and edema is more and hence the number of visits is less in steroid-antibiotic packing group, so it is worthwhile to use steroid-antibiotic than glycerine pack.","['Kabadar P', 'Doddamani SS', 'Mathri A']",2022,74,Suppl 3,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Kabadar P, et al.

OME has been reported in a brachycephalic breed (boxer), and the same condition is described as primary secretory OM in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. These dogs can be asymptomatic or present with pain, facial nerve paralysis and reduced hearing. This report describes two cases of OME with associated neurologic signs in Boston terriers with no previous history of OE, normal external ear canals and tympanic membranes. Neurologic evaluation revealed right head tilt along with vestibular ataxia and frequent walking tight circles to the right in case 1, and a dull mentation with a right-sided head tilt and torticollis, vestibular tetra-ataxia, ambulatory tetraparesis and circling to the right in case 2. MRI imaging of the brain was performed. Results showed bilateral OM with right-sided otitis interna and equivocal associated otogenic meningitis in case 1 and right-sided OM in case 2. Myringotomy was performed, and both dogs' ME sampled for cytology that only revealed inflammatory cells; and bacterial cultures which revealed a light growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in case 1. ME were flushed with sterile saline. Oral glucocorticoids and antibiotics based on the susceptibility results, and a compound antibiotic and glucocorticoid ear solution were prescribed to case 1. Neurologic improvement was observed a few days after the appointment, but a mild right-sided head tilt remained evident. Owner of case two elected humane euthanasia due to patient respiratory difficulties upon anaesthetic recovery and other concurrent healthy concerns. Current findings reinforce that brachycephalic dogs may be prone to develop OME, and advanced imaging tests are key to the diagnosis.","['Souza CP', 'Foss KD', 'Mascarenhas MB', 'Clegg JL']",2023,9,3,Vet Med Sci,"Souza CP, et al.

It was estimated that each year in the United States, 31 pathogens caused 37.2 million illnesses, with 36.4 million domestically acquired. Of those, 9.4 million were foodborne: 59% were caused by viruses, 39% by bacteria, and 2% by parasites. The pathogens that caused the most foodborne illnesses were norovirus (58%), nontyphoidal Salmonella species (11%), Clostridium perfringens (10%), and Campylobacter species (9%). Unspecified agents caused an estimated 38.4 million episodes of domestically acquired foodborne gastroenteritis, 258,033 hospitalizations, and 3,574 deaths. The estimate for illnesses caused by waterborne transmission was 7.15 million. The diseases that caused the greatest number were otitis externa (n = 4.67 million), norovirus (n = 1.33 million), giardiasis (n = 415,000), and cryptosporidiosis (n = 322,000). An important aspect of management and prevention is health-care provider reporting of foodborne and waterborne illnesses. Health-care provider reporting of reportable diseases has been inconsistent, infrequent, and delayed. Education efforts concerning reporting need to be enhanced, and physicians should report suspected cases before laboratory confirmation to enhance the timeliness of outbreak investigation and possibly prevent subsequent cases.",['Wittler RR'],2023,44,2,Pediatr Rev,Wittler RR.

36669031,"In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Thymus vulgaris, Origanum vulgare, Satureja montana and Their Mixture against Clinical Isolates Responsible for Canine Otitis Externa.","Otitis externa is a frequent inflammation among dogs, mainly caused by bacteria and yeasts that are often resistant to conventional drugs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of commercial essential oils (EOs) from Origanum vulgare, Satureja montana, and Thymus vulgaris, as well as a mixture of these three components, against 47 clinical bacterial strains (Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens) and 5 Malassezia pachydermatis strains, previously cultured from the ears of dogs affected by otitis externa. The tested Gram-positive bacteria were sensible to the analysed EOs with MICs ranging from 1.25% (v/v) to <0.0195% (v/v); Gram-negative isolates, mainly P. aeruginosa, were less sensitive with MICs from >10% (v/v) to 0.039% (v/v). M. pachydermatis isolates were sensitive to all EOs with MICs from 4.25% (v/v) to 2% (v/v). However, the mixture was active against all bacterial (except one P. aeruginosa strain) and fungal tested isolates. The three EOs and their mixture seem to be an interesting alternative for treating canine otitis externa when conventional antimicrobials are not active.","['Ebani VV', 'Pieracci Y', 'Cagnoli G', 'Bertelloni F', 'Munafò C', 'Nardoni S', 'Pistelli L', 'Mancianti F']",2023,10,1,Vet Sci,"Ebani VV, et al.

The article discusses the anatomical and physiological features of the structure of the outer ear, the epidemiology of otitis externa. Acute inflammation is characterized by the presence of significant microflora, and most often it is preceded by the impact of various physical factors. With chronic inflammation, more changes from the skin are recorded, while the microflora is not always isolated. The authors consider the problem of chronic inflammation of the outer ear. They provide their own data on the etiology of inflammation. Particular attention is paid to local treatment, including their own experience of using the combined drug Candiderm. As a result of the treatment, the skin changes of the external auditory canal were completely resolved in all patients by day 28, the itching in the ears completely stopped after 10-14 days of therapy.

36566413,Necrotising Otitis Externa: An Overview Of Imaging Modalities.,"Necrotising Otitis Externa (NOE) has often posed some challenges in view of diagnosis and management by clinicians. One such challenge is the appropriate and timely use of imaging techniques, since its use is critical not only in diagnosis but also determining the extent and resolution of the disease. Hence, doctors in both primary and secondary health care need to be familiar with presenting symptoms, while specialists need to be appraised of advances in imagining techniques in management of NOE. Whilst there is a general consensus amongst clinicians on some aspects of management of NOE, there is very limited consensus on the use of imaging modalities. There is no single modality of imaging that can provide a complete picture of diagnosis, disease progression and resolution. There are some advantages and limitation of each methodology, which indicate that a multi-modal imaging technique at particular stages of the disease may provide better management outcomes. However, further research in this area is required, as there is not yet an established 'gold standard' for imaging in NOE.",['Khan H'],2022,34,4,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,Khan H.

The aim of this work was to explore the role of epidermal compromise in the aetiology of necrotising otitis externa.
METHOD: A structured risk factor history was taken from 54 patients diagnosed with necrotising otitis externa between 2017 and 2022. Primary care records were also reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 94 per cent of patients reported incidents of potential epidermal compromise preceding severe pain onset, including a 35 per cent incidence of ear syringing. A total of 94 per cent of patients were immunosuppressed, including 78 per cent with diabetes. All patients had medical co-morbidities.
CONCLUSION: This study proposed an aetiological triad for necrotising otitis externa: immunosuppression, infection and epidermal compromise. Epidermal compromise is a potentially modifiable risk factor for necrotising otitis externa. Meticulous primary ear care for older adult, diabetic and immunosuppressed patients is recommended. These populations should never undergo ear syringing and should avoid ear canal trauma and prolonged exposure to moisture.","['Bisbinas V', 'Stapleton E']",2023,137,7,J Laryngol Otol,"Bisbinas V and Stapleton E.

36528642,Management and long-term comorbidities of patients with necrotizing otitis externa.,"PURPOSE: We aimed to present the management of the patients with necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) and its comorbidities in early and long-term follow-up.
METHODS: Between 2011 and 2022, 30 patients with the diagnose of NEO, who had cortical bone erosion or trabecular demineralization in temporal bone computed tomography and administered at least 6-week antimicrobial therapy were included in the study. Clinical, laboratory and imaging findings of patients, and comorbidities during follow-up were analysed. NOE extending further from the petro-occipital fissure on magnetic resonance imaging was accepted as medial skull base (MSB) involvement.
RESULTS: 30 patients, (8 women, 22 men, mean age 66.2 ± 1.7), with NOE were followed 36.4 ± 29.6 months. The mortality rate was 23.33% and the mean survival time was 12.37 ± 11.35 months. Repeated cultures reveal a new or second pathogen in 5 patients (20%). Severe and profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) were observed in 4 and 12 patients, respectively. Labyrinthitis ossificans emerged in 3 of 6 surviving patients with profound SNHL during follow-up. Chronic disease anemia (CDA) (66.66%), cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (43.33%), chronic renal failure (CRF) (30%), and retinopathy (26.66%) were the most frequent comorbidities in patients with NOE. Cranial nerve paralysis (CNP) (P < 0.001), SNHL (P < 0.04), CDA (P < 0.005), and mortality (P < 0.022) were significantly associated with the presence of MSB involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: NOE is a disease that requires long-term follow-up, causes severe morbidity, and has a high mortality rate. MSB involvement is associated with CNP, SNHL and labyrinthitis ossificans.

A 70-year-old male complained of fever and severe otorrhea from left external auditory canal 2 months after undergoing a craniotomy to remove a hematoma. He had right-sided paralysis and undertook bed rest. Brain computed tomography revealed continuous fluid accumulation in the left mastoid air cells and middle ear from left external auditory canal in addition to leukocytosis and increased C-reactive protein level. The tympanic membrane was severely swelling. These results indicated the presence of otitis media and mastoiditis. Otorrhea culture showed large amounts of M. slooffiae. The administration of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB), the irrigation of external auditory canal with normal saline, and the application of topical ketoconazole ointment were started. The administration of L-AMB for 8 weeks and voriconazole, which was switched from L-AMB, for 4 weeks ameliorated his infection and he was transferred to another hospital to receive rehabilitation. From these results and his clinical course, the diagnosis of otitis externa caused by Malassezia slooffiae complicated with mastoiditis was made. And the possibility of the contamination by M. slooffiae was very low.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate hypochlorous acid as an ear flushing and antimicrobial agent in dogs with chronic OE.
ANIMALS: Twenty dogs with chronic OE caused by the same organisms bilaterally.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One ear was flushed under anaesthesia with hypochlorous acid, the other with saline solution. Subsequently, the ear flushed with hypochlorous acid was cleaned with the same solution twice daily for 2 weeks, the other ear with a commercial ear cleaner. An ear medication containing miconazole, polymyxin B and prednisolone was used once daily in both ears. Clinical scores were determined before the flush. Ear cytological results were obtained, a hearing test was conducted before and after the ear flush, and a culture was taken directly after flushing. Ears were evaluated after 2 weeks of therapy.
RESULTS: Yeast was present in the ears of 11, cocci in one and a mixed infection in eight dogs. Five ears were negative on culture after flushing with hypochlorous acid, one after the saline flush. Clinical and cytological scores decreased significantly with both solutions after 2 weeks of treatment. There was no difference between treatments in any of the scores at any time point between treatments and in the results of the hearing test before and after the flushing procedure. Adverse effects were not seen.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective and prospective medical records analysis.
METHODS: The medical records of all patients who presented to a referral medical center during 2015-2022 and initially diagnosed with SBOM. Radiological assessment of each sub-site was performed by 2 qualified neuro-radiologist, who were blind to the clinical data.
RESULTS: 33 patients were enrolled. All patients suffered edema and exudates of the external auditory canal (EAC). The most common osseous markers for SBOM were dehiscence or irregularity of the anterior EAC wall and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) medial wall (21/33, 64% patients, each), followed by a fistula from the TMJ to the EAC (20/33, 61% patients). Eustachian tube bony walls and condylar irregularity and/or dehiscence were as prevalent as 16/33, 48% of patients, each. EAC inferior and posterior walls of the EACs were irregular or dehiscent in patients with more advanced disease.

METHODS: This was a multicentre retrospective study carried out over an 8-year period. Cats diagnosed with OMI, with or without a nasopharyngeal polyp, leading to peripheral vestibular signs were included. Only cats for which MRI with postcontrast T1-weighted sequences and CSF analyses available were included. Cats with intra-axial MRI lesions or empyema were excluded.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight cats met the inclusion criteria. MgE was reported in 26/58 cases, of which nine had an abnormal CSF result (increased total nucleated cell count [TNCC] or total protein); 32/58 cases had no MgE, of which 10 showed abnormal CSF results.

We report the case of a necrotizing otitis externa, treated with antibiotics, which was complicated a few months later by spinal compression.
OBSERVATION: This is the case of a 60-year-old patient, diabetic, who presented a painful otorrhea associated to left facial palsy.The diagnosis of necrotizing otitis externa was retained after performing a CT scan of the temporal bone.6 months after medical treatment, the patient became has been complicated by tetraparesis with respiratory distress.
DISCUSSION: Necrotizing otitis externa is an osteitis of the base of the skull, which occurs in the diabetic patient and which starts in the external ear and spreads by contiguity after infection of the temporal bone.It represented clinically by otalgia and purulent otorrhea.The role of imaging is to confirm the involvement and to specify the extension of the lesions. CT scan is useful to evaluate the bone involvement. MRI is the examination of choice for the study of soft tissues and is essential in advanced forms.Its treatment is based on antibiotic therapy for a minimum of 6 weeks.
CONCLUSION: OEM is an infection occurring in elderly and diabetic patients. Imaging allows to confirm the diagnosis and to carry out the assessment of extension; but also has a great interest in the follow-up of these immunocompromised patients who are subject to complications with insidious evolution.","['Eddine HS', 'Gourram K', 'Merzem A', 'Moussali N', 'Benna N', 'Bouzoubaa Y', 'Douimi L', 'Rouadi S', 'Abada R', 'Mahtar M']",2022,83,,Ann Med Surg (Lond),"Eddine HS, et al.

PROCEDURES: Online survey and word-of-mouth recruitment were conducted to identify dogs that developed clinical signs of nKCS after application of otitis externa medication containing terbinafine and florfenicol. A retrospective analysis of medical records of dogs meeting inclusion criteria was then conducted. Included dogs had onset of clinical signs of nKCS within 1 day after application of otitis externa medications containing terbinafine and florfenicol and had documentation of low Schirmer tear test value (< 15 mm/min) of affected eyes.
RESULTS: 29 dogs with medical records available for review met the inclusion criteria. Documented return of clinically normal tear production was identified in 24 of 29 dogs, with a median time from application of ear medication to documented return of clinically normal tear production of 86 days (range, 19 to 482 days). A corneal ulcer was diagnosed in 68% (20/29). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed being referred to an ophthalmologist (P = .03) and having a deep ulcer (P = .02) were associated with a longer time to documentation of Schirmer tear test ≥ 15 mm/min.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dogs that developed nKCS within 1 day after application of otitis externa medications containing terbinafine and florfenicol had a good prognosis for return of normal tear production within 1 year.","['Bercovitz GR', 'Gaerig AM', 'Conway ED', 'Huey JA', 'Telle MR', 'Stavinohova R', 'Cherubini GB', 'Capasso A', 'Myrna KE']",2022,261,1,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Bercovitz GR, et al.

36337257,Warm-season temperatures and emergency department visits among children with health insurance.,"High ambient temperatures have become more likely due to climate change and are linked to higher rates of heat-related illness, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, mental health disorders, and other diseases. To date, far fewer studies have examined the effects of high temperatures on children versus adults, and studies including children have seldom been conducted on a national scale. Compared to adults, children have behavioral and physiological differences that may give them differential heat vulnerability. We acquired medical claims data from a large database of commercially insured US children aged 0-17 from May to September (warm-season) 2016-2019. Daily maximum ambient temperature and daily mean relative humidity estimates were aggregated to the county level using the Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes dataset, and extreme heat was defined as the 95th percentile of the county-specific daily maximum temperature distribution. Using a case-crossover design and temperature lags 0-5 days, we estimated the associations between extreme heat and cause-specific emergency department visits (ED) in children aged <18 years, using the median county-specific daily maximum temperature distribution as the reference. Approximately 1.2 million ED visits in children from 2489 US counties were available during the study period. The 95th percentile of warm-season temperatures ranged from 71 °F to 112 °F (21.7 °C to 44.4 °C). Comparing 95th to the 50th percentile, extreme heat was associated with higher rates of ED visits for heat-related illness; endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases; and otitis media and externa, but not for all-cause admissions. Subgroup analyses suggested differences by age, with extreme heat positively associated with heat-related illness for both the 6-12 year (odds ratio [OR]: 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16, 1.56) and 13-17 year age groups (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.76). Among children with health insurance across the US, days of extreme heat were associated with higher rates of healthcare utilization. These results highlight the importance of individual and population-level actions to protect children and adolescents from extreme heat, particularly in the context of continued climate change.","['Stowell JD', 'Sun Y', 'Spangler KR', 'Milando CW', 'Bernstein A', 'Weinberger KR', 'Sun S', 'Wellenius GA']",2023,1,1,Environ Res Health,"Stowell JD, et al.

36334551,Uncommon disease with unusual presentation: A case report of acute necrotizing otitis media.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute necrotizing otitis media (ANOM) is defined as a severe middle ear infection that results in tympanic membrane necrosis. Commonly caused by bacteria infection. It is a rare entity of otitis media, with unknown prevalence. Usually seen in immunocompromised patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case report of a 79-year-old diabetic male, who presented to the otolaryngology clinic with history of intermittent worsening nocturnal left ear pain. The clinical presentation was suggesting necrotizing otitis externa despite lacking the classical picture of external ear canal edema and granulation, in the presence of a dull bulging tympanic membrane. Then the patient developed hearing loss, along with ear discharge, high inflammatory markers, and significant imaging findings. This case represents an unusual presentation of ANOM. The patient responded well to aggressive medical treatment, along with grommet insertion.
CONCLUSION: Despite the development of antibiotics, ANOM is still possible, especially in high-risk patient. A high index of suspicion, along with detailed history, physical examination, and supportive imaging are needed, to diagnose ANOM. Aggressive treatment with antibiotics should be started immediately, guided by the culture results, to improve the prognosis and prevent further complications.","['Naqi R', 'Ahmed AK', 'Alrayyes HY']",2022,100,,Int J Surg Case Rep,"Naqi R, et al.

36319942,Detection of the international lineage ST71 of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in two cities in Rio de Janeiro State.,"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is the main coagulase-positive staphylococci associated with canine skin/soft tissue infections (SSTI), otitis externa, and surgical site infections. The international spread of an epidemic and multiresistant lineage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP), the so-called European clone-displaying sequence type (ST) 71-requires attention. The first isolation of an MRSP ST71 isolate in South America was reported in Rio de Janeiro city, in 2010; however, a limited number of canine isolates were analyzed. Thus, to have a better panel of the MRSP spread in this city, we were stimulated to continue this study and search for the presence of MRSP in 282 colonized or infected dogs in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Among the MRSP isolates collected (N = 17; 6.1%), the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns were similar to those of European clone. All 17 isolates were classified as ST71 by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). In order to assess whether isolates of MRSP ST71 may have also spread to the Rio de Janeiro state countryside, we collected samples from 124 infected dogs in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes (232 km away from Rio de Janeiro city). Our data showed the presence of ST71 lineage in one isolate among three MRSP detected. S. pseudintermedius was isolated from 40.6% of the clinical samples (N = 165/406). A relatively high incidence of methicillin resistance, detected by a PCR-based method, was found in 12.1% of the S. pseudintermedius recovered from animals (N = 20/165). The resistance profile of these isolates was similar to that described for the international ST71 strains whose genomes are publicly available in the GenBank. The prospect of ST71 isolates being resistant to virtually all antimicrobials used in veterinary medicine is alarming and should be considered a central issue considering that MRSP ST71 spreads over large geographic distances and its transmission from animals to humans.","['Penna B', 'Silva MB', 'Botelho AMN', 'Ferreira FA', 'Ramundo MS', 'Silva-Carvalho MC', 'Rabello RF', 'Vieira-da-Motta O', 'Figueiredo AMS']",2022,53,4,Braz J Microbiol,"Penna B, et al.

The most prevalent treatment for otitis externa is ear drops, but it is difficult to adhere properly to this treatment, causing poor patient compliance and the potential for complications. As a result, we have developed a tetraethyl orthosilicate-based hydrogel for use as single application treatment for otitis externa to increase ease of use and improve patient outcomes. Herein, we investigated the manufacturability of the hydrogel, focusing on several key aspects: formulation repeatability and reproducibility, material source and tolerances, release of a variety of model drugs, and impact of application-specific physiological factors, specifically local pH and enzymatic activity on drug release. Overall, our results indicate that these hydrogels are well suited for production and scalability, as they have a robust manufacturing process, have a wide tolerance for pH level, release a variety of model drugs, and are not impacted by outer ear canal-specific physiological factors.","['Barrett-Catton E', 'Arrigali EM', 'Serban BA', 'Sandau KC', 'Serban MA']",2022,14,10,Pharmaceutics,"Barrett-Catton E, et al.

Benefit from non-surgical management has not been reported, despite this being the outcome of most otolaryngology and audiology consultations.
DESIGN: GBI responses from 4543 adults from the Scottish ENT Outcome Study were categorised by diagnosis. Benefit scores for different interventions within diagnostic categories for which surgery was not a potential management are reported using the revised 5-factor Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI-5F; 15 questions and 5 factors).
SETTING: Adult otolaryngology outpatient clinics in six university hospitals.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults seen with conditions that had no surgical option and given non-surgical management.
RESULTS: Overall, 80% of participants managed in Scottish Ear Nose and Throat Outcome Study (SENTOS) did not have surgery. A total of 1373 (30%) participants with various diagnoses were given reassurance and advice with no active intervention. There was no change in their GBI-5F total or factor scores, suggesting that they did not come to harm from their lack of active intervention. Hearing aids for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss gave greater benefit than reassurance in all factors, though individuals with a conductive impairment reported greater benefit in the Quality of life factor than those with a sensorineural impairment. Hearing aids and maskers produced benefit in the Support factor for patients with tinnitus. Epley's manoeuvre for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo gave benefit in the total score and the Quality of life factor compared with reassurance. Systemic medication for laryngo-pharyngeal reflux and topical medication for otitis externa gave no greater benefit in any factor or the total score compared with reassurance.

36223251,Computed tomography findings in horses presented with signs of head-shaking.,"BACKGROUND: Trigeminal nerve-mediated head-shaking (TNMH) in horses is a diagnosis made by exclusion. Computed tomography (CT) is frequently used to identify any disease process that could cause the clinical signs of head-shaking. Although abnormalities are frequently identified, it is unknown whether treatment of these conditions improves clinical signs.
OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the clinical significance of CT findings in horses presented with a complaint of head-shaking.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: CT and patient records were reviewed and all abnormal findings and any treatments subsequently carried out was recorded. A questionnaire was sent to referring veterinarians and owners were contacted by telephone to establish whether treatment of the identified condition improved clinical signs.
RESULTS: This study included 103 horses presented for head CT with the complaint of head-shaking with follow-up information obtained for 84 horses (81.6%). The diagnosis of TNMH was based on a combination of positive maxillary nerve block and/or response to treatment for TNMH. Although TNMH was the most common diagnosis with 62 horses (60.2%) affected, in 22 horses (21.4%), a primary disease process was identified and treatment of the condition eliminated signs of head-shaking. Clinically relevant primary diseases included dental fracture, primary sinusitis, temporo-mandibular joint arthritis, nuchal bursitis, musculoskeletal pathologies, basisphenoid fracture, otitis externa and a mass affecting the infra-orbital nerve.
MAIN LIMITATIONS: Some clinical information was missing and follow-up information was not obtained in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: CT was perceived as a useful diagnostic tool by most veterinarians, ruling out significant abnormalities. In over 20% of the cases, a treatable primary condition was identified leading to complete resolution of clinical signs.","['Perrier M', 'Manso-Díaz G', 'Dunkel B']",2023,55,4,Equine Vet J,"Perrier M, et al.

Research evaluating the stability and antimicrobial efficacy of these solutions is limited.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: This study determined the chemical stability and in vitro bactericidal efficacy of compounded solutions of enrofloxacin and gentamicin during storage for 28 days.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Solutions of enrofloxacin (10 mg/mL, 1%) and gentamicin (3 mg/mL, 0.3%) were prepared with normal saline and 1 mg/mL dexamethasone. Solutions were stored at room temperature (25°C) for 0, 14 and 28 days. The chemical stability of the antibiotics and dexamethasone were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in triplicate. Efficacy assessment was made with 10 isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius obtained from dogs with OE. Serial 10-fold dilutions of the bacteria with the compounded solutions were prepared and the colony count results were converted into colony-forming units (cfus). The mean cfu/mL and cfu/mL reduction rates were compared between Day (D)0, D14 and D28. All of the antimicrobial testing solutions were performed in triplicate.
RESULTS: Chromatography showed that both antibiotics and dexamethasone were stable for 28 days. No significant differences were observed in the antibiotic bactericidal efficacy of stored solutions at D0, D14 or D28.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Solutions of 1% enrofloxacin and 0.3% gentamicin in normal saline with 0.1% dexamethasone maintained chemical stability and bactericidal efficacy over 28 days.

The external auditory canal provides an appropriate and optimal situation for fungal growth.
OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to identify the causative agents of otomycosis and determine corresponding antifungal drug susceptibility patterns in north-western Iran.
METHODS: From October 2020 until November 2021, 200 patients attended an otolaryngology referral centre with otitis externa, and their ear discharge and debris were examined and cultured. The identification of the fungal agents was implemented by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. In vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of the isolates was conducted in accordance with the CLSI broth microdilution protocols.
RESULTS: The prevalence of otomycosis was measured 50.5% (n = 101/200). The majority of patients were in their forties (n = 35, 34.6%) and female (n = 57, 56.4%), and the most prevalent symptom was otalgia (56.4%). The most underlying factor was remarked manipulation employing a cotton swab (65.3%). Regarding fungus, Aspergillus section Nigri (58.57%) was the foremost isolate, followed by Aspergillus section Flavi (19.23%) and Candida parapsilosis (14.96%). The predominance of Aspergillus isolates had minimal in vitro sensitivity to tioconazole and nystatin. Candida species represented higher geometric mean minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against nystatin. The MIC of three Aspergillus species isolates shown above the epidemiologic cut-off values (ECV) against itraconazole.

36065683,Quinolone Ear Drops and Achilles Tendon Rupture.,"BACKGROUND: Delayed eardrum healing has been observed in the ear opposite to the ear treated with otic quinolones (OQ) in rats. Case reports describe tendinopathies after OQ treatment, suggesting adverse systemic effects.
METHODS: We studied patients aged 19 to 64 years with diagnosis of otitis externa or media in private insurance between 2005 and 2015. We compared OQ treatment against otic neomycin, oral amoxicillin, or azithromycin. Outcomes included Achilles tendon rupture (ATR), Achilles tendinitis (AT), and all-type tendon rupture (ATTR). We applied an active comparator, new-user design with 1-year look-back and ceased follow-up at initiation of systemic steroids or oral quinolones, external injury, hospitalization, and after 35 days. We used trimmed stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights to balance comparison groups in a survival framework. Negative outcomes (clavicle fractures or sports injuries) were examined to rule out differences from varied physical activity (unmeasured confounding).
RESULTS: We examined 1 501 009 treated otitis episodes. Hazard ratios (HR) for OQ exposure associated with ATR were 4.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-11.02), AT 1.04 (95% CI, 0.73-1.50), and ATTR 1.71 (95% CI, 1.21-2.41). Weighted risk differences (RD) per 100 000 episodes for OQ exposure were ATR 7.80 (95% CI, 0.72-14.89), AT 1.01 (95% CI, -12.80 to 14.81), and ATTR 18.57 (95% CI, 3.60-33.53). Corresponding HRs for clavicle fractures and sports injuries were HR,1.71 (95% CI, 0.55-5.27) and HR,1.45 (95% CI, 0.64-3.30), suggesting limited residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: OQ exposure may lead to systemic consequences. Clinicians should consider this potential risk and counsel patients accordingly.

36032817,Cochlear Implantation in Biotinidase Enzyme Deficiency.,"Metabolic syndromes associated with hearing loss are rare and are characterized by specific enzyme pathway deficiencies involving lysosomal storage, peroxisomes, fatty acid enzymes, organic acids and amino acids. The deficiency of biotinidase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of biotin, is one such rare cause of congenital hearing loss estimated at 1:60,000 newborns. The parents of a 5-year-old girl presented to the clinic with complaints that she was hard of hearing with no speech development. At age 2 she had been diagnosed with organic aciduria and hydronephrourethrosis and was operated for renal calculi. Clinical examination showed periorificial scaly skin lesions and eczematous otitis externa. An audiological evaluation showed bilateral profound SNHL. Imaging and routine investigations were unremarkable, except for a mild low anion gap metabolic acidosis. General anaesthesia involved avoidance of neuromuscular agents due to the risk of inducing hypotonia. Surgery consisted of cortical mastoidectomy followed by the facial recess approach. A standard electrode array was inserted via the round window technique and complete atraumatic insertion was achieved. Intraoperative electrode impedance and NRT tracings were good. Hearing loss in biotinidase deficiency may be expected to be of progressive nature and regular evaluation of hearing and speech is required. Cochlear implantation is currently the best available solution for severe to profound hearing loss in this disorder although the enzymatic pathology affects the entire auditory pathway. Biotin supplementation is required lifelong for its management.","['Castellino A', 'Kurkure R', 'Rayamajhi P', 'Kameswaran M']",2022,74,Suppl 1,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Castellino A, et al.

36000066,A rare entity: Benign osteonecrosis of the temporal bone.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors that may contribute to the rare disease process of benign osteonecrosis of the temporal bone and to differentiate this poorly understood disease from other disorders.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review using tertiary academic medical center electronic medical records (EMR) for otolaryngology was performed in August 2021. The study included data from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2020. The patients were identified by a series of predetermined criteria. Their demographic information and clinical course were qualitatively compared. Patients with a history of radiation to the head or neck or who had other otolaryngologic comorbidities were excluded from the study. Inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to filter patients and a thorough chart review was conducted among the patients identified.
RESULTS: A total of three patients were identified that met criteria for the study upon thorough chart review. Out of these patients, all were male, fell within the age range of 67-78 years old and had a history of hypertension. Two out of three had diabetes. In all cases, the plan included supportive care and regular follow up appointments.
CONCLUSION: Benign osteonecrosis of the temporal bone is a rare disease that is difficult to diagnose and even more complicated to document. There is no specific ICD-10 code for this disease making it exceedingly difficult to identify patients with a simple EMR search. Several previously hypothesized risk factors were studied in this review. The limited patient population makes it difficult to confidently identify risks. In the patients studied, the commonalities included that they were all men, above the age of 67 when diagnosed, and all had a history of hypertension. To fully understand this rare entity further research must be conducted and more patients must be studied to aid with the identification of risk factors and clinical diagnosis of this condition.

35934599,Intractable otitis media - Pathogenesis and treatment of Eosinophilic otitis media (EOM) and otitis media with Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -associated vasculitis (OMAAV).,"Intractable otitis media is resistant to antimicrobial therapy, tympanostomy ventilation tube insertion, and surgery. In children, intractable acute otitis media, pathological tympanic membrane due to prolonged otitis media with effusion (OME), tympanic membrane atelectasis, and adhesive otitis media are common. Contrarily, in adults, otitis media caused by drug-resistant pathogens, tuberculous otitis media, cholesterol granuloma, malignant otitis externa (skull base osteomyelitis), eosinophilic otitis media (EOM), and otitis media with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (OMAAV) are common and require differentiation. Among them, EOM is increasing along with eosinophilic upper respiratory tract diseases, such as bronchial asthma and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS), a subgroup of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). EOM is associated with adult-onset bronchial asthma and is characterized by viscous middle ear effusion and middle ear mucosa thickness with eosinophilic infiltration, which requires treatment with glucocorticoids according to disease activity and symptoms. Recently, OMAAV was proposed because of the similarities in clinical features and therapeutic effects. The clinical course of OMAAV is characterized by a relatively rapid increase in the bone conductive hearing threshold, which progresses over 1-2 months, without response to antimicrobial agents or tympanostomy ventilation tube insertion, and in some cases, is complicated by facial paralysis and hypertrophic pachymeningitis. This new concept may explain the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of many cases of intractable otitis media, the cause of which was previously unknown. Although making a diagnosis of OMAAV is relatively easy based on the clinical course, such as vascular dilatation of the tympanic membrane and positive ANCA titer, it is often difficult because the ANCA titer becomes negative with previous administration of glucocorticoids. In adults with intractable otitis media, ANCA titers must be measured before glucocorticoid administration. Treatment consisted of remission induction therapy with a combination of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs.",['Yoshida N'],2023,50,2,Auris Nasus Larynx,Yoshida N.

35919846,Efficacy of controlled-flux electrolyzed acidic solution in dogs with otitis externa.,"Otitis externa is an inflammatory disease of the external ear canal; a therapeutic alternative is the controlled-flux electrolyzed acidic solution (SAEFC) with bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and cytological efficacies of SAEFC in otitis externa. A total of 30 dogs were examined. The clinical and cytological evaluations were on days 1, 7 and 14; the following was considered: Pain, erythema, exudate, inflammation, ulcers, putrid odor and pigmentation. Cytological evaluations were carried out to examine the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), intra-cellular bacteria (cocci; IC), extra-cellular bacteria (EC) and yeasts on days 1, 7 and 14. A cotton swab saturated with SAEFC was applied for each dog's ear. The values of PMN diminished having a significant difference between days. The presence of IC (cocci) had a difference in evaluations from day 1 to day 7 and from day 7 to day 14 demonstrating an important drop. The evaluation of pain showed a sustained decrease until reaching 95.00% of remission, erythema diminished 68.33%, the exudate dropped to 90.00%, inflammation was no longer present by day 14 in 78.00% of the cases and 21.67% showed a slight inflammation, the putrid odor dropped to 95.00% and 5.00% presented a mild odor and by day 14 ear pigmentation was no longer present in 51.67% of the cases and the 48.33% had slight pigmentation.

The objective of this study was to compare results from cytology, bacterial culture and 16S amplicon profiling. Twenty samples from 16 dogs with chronic suppurative otitis externa were collected. A direct cytological evaluation was carried out during the consultations. Aerobic bacterial culture and susceptibility were performed by an external laboratory used in routine practice. For 16S amplicon profiling, DNA was extracted and the hypervariable segment V1−V3 of the 16S rDNA was amplified and then sequenced with a MiSeq Illumina sequence carried out by the Mothur software using the SILVA database. A good correlation between cytology and bacterial culture was observed in 60% of the samples. Some bacterial species revealed by bacterial culture were present with low relative abundance (<10%) in 16S amplicon profiling. Some bacterial species revealed by the 16S amplicon profiling analysis were not identified with culture; most of the time, the offending species was a Corynebacterium. To conclude, a careful interpretation of the results of bacterial culture should be made and always be in agreement with the cytology. The 16S amplicon profiling method appears to be a more sensitive method for detecting strains present in suppurative otitis but does not provide information on bacterial susceptibility.","['Leonard C', 'Thiry D', 'Taminiau B', 'Daube G', 'Fontaine J']",2022,9,7,Vet Sci,"Leonard C, et al.

35857867,A Novel Canine Otoscopy Teaching Model for Veterinary Students.,"Otoscopic evaluation using an otoscope is an important tool among the diagnostic modalities for otitis externa and is considered a core component of a canine patient's complete physical examination. Traditionally, otoscopic training in veterinary school involves using live dogs (i.e., laboratory dogs or dogs that are patients of the veterinary teaching hospital). While this approach has its advantages, performing otoscopic examination on live dogs presents several challenges: it requires adequate patient restraint, can cause stress to the dog, and can potentially cause trauma and/or injury to the dog's ear canal when performed by an inexperienced individual. Using an alternative teaching tool for otoscopic evaluation could overcome these challenges and improve veterinary students' learning experience. In this study, we investigated student perceptions of a novel canine teaching model for otoscopic evaluation in first-year veterinary students. The Elnady preservation technique was employed to create a realistic, durable, and flexible model for otoscopic training in a dermatology laboratory session in a first-year veterinary course. Student feedback was assessed on a Likert scale, and overall feedback indicated that students felt that the model was beneficial for skill building and removed many of the stressors incurred with using live animals when training in clinical skills. Most students stated that they would like to have additional similar models incorporated into training and would recommend these models to other students.","['Tham HL', 'Elnady FA', 'Byrnes MK']",2022,,,J Vet Med Educ,"Tham HL, et al.

AOE can cause severe otalgia and can interrupt the daily activities; however, bed rest is required in about 20% of the patients.
AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of adding an oral antibiotic with the topical antibiotic steroid in the treatment of uncomplicated AOE which is limited to the ear canal in immunocompetent patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective comparative clinical study was conducted in the department of otolaryngology at Al-Jerrahat Teaching Hospital and Private Clinic, Baghdad, Iraq, during the period from April 2020 to October 2021. A total of 68 immunocompetent patients (39 females and 29 males), diagnosed as cases of uncomplicated AOE which is limited to the ear canal, were included in this study. The patients were categorized into two groups. Patients in group A were treated with topical tobramycin 0.3%-dexamethasone 0.1% drops, while patients in group B received the same treatment as group A patients plus oral Ciprofloxacin tablets 500 mg twice daily. The patients were followed up on day-to-day basis until complete resolution of pain and edema. The severity of pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, while edema was graded by dividing the ear canal by imaginary horizontal and vertical lines into four quarters. The post-treatment pain VAS scores and edema grades of both groups were compared. Statistical analysis using t-test was done to calculate P-value in order to find if there is a significant difference regarding the resolution of pain and edema between group A and group B.
RESULTS: During the whole follow-up period there was no significant difference between group A and group B patients regarding the resolution of pain and edema (P-value was more than 0.05).

35839652,Incorporating hearing screening to an otolaryngology surgical mission in the rural Dominican Republic.,"INTRODUCTION: Hearing loss disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries. Children with undiagnosed hearing loss may have difficulty with learning, language development, and behavior. The aim of this study was to understand the extent of hearing loss and common otologic disorders among school-age children in the rural western region of the Dominican Republic and to chronical the early stages of a limited-resource, locally-sustained hearing screening program in tandem with a bi-annual surgical mission.
METHODS: Hearing screenings were performed for 528 school-age children (1056 ears, age 5-17 years old) over 5 days in a village hospital in Peralta, DR. Testing initially included otoscopy and screening audiometry. Children who referred or could not be conditioned underwent distortion product otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), and tympanometry. Children who referred following both screening audiometry and OAEs were considered to have hearing loss. Those with normal tympanograms were considered potential hearing aid candidates.
RESULTS: Abnormal ear examination/otoscopic results were present in 43 children (8.1%) and included: microtia/atresia, impacted cerumen, ear canal foreign body, serous otitis media, otitis externa, and tympanosclerosis. 55 of 528 school-age children referred following screening audiometry and 7 were unable to condition. Of these 62 children, 56 tolerated OAEs and 20 referred following OAEs (3.8%). Fourteen children had type B or C tympanogram and 6 school-age children who were determined to have chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) underwent myringotomy and pressure equalization tube placement. Ten of 528 children (1.9%) had normal tympanometry and otoscopy, and referred following screening audiometry and OAEs suggesting the patients may be potential hearing aid candidates.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hearing loss in this cohort of children in the rural, western Dominican Republic was high at roughly 4% with roughly 2% of children being potential hearing aid candidates. Nearly 10% of children screened had an abnormal otologic examination; sometimes easily remedied by otolaryngologic intervention. With the support of local leadership, it is feasible to incorporate hearing services into otolaryngology outreach and build locally sustainable programs.","['Urban MJ', 'Wojcik C', 'Losenegger T', 'Hammond R', 'Barry S', 'Jagasia A', 'Filpo W', 'Jagasia AJ']",2022,160,,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Urban MJ, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the superiority of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution compared with ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone in treating AOE.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted between August 1, 2017, and September 14, 2018, at 36 centers in the US. The study population comprised 493 patients aged 6 months or older with AOE of less than 21 days' duration with otorrhea, moderate or severe otalgia, and edema, as well as a Brighton grading of II or III (tympanic membrane obscure but without systemic illness). Statistical analysis was performed from November 14, 2018, to February 14, 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin, or fluocinolone twice daily for 7 days and were evaluated on day 1 (visit 1; baseline), days 3 to 4 (visit 2; conducted via telephone), days 8 to 10 (visit 3; end of treatment), and days 15 to 17 (visit 4; test of cure).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was therapeutic cure (clinical and microbiological) at the end of the treatment period. The principal secondary end point was the time to end of ear pain. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the microbiological intent-to-treat population, clinical intent-to-treat population, and microbiological intent-to-treat population with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
RESULTS: A total of 493 patients (254 female patients [51.5%]; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [23.1] years) were randomized (197 to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, 196 to receive ciprofloxacin, and 100 to receive fluocinolone). Therapeutic cure in the modified intent-to-treat population with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (63 of 103 [61.2%]) was statistically comparable to that of ciprofloxacin (49 of 91 [53.8%]; difference in response rate, 7.3%; 95% CI, -6.6% to 21.2%; P = .30) and fluocinolone (20 of 45 [44.4%]; difference in response rate, 16.7%; 95% CI, -0.6% to 34.0%; P = .06) at visit 3 and significantly superior to ciprofloxacin at visit 4 (90 of 103 [87.4%] vs 69 of 91 [75.8%]; difference in response rate, 11.6%; 95% CI, 0.7%-22.4%; P = .04). A statistically faster resolution of otalgia was achieved among patients treated with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (median, 5.0 days [range, 4.2-6.3 days]) vs ciprofloxacin (median, 5.9 days [range, 4.3-7.3 days]; 95% CI, 4.3-7.3 days; P = .002) or fluocinolone (median, 7.7 days [range, 6.7-9.0 days]; 95% CI, 6.7-9.0 days; P < .001). Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone demonstrated statistical superiority in sustained microbiological response vs ciprofloxacin (94 of 103 [91.3%] vs 74 of 91 [81.3%]; difference in response rate, 9.9%; 95% CI, 0.3%-19.6%; P = .04) and fluocinolone (34 of 45 [75.6%]; difference in response rate, 15.7%; 95% CI, 2.0%-29.4%; P = .01) and in the microbiological outcome vs fluocinolone by visit 3 (99 of 103 [96.1%] vs 37 of 45 [82.2%]; difference in response rate, 13.9%; 95% CI, 2.1%-25.7%; P = .01) and ciprofloxacin by visit 4 (97 of 103 [94.2%] vs 77 of 91 [84.6%]; difference in response rate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 0.9%-18.2%; P = .02). Fifteen adverse events related to study medications were registered, all of which were mild or moderate.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution was efficacious and safe in treating AOE but did not demonstrate superiority vs ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solutions alone in the main study end point of therapeutic cure.

35791722,Effect of an ear cleaner instillation containing lipacids in a model of re-acidification of the external auditory canal in dogs.,"BACKGROUND: In humans, the acidic pH of the ear canal plays a protective role against infection and a change towards alkalinity of the external auditory canal (EAC) is a local factor in the progression of acute to chronic otitis externa (OE). The use of acidic preparations alone for treatment of OE without concurrent antibiotic use is well-documented in humans. In dogs, only one study has investigated the EAC pH in healthy dogs and in dogs with OE, and investigations to understand the role of EAC pH in the pathogenesis of canine OE are lacking.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To obtain physiological EAC pH values in beagle dogs. To develop a model of re-acidification of the EAC in dogs and to investigate how an acidic solution may accelerate the return to a physiological pH.
ANIMALS: Ten healthy beagle dogs in a laboratory setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model of re-acidification of the EAC was developed by instillation of a pH 10.1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and the subsequent acidic effect of an ear cleaner containing lipacids was evaluated in this model.
RESULTS: Mean physiological EAC pH was 6.12 (± 0.36). EAC re-acidification took up to 9 h in this model. Mean pH values dropped immediately to 6.38 (± 0.27) on ears treated with an acidic ear cleaner. No abrupt drop was observed of the mean pH values for the control ears.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study confirms that physiological EAC pH in dogs is acidic. This model of re-acidification of the EAC pH allows investigations on acidic properties of topical ear products in healthy ears.","['Panzuti P', 'Mosca M', 'Fantini O', 'Noel G', 'Cappelle J', 'Pin D']",2022,33,5,Vet Dermatol,"Panzuti P, et al.

35751693,Predictive factors in treatment response of malignant external otitis.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence and impact of various predictive factors including diabetes control in malignant external otitis (MEO) treatment response.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study on MEO patients, we defined treatment response with three indices; ESR level decrease, hospitalization period, and systemic antifungal drug usage. The impact of diabetes control and other predictive factors on these indices have been evaluated.
RESULTS: Overall, 164 patients with a mean age of 67.8 ± 9.7 years were included. Cranial nerve involvement was present in 56 patients. Nine patients had immunodeficiency. 19.5% of cases had leukocytosis. Diabetes mellitus was present in 156 patients, suffering for an average of 13.9 ± 8.6 years. The overall mean hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) level was 8.3% (4.4-12.8%), and the mean fasting blood sugar was 146.4 mg/dl (63-292 mg/dl). 29.3% of patients had good diabetes control before admission (HbA1c < 7%), 54.9% had poor control (7% < HbA1c < 10%) and 15.9% had very poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 10%). The predictive role for the following factors were not statistically significant: age, gender, comorbidities, diabetes, diabetes management method used before and during hospitalization, diabetes duration, leukocytosis, immunodeficiency, fasting blood sugar level, HbA1c level, glycemic control index, and insulin amount. However, CRP level with a mean value of 34.3 mg/L showed a significant correlation with ESR decrease, hospitalization period, and antifungal drug usage.
CONCLUSION: CRP level could be used as a predictor for the hospitalization period, the need for systemic antifungal and ESR level decrease. It would be helpful to check the CRP level at the time of diagnosis to predict the hospitalization period and the necessity of systemic antifungal management to adjust the treatment strategy.","['Zonnour A', 'Jamshidi A', 'Dabiri S', 'Hasibi M', 'Tajdini A', 'Karrabi N', 'Yazdani N']",2023,280,1,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Zonnour A, et al.

It has been reported that miR-34a expression is low in many cancers and acts as a tumor suppressor, but its function in EACSCC has not yet been reported.
AIMS: To analyze the miR-34a expression levels in EACSCC specimens using 
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed microRNA ISH for miR-34a detection and immunohistochemical analysis of p53 and Ki67 in the EACSCC and otitis externa (OE) specimens.
RESULTS: miR-34a was expressed in the basal and suprabasal layers in the OE epidermis. The pronounced expression of miR-34a was observed in the two cases of T2 (Stage II). In the one case of T3 (Stage III), it was almost the same as that of the OE. On the other hand, the expression levels of miR-34a in the one case of T3 (Stage IV) and two cases of T4 (Stage IV) were apparently reduced.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the expression level of miR-34a was higher in early-stage EACSCC and lower in advanced-stage EACSCC.

35696322,Necrotizing external otitis: analysis of relapse risk factors in 66 patients managed during a 12 year period.,"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing external otitis (NEO) is a severe infection of the skull base that occurs generally in the elderly and/or in diabetic recipients. There are few data in the literature about the therapeutic management of this complex bone infection.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse relapses after NEO treatment completion, and to describe the clinical features of NEO.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in the Lyon regional reference centre for the management of complex bone and joint infections. Consecutive cases of NEO from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2018 were included. The primary outcome was the relapse of NEO. Variables were analysed using Cox regression survival analysis with adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and Kaplan-Meier curve.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were included. Median age was 75 (IQR 69-81) years and 46 (70%) patients were diabetic. Eleven patients (17%) had temporomandibular arthritis, 10 (15%) cranial nerve paralysis, 2 (3%) cerebral thrombophlebitis, and 2 (3%) contiguous abscess. Microbiological documentation was obtained in 56 patients and revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 44/56 patients (79%). Nine (14%) cases had no microbiological documentation. Antibiotic therapy was dual for 63 (95%) patients. During a median follow-up of 27 (IQR 12-40) months, 16 out of 63 (25%) patients experienced a relapse. Fungal infection was significantly associated with relapse [aHR 4.1 (95% CI 1.1-15); P = 0.03].

Clival osteomyelitis is typically seen in the pediatric population and is very rare in the adult population. It occurs as a complication of recurring paranasal infections and malignant otitis externa. The exact pathophysiology of osteomyelitis of the clivus is relatively uncertain. Here, we describe a case of a 36-year-old man with medical history significant for hypertension and poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who experienced recurrent paranasal sinus infection for 2 years. He received multiple antibiotic treatments and underwent adenoidectomy without substantial improvement of symptoms. Ultimately, a diagnosis of the clival osteomyelitis through the help of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinus and neck was made. This diagnosis allowed for adequate intervention and treatment of our patient with subsequent resolution of his presenting symptoms. This case highlights the importance of high suspicion for clival osteomyelitis in patients with recurring sinus infections.","['Kayode-Ajala F', 'Williams N', 'Ejikeme C', 'Walji A', 'Farrer W']",2022,10,,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,"Kayode-Ajala F, et al.

This study aims to identify factors associated with treatment response and outcome in patients with NOE treated through outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with NOE treated over a 4-year period (January 2018-January 2022) at a tertiary referral hospital in Derbyshire, UK. We defined OPAT failure as unplanned readmission within 30 days of discontinuation of OPAT. Prolonged duration of therapy was defined as length of parenteral antimicrobial treatment of more than 8 weeks. A total of 46 cases of NOE were reviewed. OPAT failure and prolonged therapy were recorded in 9 (19.6%) and 23 (50.0%) episodes respectively. Facial nerve involvement (odds ratio [OR], 14.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.76-76.60; p = 0.002), dementia (OR, 7.65; 95% CI, 1.23-47.46; p = 0.029), Charlson comorbidity score (OR, 1.41 per unit increase; 95% CI, 1.00-2.00; p = 0.049) and peak CRP level (OR, 1.03 per unit increase; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06; p = 0.027) were associated with increased risk of treatment failure.

35546515,Facial Paralysis in Skull Base Osteomyelitis - Comparison of Surgical and Nonsurgical Management.,"TITLE: Facial Paralysis in Skull Base Osteomyelitis - Comparison of Surgical and Nonsurgical Management.
OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical management in cases of facial paresis secondary to skull base osteomyelitis.
METHODS: A 14 patients presenting with skull base osteomyelitis complicated by facial nerve paresis at a single tertiary referral center from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were treated with medical therapy with or without surgical intervention, consisting of mastoidectomy and debridement with or without facial nerve decompression. House-Brackmann (HB) Grade was the main outcome measure.
RESULTS: A 14 patients (average age 68 years, range 58-82 years, 71% male) were analyzed, with 5 undergoing facial nerve decompression (36%), 5 undergoing mastoidectomy without facial nerve decompression (36%), and 4 undergoing medical management alone (28%). Of the 4 patients who underwent medical therapy alone, none experienced significant improvement in facial function. Of the 5 patients who underwent facial nerve decompression, 3 patients experienced improved facial function. Of the 5 patients who underwent mastoidectomy without decompression, 4 experienced improved facial function. There was no clear link between the severity of infection and the severity of facial paresis. When comparing HB score changes before and after treatment across groups, there was no statistically significant difference seen (p = 0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: Mastoidectomy and debridement with or without facial nerve decompression may improve facial nerve outcomes when compared to isolated medical management, although differences were not of statistical significance. The best facial nerve recoveries occurred in patients undergoing surgery within 14 days of the onset of paralysis.

35461827,Modification of bacterial cell membrane dynamics and morphology upon exposure to sub inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin.,"Ciprofloxacin (CPX), a second generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is used as a primary antibiotic for treatment against gastroenteritis, drug-resistant tuberculosis, and malignant otitis externa. CPX is a broad spectrum antibiotic that targets the DNA gyrase of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Irrational and improper usage of CPX results in emergence of CPX resistant organisms emphasizing the importance of using lethal doses of CPX. Here, we have systematically analysed the effect of CPX at sub lethal concentrations on live E. coli membrane and growth dynamics. As a result of CPX interaction at sub-lethal concentrations, we detected filamentation of the bacterial cells during cell division. Although CPX is a DNA targeting antibiotic and did not result in considerable increase of live E. coli cell surface roughness, we observed significant enhancement in the lipid diffusion coefficients possibly due to disrupted lipid packing or altered lipid composition. Interestingly, we seem to observe slightly higher extent of lipid diffusion alteration when bacterial inner membrane specific label FM4-64 was used in comparison to the non-specific membrane dye. Both these results are contrary to that observed in bacterial cells for colistin, a membrane targeting antibiotics. Our work highlights the need for using multiple, complementary surface and depth sensitive techniques to obtain information on the realistic nature of bacterial cell membrane remodelling due to non-membrane targeting antibiotics. Our work could have implications for identification of potential biomembrane markers at sub-lethal concentrations even for antibiotics which are non-membrane targeting that could help in unravelling pathways for emergence of antimicrobial resistance.","['Ponmalar II', 'Swain J', 'Basu JK']",2022,1864,8,Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,"Ponmalar II, et al.

35453235,A Cross-Sectional Study of Veterinarians in Germany on the Impact of the TÄHAV Amendment 2018 on Antimicrobial Use and Development of Antimicrobial Resistance in Dogs and Cats.,"To minimize the use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, the 2018 amendment to the regulations of veterinary pharmacies (TÄHAV) introduced legal restrictions in Germany. In an online survey among German veterinarians, we investigated the influence of these requirements on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of dogs and cats and the development of resistance rates. It was found that, on average, between 21% and 30% of daily treated dogs and cats received antimicrobial therapy. The TÄHAV amendment led to a less frequent use of highest priority critically important antimicrobials (HPCIA) in 79% (240/303) of respondents and less antimicrobial use in general in 36% (108/303). As a result of these legal changes, 63% (190/303) of participants requested antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) more frequently. Participants consulted ASTs particularly frequently for treatment of otitis externa with 63% (190/303), cystitis with 55% (168/303), wounds with 44% (132/303), and pyoderma with 29% (88/303). Veterinarians also noted an increased loss of antimicrobial efficacy, especially when treating these diseases. The results of our survey confirm that the TÄHAV amendment is having a positive impact on prudent antibiotic use, with participants performing more ASTs, using HPCIA less frequently, and choosing alternative antimicrobials for therapy.","['Moerer M', 'Merle R', 'Bäumer W']",2022,11,4,Antibiotics (Basel),"Moerer M, et al.

Concentrations of a panel of 13 cytokines on the ear canal surface and the lipid profile of the exudate were measured on D0 and D14. From D0 to D12 or D13, the dogs’ ears were cleaned daily if the secretion score (SEC) was 3/3, every second day if the score was 2/3 and every third day if the score was 1/3. PS, OTIS-3, SEC and CYTO were significantly lower on D7 compared to baseline (−40%, −31%, −36%, −34%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The same parameters decreased further on D14 (−60%, −53%, −61%, −73%, respectively; p < 0.0001) and amounts of interleukin 8 and chemokine KC-like were also reduced compared to baseline (−45%, p < 0.01; −36%, p = 0.3, respectively). The lipid profile was also modified, with a decrease in free lipids and an increase in bound lipids.","['Moog F', 'Mivielle J', 'Brun J', 'Dumitrache MO', 'Amalric N', 'Lecru LA', 'Pressanti C', 'Kondratjeva J', 'Combarros D', 'Fantini O', 'Cadiergues MC']",2022,9,4,Vet Sci,"Moog F, et al.

35382918,Give ears some respite from regular microsuctioning in bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the external ear canal.,"BACKGROUND: This paper reports a case series of three elderly patients who were regularly attending ENT clinic every four to six weeks for ear canal care to address chronic otitis externa. All three patients had been taking bisphosphonate alendronic acid for years, and it is suspected that this drug was partly to blame for the progression of their chronic ear conditions.
RESULTS: Some improvements were noted when the bisphosphonate was discontinued. The regular microsuctioning, and application of topical antibiotics with steroids, provided temporary relief of symptoms. The present pandemic shut down the routine clinic and the patients were not seen for four to five months. On latest review, it was a surprise to see that their ears seemed to have significantly improved, with healthy re-epithelialisation.
CONCLUSION: It is thus believed that excessive and repeated microsuctioning in bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of that external ear canal can delay re-epithelialisation, and gradually prolonging the intervals between microsuctioning could help in overall resolution of the disease.","['Abelardo E', 'Jaramillo M']",2022,136,10,J Laryngol Otol,Abelardo E and Jaramillo M.

35382682,Diagnostic approach to patients at risk of otogenic skull base osteomyelitis.,"BACKGROUND: Otogenic skull base osteomyelitis (OSBO) is rare and potentially fatal sequelae of otitis externa. Accurate and timely diagnosis is important due to rising incidence, morbidity and costs associated with treatment. Consensus on the diagnostic approach for OSBO has yet to be reached, in particular the utility of imaging modalities.
AIMS/OBJECTIVES: This study reviews a single institution's high-volume experience of OSBO, with the aim of analysing clinicopathologic features and imaging studies to develop a diagnostic algorithm.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients admitted with OSBO from 2009 to 2019, was performed. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 103 patients with 106 unique episodes of suspected OSBO were selected. De-identified information including patient demographics, clinicopathologic features and imaging outcomes was recorded and analysed.
RESULTS: HbA1c ≥ 7% significantly predicted for OSBO in univariate (OR 7.83, 95% CI 1.85-33.16, 
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Once there is a clinical suspicion for OSBO, diagnosis is established by synthesising results from clinical assessment, pathologic investigations and imaging modalities. The imaging utilised to diagnose OSBO should vary according to the clinical situation and limitations of each modality.","['Lim JWJ', 'Hill FCE', 'Kerr S', 'Briggs R', 'McLean T']",2022,142,3-4,Acta Otolaryngol,"Lim JWJ, et al.

35476376,Bacterial Infections in Diabetes,"None: Bacteria are microscopic single-celled organisms that exist in millions inside and outside the human body. Some bacteria are harmful and can cause a multitude of diseases in human beings. Diabetes mellitus, being a global pandemic, serves as an important cause of susceptibility to bacterial infections. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with impaired innate and adaptive immune responses that predispose to bacterial infections. In addition, chronic complications of diabetes like neuropathy (sensorimotor and autonomic) and peripheral vascular disease can lead to skin ulcerations with secondary bacterial infections. Diabetes also increases the incidence of infection related mortality. The relationship of diabetes and bacterial infections can be reciprocal, with certain infections like periodontitis exacerbating insulin resistance. Abnormalities in the bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract can play a role in the development of diabetes. Bacteria can infect any organ in the human body, the most common sites of infection in diabetes being the urinary tract, respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissues. Certain bacterial infections are very specific for diabetes like emphysematous pyelonephritis, emphysematous cholecystitis, and malignant otitis externa. Different antibiotic regimens (empirical and culture-specific) have been recommended for different bacterial infections, depending upon the site and severity. Our chapter gives an overview of the various bacteria, important from the standpoint of diabetes. We have also discussed the epidemiology and pathogenesis of bacterial infections in diabetes. In addition, we have highlighted the spectrum of bacterial infections and their management in diabetes. Stringent glycemic control, vaccination, adequate foot care practices, source control are some of the preventive measures to avoid bacterial infections in diabetes. Adequate knowledge about the spectrum and management of bacterial infections is important to prevent morbidity and mortality in diabetes.

35365694,Association of comorbidities and medications with risk of asthma exacerbation in pediatric patients: a retrospective study using Japanese claims data.,"Asthma exacerbation impairs the quality of life of pediatric patients and negatively impacts future respiratory function and health economics. Several risk factors associated with exacerbations have been identified; however, most studies report the risk of each factor. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the risk of each factor and a combination of factors. We performed a retrospective cohort study using Japanese claims data and extracted factors associated with exacerbations using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression and stepwise method. Risk scores were then calculated from the extracted factors and validated by tenfold cross validation. Of the 1,748,111 asthma patients in the database, the data of 14,980 were extracted, and 1988 (13.3%) had exacerbation. Factors associated with asthma exacerbation were age of 3-5 years, exacerbation history before cohort entry date, allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, otitis externa, blepharitis, upper respiratory infections, urticaria, LTRA prescription, were determined. A four-level risk score was calculated from 9-factors and the AUC derived from cross validation was 0.700. Most factors extracted in our study are consistent with those of previous studies. We showed that combining each factor is more helpful in assessing the increased risk of asthma exacerbation than assessing each factor alone.","['Maeda S', 'Kobayashi S', 'Takahashi K', 'Miyata S']",2022,12,1,Sci Rep,"Maeda S, et al.

Patients are typically frail, diagnostic delay is common and severe pain is a key feature. This study aimed to qualitatively analyse patient-centred data to identify key themes in the patient's experience.
METHODS: Open-ended questionnaires were sent to 28 patients. Responses were qualitatively analysed using a grounded theory approach. Iterative cycles were used to develop codes using a constant comparison technique. Emerging categories were refined to identify core themes.
RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: severe pain, mental health, quality of life and diagnostic delays.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to explore patients' perspectives in necrotising otitis externa. It indicates a need to raise awareness of necrotising otitis externa, and to improve symptom management, pain control and quality of life. This valuable information can be used to identify research priorities, guide service improvements, improve clinical care and feed into the development of a Core Outcome Set for necrotising otitis externa.","['Owen E', 'Abrar R', 'Stapleton E']",2023,137,4,J Laryngol Otol,"Owen E, et al.

35311376,Laboratory and imaging findings of necrotizing otitis externa are associated with pathogen type and disease outcome: A retrospective analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of laboratory and imaging data with diagnostic parameters of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) and its severity, and to compare between bacterial and fungal infections.
METHODS: Records of patients diagnosed with NOE during 2010-2018 at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery were reviewed retrospectively for demographics; disease characteristics; and laboratory, scintigraphy, and imaging results.
RESULTS: Of 48 patients with NOE, the mean age is 73±11.6 years; 32 (67%) were males; 83% had diabetes mellitus. Common pathogens were pseudomonas (49%) and fungi (33%). Sensitivities of the technetium-scan (SPECT ratio ≥1.5), temporal bone computed tomography (CT), and gallium-scan (SPECT ratio ≥1.3) were: 78.7%, 48.8%, and 31.4%, respectively. Gallium-scan results correlated positively with CT bone involvement (p=0.002) and hospital length of stay (p=0.0014). C-reactive protein (CRP) level correlated with hospital length of stay (p=0.028) and positive technetium-scan results (p=0.012). Fungal infection had a higher technetium SPECT ratio (2.16 vs. 1.77, p=0.04), gallium SPECT ratio (1.4 vs. 1.2, p=0.02), longer duration of systemic treatment (87.4 vs. 37.9 days, p=0.014), and longer hospital length of stay (31.6 vs. 15.2 days, p=0.004) compared to non-fungal infection. Eight (17%) patients had responded poorly to treatment. Fungal pathogens, facial nerve paresis, extra-auricular, and bilateral disease were more prevalent among the non-responders.
CONCLUSION: The technetium scan has higher sensitivity than temporal bone CT for diagnosing NOE. The gallium scan and CRP correlated well with hospital length of stay. A high rate of fungal infection was found, with significantly higher technetium and gallium SPECT ratios and worse outcome compared to bacterial infection. Fungal NOE remains therapeutically challenging.","['Margulis I', 'Cohen-Kerem R', 'Roitman A', 'Gez-Reder H', 'Aviram A', 'Bitterman-Fisher S', 'Kugelman N', 'Doweck I']",2022,,,Ear Nose Throat J,"Margulis I, et al.

35302459,Utility of Temporal Bone Computed Tomography in Pediatric Emergency Medicine.,"OBJECTIVE: Temporal bone computed tomography (CT) requires a relatively high radiation dose to produce high-resolution images required to define surgical anatomy. In the acute setting, the need for this detailed evaluation of temporal bone pathology may not be required for nonsurgical management and clinical decision-making. We performed a retrospective review of the clinical characteristics and subsequent management of children who underwent CT of the temporal bone with the goal of optimizing clinical decision-making and mitigating the risks of radiation exposure in children.
METHODS: We included pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with International Classification of Diseases (9th or 10th revision) diagnoses consistent with otitis externa, otitis media, mastoiditis, head trauma, temporal bone fracture, and otalgia who were treated in the emergency department and underwent temporal bone CT from January 1, 2012-December 31, 2016. We collected data regarding the patients' presenting symptoms, physical exam findings, indications for imaging, radiographic findings, disposition, and operative intervention within 30 days of imaging. Features of the suspected mastoiditis group were compared between operative and non-operative patients.
RESULTS: Over the four-year study period there were 96 temporal bone CTs. Most studies (70%) were associated with a subsequent inpatient admission. Common indications for imaging included evaluation of acute mastoiditis (55%) or trauma (41%). Of the 53 patients with concern for mastoiditis, 27 (51%) required otologic surgery. Two patients in the trauma group required surgical intervention, both for facial nerve decompression. In patients with suspected mastoiditis, mental status changes (P = 0.02), auricular proptosis (P = 0.05), and fluctuance (P = 0.02) were significantly more prevalent in the operative group; however, no other findings were significantly associated with operative intervention.
CONCLUSION: Temporal bone CT is beneficial in guiding diagnosis and management of acute mastoiditis. We found that a majority of patients with suspected mastoiditis who underwent temporal bone CT ultimately required surgery or hospital admission. However, the potential for reduction in the use of CT still exists in this population. Fractures of the temporal bone typically do not require urgent operative intervention in the absence of complete facial nerve paralysis; thus, the utility of temporal bone CT in trauma evaluation may be limited.","['Benyo S', 'Benn DV', 'Saadi RA', 'Gangai L', 'Kasmire KE', 'Isildak H', 'Goyal N']",2022,23,2,West J Emerg Med,"Benyo S, et al.

35293639,Brachycephaly in French bulldogs and pugs is associated with narrow ear canals.,"BACKGROUND: Brachycephalic dog breeds have multiple skull malformations which may lead to anatomical changes in the external auditory canal. It is our frequent observation that in the otoscopic examination of the external ear in these breeds we are unable to visualise the tympanic membrane as a consequence of extreme narrowing of the proximal ear canal. Additionally brachycephalic dogs reportedly are predisposed to otitis externa (OE) and otitis media.
OBJECTIVES: To characterizse the transition of the cartilaginous ear canal to the bony meatus acusticus externus using computed tomography (CT) and to investigate a possible association with OE in brachycephalic dogs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five client-owned dogs [pugs (n = 20), French bulldogs (n = 55)] were included and assessed for OE using an owner questionnaire and otoscopic and cytological examinations. In dorsal plane CT scans, the diameter of the porus acusticus externus was measured using novel methodology. The results were compared with a normocephalic control group without preexisting otological disorders.
RESULTS: Brachycephalic dogs had a significantly smaller porus acusticus externus diameter (2.6 mm) than normocephalic dogs (5.0 mm). Of the brachycephalic dogs, 32% had OE yet this was not statistically significantly related to the diameter of the porus acusticus externus. Middle ear effusion (44%) and narrowing of the external ear canal (82.6%) were significantly more frequent in brachycephalic dogs. Only five of 150 eardrums could be visualised otoscopically.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Malformation of the porus acusticus externus causes severe stenosis of the proximal ear canal in brachycephalic dogs. A connection between stenosis of the external auditory canal and OE could not be confirmed.","['Töpfer T', 'Köhler C', 'Rösch S', 'Oechtering G']",2022,33,3,Vet Dermatol,"Töpfer T, et al.

35237014,The use of a caudal auricular axial pattern flap for repair of a degloving pinna wound in a dog.,"A 3-year-old male neutered French bulldog was presented for an anatomical degloving injury of the left pinna following a conflict with a larger dog at a park. Approximately 2/3 of the dorsal skin was removed from the convex surface of the left pinna along with an irregular, full thickness injury on the lateral aspect of the pinna distal to the cutaneous marginal pouch. A caudal auricular axial pattern flap (CAAPF) was used to reconstruct the pinna. The flap healed with no noted necrosis over the long-term. Postoperative cellulitis was noted for approximately 3 mo. The dog was medically managed for bilateral otitis externa multiple times over the course of recovery. Long-term function and cosmesis at 1.5 y after surgery revealed adequate functional movement of the pinna and acceptable cosmesis. It is concluded that, rather than a pinnectomy, a CAAPF can be offered as a surgical option in dogs that have injuries localized to the pinna. Key clinical message: A CAAPF is an alternative to pinnectomy for reconstruction of the pinna after degloving injury and yields a functional and cosmetically acceptable outcome.","['Katarwala KR', 'Buote NJ']",2022,63,3,Can Vet J,Katarwala KR and Buote NJ.

Anti-inflammatory medicines and prednisolone were ineffective and total ear canal ablation was performed. Histological diagnosis was chronic otitis externa. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (Cowdry type A and full-type) were occasionally observed in the ceruminous gland epithelium. The inclusion bodies were negative for nucleic acid and ultrastructurally composed of fibrous structures (approximately 10 nm in width). Viral infection was initially suspected, but polymelase chain reaction tests did not detect the expected viral genes. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the inclusion bodies were positive for heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), suggesting that these bodies could be protein aggregates including HSP70. The etiology of this lesion has not been elucidated, but chronic inflammation may influence the cytoplasm-to-nuclear transportation of HSP70. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of canine chronic otitis externa with HSP70-positive intranuclear inclusion bodies.","['Kiuchi T', 'Watanabe K', 'Nakagun S', 'Miyahara K', 'Horiuchi N', 'Kobayashi Y']",2022,35,1,J Toxicol Pathol,"Kiuchi T, et al.

RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were diabetic (group A) and 4 were non-diabetic, non-immunocompromised (group B). Otalgia was present in all patients (100%), followed by otorrhoea (67%) and edema (64%). Polyps were present in 18 patients (50%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 16 out of 25 positive cultures (64%). Four patients of group A and none of group B underwent surgery. Five patients of group A and none of group B had at least 1 cranial nerve involvement. The mean age was 77.22 ± 8.17 for group A and 47.25 ± 3.59 for group B (P < .001). No statistical significance was observed in regards to major symptoms, inflammatory markers (white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), positive imaging, and microbiological findings between the 2 groups. The average days of hospitalization were 42.41 ± 31.06 for group A and 10.25 ± 2.63 for group B (P < .049). Four diabetic patients died.
CONCLUSION: Non-diabetic, non-immunocompromised adult patients with malignant otitis externa had a better response to antibiotic therapy and a shorter length of hospitalization. A high clinical suspicion for malignant otitis externa should always raise in cases of otitis externa that fail to respond in a topic and/or oral antibiotic treatment for more than a week.","['Sideris G', 'Latzonis J', 'Avgeri C', 'Malamas V', 'Delides A', 'Nikolopoulos T']",2022,18,1,J Int Adv Otol,"Sideris G, et al.

35182615,High rates of multidrug resistance in bacteria associated with small animal otitis: A study of cumulative microbiological culture and antimicrobial susceptibility.,"The etiology of otitis in dogs and cats is multifactorial and complex, involving bacterial and fungal pathogens. As empiric antimicrobial prescription is a common practice when treating such cases, antimicrobial resistance may represent a complicating factor. The aim of this study was to describe microbiological features and susceptibility profiles of pathogens associated with 142 cases of external otitis, comprising 138 dogs and 4 cats.. The specimens were processed to identify bacterial and fungal etiologies following standard microbiological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined in vitro against 15 antibiotics and 3 antifungals. Further, Staphylococcus spp. isolates were screened for the detection of β-lactamase enzymes using cefinase paper discs. Pseudomonas spp. and isolates from Enterobacteriaceae family were screened for colistin (Polymyxin E) resistance and for the mcr-1-mediated colistin resistance gene by PCR. The presence of mixed cultures of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp. and Staphylococcus spp., and co-infections with Malassezia spp., emphasizes the polymicrobial etiology of external otitis in small animals. Emerging rates of multidrug resistance observed in almost 50% of the isolates may alert for a near future of challenging veterinary cases unresponsive to first-line antimicrobials. In addition, these results highlight a potential public health concern of multidrug resistant bacteria, given the proximity of pets and their owners. This study addressed central aspects of external otitis, providing microbiologists and clinicians updated information on the etiology and treatment of challenging cases of multidrug resistant bacteria. It also provides priceless surveillance value in monitoring resistant bacteria in small animals.","['Martins E', 'Maboni G', 'Battisti R', 'da Costa L', 'Selva HL', 'Levitzki ED', 'Gressler LT']",2022,165,,Microb Pathog,"Martins E, et al.

35148731,Comparison of the clinical outcome of endoscopic push-through myringoplasty and microscopic overlay myringoplasty: matching co-variated designs.,"BACKGROUND: The conventional microscopic overlayer myringoplasty is preferred because it allows a both hands technique, not reducing middle ear space, increasing the blood supply in the repaired area, and providing graft support; however, this technique may be troublesome for the novice surgeon during tympanomeatal flap elevation. Recently, the endoscopic push-through myringoplasty technique has developed. It provides better visualization of the hidden areas and does not require raising tympanomeatal flap. Therefore, the comparison of clinical outcomes between endoscopic push-through myringoplasty and conventional microscopic overlay myringoplasty technique was investigated.
METHODS: A retrospective case-control hospital-based study was conducted using archival data from the patients who underwent myringoplasty between January 2015 and May 2021 at Srinagarind Hospital and Khon Kaen Hospital, Thailand. The medical records of patients who underwent endoscopic push-through technique or microscopic overlayer technique were chosen by simple randomization and matched 1:1 based on the air conduction threshold, air-bone gap, size of perforation, and experience of the surgeon. The two techniques were compared for clinical outcome success, including tympanic membrane closure, improved air conduction threshold, air-bone gap closure, and operation time duration.
RESULTS: Medical records of 70 patients were retrieved and classified into 35 patients who underwent endoscopic push-through and 35 patients who underwent microscopic overlayer myringoplasty. The size of tympanic membrane perforation and preoperative audiometry were not significantly different between both groups (p > 0.05). The postoperative outcome in endoscopic technique revealed that the air-bone gap and the success rate of tympanic membrane closure were comparable with microscopic techniques (p = 0.420 and p = 0.156, respectively). The operation time was significantly shorter in the endoscopic technique (p < 0.05). Complications were found in one patient with otitis externa in the endoscopic technique group and one patient with graft lateralization in the microscopic technique group.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic push-through myringoplasty is an alternative minimally invasive technique that may allow the potential outcomes comparable with the microscopic overlayer myringoplasty and with a significantly shorter operation time.","['Mahawerawat K', 'Kasemsiri P']",2022,22,1,BMC Surg,Mahawerawat K and Kasemsiri P.

35145933,Sertaconazole versus Clotrimazole and Miconazole Creams in the Treatment of Otomycosis: A Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Fungal otitis extern or otomycosis, is common worldwide, and resistance of fungal organisms to antifungal drugs has been reported in otomycosis and other fungal infections. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sertaconazole versus placebo, as well as miconazole and clotrimazole topical creams in otomycosis patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blinded clinical trial, 138 otomycosis patients (230 ears) were evaluated in four groups. After the first session of the ear canal debridement and irrigation with acetic acid 2% solution, the patients were treated with either A) sertaconazole 2% cream, B) miconazole 2% cream, C) clotrimazole 2% cream, or D) placebo. The results of clinical evaluations and response to treatment (complete, partial, and no response) were recorded at the time of the first visit and by the end of the first, second, and fourth weeks of treatment. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Response results to treatments, ear itching, aural fullness, otalgia, and otorrhea revealed significant differences in either group A or groups B and C, compared to the placebo group (P<0.05). Considering both complete and partial responses together, the sertaconazole group showed a 96.43% response rate. For complete response, miconazole revealed better results, compared to the other two creams; however, the differences for the therapeutic outcomes were not statistically significant. No adverse reactions were observed in the study groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Sertaconazole had comparable results with miconazole and clotrimazole in the treatment of otomycosis, and especially if complete and partial responses were considered together, it was more efficacious than miconazole and clotrimazole creams.","['Nemati S', 'Gerami H', 'Faghih Habibi A', 'Kazemnejad E', 'Shabani N', 'Aghsaghloo V', 'Montazeri S']",2022,34,120,Iran J Otorhinolaryngol,"Nemati S, et al.

35111884,Prevalence of Infectious Diseases Among 6078 Individuals With Down Syndrome in the United States.,"A recent disease prevalence study of the largest documented Down syndrome (DS) cohort in the United States strongly suggested significant disparity in general infectious disease conditions among individuals with DS versus those without DS. In this follow-up retrospective analysis, we explored these differences in greater detail by calculating prevalence of 52 infectious diseases, across 28 years of data among 6078 individuals with DS and 30,326 age- and sex-matched controls, abstracted from electronic medical records within a large Midwestern health system. We found that the DS cohort had higher prevalence of pneumonias (including aspiration, viral, bacterial, pneumococcal, and unspecified/atypical); otitis externa; and the skin infections impetigo, abscess, and cellulitis. To the contrary, the DS cohort had lower prevalence of many respiratory infections other than pneumonia (including influenza, strep pharyngitis, upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, scarlet fever, and otitis media); sexually transmitted infections (including bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia, genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus, pelvic inflammatory disease, and trichomoniasis); mononucleosis; shingles; unspecified hepatitis; intestinal infections; and enteritis. These findings highlight that individuals with DS could be more or less prone to different infectious diseases than their non-DS matched counterparts. Additional research to understand why these differences exist and how they might affect the clinical approach to patients with DS is warranted.","['Fitzpatrick V', 'Rivelli A', 'Chaudhari S', 'Chicoine L', 'Jia G', 'Rzhetsky A', 'Chicoine B']",2022,9,1,J Patient Cent Res Rev,"Fitzpatrick V, et al.

35107126,The EDA-deficient mouse has Zymbal's gland hypoplasia and acute otitis externa.,"In mice, rats, dogs and humans, the growth and function of sebaceous glands and eyelid Meibomian glands depend on the ectodysplasin signalling pathway. Mutation of genes encoding the ligand EDA, its transmembrane receptor EDAR and the intracellular signal transducer EDARADD leads to hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, characterised by impaired development of teeth and hair, as well as cutaneous glands. The rodent ear canal has a large auditory sebaceous gland, the Zymbal's gland, the function of which in the health of the ear canal has not been determined. We report that EDA-deficient mice, EDAR-deficient mice and EDARADD-deficient rats have Zymbal's gland hypoplasia. EdaTa mice have 25% prevalence of otitis externa at postnatal day 21 and treatment with agonist anti-EDAR antibodies rescues Zymbal's glands. The aetiopathogenesis of otitis externa involves infection with Gram-positive cocci, and dosing pregnant and lactating EdaTa females and pups with enrofloxacin reduces the prevalence of otitis externa. We infer that the deficit of sebum is the principal factor in predisposition to bacterial infection, and the EdaTa mouse is a potentially useful microbial challenge model for human acute otitis externa.","['Del-Pozo J', 'Headon DJ', 'Glover JD', 'Azar A', 'Schuepbach-Mallepell S', 'Bhutta MF', 'Riddell J', 'Maxwell S', 'Milne E', 'Schneider P', 'Cheeseman M']",2022,15,3,Dis Model Mech,"Del-Pozo J, et al.

35089639,In vitro antifungal activity of cold atmospheric microwave plasma and synergistic activity against Malassezia pachydermatis when combined with chlorhexidine gluconate.,"BACKGROUND: The antifungal efficacy of cold atmospheric microwave plasma (CAMP) against Malassezia pachydermatis has not been to be evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the antifungal effects of CAMP against M. pachydermatis and its synergistic effects with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX).
METHODS: A M. pachydermatis isolate was collected from a dog with otitis externa and Malassezia dermatitis at the Seoul National University Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital. The antifungal effect was determined by applying CAMP to a M. pachydermatis isolate that was incubated for 3 days at 37°C. After 1, 2, 3 and 5 min of application, the efficacy of the plasma treatment was determined according to the number of colony forming units (CFUs). A mixture consisting of inoculum and CHX was applied to evaluate the synergistic effect of the plasma treatment in the same way.
RESULTS: The application of CAMP showed significant antifungal effects against M. pachydermatis. The antifungal effect of CAMP was enhanced by an increased exposure time and output power. The application of CAMP with 0.02% and 0.2% CHX resulted in lower survival rates against M. pachydermatis when compared with its sole application at 1 or 2 min.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings demonstrate that CAMP has a potential as a new antifungal option for M. pachydermatis and has synergistic antifungal effects with CHX in vitro. Clinical applications for CAMP are necessary to assess the antifungal efficacy for patients.","['Lee TH', 'Hyun JE', 'Kang YH', 'Baek SJ', 'Hwang CY']",2022,8,2,Vet Med Sci,"Lee TH, et al.

METHOD: The UK SMI B1 protocol including a single Sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol (SABC) incubated at 37°C for 48 hours was compared with a standard fungal-specific culture method using two SABC agar plates incubated at 28 and 37°C for 2 weeks with an extra Candida chromogenic agar incubated at 37°C for 5 days. This real-life evaluation was undertaken on ear samples from patients with OE from January 2020 to December 2020.
RESULTS: Altogether, 304 individual patient ear swabs were prospectively examined. The positivity rate of UK standard was 14% (42/304) versus 26% (79/304) for the fungal-specific protocol (p < .05). The standard protocol identified seven compared with 17 species using the fungal-specific protocol. A total of 93 fungal isolates were recovered; nine different yeasts and eight filamentous fungal species. Candida parapsilosis (38/304; 13%), C. albicans (10/304; 3%) and C. orthopsilosis (6/304; 2%) were common yeast species. Aspergillus niger complex (16/304; 5%) was the most common mould, followed by A. fumigatus complex (3/304; 1%). Many less common and emerging yeasts and moulds were only isolated from samples cultured using a fungal-specific protocol.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the UK SMI B1 media and procedures are inadequate to detect all fungal agents causing otomycosis. Fungal-specific culture protocols increase the recovery rate and diversity of fungal pathogens isolated from external ear samples.","['Rawson TM', 'Fatania N', 'Abdolrasouli A']",2022,65,4,Mycoses,"Rawson TM, et al.

35073343,The adult microbiome of healthy and otitis patients: Definition of the core healthy and diseased ear microbiomes.,"Otitis media (OM) and externa (OE) are painful, recurrent ear conditions. As most otitis publications focus on the bacterial content of childhood ears, there remains a dearth of information regarding the adult ear microbiome including both bacteria and fungi. This study compares the outer ear microbiome of healthy adults to adults affected by OE and OM using both intergenic-transcribed-spacer (ITS) and 16S-rDNA sequencing. The adult ear core microbiome consists of the prokaryote Cutibacterium acnes and the eukaryotic Malassezia arunalokei, M. globosa, and M. restricta. The healthy ear mycobiome is dominated by Malassezia and can be divided into two groups, one dominated by M. arunalokei, the other by M. restricta. Microbiome diversity and biomass varied significantly between healthy and diseased ears, and analyses reveal the presence of a potential mutualistic, protective effect of Malassezia species and C. acnes. The healthy ear core microbiome includes the bacteria Staphylococcus capitis and S. capitis/caprae, while the diseased ear core is composed of known bacterial and fungal pathogens including Aspergillus sp., Candida sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Corynebacterium jeikeium. The data presented highlight the need for early detection of the cause of otitis to direct more appropriate, efficient treatments. This will improve patient outcomes and promote improved antimicrobial stewardship.","['Burton M', 'Krumbeck JA', 'Wu G', 'Tang S', 'Prem A', 'Gupta AK', 'Dawson TL']",2022,17,1,PLoS One,"Burton M, et al.

35047310,Malignant Otitis Externa in a 20-Year-Old Male Patient With Erdheim-Chester Disease: A Case Report.,"Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening, invasive infection of the external auditory canal and lateral skull base. It is mainly seen in older adults with diabetes or immunocompromised patients and rarely seen in children. Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare, non-Langerhans histiocytosis disorder. It is a multisystem disease with a poorly understood etiology. It commonly affects the skeletal system, central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular system, lungs, retroperitoneum, kidneys, and skin. CNS involvement confers poor prognosis and reduced response to treatment. Cardiovascular involvement is another indicator of poor prognosis. This report describes the case of a 20-year-old male with ECD who had bilateral malignant otitis externa/skull base osteomyelitis and hearing loss. The patient was not responding well to treatment. He was on intravenous antibiotics, underwent left mastoidectomy, received targeted immunotherapy, and had four rounds of chemotherapy. The patient died after six months from the diagnosis and targeted treatment, which indicates the aggressiveness of the disease. MOE should be suspected in any patient presenting with intractable otalgia with otorrhea that is not responsive to local treatment for uncomplicated otitis externa or otalgia with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain aggravated by chewing. This is the first report of malignant otitis externa in a young patient with ECD to the best of the author's knowledge. This case emphasizes the importance of suspecting MOE in young patients, especially if the risk factors of the disease are present because early diagnosis can prevent or minimize life-threatening complications.","['Alarimah YGS', 'Alanazi KAH', 'Alshammari NH', 'Fatani HA', 'Aldajani NF']",2021,13,12,Cureus,"Alarimah YGS, et al.

RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included; 63% female, median age 57 years. One was excluded (clinically not OE). Most patients had multiple primary care visits before referral (average 4 GP; 2 practice nurse). Sixty per cent had received oral antibiotics (16% multiple classes). Eighteen per cent had never had ear drops. Thirty-nine per cent were not advised to keep ears dry. Twenty-one per cent had dermatitis; 13% contact allergy, 30% systemic allergy, 5% diabetes. Less than 10% had narrow canals. Thirty-six per cent had active discharge but <7% needed a wick. Approximately 75% appear suitable for community aural care clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: OE occurs most commonly in female patients, often with associated risk factors. Patients often consult primary care several times prior to referral. Lifestyle advice and ototopical drops are frequently overlooked; instead, often inappropriately treated with oral antibiotics. Most ears were anatomically normal, and community aural care clinics may have a role in more timely and accessible treatment.","['Mather MW', 'Mohammed H', 'Wilson JA']",2022,39,5,Fam Pract,"Mather MW, et al.

35014745,Prolonged twice-daily administration of oclacitinib for the control of canine atopic dermatitis: a retrospective study of 53 client-owned atopic dogs.,"BACKGROUND: Oclacitinib administered at the licensed dose twice daily for two weeks and then once daily as required is recommended for the treatment of atopic dogs. In some cases, the once-daily regimen is insufficient to control the clinical signs.
OBJECTIVES: To provide preliminary safety and efficacy data on the prolonged twice-daily administration of oclacitinib in atopic dogs.
ANIMALS: Fifty-three client-owned atopic dogs.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The medical records of dogs with atopic dermatitis treated with oclacitinib twice daily for more than two weeks were reviewed retrospectively. Animal details, treatment dose and duration, concurrent diseases, adjunctive medications and possible adverse events were recorded. Treatment efficacy was assessed retrospectively and, when available, the selected blood parameters before and during the treatment were compared. Statistical analyses of the collected data were performed.
RESULTS: The median treatment duration was 113 days. Excellent-to-good efficacy was observed in 38 dogs (72%), including 24 of 33 dogs that failed to respond to the once-daily regimen. Eight dogs showed a poor response despite the addition of systemic glucocorticoids. Pyoderma, gastrointestinal signs and otitis externa were the most frequent adverse events recorded whilst on treatment. Blood tests performed in 35 dogs showed slightly decreased leucocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil and monocyte counts that remained within the reference ranges in most cases. Three dogs developed hypercholesterolemia.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Prolonged twice-daily administration of oclacitinib generally was well-tolerated and was effective in most of the treated dogs. Regular clinical evaluation and blood tests are advisable for this treatment regimen.","['Denti D', 'Caldin M', 'Ventura L', 'De Lucia M']",2022,33,2,Vet Dermatol,"Denti D, et al.

35000633,Exploring theories for the exponential 16-year rise in incidence of necrotising otitis externa in England.,"BACKGROUND: Necrotising otitis externa is a severe, life-threatening infection. Epidemiological data demonstrate a dramatic rise in reported cases in England from 2002 to 2017. The reasons for this remain elusive.
METHODS: A quantitative descriptive study was undertaken using epidemiological data from the Hospital Episode Statistics database. Cases from 2002 to 2017 were compiled and analysed. Four potential theories were explored to explain the rise in incidence.
RESULTS: Within the 16-year period, 7327 necrotising otitis externa cases were reported. Annual necrotising otitis externa incidence increased 1142 per cent within the 16-year period, from 123 recorded cases in 2002 to 1405 cases in 2017. This correlates with an increasing prevalence of diabetes, an ageing population and likely increased physician awareness of necrotising otitis externa. There is insufficient evidence to support antibiotic resistance as a significant associated factor.
CONCLUSION: Correlation does not imply causation. It is likely that a combination of factors is contributing to the rise in necrotising otitis externa incidence, including increased physician recognition, diagnosis and accurate clinical coding.","['Linton S', 'Stapleton E']",2022,136,10,J Laryngol Otol,Linton S and Stapleton E.

Treatment is based on the use of topical steroids, moisturisers and occasionally antibiotics. Results, however, can be disappointing, especially over the long term.
METHODS: This study compared the long-term response to pimecrolimus, administered to a group of 11 patients, against clobetasone butyrate, administered to an equivalent number of patients. Response to the treatment was assessed and statistically analysed at 3 and 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Whereas the degree of improvement following the use of pimecrolimus and clobetasone butyrate was similar for the two groups at month 3, a highly statistically significant difference was documented at month 12, with a much greater and sustained improvement in the pimecrolimus group.","['Nemeth Z', 'Verga E', 'Verdolini R']",2022,136,7,J Laryngol Otol,"Nemeth Z, et al.

One such challenge is the appropriate and timely use of imaging techniques since its use is critical not only in diagnosis but also in determining the extent and resolution of the disease. Hence, doctors in both primary and secondary health care need to be familiar with presenting symptoms while specialists need to be appraised of advances in imagining techniques in diagnosis and management of NOE. Whilst there is a general consensus amongst clinicians on some aspects of management of NOE, there is very limited consensus on the use of imaging modalities. There is no single modality of imaging that can provide a complete picture of diagnosis, disease progression and resolution. This review aims to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of various imaging techniques used in the diagnosis and management of NOE over the years and whether a multi-modal imaging technique at particular stages of the disease may provide better management outcomes.",['Khan HA'],2021,13,12,Cureus,Khan HA.

34943718,"Delafloxacin, Finafloxacin, and Zabofloxacin: Novel Fluoroquinolones in the Antibiotic Pipeline.","Novel antimicrobial agents, approved for clinical use in past years, represent potential treatment options for various infections. In this review, we summarize the most important medical and microbiological features of three recently approved fluoroquinolones, namely delafloxacin, finafloxacin, and zabofloxacin. Delafloxacin possesses an anionic chemical structure, and represents broad-spectrum activity, as it targets both bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with equal affinity. Its molecular surface is larger than that of other fluoroquinolones, and it has enhanced antibacterial efficacy in acidic environments. Delafloxacin has been approved to treat acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections, as well as community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Finafloxacin has a zwitterionic chemical structure, and targets both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. This enables a broad antibacterial spectrum; however, finafloxacin has so far only been approved in ear-drops to treat bacterial otitis externa. Zabofloxacin is also a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone agent, and was first approved in South Korea to treat acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The introduction of these novel fluoroquinolones into daily practice extends the possible indications of antibiotics into different bacterial infections, and provides treatment options in difficult-to-treat infections. However, some reports of delafloxacin resistance have already appeared, thus underlining the importance of the prudent use of antibiotics.","['Kocsis B', 'Gulyás D', 'Szabó D']",2021,10,12,Antibiotics (Basel),"Kocsis B, et al.

An otic suspension that contains florfenicol, terbinafine and mometasone furoate, and lasts for 30 days after a single application, frequently is used to treat canine otitis externa (OE). This medication was shown to cause adrenocortical suppression on Day (D)2 postadministration and two weeks after two applications two weeks apart.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine if topical florfenicol/terbinafine/mometasone furoate causes adrenocortical suppression in healthy, small-breed dogs with bilateral OE at D28 postapplication.
ANIMAL: Seven client-owned dogs weighing <10 kg diagnosed with non-Pseudomonas bilateral OE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cortisol was measured pre- and post-adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) stimulation on D0. Topical florfenicol/terbinafine/mometasone furoate was applied in both ears. Dogs were reassessed on D28, and cortisol was measured pre- and post-ACTH stimulation.
RESULTS: The median pre- and post-ACTH cortisol concentrations on D28 were 2.5 µg/dL (range 2.0-5.0 µg/dL) and 14.3 µg/dL (range 11.5-23.1 µg/dL), respectively. There was no significant difference (P = 0.85) between post-ACTH cortisol concentrations from D0 to D28.

34826142,Otological complications in inversa type recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.,"BACKGROUND: The rare inversa subtype of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB-I) is characterized by predominant intertriginous skin blistering and marked mucosal involvement. Specific recessive missense mutations in the collagen VII triple helix are implicated in the disease. To date, otological complications have been reported infrequently in this patient group.
METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective, double institution case record review of patients with RDEB-I who presented with otological complications between January 2000 and June 2020. Diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical features, family history and mutation analysis of the COL7A1 gene.
RESULTS: In total, 11 (44%) of 25 patients with RDEB-I in our database (2 paediatric, 9 adult; mean age 40.9 years, range 8-72 years) experienced otological complications. Of these 11 patients, 10 (90.9%) had recurrent otitis externa, 7 (63.6%) had meatal stenosis and 7 (63.6%) had recurrent blistering of the external auditory canals. All 11 patients reported hearing difficulties, with conductive hearing loss confirmed by audiology testing in 6 (54.5%) of these. Of the 11 patients, 3 (27.3%) went on to have implantable hearing aids [2 bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA) and 1 middle ear implant (MEI)] fitted with favourable outcome, while a fourth paediatric patient presented with a cholesteatoma that was surgically managed.
DISCUSSION: We observed a higher prevalence of otological morbidity in RDEB-I than previously reported, and present the first case of cholesteatoma in epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Our data indicate that BAHA and MEI are safe and effective treatment options for hearing loss in EB. Clinicians should be vigilant in screening for ear symptoms in RDEB-I and consider early referral to an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.","['Robertson SJ', 'Prodinger C', 'Liu L', 'Skilbeck C', 'Petrof G', 'Martinez AE', 'Mellerio JE', 'Greenblatt DT']",2022,47,4,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Robertson SJ, et al.

METHOD: This is a mixed-methods study drawing on data from primary and secondary care and open National Health Service sources.
RESULTS: A total of 101 general practitioner survey respondents reported frequently prescribing oral antibiotics for otitis externa. General practitioner consultations for otitis externa increased 25 per cent over 15 years. General practitioner ototopical preparations cost the National Health Service £7 410 440 in 2006 and £11 325 241 in 2016.

34799270,Predictive value of radiologic studies for malignant otitis externa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Necrotizing Otitis Externa (NOE) based on radiologic studies.
METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases were searched. True-positive and false-negative results were extracted for each study. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool.
RESULTS: The included studies contained data on 37 studies diagnosed with NOE. The sensitivity of gallium-67, technetium-99m, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was 0.9378 (0.7688-0.9856), 0.9699 (0.8839-0.9927), and 0.9417 (0.6968-0.9913), respectively. For Computed Tomography (CT), the positive criteria consisted of bony erosion alone and bony erosion plus any soft tissue abnormality. The sensitivity of CT based only on bony erosion was 0.7062 (0.5954-0.7971); it was higher 0.9572 (0.9000-0.9823) when based on bony erosion plus any soft tissue abnormality.
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic sensitivity of technetium-99m, gallium-67, and MRI was favorable. On CT, the presence of bony erosion may be a useful diagnostic marker of NOE, but the diagnostic sensitivity will be even higher if the criterion of any soft tissue abnormality is also included; however, care should be taken when interpreting the results. Our study demonstrates the potential utility of radiology studies for diagnosing NOE, but their lack of specificity must be considered, and standardized anatomic criteria are still needed.

The aim of this study was to explore the potential cost of a cohort of patients with necrotising otitis externa presenting to a single tertiary NHS trust.
METHOD: This was a retrospective study with data from 14 patients with confirmed necrotising otitis externa who were treated, monitored, discharged or who died between October 2016 and November 2018. Direct costs using the tariffs from the 2018 to 2019 financial year included in-patient stay, imaging, peripheral inserted central catheter line cost, ENT and out-patient parenteral antibiotic therapy visits and antimicrobial duration.
RESULTS: The mean cost of treatment per patient was £17 615 (range, £9407 to £38 230) with an extreme outlier costing more than £122 000.

Imaging plays a crucial role because symptoms can be vague and nonlocalizing. Necrotizing otitis externa in diabetic or immunocompromised patients is the commonest cause of skull base osteomyelitis (SBO), followed by sinogenic infections and idiopathic central SBO. Multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and high-resolution CT are the mainstays for establishing a diagnosis and estimating disease extent, with MR being superior in ascertaining marrow and soft tissue involvement.

METHOD: This was a closed audit cycle in a tertiary ENT centre of patients presenting with necrotising otitis externa to the ENT department between 2015 and 2019. The aim was to audit the length of hospital stay in comparison to national figures as well as the time needed for investigations.
RESULTS: The number of patients with necrotising otitis externa is increasing in England. Length of stay, however, appears to be more stable. A total of 66 admissions occurred over the study period for 48 patients in total, and mean length of stay was 12.4 days. After implementation of a new protocol, length of stay was reduced to 7.1 days.
CONCLUSION: Patients with necrotising otitis externa require prompt diagnosis and management in order to shorten length of stay in hospital and avoid serious complications. Multi-disciplinary protocol development and implementation could help in reducing length of stay of necrotising otitis externa patients.","['Mohammed H', 'Chean Khun Ng J', 'Qureshi MH', 'Yates P']",2022,136,7,J Laryngol Otol,"Mohammed H, et al.

To date, it has not been demonstrated how the upper respiratory tract inflammation spreads from the primary infection site to internal jugular vein and systemic thrombosis. We report a very rare case of Lemierre's syndrome derived from malignant otitis externa in which the spread of infection and thrombosis process were identified by imaging. A 61-year-old man with severe diabetes mellitus visited our hospital with consciousness disturbance and right posterior neck pain. He complained of right ear pain and otorrhea several days prior to the neck pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated thrombosis in internal jugular vein and multiple lung abscesses. Temporal bone images revealed continuous lesions from skull base osteomyelitis to suboccipital abscess and sigmoid sinus thrombosis. We diagnosed the patient as having Lemierre's syndrome secondary to skull base osteomyelitis following malignant otitis externa. The patient clinically recovered with a combination of drainage of suboccipital abscess and long-term administration of antibiotics, which is the standard treatment of malignant otitis externa. Considering the details of imaging and bacterial examination is very useful for understanding the pathophysiology and determining appropriate treatment in Lemierre's syndrome pathophysiology and determining appropriate treatment in Lemierre's syndrome.","['Ogi M', 'Takahashi K', 'Morita Y', 'Horii A']",2021,17,5,J Int Adv Otol,"Ogi M, et al.

However, the stability of amikacin within these solutions is unknown.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the stability of amikacin at 10 and 30 mg/mL concentrations in four topical solutions over a 56 day period. We hypothesised that amikacin would maintain chemical stability within the various solutions.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Amikacin was formulated to 10 and 30 mg/mL (1% and 3%) concentrations within four topical solutions: tris-EDTA (TrizEDTA Aqueous Flush) (TE); 0.15% chlorhexidine gluconate and tris-EDTA (TrizCHLOR Flush) (TC); 0.9% NaCl (NA); and 0.9% NaCl + 2 mg/mL dexamethasone (ND). Samples were made in duplicate and stored at room temperature (25°C) for 0, 7,14, 21, 28 and 56 days. Amikacin content was quantified, in triplicate, by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: The recovered amikacin concentrations for the 10 mg/mL solutions ranged from 10 to 13.5 mg/mL (mean 11.5 mg/mL) with the exception of NA sample 2 at Day (D)0 (9.4 mg/mL) and D7 (9.2 mg/mL). The recovered amikacin concentrations for the 30 mg/mL solutions ranged from 30 to 40.2 mg/mL (mean 35.7 mg/mL). No significant difference was seen between the amikacin concentrations at D0 compared to D56 for all solutions except 10 mg/mL TE (P < 0.001).

34488894,Frequency and predisposing factors for canine otitis externa in the UK - a primary veterinary care epidemiological view.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is a commonly diagnosed disorder in dogs and can carry a high welfare impact on affected animals. This study aimed to report the prevalence and explore the role of breed and aural conformation as predisposing factors for canine otitis externa in the UK. The study used a cohort design of dogs under UK primary veterinary care at clinics participating in the VetCompass Programme during 2016. Risk factor analysis used multivariable logistic regression modelling.
RESULTS: The study included a random sample of 22,333 dogs from an overall population of 905,554 dogs under veterinary care in 2016. The one-year period prevalence of otitis externa was 7.30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.97 to 7.65). Breed and ear carriage were the highest ranked risk factors. Compared with crossbred dogs, sixteen breed types showed increased odds, including: Basset Hound (odds ratio [OR] 5.87), Chinese Shar Pei (OR 3.44), Labradoodle (OR 2.95), Beagle (OR 2.54) and Golden Retriever (OR 2.23). Four breeds showed protection (i.e. reduced odds) of otitis externa: Chihuahua (OR 0.20), Border Collie (OR 0.34), Yorkshire Terrier (OR 0.49) and Jack Russell Terrier (OR 0.52). Designer breed types overall had 1.63 times the odds (95% CI 1.31 to 2.03) compared with crossbred dogs. Compared with breeds with erect ear carriage, breeds with pendulous ear carriage had 1.76 times the odds (95% CI 1.48 to 2.10) and breeds with V-shaped drop ear carriage had 1.84 times the odds (95% CI 1.53 to 2.21) of otitis externa.
CONCLUSIONS: Breed itself and breed-associated ear carriage conformation are important predisposing factors for canine otitis externa. Greater awareness of these associations for both predisposed and protected breeds could support veterinary practitioners to promote cautious and low-harm approaches in their clinical advice on preventive care for otitis externa, especially in predisposed breeds.","[""O'Neill DG"", 'Volk AV', 'Soares T', 'Church DB', 'Brodbelt DC', 'Pegram C']",2021,8,1,Canine Med Genet,"O'Neill DG, et al.

She had a background of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stage 2 endometrial adenocarcinoma, treated 18 months ago. Computed tomography scan showed erosion of the skull base and temporal bone. She was referred to the otolaryngology team with a diagnosis of necrotising otitis externa. On clinical examination, there was an exophytic, necrotic lesion in the ear canal arising from the posterior canal wall. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a lesion located in the left jugular foramen extending into the middle ear, with characteristics consistent with a glomus jugulo-tympanicum. Interestingly, histology of the lesion showed malignant cells with immunohistochemical staining suggestive of an adenocarcinoma. This is the first reported case of metastatic endometrial carcinoma involving the jugular foramen and temporal bone. Although a diagnosis is rare, it is important to consider it when other differential diagnoses are not fitting.

34374169,In vitro antimicrobial activity of cold atmospheric microwave plasma against bacteria causing canine skin and ear infections.,"BACKGROUND: Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a new generation medical therapeutic option for bacterial infections. CAP causes physical cell wall rupture and DNA damage, therefore making it highly useful in the treatment of various conditions such as skin infections.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The antimicrobial activity of cold atmospheric microwave plasma (CAMP) against major strains in canine skin infections was tested and the difference in antimicrobial activity between the antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was evaluated.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and clinical isolates identified as methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (n = 27) and methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (n = 13) were exposed to CAMP for 10 s, 30 s and 60 s. Afterwards, the bacterial survival rate was confirmed.
RESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) were more susceptible than Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius) for the same duration of CAMP exposure. Only the Gram-negative bacteria were completely killed after 60 s exposure. In S. pseudintermedius isolates, CAMP exposure had similar antibacterial effects regardless of antibiotic resistance.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: CAMP has sufficient antimicrobial activity against major bacterial strains that cause pyoderma and otitis externa in dogs, and may be an alternative therapeutic option for S. pseudintermedius skin infections, for which antibiotics often are ineffective because of antimicrobial resistance in clinical veterinary medicine.","['Jin HJ', 'Hwang CY', 'Kang JH', 'Baek SJ', 'Hyun JE']",2021,32,5,Vet Dermatol,"Jin HJ, et al.

34370852,Collaborative Care Improves Treatment Outcomes for Dogs with Chronic Otitis Externa: A Collaborative Care Coalition Study.,"The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare outcome measures in dogs treated by a primary care veterinarian (pcDVM) before referral and after seeking collaboration with a board-certified veterinary dermatologist (BCVD) for cases of severe recurrent chronic otitis externa. Medical records of 65 client-owned dogs were retrospectively reviewed, and data were obtained regarding treatment history, referral timeframe, recurrence rate, clinical signs, and resolution of signs. The median number of otitis recurrences while under the care of the pcDVM was 4 (range 1-40) versus collaborative BCVD care of 2 (P < .01). There was a longer median time to otitis recurrence with collaborative care (171 days) compared with dogs managed by the pcDVM before referral (21 days; P > .01). Proliferative changes in the ear canals improved in 41/45 (91%) of cases under BCVD care compared with 6/45 (13%) under care by the pcDVM (P < .01). Dogs with chronic otitis had better long-term outcomes when collaboration with a BCVD was pursued within 6 mo of treatment. Referral or consultation with a BCVD should be considered for cases of chronic canine otitis that are persistent or quickly recurrent (20-30 days) over a 6 mo period.","['Logas D', 'Maxwell EA']",2021,57,5,J Am Anim Hosp Assoc,Logas D and Maxwell EA.

34351013,Evaluation of the use of paired modified Wright's and periodic acid Schiff stains to identify microbial aggregates on cytological smears of dogs with microbial otitis externa and suspected biofilm.,"BACKGROUND: Micro-organisms associated with canine otitis externa (OE) may cause biofilm-associated infections (BAI). A key component of biofilm is microbial aggregate and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) can stain polysaccharide EPS in human otitis media with effusion, but this has not been tested in canine OE. There is no cytological definition for microbial aggregate, and definitive methods for identifying BAI in a clinical setting in canine OE have not been defined.
OBJECTIVES: To establish whether PAS stain can identify polysaccharide matrix on cytological smears; and to determine the reproducibility of identification of microbial aggregates within a discrete area of stained matrix, using paired modified Wright's and PAS-stained smears.
ANIMALS: Forty privately-owned dogs presenting to a dermatological referral practice.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, three investigators independently and blindly classified 40 paired modified Wright's-PAS slide sets into groups: aggregate-associated infection (AAI) and non-AAI (n = 27); and control (n = 13). Agreement between investigators for presence of AAI was measured using Fleiss' kappa statistic (FK). Agreement between investigators and dermatologists for presence of AAI upon cytological evaluation, and suspected BAI based on clinical examination, was measured using Cohen's kappa statistic.
RESULTS: The matrix was confirmed to stain PAS-positive. Interinvestigator agreement for AAI was very good using PAS (0.82 FK) and fair using modified-Wright's (MW) (0.33 FK). Reproducible cytological features associated with AAI were the presence of: three or more distinct aggregates (0.76 FK); discrete areas of PAS-positive matrix (0.70 FK); and the presence of high-density material (0.70 FK) using PAS stain.
CONCLUSION: PAS can stain the extracellular matrix on otic smears, and a novel protocol for reproducible identification of cytological features such as microbial aggregates has been established.","['Parnell-Turner H', 'Griffin CE', 'Rosenkrantz WS', 'Kelly Keating M', 'Bidot WA']",2021,32,5,Vet Dermatol,"Parnell-Turner H, et al.

METHODS: All appointments to a rapid access triage clinic from 1 June to 31 August in 2019 and 2020 were reviewed retrospectively and their reasons for consultation classified. A binomial proportion test was used to determine whether the proportions of consultations per presentation differed significantly between years. This analysis was repeated with the number of unique patients per presenting complaint.
RESULTS: The proportions of nine reasons for consultation differed significantly between 2019 and 2020, including an increase in otitis media and nasal trauma presentations, and a decrease in otitis externa and tonsillitis presentations. Reattendances caused some variation in the frequency of certain diagnoses.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a shift in the presentations to first-on-call services, which may be a result of changes in patient behaviour and access to healthcare services.","['Allen H', 'Winstanley J', 'Stubington TJ', 'Judd O']",2021,135,9,J Laryngol Otol,"Allen H, et al.

34273591,Standardised treatment protocol for necrotizing otitis externa: retrospective case series and systematic literature review.,"OBJECTIVES: There is currently no consensus on the most effective treatment protocol for necrotizing otitis externa (NOE). This article aims to produce a NOE treatment protocol from the literature and clinical experience.
METHODS: A total of 26 case series from the literature were reviewed in combination with a retrospective case series of inpatients from Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust from 2013-2018. Over 5 years, 40 patients were identified, with only 29 being analysed due to unavailable or incomplete case notes.
RESULTS: In the literature review, the most common bacterial species causing NOE was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was prevalent, however multidrug resistance was rare. Ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were the most widely used antibiotics. No ceftazidime resistance was reported in the literature or in our cohort. The average age of the patients in our cohort was 80 years. Moreover, 62% had either diabetes mellitus or were immunosuppressed. One patient died directly due to NOE-related sepsis. Intravenous ceftazidime monotherapy was mostly used. The duration of treatment was 6-7 weeks, with no relapses documented.
CONCLUSION: Ceftazidime monotherapy was an effective empirical treatment in our cohort, and a total duration of 6-7 weeks of antibiotics was sufficient. We have created a standardised treatment protocol based on our findings that will need to be validated in a larger cohort of patients.","['Frost J', 'Samson AD']",2021,26,,J Glob Antimicrob Resist,Frost J and Samson AD.

34254846,Feline cystadenomatosis affecting the ears and skin of 57 cats (2011-2019).,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand epidemiological factors associated with feline cystadenomatosis, including signalment and papillomavirus PCR status. Cystadenomatosis is an uncommon condition primarily involving the ceruminous and apocrine skin and ear glands.
METHODS: This was a retrospective case series. Clinical records from 2011 to 2019 from a tertiary referral hospital in Boston, MA, USA were screened for cases, and case data were re-evaluated and analyzed. The total patient pool contained 65,385 individual cats, of which 797 were referred to the dermatology service. Medical records and biopsy specimens were reviewed; the information collected included signalment, clinical signs, physical examination and diagnostic tests, comorbidities and histopathologic findings. PCR was performed on biopsy specimens to test for papillomavirus DNA.
RESULTS: The cystadenomatosis population consisted of 57 cases (7.1% of total cases referred to the dermatology service) with 105 affected ears. Twenty-seven cases (48 ears) were confirmed via histopathology; four cats (7%) exhibited clinically cystic lesions on the periocular, periorbital and perianal regions; only one cat did not have pinnal lesions. Domestic shorthair cats were most often affected. Relative risk for cystadenomatosis was 2.24 times higher in male cats. In 48 cats (84.2%), ears were bilaterally affected. Seven cats (12.3%) had malignant neoplasia, which included: inflamed adenocarcinoma (n = 5); mast cell tumor (n = 1); or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). PCR testing on biopsy specimens from 24 cats revealed feline papillomavirus type 2 DNA in only four cats.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cystadenomatosis was more prevalent in senior non-purebred cats, over-represented in male cats and did not appear to be associated with papillomavirus, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukemia virus status or other identifiable illnesses.

34242952,Accuracy and patient perceived difficulty of utilizing ototopical antibiotic therapy.,"PURPOSE: To examine how patients self-administer ear drops, ascertain their perceived difficulty in performing the task and determine if they are able to deliver the correct dosage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study performed in an otology outpatient clinic with twenty-one subjects with a condition requiring ototopical antibiotics. The number of ear drops applied as well as skills performed during ear drop application was measured. Patient reported difficulty and confidence in application of ear drops data was also obtained.
RESULTS: The mean number of drops applied was 2.91 ± 2.1 (target = 3 drops) with a large variance in drop application, range of 0.6 to 9.2 drops. If ""correct dosage"" is considered 85-115% of the intended dose, then almost half of patients, 47.6%, underdosed with 23.8% that over dosed. Patients reported that the average difficulty in applying drops to themselves was 3.6 (1 being easy and 10 being difficult). Patients reported a high confidence level in applying the correct dose of ear drops of 6.7 (1 being not confident and 10 being very confident).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study of 21 patients self-administering ear drops, only 28.6% of patients were able to correctly apply the appropriate treatment dose, with almost half of patients underdosing. Questionnaire data indicated that most patients were unaware they were administering an incorrect dose. Inaccurate administration of ear drops could be problematic and lead to longer durations of symptoms, false treatment failures, and increased costs.","['Selleck AM', 'Dedmon MM']",2021,42,5,Am J Otolaryngol,Selleck AM and Dedmon MM.

METHODOLOGY: A 10-year retrospective review was carried out on MOE in a single otology institution from January 2011 to December 2020. The MOE was classified based on proposed Tengku's radiological stratification according to HRCT and TBPS findings. Phase I is defined as inflammation limited to the soft tissue in the external auditory canal, without involvement of the bone. Phase II is the inflammation beyond the soft tissue, involving bone, but limited to the mastoid. Phase III is when the inflammation extends medially, involving the petrous temporal bone or temporomandibular joint, with or without parapharyngeal soft tissue involvement. Phase IV refers to inflammation extending medially to involve the nasopharynx, with or without abscess formation. Finally, Phase V is inflammation that further extends to the contralateral base of the skull.
RESULTS: A sample of 49 patients was involved in this study. Majority of the patients were having Phase III (36.7%) of the disease, followed by Phase V (24.5%), Phase II (18.4%), Phase IV (16.3%), and Phase I (4.1%). A comprehensive treatment algorithm was drafted based on our institution's experience in managing MOE. The mortality rate was low (8.2%), mainly involving patients in advanced phase of the disease (Phases IV and V).
CONCLUSION: This study has revealed the evidence of progression of MOE based on the proposed radiological stratification. This stratification is simple and practically applicable in clinical settings. We suggest the use of our proposed treatment algorithm as a standard diagnostic and treatment protocol for MOE.","['Kamalden TMIT', 'Misron K']",2022,279,6,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,Kamalden TMIT and Misron K.

34226449,Efficacy of Clotrimazole 1% Solution Compared to Econazole Nitrate 1% + Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% Cream in Patient with Otomycosis.,"Fungal infection of the ear canal is called Otomycosis. It is more common in hot and humid condition. There are many modalities of treatment or therapeutic agent for treatment of otomycosis. Econazole Nitrate 1% + Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% cream is a topical antifungal agent described to be effective in the treatment of otomycosis. This study was performed to compare the efficacy of topical application clotrimazole 1% solution and Econazole Nitrate 1% + Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% cream in the treatment of otomycosis. A controlled, randomized and open clinical trial was carried out in ENT department of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from January 2020 to July 2020. Patients diagnosed with fungal otitis externa who were treated with topical antifungals were included in this study. They were randomized into two treatment groups: i) Clotrimazole 1% solution, 2) Econazole Nitrate 1% + Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% cream. Patients were microscopically evaluated at two weeks of treatment to determine resolution of disease. Recurrence and complications were recorded. Demographic and clinical variables were collected and analyzed, follow up and final outcomes (absence of infection) were compared between two groups. One hundred & two (102) patients were included, 51 in the clotrimazole 1% solution group and 51 in the Econazole Nitrate 1% + Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% cream group. Predominant symptoms are pain, pruritus, aural fullness and hearing loss. Aspergillus organism was isolated most frequently (63.73%).

34191783,A Web-Based Deep Learning Model for Automated Diagnosis of Otoscopic Images.,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a multiclass-classifier deep learning model and website for distinguishing tympanic membrane (TM) pathologies based on otoscopic images.
METHODS: An otoscopic image database developed by utilizing publicly available online images and open databases was assessed by convolutional neural network (CNN) models including ResNet-50, Inception-V3, Inception-Resnet-V2, and MobileNetV2. Training and testing were conducted with a 75:25 breakdown. Area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were used to compare different CNN models' performances in classifying TM images.
RESULTS: Our database included 400 images, organized into normal (n = 196) and abnormal classes (n = 204), including acute otitis media (n = 116), otitis externa (n = 44), chronic suppurative otitis media (n = 23), and cerumen impaction (n = 21). For binary classification between normal versus abnormal TM, the best performing model had average AUC-ROC of 0.902 (MobileNetV2), followed by 0.745 (Inception-Resnet-V2), 0.731 (ResNet-50), and 0.636 (Inception-V3). Accuracy ranged between 0.73-0.77, sensitivity 0.72-0.88, specificity 0.58-0.84, PPV 0.68-0.81, and NPV 0.73-0.83. Macro-AUC-ROC for MobileNetV2 based multiclass-classifier was 0.91, with accuracy of 66%. Binary and multiclass-classifier models based on MobileNetV2 were loaded onto a publicly accessible and user-friendly website (https://headneckml.com/tympanic). This allows the readership to upload TM images for real-time predictions using the developed algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: Novel CNN algorithms were developed with high AUC-ROCs for differentiating between various TM pathologies. This was further deployed as a proof-of-concept publicly accessible website for real-time predictions.","['Tsutsumi K', 'Goshtasbi K', 'Risbud A', 'Khosravi P', 'Pang JC', 'Lin HW', 'Djalilian HR', 'Abouzari M']",2021,42,9,Otol Neurotol,"Tsutsumi K, et al.

34189794,Chemical and microbiological stability of diluted ceftazidime in three different solutions under three storage temperatures over a 28 day period.,"BACKGROUND: Ceftazidime (CAZ) solutions are being used based on anecdotal reports for otitis externa complicated by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR PA). The chemical and microbiological stability of these proposed compounded solutions have not been evaluated, and likely are affected by the diluent and storage duration or temperature.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Compounded CAZ solutions would show variable degradation dependent on diluent, time and temperature. The antimicrobial activity of the solutions would reflect changes in concentration and not alterations to the chemical compound.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ceftazidime was compounded with 100 mL 0.9% sodium chloride (NA+CAZ), 118 mL Triz-EDTA Aqueous flush (TE+CAZ) and 125 mL Douxo Micellar Solution (MI+CAZ). Aliquots of the solutions were stored at 25°C, 4°C and -20°C for 28 days. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse CAZ recovery from compounded solutions at weekly intervals. A modified broth dilution technique was utilised to assess minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to monitor antimicrobial activity against a reference PA strain.
RESULTS: Temperature, duration of storage and diluent each had independent effects on the chemical stability of CAZ. CAZ concentrations decreased over time as well as with increased temperature. NA+CAZ solutions exhibited the least degradation compared to the other solutions. The MIC for PA was most consistent for NA+CAZ solutions regardless of storage temperature and duration of storage.

34189776,Malassezia otitis unresponsive to primary care: outcome in 59 dogs.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa (OE) is a common disorder in dogs. Infection by the commensal yeast, Malassezia pachydermatis, may result in chronic disease that does not respond to standard primary care. Chronic infectious OE may be associated with otitis media (OM).
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: To report medical management, clinical outcomes and frequency of middle ear involvement, in dogs with Malassezia otitis unresponsive to primary care.
ANIMALS: Fifty-nine dogs from one referral veterinary hospital from January 2007 to September 2018.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Retrospective analysis of medical records of dogs referred with chronic otitis and treated for Malassezia otitis at a referral veterinary hospital.
RESULTS: Chronic Malassezia OE was treated successfully in 91% of ears, in 87% of these cases with one ear flush intervention. Median time-to-resolution was 27 days after ear flush intervention. Neither duration of otitis, presence of neutrophils in aural discharge nor administration of oral itraconazole affected clinical outcome. Malassezia OM occurred concurrently in 17% of ears.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These findings assist clinicians and carers of affected dogs in decision-making, by documenting that most cases of canine Malassezia otitis that have not resolved with standard primary care, can be treated successfully with a well-staged and intense medical treatment plan. Malassezia OM should be suspected to occur concurrently in around a fifth of affected ears.","['Boone JM', 'Bond R', 'Loeffler A', 'Ferguson EA', 'Hendricks A']",2021,32,5,Vet Dermatol,"Boone JM, et al.

34185016,Biannual Differences in Interest Peaks for Web Inquiries Into Ear Pain and Ear Drops: Infodemiology Study.,"BACKGROUND: The data retrieved with the online search engine, Google Trends, can summarize internet inquiries into specified search terms. This engine may be used for analyzing inquiry peaks for different medical conditions and symptoms.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze World Wide Web interest peaks for ""ear pain,"" ""ear infection,"" and ""ear drops.""
METHODS: We used Google Trends to assess the public online interest for search terms ""ear pain,"" ""ear infection,"" and ""ear drops"" in 5 English and non-English-speaking countries from both hemispheres based on time series data. We performed our analysis for the time frame between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2019. First, we assessed whether our search terms were most relevant to the topics of ear pain, ear infection, and ear drops. We then tested the reliability of Google Trends time series data using the intraclass correlation coefficient. In a second step, we computed univariate time series plots to depict peaks in web-based interest. In the last step, we used the cosinor analysis to test the statistical significance of seasonal interest peaks.
RESULTS: In the first part of the study, it was revealed that ""ear infection,"" ""ear pain,"" and ""ear drops"" were the most relevant search terms in the noted time frame. Next, the intraclass correlation analysis showed a moderate to excellent reliability for all 5 countries' 3 primary search terms. The subsequent analysis revealed winter interest peaks for ""ear infection"" and ""ear pain"". On the other hand, the World Wide Web search for ""ear drops"" peaked annually during the summer months. All peaks were statistically significant as revealed by the cosinor model (all P values <.001).
CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that individuals affected by otitis media or externa, possibly the majority, look for medical information online. Therefore, there is a need for accurate and easily accessible information on these conditions in the World Wide Web, particularly on differentiating signs and therapy options. Meeting this need may facilitate timely diagnosis, proper therapy, and eventual circumvention of potentially life-threatening complications.","['Brkic FF', 'Besser G', 'Schally M', 'Schmid EM', 'Parzefall T', 'Riss D', 'Liu DT']",2021,23,6,J Med Internet Res,"Brkic FF, et al.

Although the antibiofilm activity of AgNPs has been demonstrated in humans, this activity has not yet been elucidated in veterinary medicine.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of silver nanoparticles against Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
METHODS: Ten isolates of S. pseudintermedius obtained from dogs with otitis externa were treated with AgNPs, and the antibiofilm activity was measured using a modified microtiter plate and Congo red agar (CRA) method and scanning electron microscopy.
RESULTS: AgNPs displayed a significant dose-dependent antibiofilm activity and reduced biofilm formation at concentrations of 20 and 10 µg/ml (p < 0.05). S. pseudintermedius exposed to 20 µg/ml of AgNPs formed less bacterial slime compared to the controls on CRA plates. Scanning electron micrographs showed that the biofilm had few individually scattered cells along its surface when treated with AgNP concentrations of 20 and 10 µg/ml. Untreated surfaces showed an aggregated biofilm.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that AgNP may be a valuable alternative antibiofilm agent for canine otitis externa.","['Seo M', 'Oh T', 'Bae S']",2021,7,5,Vet Med Sci,"Seo M, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was performed in April 2020 for studies on SBO with a minimum sample size of 10 patients. Studies that reported presenting symptoms, cross-sectional imaging findings, complications, and mortality were included in the analysis. The quality of included articles was tested using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. A data extraction form was used to retrieve relevant parameters from each of the articles.
RESULTS: Thirteen articles were included in the final analysis. Diabetes mellitus was the most common predisposing factor (12.5-91.0%). Presenting complaints in all bacterial SBO studies were otogenic, while fungal SBO patients had nasal/ocular complaints. Rates of mortality and surgical intervention in the fungal group were 50-100% and 50%, respectively, as compared to the bacterial group - 7-87% and 10%, respectively. On imaging, the site of initial infection in bacterial SBO was the external auditory canal, while in fungal SBO it was the paranasal sinus. The incidence of orbital extension was < 5% in bacterial and 44-70% in fungal SBO, among which

34119229,Clinical and Genetic Findings in 28 American Cocker Spaniels with Aural Ceruminous Gland Hyperplasia and Ectasia.,"American Cocker Spaniels (ACSs) develop aural ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia more often than dogs of other breeds. Data on the cause and development of these breed characteristic histopathological changes are lacking. We performed video-otoscopic examinations and dermatological work-up on 28 ACSs, obtained aural biopsies from each dog and assessed the statistical associations between the presence of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia and disease history, clinical or microbiological findings and underlying cause of otitis externa (OE). Histological lesions of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia were observed in aural biopsies from 6/13 clinically healthy ears and 13/15 ears with OE from 19/28 examined dogs. Nine of 28 dogs had histologically normal ceruminous glands (odds ratio [OR] 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-36.6). Bacterial growth in microbiological culture of aural exudate (OR 14.1, 95% CI 2.1-95.3) was associated with ceruminous glandular changes, whereas previous history of OE, cutaneous findings or underlying allergies were not. Pedigree analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) were performed on 18 affected and eight unaffected dogs based on histopathological diagnosis. While the GWAS indicated a tentative, but not statistically significant, association of ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia with chromosome 31, a larger cohort is needed to confirm this preliminary result. Based on our results, ceruminous gland hyperplasia and ectasia may also precede clinical signs of OE in ACSs and a genetic aetiological component is likely Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to verify our preliminary results.","['Kaimio M', 'Malkamäki S', 'Kaukonen M', 'Ahonen S', 'Hytönen MK', 'Rantala M', 'Lohi H', 'Saijonmaa-Koulumies L', 'Laitinen-Vapaavuori O']",2021,185,,J Comp Pathol,"Kaimio M, et al.

34091924,Use of a modified Burow's solution to treat canine otitis externa: A randomised comparative clinical study.,"BACKGROUND: Given the increase in antimicrobial drug resistance of several pathogens that affect the ear, there is a need for alternative therapy for canine otitis externa (OE). We hypothesised that the efficacy of modified Burow's solution would be non-inferior to that of standard treatment with Surolan.
METHODS: The treatment success rate of a topical aluminum acetate 2% and betamethasone 0.1% (modified Burow's) otic solution was compared with that of a standard topical otic treatment of polymyxin B sulfate, prednisolone acetate and miconazole (Surolan) suspension in a prospective, open-label clinical trial. For 10 days, 142 dogs (232 ears) with OE were treated with modified Burow's solution or Surolan. The primary study endpoint was the cure rate at 10 days. Clinical efficacy was analysed as a secondary endpoint but without assessment for non-inferiority.
RESULTS: The 10-day OE cure rate was 65% and 59% in the Burow's and Surolan groups, respectively. The modified Burow's solution was non-inferior to Surolan at a non-inferiority margin of -11.5% and was more clinically effective than Surolan in dogs with OE caused by yeast or bacteria.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that modified Burow's solution is an effective treatment for OE in dogs.","['Sadeghi S', 'Kamrani A', 'Kuc U', 'Polissar N', 'Selukar S', 'Sadeghi S']",2022,190,3,Vet Rec,"Sadeghi S, et al.

34033155,Preventive use of a topical anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid in atopic dogs without clinical sign of otitis does not affect ear canal microbiota and mycobiota.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is associated with a lack of bacterial/fungal diversity in atopic dermatitis. Clinical experience has shown that use of topical corticosteroids in the ear canal (EC) can prevent otitis. No data are available on the impact of this treatment on the EC microbiota.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To observe the bacterial/fungal diversity in the EC and the clinical effect of topical corticosteroids administered over a four week period in atopic dogs without active otitis.
ANIMALS: Ten atopic dogs without active otitis.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Mometasone was applied in the right EC, while the left was used as control. A clinical and cytological evaluation of the EC was performed. Swabs of each EC were analysed using next-generation sequencing methods.
RESULTS: At the beginning of the trial, variations in microbiota and mycobiota were observed between dogs and also within individuals. Statistically, no significant difference was observed in alpha and beta diversity between the treated and the untreated group over time. Clinically, right and left EC diversities were no different at Day (D)28 (P = 0.28). A significant difference was noted between D0 and D28 for the treated ears (P = 0.012) and not for the untreated ears (P = 0.63). No cytological evidence of microbes was found for treated ECs at D28.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data suggest that the use of topical corticosteroids as proactive treatment is unlikely to increase the risk of secondary microbial overgrowth. The positive clinical effect of this proactive treatment seems to be supported through cytological and otoscopic improvement.","['Léonard C', 'Taminiau B', 'Ngo J', 'Fantini O', 'Daube G', 'Fontaine J']",2021,32,4,Vet Dermatol,"Léonard C, et al.

34009720,Influence of hospital size on antimicrobial resistance and advantages of restricting antimicrobial use based on cumulative antibiograms in dogs with Staphylococcus pseudintermedius infections in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (SP) and the prevalence of meticillin-resistant SP (MRSP) is increasing in dogs worldwide.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of hospital size on antimicrobial resistance of SP and whether restricted use of antimicrobials based on antibiograms could reduce the identification of antimicrobial resistance in SP from infected dogs.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In Study 1, a total of 2,294 SP isolates from dogs with pyoderma (n = 1,858, 52 hospitals) or otitis externa (OE; n = 436, 44 hospitals) taken between 2017 and 2019 were analysed. Clinics were categorised into small, medium and large based on numbers of practicing veterinary surgeons. In Study 2, a cumulative antibiogram was constructed for 12 antimicrobials from one large veterinary clinic from 2017 to 2018. Referring to this antibiogram, the clinic introduced strict antimicrobial selection criteria to treat dogs with pyoderma and OE, starting in 2018.
RESULTS: MRSP was identified in 981 dogs (42.8%). In large clinics, the isolation rate of MRSP was 51.1% (404 of 791), which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in small clinics with less than two veterinary practitioners (34.0%, 154 of 453). In the antibiogram study, the susceptibility rates of oxacillin (MPIPC, 61.5%), cefpodoxime (CPDX, 55.8%) and minocycline (MINO, 55.8%) were significantly higher in 2019 (n = 52) than in 2017 to 2018 (n = 54; MPIPC, 37.0%; CPDX, 33.3%; MINO, 20.4%; P < 0.05).

34009660,In vitro activity of lactoferricin solution against Malassezia pachydermatis from otitis externa in dogs and cats.,"BACKGROUND: Malassezia pachydermatis is a commensal organism of the skin, yet it may induce dermatitis and/or otitis. Lactoferricin (Lfcin) is an antimicrobial peptide obtained by the pepsin-mediated digestion of lactoferrin, a multifunctional innate-defence milk protein. The antibacterial activity of Lfcin is thought to cause alteration of bacterial membrane permeability, thus inducing cell death.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro antifungal activity of different dilutions of Lfcin solution against M. pachydermatis strains isolated from ears of dogs and cats with otitis externa.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty clinical Malassezia isolates from 40 dogs and 10 cats were tested. A dilution method in microtitre plates was used starting with a 20% Lfcin water solution. The different dilutions were 2:1 (13.3%), 1:1 (10%), 1:2 (6.7%), 1:5 (3.3%) and 1:10 (1.8%). Results were expressed as the value at which the growth of 50% (minimal fungicidal concentration MFC
RESULTS: All strains showed susceptibility to 20% Lfcin solution (100%). With 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions corresponding to 3.3% and 1.8% Lfcin solutions, all strains showed resistance. The MFC
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results indicated that Lfcin solution exhibits the antimicrobial activity specific to antimicrobial peptides.

33989313,"Acute otitis externa: Consensus definition, diagnostic criteria and core outcome set development.","OBJECTIVE: Evidence for the management of acute otitis externa (AOE) is limited, with unclear diagnostic criteria and variably reported outcome measures that may not reflect key stakeholder priorities. We aimed to develop 1) a definition, 2) diagnostic criteria and 3) a core outcome set (COS) for AOE.
STUDY DESIGN: COS development according to Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) methodology and parallel consensus selection of diagnostic criteria/definition.
SETTING: Stakeholders from the United Kingdom.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Comprehensive literature review identified candidate items for the COS, definition and diagnostic criteria. Nine individuals with past AOE generated further patient-centred candidate items. Candidate items were rated for importance by patient and professional (ENT doctors, general practitioners, microbiologists, nurses, audiologists) stakeholders in a three-round online Delphi exercise. Consensus items were grouped to form the COS, diagnostic criteria, and definition.
RESULTS: Candidate COS items from patients (n = 28) and literature (n = 25) were deduplicated and amalgamated to a final candidate list (n = 46). Patients emphasised quality-of-life and the impact on daily activities/work. Via the Delphi process, stakeholders agreed on 31 candidate items. The final COS covered six outcomes: pain; disease severity; impact on quality-of-life and daily activities; patient satisfaction; treatment-related outcome; and microbiology. 14 candidate diagnostic criteria were identified, 8 reaching inclusion consensus. The final definition for AOE was 'diffuse inflammation of the ear canal skin of less than 6 weeks duration'.
CONCLUSION: The development and adoption of a consensus definition, diagnostic criteria and a COS will help to standardise future research in AOE, facilitating meta-analysis. Consulting former patients throughout development highlighted deficiencies in the outcomes adopted previously, in particular concerning the impact of AOE on daily life.","['Smith ME', 'Hardman JC', 'Mehta N', 'Jones GH', 'Mandavia R', 'Anderson C', 'Khan M', 'Abdelaziz A', 'Al-Dulaimy B', 'Amin N', 'Anmolsingh R', 'Anwar B', 'Bance M', 'Belfield K', 'Bhutta M', 'Buchanan R', 'Chandrasekharan D', 'Chu M', 'Chundu S', 'Conroy K', 'Crundwell G', 'Daniel M', 'Daniels J', 'De S', 'Dobbs S', 'Doshi J', 'Farr M', 'Ferdous T', 'Fragkouli E', 'Freeman S', 'Ghosh S', 'Gosnell E', 'Hannan SA', 'Heward E', 'Javed F', 'John D', 'Nicholls H', 'Kasbekar AV', 'Khan H', 'Khan H', 'Khwaja S', 'Kotecha B', 'Krishnan M', 'Kumar N', 'Lamb T', 'Lancer H', 'Manjaly JG', 'Martinez Del Pero M', 'McClenaghan F', 'Milinis K', 'Mistry N', 'Mohammed H', 'Morris E', 'Morris-Jones S', 'Padee J', 'Pal S', 'Patel S', 'Pericleous A', 'Qayyum A', 'Rouhani M', 'Saeed H', 'Santhiyapillai M', 'Seymour K', 'Sharma S', 'Siau R', 'Singh A', 'Stapleton E', 'Stephenson K', 'Stynes G', 'Subramanian B', 'Summerfield N', 'Swords C', 'Trinidade A', 'Tse A', 'Twumasi E', 'Ubhi H', 'Unadkat S', 'Vijendren A', 'Wasson J', 'Watson G', 'Williams G', 'Wilson J', 'Yao A', 'Youssef A', 'Lloyd SKW', 'Tysome JR', 'INTEGRATE (The UK ENT Trainee Research Network)']",2021,16,5,PLoS One,"Smith ME, et al.

33961315,Extra-auricular lesions of proliferative and necrotizing otitis externa in three kittens.,"BACKGROUND: Proliferative and necrotising otitis externa (PNOE) is a rare disorder in cats with poorly understood pathogenesis. Extra-auricular (EA) lesions recently have been mentioned in a textbook and in one case report.
OBJECTIVES: To describe EA lesions associated with PNOE in three kittens.
ANIMALS: A 6-month-old female domestic short hair (DSH) cat (Case 1), an 8-month-old female DSH cat (Case 2) and a 5-month-old female DSH cat (Case 3).
METHODS AND RESULTS: All cases exhibited classical lesions of PNOE associated with EA lesions, generalised (cases 1 and 3) or limited to eyelids (Case 2). Lesions were characterised by thick, adherent, hyperkeratotic papules coalescing to plaques and attempts to remove the hyperkeratotic plaques resulted in erosions. Histopathological examinations revealed classical features of PNOE: severe acanthosis associated with a marked lymphocytic exocytosis, satellitosis and apoptotic keratinocytes at all levels of the epidermis and the outer root sheath of hair follicles. Cases 2 and 3 resolved spontaneously. Case 1 remained stable with topical tacrolimus and oral prednisolone after a short course of ciclosporin.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This report describes EA lesions of PNOE in three kittens. Such lesions may be underdiagnosed, and this report emphasises the role of a thorough clinical inspection in PNOE cases.","['Panzuti P', 'Jongh O', 'Dony M', 'Vial S', 'Mosca M', 'Pin D']",2021,32,4,Vet Dermatol,"Panzuti P, et al.

This was due to skull-based osteomyelitis from necrotizing otitis externa (NOE), causing lower cranial nerve (X, XII) palsies and venous sinus thrombosis. Diagnosis was delayed as the patient reported no otalgia, had an almost normal looking external auditory canal and was not diabetic. He deteriorated and died despite intravenous antibiotics.

33927951,A Systematic Review of Antibiotic Prescription for Acute Otitis Externa.,"BACKGROUND: There is a perception among ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons that oral antibiotics are over-prescribed for acute otitis externa (AOE), and the potential for topical therapy as first-line treatment is not fully realized in primary care. We evaluated the prescription rate of topical and oral antibiotics for AOE in primary care and in patients referred to the ENT emergency clinic.
METHODS: None
RESULTS: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall quality of evidence was moderate. The rate of topical antibiotic prescriptions was between 77% and 95%, and oral antibiotics varied between 6% and 30% in patients that were managed only in primary care. Patients that were referred to an ENT emergency clinic had initially been treated by primary care practitioners with topical antibiotics in 14%-60% of cases and oral antibiotics in 16%-17%. The most commonly prescribed oral antibiotics were Amoxicillin and Co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). No study had comprehensively reviewed the indication for oral antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: The rate of topical antibiotic prescriptions for AOE was high in primary care; however, the rate was frequently suboptimal in patients attending the ENT emergency clinic. Although the rate of oral antibiotic prescriptions was relatively low, the choice of antibiotic for empirical treatment frequently did not cover the typical bacteria in AOE. There is a need for improvement in primary care prescribing of topical therapy prior to referral to the ENT emergency clinic.","['Mughal Z', 'Swaminathan R', 'Al-Deerawi HB', 'Henney S', 'Bickerton R']",2021,13,3,Cureus,"Mughal Z, et al.

33896249,"Chronic Otitis in Cats: Clinical management of primary, predisposing and perpetuating factors.","PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Chronic otitis can be one of the most frustrating diseases to manage for a small animal practitioner. While it occurs less commonly in the cat than the dog, it is no less challenging. The purpose of this review is to discuss the common and uncommon causes of chronic otitis in the cat within the clinical framework used for diagnosis and treatment. The focus is on diseases that affect the ear canal, rather than those restricted to the pinnae.
CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Otitis is multifactorial, which complicates management. A common clinical mistake is to focus solely on treating the infection present. Only by addressing all factors will a clinician successfully control chronic otitis. For the purposes of this review, the authors have adopted the established model of separating primary, predisposing and perpetuating causes of otitis. Primary factors are those that directly cause otitis (inflammation); predisposing factors are those that put the patient at risk for development of otitis; and perpetuating factors are those that result in ongoing clinical signs of otitis or that prevent clinical resolution.
AUDIENCE: This review is aimed at veterinarians who treat cats and particularly those with an interest in feline dermatology and otology.
EQUIPMENT: While many practitioners rely on a hand-held otoscope, a video-otoscope can be very helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic otitis.
EVIDENCE BASE: This review presents up-to-date information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of chronic otitis in cats, with emphasis on the most recent peer-reviewed literature.","['Brame B', 'Cain C']",2021,23,5,J Feline Med Surg,"Brame B and Cain C.

33895893,Diagnosing necrotizing external otitis on CT and MRI: assessment of pattern of extension.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Necrotizing external otitis (NEO) is a serious complication of external otitis. NEO can be classified according to-anterior, medial, posterior, intracranial, and contralateral-extension patterns. Currently there is no consensus on the optimal imaging modality for the identification of disease extension. This study compares NEO extension patterns on MR and CT to evaluate diagnostic comparability.
METHODS: Patients who received a CT and MR within a 3-month interval were retrospectively examined. Involvement of subsites and subsequent spreading patterns were assessed on both modalities by a radiologist in training and by a senior head and neck radiologist. The prevalence of extension patterns on CT and MR were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: All 21 included NEO cases showed an anterior extension pattern on CT and MR. Contrary to MR, medial extension was not recognized on CT in two out of six patients, and intracranial extension in five out of eight patients. The posterior extension pattern was not recognized on MR. Overall, single anterior extension pattern (62%) is more prevalent than multiple extension patterns (38%).
CONCLUSION: All anterior NEO extension pattern were identified on CT as well as MR. However, the medial and intracranial spreading patterns as seen on MR could only be identified on CT in a small number of patients. The posterior spreading pattern can be overlooked on MR. Thus, CT and MR are complimentary for the initial diagnosis and work-up of NEO as to correctly delineate disease extent through the skull base.","['van der Meer WL', 'Waterval JJ', 'Kunst HPM', 'Mitea C', 'Pegge SAH', 'Postma AA']",2022,279,3,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"van der Meer WL, et al.

33842734,A novel video-endoscope-guided myringotomy technique in dogs: Investigation in the value of vertical access to the tympanic membrane from beneath the patient - a pilot study.,"Myringotomy is a well-accepted method for diagnosing and treating otitis media in dogs having an intact tympanic membrane. In a recent study, the contamination rate of middle ear aspirates from the external ear canal via myringotomy was 67%. To evaluate the iatrogenic contamination rate of the middle ear aspirates by material from the ear canal, using a novel technique: Vertical access to the tympanic membrane from beneath the patient. Thirty-six ears from 20 canine Fresh cadavers with a CT scan negative for otitis externa and otitis media were video-otoscopically flushed with the ear upside. The instillation of the fluorescent dye into the ear canal and immediate retrieval were performed. With the patient positioned on a custom-made fenestrated table plate, a modified video-otoscopically guided myringotomy approaching the tympanum vertically from underneath, was performed. Contamination rates were assessed by the visual detection of fluorescent dye within the aspirated fluid, either by yellow staining solely, or a positive fluorescence test. Cytology and microbial cultivation were accomplished. Middle ear sample contamination by the material from the ear canal was identified in 2 of 36 (5.55%) ears. Neither a change in colour nor fluorescence was detected in 34 of 36 (94.44%) middle ear samples. Sixteen of 36 (44.44%) external ear canal samples and 4 of 36 (11.11%) middle ear aspirates had positive bacterial culture.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 120 ear aspiration specimens with otomycosis suspicion were subjected to manual DNA extraction using phenol-chloroform extraction after tissue digestion with a lysis buffer. The multiplex PCR was initially performed using pan-fungal and bacterial homemade primers. 
RESULTS: The overall multiplex PCR-based detection rate of bacterial (n = 88; 73.3%) and fungal (n = 97; 81%) OE was documented to be 100% along with and complete consistency with the results of direct examination and Giemsa staining. Double amplicon bands of bacterial and fungal pathogens were evidenced in 76 specimens (63.3%). Moreover, the positivity rate of pan-fungal PCR was higher than that of the culture result.

It was aimed to evaluate the relationship between treatment responses and clinical and radiologic parameters among progress of the disease. Secondary aim was to present our clinical outcomes in the treatment of malignant otitis externa.
METHOD: This study was retrospectively conducted in a single center. Reviewed data included history of complaints, duration of symptoms, addition of hyperbaric oxygen treatment, presence of surgical intervention, pathological findings, culture positivity and microorganism, laboratory findings, scintigraphy, imaging modalities and outcome of disease.
RESULT: A total of 26 cases with malignant external otitis including 17 females (65.4%) and nine males (34.6%) patients were included in our study. Duration of symptoms before the initiation of treatment, and hyperbaric oxygen treatment did not positively influence the outcome. Inflammatory markers and Peleg staging significantly reflected the treatment response.
CONCLUSION: Close monitoring of inflammatory parameters is the key point in the prediction of prognosis. Planning the management and predicting the outcomes rely on proper radiological and clinical assessment of the extent of disease.

33792784,Diabetes and glycemic control in necrotizing otitis externa (NOE).,"PURPOSE: Although the association between necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is well known, there is little knowledge in regards to the effects of DM and glycemic control on the outcome of NOE. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of DM duration and glycemic control, and in-hospital glycemic control on NOE severity.
METHODS: A retrospective case series analysis, including all patients hospitalized between 1990 and 2018 due to NOE were included. Data collected included NOE disease characteristics, duration of DM, DM-associated comorbidities, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), urine microalbumin and in-hospital blood glucose measurements. Disease severity was defined based on duration of hospitalization (above or below 20 days) and need for surgery.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were included in the study. Eighty-three patients (94.3%) had DM. Preadmission HbA1c was 8.13% (5.8-12.6%). Forty-nine patients (65.5%) had mean blood glucose of ≥ 140 mg/dL and 26 (34.5%) had ≤ 140 mg/dL. DM duration was 157.88 months among NOE patients who required surgery, and 127.6 months among patients who were treated conservatively (p value 0.25). HbA1c in patients hospitalized < 20 days was 7.6%, and 8.7% among NOE hospitalized ≥ 20 days (p value 0.027). Seven patients with mean blood glucose of ≤ 140 mg/dL had Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA-NOE) (26.7%), in comparison to 25 (51.0%) with mean blood glucose measurement of ≥ 140 mg/dL (p = 0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c at admission is associated with longer hospitalization duration among NOE patients. Mean blood glucose during hospitalization was associated with a higher likelihood of PA infection, however, it had no effect on disease outcome.","['Peled C', 'Sadeh R', 'El-Saied S', 'Novack V', 'Kaplan DM']",2022,279,3,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Peled C, et al.

Newer attempts use video samples to simulate the otoscopy exam which is a dynamic process.Aims/Objective: To assess whether recorded otoscopy videos from a smartphone adaptable otoscope can be used to develop a video-based otoscopy quiz which may be used for instructing and familiarizing participants to normal anatomy and pathologic ear conditions. To use this quiz to assess current pediatric residents' competency of common otoscopy diagnosis.
METHOD AND MATERIALS: This study was conducted in 2018. Video samples of ear pathology were collected at the Albany Medical Center using a smartphone adaptable otoscope- Cellscope. The videos were used to create a video otoscopy quiz (VOQ) without clinical vignettes. 45 pediatric residents from 3 academic institutions were evaluated with the quiz.
RESULTS: The weighted mean for the VOQ was 66.90% (95%CI 58.89%-68.42%). The breakdown by questions are: myringosclerosis 72.88%, retraction pocket 80.65%, cholesteatoma 42.22%, hemotympanum 75.04%, tympanic membrane perforation 79.62%, cerumen impaction 95.46%, otitis externa 52.54%, otitis media with effusion 63.30%, acute otitis media 75.55%, normal ear 36.39%.
CONCLUSION: We found that videos of otoscopy exams can be obtained with a smartphone adaptable otoscope and validated to develop a video-based quiz, which may be used to supplement otoscopic instruction.

Children with hearing loss have learning difficulties that adversely affect speech and language acquirement. Most patients with hearing loss can use conventional hearing aids that are partially or completely placed in the external ear canal. Middle ear implants are used when conventional hearing aids are not suitable due to medical reasons, mainly diseases of the external ear canal and the tympanic membrane. The external component of the middle ear implant digitally translates the acoustic information (sound waves) to the implanted part, where the digital information is back-translated to mechanical information (vibrations) which vibrates the ossicle to which it is attached. We present a patient who underwent a Vibrant Soundbridge implantation after unsuccessfully using hearing aids due to recurrent otitis externa. The patient's hearing improved significantly. We conclude that middle ear implants can be an effective treatment for patients who cannot use conventional hearing aids.","['Betito HR', 'Dahan T', 'Halperin D', 'Katzenell U']",2021,160,3,Harefuah,"Betito HR, et al.

The nano-cubosomal formulation ""CUB 1"" (its dispersed phase is composed of GMO (95%), Cremophor EL (2.5%) and Pluronic F108 (2.5%)) was the best achieved one. It had small particles size (216.75 ± 2.47 nm), good polydispersity index (0.339 ± 0.012) and acceptable zeta potential (-41.2 ± 2.262 mV). Images obtained after transmission electron microscopy examination ensured nearly cubic shape of formed nanoparticles with excellent dispersibility. Moreover, micrographs of rabbit ear skin specimens examined by confocal laser microscopy ensured good permeation capability of nano-structured cubosomes.In addition, in vivoskin deposition results revealed that higher amount of NFX was deposited in the rabbit ear skin throughout the study period (10 h) compared to drug suspension. Additionally, histopathological results proved that NFX loaded cubosomes can be safely applied topically on ear skin without any signs of inflammation nor skin irritation. Accordingly, these results anticipated the nano-structured cubosomal capabilities as a favorable nano-carrier for dermal NFX delivery to external ear skin for enhancing the management of otitis externa.","['Al-Mahallawi AM', 'Abdelbary AA', 'El-Zahaby SA']",2021,600,,Int J Pharm,"Al-Mahallawi AM, et al.

METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-nine dogs presenting with vestibular syndrome were included in this retrospective study. Univariate analysis of variables (clinical history, signalment, clinical presentation and neurological examination findings) was performed. Variables with p < 0.3 were selected for logistic regression.
RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of dogs were represented by eight conditions: idiopathic vestibular disease (n = 78 dogs), otitis media interna (n = 54), meningoencephalitis of unknown origin (n = 35), brain neoplasia (n = 26), ischaemic infarct (n = 25), intracranial empyema (n = 4), metronidazole toxicity (n = 3) and neoplasia affecting the middle ear (n = 3). Idiopathic vestibular disease was associated with higher age, higher bodyweight, improving clinical signs, pathological nystagmus, facial nerve paresis, absence of Horner's syndrome and a peripheral localisation. Otitis media interna was associated with younger age, male gender, Horner's syndrome, a peripheral localisation and a history of otitis externa. Ischaemic infarct was associated with older age, peracute onset of signs, absence of strabismus and a central localisation.

33718990,Molecular Identification and Antifungal Susceptibility of Yeasts and Molds Isolated from Patients with Otomycosis.,"Fungal otitis externa, an infection of the external auditory canal caused by molds and yeasts, accounts for approximately 10-20% of ear canal infections accompanying high recurrence. The purpose of the current study was to assess the pattern of etiological agents of otomycosis and resistance profile as well as the rate of tympanic membrane perforation. A total of 1040 patients with symptoms of fungal otitis externa, in a period of two years, were investigated. The mycological tests revealed the presence of different fungi in 237 ears (22.8%). Fungal otitis was more related to filamentous fungi of the species Aspergillus flavus (54.43%), A. tubingensis (10.97%), and A. niger (8.86%), followed by yeasts, Candida orthopsilosis (7.59%), C. albicans (6.75%), and C. parapsilosis (5.06%). Tympanic membrane perforation rate was found to be 6.75% and was more common with otomycosis caused by A. flavus, A. tubingensis and C. albicans. In antifungal susceptibility tests, all tested drugs showed generally good activity against most isolates of molds and yeasts, while tolnaftate, clotrimazole, nystatin, and terbinafine had lowest effects. We found that among Aspergillus isolates, one A. niger isolate was resistant to voriconazole, and one A. flavus isolate was resistant to amphotericin B. Furthermore, among Candida species, three isolates of C. orthopsilosis showed high MIC values to fluconazole, two C. albicans isolates were considered fluconazole resistant and one isolate of C. parapsilosis was resistant to caspofungin and 3 isolates were resistant to fluconazole. Regarding the existence of the cases with perforated tympanic membrane and emerging species causing fungal otitis in the current report, the importance of the early physical examination, precise molecular identification, and the antifungal susceptibility evaluation is highlighted.","['Kiakojuri K', 'Mahdavi Omran S', 'Roodgari S', 'Taghizadeh Armaki M', 'Hedayati MT', 'Shokohi T', 'Haghani I', 'Javidnia J', 'Kermani F', 'Badali H', 'Abastabar M']",2021,186,2,Mycopathologia,"Kiakojuri K, et al.

33689022,Management of tympanic membrane retractions: a systematic review.,"IMPORTANCE: Tympanic membrane retraction (TMR) is a relatively common otological finding. However, no consensus on its management exists. We are looking especially for a treatment strategy in the military population who are unable to attend frequent follow-up visits, and who experience relatively more barotrauma at great heights and depths and easily suffer from otitis externa from less hygienic circumstances.
OBJECTIVE: To assess and summarize the available evidence for the effectiveness of surgical interventions and watchful waiting policy in patients with a tympanic membrane retraction.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: The protocol for this systematic review was published at Prospero (207859). PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched from inception up to September 2020 for published and unpublished studies. We included randomized trials and observational studies that investigated surgical interventions (tympanoplasty, ventilation tube insertion) and wait-and-see policy. The primary outcomes of this study were clinical remission of the tympanic membrane retraction, tympanic membrane perforations and cholesteatoma development.
FINDINGS: In total, 27 studies were included, consisting of 1566 patients with TMRs. We included data from 2 randomized controlled trials (76 patients) and 25 observational studies (1490 patients). Seven studies (329 patients) investigated excision of the TMR with and without ventilation tube placement, 3 studies (207 patients) investigated the wait-and-see policy and 17 studies (1030 patients) investigated tympanoplasty for the treatment of TMRs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides all the studies that have been published on the surgical management and wait-and-policy for tympanic membrane retractions. No high level of evidence comparative studies has been performed. The evidence for the management of tympanic membrane retractions is heterogenous and depends on many factors such as the patient population, location and severity of the TMR and presence of other ear pathologies (e.g., perforation, risk of cholesteatoma and serous otitis media).","['Bayoumy AB', 'Veugen CCAFM', 'van der Veen EL', 'Bok JM', 'de Ru JA', 'Thomeer HGXM']",2022,279,2,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Bayoumy AB, et al.

33682472,Prognosticating patients with necrotising otitis externa based on response to treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Necrotising otitis externa (NOE) is a severe infection of the temporal bone. The traditional severity based staging system does not fully prognosticate all patients with NOE. We hypothesise that a patient response staging system would more accurately capture the disease process and guide prognosis.
METHODS: We carried out a retrospective notes review of patients diagnosed with NOE from January 2017 to December 2018 in a regional tertiary referral centre. Patient outcomes from our proposed patient response staging system were compared to a modified previously published severity based Gleeson staging system with patients requiring prolonged treatment classified as having a poor outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were treated for NOE. The majority were male (
CONCLUSIONS: The Gleeson staging system was valuable in assessing the extent of disease and all early Gleeson staged patients had good outcomes. However, patients with higher severity staging on the Gleeson system did not necessarily require prolonged treatment. There is a role for a joint approach in staging patients based on both modified Gleeson and treatment response, which would subsequently guide prognosis, duration of treatment and early diagnosis of potential fungal NOE.","['Cho WS', 'Bonduelle Q', 'Ghasemi A', 'Baskaran V', ""O'Connor R"", 'Shah J', 'Andrewartha F', 'Fergie N']",2021,103,4,Ann R Coll Surg Engl,"Cho WS, et al.

33662646,Draft genome of an extremely drug-resistant st551 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from an Italian dog with otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the draft genome sequence and analyse the genetic features of a Staphylococcus pseudintermedius clinical isolate according to the main typing schemes available, with a special focus on antibiotic resistance.
METHODS: The strain was isolated from a case of otitis externa in a dog. Its identity and pattern of antibiotic susceptibility were determined using an automated system. The genome was sequenced using an Illumina platform. MLST, SCCmec typing, resistome, and mobile genetic elements were derived by comparative analysis using available specific databases.
RESULTS: S. pseudintermedius CAM1 isolate has a chromosome size of 2 652 610 bp. It showed a wide pattern of phenotypic resistance, comprising beta-lactams, macrolides and lincosamides, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The genetic determinants of the underlying mechanisms were all found by in silico analysis of the genome. The mecA gene for methicillin resistance was harboured by the Vc type of the SCCmec. MLST of the strain was st551.
CONCLUSION: By comparison with the MLST database of S. pseudintermedius and data from published molecular epidemiology studies, CAM1 is the first st551 strain recorded in Italy and, in the context of an already extremely wide antibiotic resistance pattern, it harbours also the tetK gene, the prevalence of which is rare in MDR S. pseudintermedius.","['Vitali LA', 'Beghelli D', 'Balducci M', 'Petrelli D']",2021,25,,J Glob Antimicrob Resist,"Vitali LA, et al.

33609177,The MO-meatocanalplasty: long-term results in the narrow external auditory canal with recurrent otitis externa or the inability to wear a hearing aid.,"OBJECTIVE: The MO-meatocanalplasty is the oblique modification of the M-meatoplasty. The MO-meatocanalplasty was designed to address the superior quadrants of the meatus and the bony canal without the need for a retro-auricular incision. This retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the long-term results of the MO-meatocanalplasty in patients with a narrow external auditory canal (EAC) with recurrent otitis externa or in patients unable to wear a hearing aid.
METHODS: Twenty-two ears in twenty consecutive patients who received a MO-meatocanalplasty for a narrow EAC with recurrent otitis externa or the inability to wear a hearing aid were analysed retrospectively. There were no patients included with any type of previous or planned second stage tympanoplasty procedures. A follow-up period of 3 years was analysed for postoperative recurrent narrowing, the self-cleaning capacity of the EAC, the recurrence of otitis externa, the inability to wear a hearing aid, change in hearing level and for all types of aesthetical complaints.
RESULTS: The MO-meatocanalplasty procedure was effective in 82% (n = 18). Postoperative recurrent narrowing was detected in 9% (n = 2). Insufficient self-cleaning capacity of the EAC was 9.1% (n = 2). The ability to wear a hearing aid was restored in all patients with the need for a hearing aid. No aesthetical complaints were reported.
CONCLUSION: The MO-meatocanalplasty is an effective, safe and aesthetical accepted procedure to address the narrow meatus and external auditory canal. With this procedure, there is no need for a retro-auricular incision in order to create a well aerated, dry and self-cleaning EAC in patients with a narrow EAC with recurrent otitis externa or in patient with the inability to wear a hearing aid.","['De Greve G', 'van Dinther J', 'Vanspauwen R', 'Youri M', 'Verstreken M', 'Zarowski A', 'Offeciers E']",2021,278,12,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"De Greve G, et al.

33595266,Otolaryngeal and Oropharyngeal Conditions: Common Ear Conditions.,"Ear pain (otalgia) is a common reason for visits to family physician offices and emergency departments. Otalgia is primary when the pathology originates from the ear, and is secondary for disease processes associated with otalgia and an ear examination with normal findings. The most common diagnosis related to otalgia in children and adults is acute otitis media (AOM). It is characterized by an erythematous, bulging, and cloudy tympanic membrane. Otitis media with effusion is the presence of fluid behind the tympanic membrane without signs of inflammation. Chronic middle ear effusion is managed definitively with myringotomy and tympanostomy tube placement. Tympanic membrane rupture is a common complication after AOM or trauma. Tympanic membranes that do not heal develop chronic infection, leading to chronic suppurative otitis media. Initial management is cleaning and drying of the ear and application of topical antibiotics. Otitis externa is a painful cellulitis of the external auditory canal associated with erythema, edema, and occasional drainage. Cerumen impaction is managed with cerumenolytics, irrigation, or manual extraction. Foreign bodies in the ear are common in children younger than 6 years. Many foreign bodies can be removed with irrigation or forceps.","['Shahan BT', 'Gauer RL']",2021,501,,FP Essent,Shahan BT and Gauer RL.

33593363,Prevalence of commonly diagnosed disorders in UK dogs under primary veterinary care: results and applications.,"BACKGROUND: Although dogs are a commonly owned companion animal in the UK, the species experiences many health problems that are predictable from demographic information. This study aimed to use anonymised veterinary clinical data from the VetCompass™ Programme to report the frequency of common disorders of dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK during 2016 and to explore effects associated with age, sex and neuter status.
RESULTS: From an available population of 905,543 dogs under veterinary care at 886 veterinary clinics during 2016, the current study included a random sample of 22,333 (2.47 %) dogs from 784 clinics. Prevalence for each disorder was calculated at the most refined level of diagnostic certainty (precise-level precision) and after grouping to a more general level of diagnostic precision (grouped-level precision). The most prevalent precise-level precision disorders recorded were periodontal disease (prevalence 12.52 %, 95 % CI: 12.09-12.97), otitis externa (7.30 %, 95 % CI: 6.97-7.65) and obesity (7.07 %, 95 % CI: 6.74-7.42). The most prevalent grouped-level disorders were dental disorder (14.10 %, 95 % CI: 13.64-14.56), skin disorder (12.58 %, 95 % CI: 12.15-13.02) and enteropathy (10.43 %, 95 % CI: 10.04-10.84). Associations were identified for many common disorders with age, sex and neuter.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall findings can assist veterinarians and owners to prioritise preventive care and to understand demographic risk factors in order to facilitate earlier diagnosis of common disorders in dogs. The information on associations with age, sex and neuter status provides additional contextual background to the complexity of disorder occurrence and supports targeted health controls for demographic subsets of dogs.","[""O'Neill DG"", 'James H', 'Brodbelt DC', 'Church DB', 'Pegram C']",2021,17,1,BMC Vet Res,"O'Neill DG, et al.

A common strategy is to make compounded solutions of dexamethasone in ear cleaner.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the stability of dexamethasone when added to four commercial ear cleaners (ec): designated ecA, ecB, ecC and ecD.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two concentrations (0.1 and 0.25 mg/mL) of dexamethasone were formulated for each cleaner solution from a 2 mg/mL solution and stored in the original manufacturers' bottles at two temperatures: room (22 ˚C) and refrigerated (4 ˚C). Samples were evaluated in triplicate, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at 10 time points over 90 days. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for each time point.
RESULTS: A solution was considered stable if the dexamethasone value remained >90% of the target concentration. All dexamethasone solution values were stable to 90 days, except two solutions for ecA; the 0.25 mg/mL dexamethasone concentration was only stable to 14 (4 ˚C) and 21 days (22 ˚C).

33511482,The challenging diagnosis and follow-up of skull base osteomyelitis in clinical practice.,"PURPOSE: The disease activity of skull base osteomyelitis can be challenging to assess by means of conventional imaging methods and renders monitoring of the disease difficult, especially in areas with restricted access to nuclear medicine imaging. Here, we provide clinically relevant data on the management of skull base osteomyelitis including assessment, treatment, and follow-up strategies with regards to the role of imaging.
METHOD: A chart review was performed including 30 patients treated for SBO from 1993 to 2015. Clinical findings, treatment procedures, and complication rates were assessed. Special attention was paid to imaging procedures.
RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 36.7% and increased to 45% when cranial nerve palsies were present. An initial computed tomography (CT) scan was performed in all patients, MRI in 60% and nuclear imaging in 33%. CT scans failed to detect progression or regression in up to 80% after four to nine months. MRI examinations could reveal changes at a higher rate compared to CT. Nuclear medicine functional imaging was most likely to assess disease activity.
CONCLUSION: A combination of different imaging modalities is recommended for diagnosing SBO. For the follow-up, MRI is preferable to CT as changes can be detected more readily with MRI. If available, nuclear medicine imaging should guide the decision of treatment discontinuation.","['Auinger AB', 'Dahm V', 'Stanisz I', 'Schwarz-Nemec U', 'Arnoldner C']",2021,278,12,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Auinger AB, et al.

33502545,Computer tomography findings in necrotizing otitis externa based on the offending pathogens.,"PURPOSE: High-resolution temporal bone computer tomography (HRTBCT) is the most common initial radiological modality used for the assessment of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE).
OBJECTIVES: (1) To compare the extension of disease, as seen on HRTBCT, in patients with NOE caused by different pathogens and (2) assess whether radiological findings may suggest the offending pathogen in cases of sterile-NOE.
METHODS: All NOE patients were hospitalized between 1990 and 2018. All patients underwent HRTBCT at admission. Three groups (fungus-NOE, PA-NOE and sterile-NOE) comprising of ten patients each were randomly selected. HRTBCT was reevaluated by a senior radiologist. Thirteen radiological subsites were selected for reevaluation.
RESULTS: All patients in the fungal-NOE group complained of otalgia, compared to nine in the sterile-NOE and six in the PA-NOE groups (p value = 0.044). External ear canal edema and granulation tissue were the most common findings in all groups. Surgery was performed in five patients in the fungal-NOE and PA-NOE and three in the sterile-NOE group (p value =  > 0.05). Radiological findings indicating severe bone erosion within the EEC was seen in all patients but 3 (p value =  > 0.05). Severe TMJ erosion was seen in one patient within the fungal-NOE and PA-NOE group (p value =  > 0.05). When mild and severe involvement were combined, TMJ bone erosion was seen in four patients in the fungal-NOE and only in one patient in the PA-NOE (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: TMJ involvement may be more common in fungal disease, suggesting a different spreading pathway, as opposed to PA-NOE. Accordingly, TMJ involvement on HRTBCT may justify antifungal treatment in sterile culture-NOE.","['Peled C', 'Novoa R', 'El-Saied S', 'Sadeh R', 'Novack V', 'Kaplan DM']",2021,278,12,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Peled C, et al.

33438505,Experience level as a predictor of entry into the hypotympanum during feline total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy.,"OBJECTIVES: The study hypotheses were as follows: (1) owing to the unique anatomy of the feline middle ear, the hypotympanum would be entered in less than 100% of cats during total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomies (TECA-LBOs); and (2) incomplete penetration of the septum and subsequent failure to enter the hypotympanum is more likely to occur in surgeries performed by a novice surgeon when compared with an experienced surgeon and may be under-recognized.
METHODS: Head CT was performed in 12 feline cadavers to confirm absence of gross ear disease. A novice surgeon and an experienced surgeon were randomly assigned to perform TECA-LBO on the left or right ear. Surgeons were blinded to each other's surgical technique. CT of cadavers was performed after the procedure. Successful penetration of the septum, entry into the hypotympanic cavity and amount of bone removed in bulla osteotomy, quantified via CT, were compared between the novice surgeon and experienced surgeon.
RESULTS: The novice surgeon entered the hypotympanum in 3/12 (25%) procedures, compared with 9/12 (75%) procedures performed by the experienced surgeon. The experienced surgeon performed a larger osteotomy than the novice surgeon (3301 mm vs 1376 mm, 
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results underscore the need for familiarity with feline middle ear anatomy when performing TECA-LBOs. Postoperative CT is recommended for novice surgeons to confirm entry into the hypotympanum.","['Mehrkens LR', 'Townsend KL', 'Cooley SD', 'Milovancev M', 'Newsom LE']",2021,23,10,J Feline Med Surg,"Mehrkens LR, et al.

33429178,Malignant otitis externa: An updated review.,"Malignant otitis externa is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal and skull base. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most isolated microorganism and it affects mostly to diabetic, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Non-resolving otalgia and chronic otorrhea are the clinical manifestations presented. Facial nerve palsy is a common and well recognized complication. (Computed tomography) CT scan is useful for initial assessment, Technetium-99m is highly sensitive and is part of the protocol for diagnosis. Treatment should be individualized, with multidisciplinary cooperation among specialties. Management involves systemic antipseudomonal antibiotics and monitoring with radiologic techniques, it also involves the strict control of diabetes. It is essential to follow up the patients for at least a year post-treatment. In refractory malignant otitis externa and affection of facial nerve, surgical management is recommended. We reviewed the most recent studies on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment to provide an update on Malignant Otitis Externa that can offer an overview for clinical practice and future research.","['Treviño González JL', 'Reyes Suárez LL', 'Hernández de León JE']",2021,42,2,Am J Otolaryngol,"Treviño González JL, et al.

33414694,From Uncommon Infection to Multi-Cranial Palsy: Malignant External Otitis Insights.,"PURPOSE: The progression of the otitic infectious process toward diseases of particular severity is often unpredictable, just as it is challenging to manage the patient over time, even after the apparent resolution of the disease. We aim to define a radiological reading key that allows us to correctly and promptly treat the disease, avoiding the possible severe complications.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 13 cases of basal cranial osteomyelitis (SBO) due to malignant external otitis, by the ENT Department of the University of Catania. Through a standardized approach and following the latest guidelines, we have evaluated all patients performing a standardized and personalized radiological protocol according to the stage of the patient's pathology and modulating the treatment consequently.
RESULTS: Clinical signs have been observed such as otorrhea (100%), otalgia in 13/13 patients (100%), granulations in external auditory canal (100%), preauricular cellulitis in 9/13 patients (69%) headache 6/13 cases (46%), dysphonia 4/13 cases (31%). HRCT of the temporal bone proved useful in identifying even minimal bone lesions in 13/13 (100%) while improving MRI in vascular and nervous involvement, although in 1/13 patient with nerve palsy clinical symptomatology preceded radiological evidence. The 99mTc 3-phase planar bone scintigraphy was positive for SBO in 9/13 cases (69%) during the initial phase and, in 100% of the cases in images delayed to 2-3 hours. Subsequent checks up to 1 year, using the Ga 67 scintigraphy, excluded the presence of recurrences in 100% of patients.
CONCLUSION: The osteomyelitis of the base of the skull is a severe complication of malignant external otitis, often not always easily diagnosed. Recurrence can occur up to 1 year after stopping therapy. Imaging techniques such as Tc and MRI are relevant for the initial diagnostic approach and the staging of the pathology and its complications. Nuclear medicine imaging plays a fundamental role in the evaluation of related osteoblastic activity, especially in the remission phase of the disease.","['Ferlito S', 'Maniaci A', 'Di Luca M', 'Grillo C', 'Mannelli L', 'Salvatore M', 'La Mantia I', 'Spinato G', 'Cocuzza S']",2020,18,4,Dose Response,"Ferlito S, et al.

33411616,Diagnosis of Skull Base Osteomyelitis.,"Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is an infection of the temporal, sphenoid, or occipital bone that can be a challenge to diagnose because of its nonspecific symptoms, long clinical course, and radiologic findings that mimic those of other entities. The authors review this unusual infection on the basis of six proven cases. The diagnosis of SBO should be made according to four points: a high index of clinical suspicion, radiologic evidence of infection, repeated biopsies that are negative for malignancy, and positive results of microbiologic tests. SBO typically manifests clinically in patients with diabetes and recurrent otitis externa; the infection usually extends inferiorly to the compact bone of the infratemporal fossa, affecting the lower cranial nerve foramina. Several image-based techniques should be used to diagnose SBO. CT is the best option for evaluating bone erosion and demineralization, MRI can help delineate the anatomic location and extent of disease, and nuclear imaging is useful for confirming bone infection with high sensitivity. However, the standard diagnostic procedure for SBO is for patients to undergo repeated biopsies to rule out malignancy, with histopathologic signs of infection and detection of microorganisms in the biopsied bone or soft tissue indicating SBO. The ability to diagnose SBO can be increased by identifying patients at risk, recognizing the most important causes and routes of infection, describing the main radiologic findings, and always considering the differential diagnosis.

Experience of an ENT rapid access clinic during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the conditions that still present to ENT despite government advice to avoid unnecessary travel. It also assessed the impact of social distancing on pathologies presenting to ENT and reviewed the usefulness of telephone consultations in semi-urgent presentations.
METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted of 97 instances of patient care carried out in the rapid access ENT clinic at a large district general hospital.
RESULTS: Otitis externa and foreign bodies represented 25 per cent and 13 per cent of consultations respectively. Tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess were uncommon, representing 6 per cent of total consultations. Telephone appointments represented only 28 per cent of total consultations; however, they appeared to reduce the number of physical appointments required.
CONCLUSION: Otitis externa and foreign bodies continue to be common during the pandemic. Social distancing measures reduced the number of tonsillitis and quinsy presentations. Telephone consultations are effective for certain urgent presentations to ENT, most noticeably nasal trauma and follow up of non-serious pathologies.","['Stubington TJ', 'Morrison B', 'Sevilla C', 'Judd O']",2021,135,1,J Laryngol Otol,"Stubington TJ, et al.

33399257,Effect of an anti-inflammatory pomegranate otic treatment on the clinical evolution and microbiota profile of dogs with otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Canine otitis externa (OE) is a common disease characterised by inflammation of the epithelial tissue of the external ear canal. Secondary infections are frequent, and Malassezia pachydermatis and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius are routinely isolated and treated with antifungal and antibiotic compounds.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To analyse the otitis ear microbiome before and after a treatment with prednisolone plus pomegranate or antimicrobial drugs ANIMALS: 15 dogs with nonpurulent OE.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 30 day, double-blinded, multicentre, randomized and controlled parallel-group (1:1) trial was conducted in 15 dogs with nonpurulent OE, following two different topical treatments (prednisolone plus pomegranate versus prednisolone plus antibiotic and antifungal drugs). On days (D)0, D15 and D30, serum and skin otic samples were collected, and clinical examination and microbiome analysis (bacteria and fungi) were performed. Results were compared with validated otitis clinical scores to assess the effectiveness of both treatments.
RESULTS: Nine bacterial and four fungal families were detected during the three time-points tested. An increase in fungal diversity (Shannon index) and composition was the most significant change observed after both treatments. At treatment D15 and D30, the reduction in clinical signs was statistically significant in both treatment groups (P ≤ 0.05). Prednisolone plus pomegranate cleanser treatment was able to control the clinical signs of otitis as well as the bacterial and fungal overgrowth.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Mild otitis cases associated with microbial overgrowth may be managed with topical antiseptic and anti-inflammatory agents without the need for antibiotic and/or antifungal compounds.","['Puigdemont A', ""D'Andreano S"", 'Ramió-Lluch L', 'Cuscó A', 'Francino O', 'Brazis P']",2021,32,2,Vet Dermatol,"Puigdemont A, et al.

33374846,Estimated Burden of Fungal Infections in Oman.,"For many years, fungi have emerged as significant and frequent opportunistic pathogens and nosocomial infections in many different populations at risk. Fungal infections include disease that varies from superficial to disseminated infections which are often fatal. No fungal disease is reportable in Oman. Many cases are admitted with underlying pathology, and fungal infection is often not documented. The burden of fungal infections in Oman is still unknown. Using disease frequencies from heterogeneous and robust data sources, we provide an estimation of the incidence and prevalence of Oman's fungal diseases. An estimated 79,520 people in Oman are affected by a serious fungal infection each year, 1.7% of the population, not including fungal skin infections, chronic fungal rhinosinusitis or otitis externa. These figures are dominated by vaginal candidiasis, followed by allergic respiratory disease (fungal asthma). An estimated 244 patients develop invasive aspergillosis and at least 230 candidemia annually (5.4 and 5.0 per 100,000). Only culture and microscopy are currently available for diagnosis, so case detection is suboptimal. Uncertainty surrounds these figures that trigger the need for urgent local epidemiological studies with more sensitive diagnostics.","['Al-Hatmi AMS', 'Al-Shuhoumi MA', 'Denning DW']",2020,7,1,J Fungi (Basel),"Al-Hatmi AMS, et al.

33350905,Estimate of Burden and Direct Healthcare Cost of Infectious Waterborne Disease in the United States.,"Provision of safe drinking water in the United States is a great public health achievement. However, new waterborne disease challenges have emerged (e.g., aging infrastructure, chlorine-tolerant and biofilm-related pathogens, increased recreational water use). Comprehensive estimates of the health burden for all water exposure routes (ingestion, contact, inhalation) and sources (drinking, recreational, environmental) are needed. We estimated total illnesses, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, deaths, and direct healthcare costs for 17 waterborne infectious diseases. About 7.15 million waterborne illnesses occur annually (95% credible interval [CrI] 3.88 million-12.0 million), results in 601,000 ED visits (95% CrI 364,000-866,000), 118,000 hospitalizations (95% CrI 86,800-150,000), and 6,630 deaths (95% CrI 4,520-8,870) and incurring US $3.33 billion (95% CrI 1.37 billion-8.77 billion) in direct healthcare costs.

33299928,Single Application Cold-Chain Independent Drug Delivery System for Outer Ear Infections.,"Outer ear infections (OE) affect millions of people annually with significant associated healthcare costs. Incorrect administration or non-compliance with the treatment regimen can lead to infection persistence, recurrence, antibiotic resistance, and in severe cases aggravation to malignant otitis externa. Such issues are particularly pertinent for military personnel, patients in nursing homes, the geriatric population, for patients with head or hand tremors and for those with limited or no access to proper healthcare. With the intent of using traditional material science principles to deconvolute material design while increasing relevance and efficacy, we developed a single application, cold-chain independent thixotropic drug delivery system. This can be easily applied into the ear as a liquid, then gels to deliver effective concentrations of antibiotics against bacterial strains commonly associated with OE. The system maintains thixotropic properties over several stress/no stress cycles, shows negligible swelling and temperature dependence, and does not impact the minimum inhibitory concentration or bactericidal effects of relevant antibiotics. Moreover, the thixogels are biocompatible and are well tolerated in the ear. This drug delivery system can readily translate into a user-friendly product, could improve compliance via a single application by the diagnosing health care provider, is expected to effectively treat OE and minimize the development of antibiotic resistance, infection recurrence or exacerbation.","['Serban BA', 'Shi K', 'Alverson JB', 'Hoody J', 'Priestley ND', 'Park AH', 'Serban MA']",2020,6,10,ACS Biomater Sci Eng,"Serban BA, et al.

33290924,Pediatric acute otitis externa: Characteristics and predictors for hospital admission.,"BACKGROUND: Acute otitis externa (AOE), is a common infectious disease affecting children and adults. Its peak prevalence is around the summer months, it involves the external auditory canal and in most cases is due to bacterial agents.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational analytical case-based study involving all consecutive patients under the age of 18 years old presenting with AOE to a pediatric emergency department.
RESULTS: We collected data from 337 patients under 18 years of age with 344 visits to the Emergency Department, between the years 2011-2018. Nearly half of the visits presented during the summer months. Children were divided into two subgroups: hospitalized and non-hospitalized. Median hospitalization time was 3 days. The hospitalized sub-group had higher rates of failed treatment, as well as higher rates of external ear canal edema, systemic fever, canal discharge and auricular edema. On multivariable analysis the following variables had the strongest correlation for hospital admission: auricular edema (OR 27.98), otorrhea (OR 1.82), narrowing of the ear canal by more than 50% (OR 1.91), fever (OR 2.92), and previous systemic treatment (OR 2.53). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was isolated in 78% of cultures in the hospitalized sub-group. All PA strains were sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the main clinical variables which may predict hospitalization among children with AOE as well as the dominant role of sensitive strains of PA in the pathogenesis of this condition in children.","['Gruber M', 'Damry D', 'Ibrahim N', 'Glikman D', 'Ronen O']",2021,140,,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Gruber M, et al.

33237912,Cerumen microbial community shifts between healthy and otitis affected dogs.,"Otitis externa is a common multifactorial disease in dogs, characterized by broad and complex modifications of the ear microbiota. The goal of our study was to describe the ear cerumen microbiota of healthy dogs, within the same animal and between different animals, and to compare the cerumen microbiota of otitis affected dogs with that of healthy animals. The present study included 26 healthy dogs, 16 animals affected by bilateral otitis externa and 4 animals affected by monolateral otitis externa. For each animal cerumen samples from the right and left ear were separately collected with sterile swabs, and processed for DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplicon libraries were sequenced using an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM), and taxonomical assignment and clustering were performed using QIIME 2 software. Our results indicate that the bacterial community of the cerumen in healthy dogs was characterized by extensive variability, with the most abundant phyla represented by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. The analysis of both alpha and beta diversity between pairs of left and right ear samples from the same dog within the group of affected animals displayed higher differences than between paired samples across healthy dogs. Moreover we observed reduced bacterial richness in the affected group as compared with controls and increased variability in population structure within otitis affected animals, often associated with the proliferation of a single bacterial taxon over the others. Moreover, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas resulted to be the bacterial genera responsible for most distances between the two groups, in association with differences in the bacterial community structure. The cerumen microbiota in healthy dogs exhibits a complex bacterial population which undergoes significant modifications in otitis affected animals.","['Borriello G', 'Paradiso R', 'Catozzi C', 'Brunetti R', 'Roccabianca P', 'Riccardi MG', 'Cecere B', 'Lecchi C', 'Fusco G', 'Ceciliani F', 'Galiero G']",2020,15,11,PLoS One,"Borriello G, et al.

It is very rarely centred on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Fungi cause NOE in approximately 5-20% of patients, and a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, particularly when there is no improvement with prolonged topical and intravenous antibiotic therapy.

33178972,Otoscopy and imaging features of spontaneous temporomandibular joint herniation into the external auditory canal.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the otoscopy, CT and MRI features of spontaneous temporomandibular joint(TMJ）herniation(STMJH) into the external auditory canal (EAC) through the persistent foramen of Huschke (PFH).
METHODS: 15 cases diagnosed STMJH were collected. The otoscopy, CT data of 15 cases and MRI data of 6 cases were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Otoscopy revealed a mass located in the anterior wall of the bony EAC that moved forwards and backwards during mouth opening and closing, respectively. CT showed a soft mass with bony defect in the anterior wall of the EAC, with no enhancement; the bony defect margin was well defined in all cases. The bone adjacent to the PFH was pressed and partially wrapped around the soft mass, as if ""holding a ball,"" in seven cases. Pseudobone shell around the soft mass was observed in eight cases. Six cases included MRI scans, which showed TMJ soft tissue herniated into the EAC.
CONCLUSION: STMJHs have unique otoscopic, CT and MRI features. The examination strategy recommended is dynamic otoscopy and conventional CT, MRI can be chosen when the herniation is complicated by infection or otitis externa or when the patient has TMJ dysfunction; conservative management and follow-up observations are the main treatment strategy recommended.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Mechanical stress of TMJ on the EAC is thought to cause herniation and the special CT features, the location and size of the PFH, especially the location, are the major risk factors for TMJ herniation in patients with FH.","['Liu JH', 'Huang WH', 'Xu JH', 'Liu Y', 'Sha Y']",2020,2,1,BJR Open,"Liu JH, et al.

Her symptoms began with left otalgia and otorrhea which progressed to helical erythema, prompting a visit to the emergency department. She was noted to have erythema of the left auricle and swelling of the left auditory meatus. Our otolaryngology service observed erythema of the auricle with sparing of the lobule.
DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis to be otitis externa with perichondritis was established, and we recommended otic ciprofloxacin-hydrocortisone, IV vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. The patient had marked improvement and was discharged on an oral and otic fluoroquinolone. In this case, the diagnosis of perichondritis was made by a classic physical examination finding: erythema and edema with sparing of the fatty lobule.

33103763,Adherence to Subspecialty Guidelines in the Emergency Department.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery has published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to guide management of common otolaryngologic (ENT) conditions. While these CPGs have been disseminated within specialty journals, many patients' first presentation of certain ENT complaints is to primary and acute care settings, including the emergency department (ED). It is less clear whether practice in these settings is concordant with specialty CPGs.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records was performed at an academic tertiary care center with ED diagnoses of 1) Bell's palsy/facial weakness (BP) or 2) acute otitis externa (AOE) from May 2014-June 2018. Individual chart abstraction was performed for all encounters with these diagnoses for the purpose of assessing providers' adherence to CPGs.
RESULTS: During the study period, 224 patients were diagnosed with BP and 465 patients were diagnosed with AOE. Of the patients diagnosed with BP, 94% (n = 211/224) were prescribed oral steroids, concordant with guidelines, while 36% of these patients received head computed tomography (CT) scans and 43% received laboratory tests, counter to the guidelines. For those with a diagnosis of AOE, 28.6% received topical antibiotics only as primary treatment (n = 133/465) in accordance with guidelines while systemic antibiotics were prescribed in 42.2% (n = 196/465) discordant with the guidelines and 29.2% received both topical and systemic antibiotics (n = 136/465).
CONCLUSIONS: CPGs developed by subspecialty societies provide evidence-based recommendations for the care of patients with particular conditions, but may not be disseminated broadly outside of the specialty. Further research is required to understand the reasons behind divergent management of such conditions.

33064160,[Diagnosis and treatment of external otitis].,"External otitis is one of the most common infections in the head and neck region, as about 10% of all people suffer from it at least once during their life. It is an infection of the cutis and subcutis of the outer ear canal caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungus as well as allergens or degenerative toxic substances. A concomitant infection of the eardrum (myringitis) may develop. Patients typically present with unilateral, rarely bilateral, earache (otalgia), with accompanying hearing loss and sometimes discharge from the ear (otorrhea). In general, otalgia is one of the most common reasons for consulting a general practitioner in Germany (4.2-7.7%), especially for children up to 14 years.",['Simon F'],2020,68,11,HNO,Simon F.

Interestingly, nine new sequence types (39%), from 1053 up to 1061, were described for the first time. Moreover, the isolated MRSP strains showed relevant antibiotic resistance profiles. This report highlights the circulation of new sequence types of MRSP in Italy and underlines the need of a global epidemiological surveillance to limit the increasing spread of multidrug-resistant MRSPstrains worldwide, since they may represent a considerable concern for dog's health.","['Nocera FP', 'Parisi A', 'Corrente M', 'De Martino L']",2020,23,3,Pol J Vet Sci,"Nocera FP, et al.

32981533,Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on urgent referrals to secondary care otolaryngology: a prospective case series.,"OBJECTIVE: As the novel coronavirus disease 2019 changed patient presentation, this study aimed to prospectively identify these changes in a single ENT centre.
DESIGN: A seven-week prospective case series was conducted of urgently referred patients from primary care and accident and emergency department.
RESULTS: There was a total of 133 referrals. Referral rates fell by 93 per cent over seven weeks, from a mean of 5.4 to 0.4 per day. Reductions were seen in referrals from both primary care (89 per cent) and the accident and emergency department (93 per cent). Presentations of otitis externa and epistaxis fell by 83 per cent, and presentations of glandular fever, tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess fell by 67 per cent.
CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 has greatly reduced the number of referrals into secondary care ENT. The cause for this reduction is likely to be due to patients' increased perceived risk of the virus presence in a medical setting. The impact of this reduction is yet to be ascertained, but will likely result in a substantial increase in emergency pressures once the lockdown is lifted and the general public's perception of the coronavirus disease 2019 risk reduces.","['Osborne MS', 'Bentley E', 'Farrow A', 'Chan J', 'Murphy J']",2020,,,J Laryngol Otol,"Osborne MS, et al.

32979301,Changes in the ear canal microbiota of dogs with otitis externa.,"AIMS: Otitis externa (OE), one of the most common ear diseases in dogs, is caused by bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus sp. To understand the network of microbial communities in the canine ear canal affected with OE, we performed a cross-sectional study using next-generation sequencing.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Ear swab samples were collected from 23 OE-affected and 10 healthy control dogs, and the 16S rRNA gene sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. The otic microbiota in the OE-affected dogs showed significantly decreased alpha diversity compared to controls. The community composition also differed in the affected group, with significantly higher relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes and the genus Staphylococcus (P = 0·01 and 0·04 respectively). Contrary to our expectations, the severity of the disease did not impact the otic microbiota in OE-affected dogs.
CONCLUSIONS: The ear canal microbiota of OE-affected dogs is distinct from that of healthy dogs, irrespective of disease status.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study, one of the few detailed analyses of the otic microbiota, can provide practical information for the appropriate treatment of canine OE.","['Kasai T', 'Fukui Y', 'Aoki K', 'Ishii Y', 'Tateda K']",2021,130,4,J Appl Microbiol,"Kasai T, et al.

32918365,Rare/cryptic Aspergillus species infections and importance of antifungal susceptibility testing.,"BACKGROUND: The number of patients infected with Aspergillus rose dramatically in recent years. However, studies on the clinical spectrum and antifungal susceptibilities of non-classical (non-fumigatus, non-flavus, non-niger and non-terreus) pathogenic Aspergillus species are very limited.
OBJECTIVES: We examined the clinical spectrum and antifungal susceptibilities of 34 non-duplicated, non-classical Aspergillus isolates collected from Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Shanghai.
METHODS: The Aspergillus isolates were identified by internal transcribed spacer, partial BenA and partial CaM sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Susceptibility testing against eight antifungals was performed following the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing's methodology.
RESULTS: The 34 Aspergillus isolates were identified as 14 different rare/cryptic species of four sections (Flavi [n = 8], Nidulantes [n = 8], Nigri [n = 17] and Restricti [n = 1]). Except for one patient whose clinical history could not be retrieved, 72.7% of the remaining patients had underlying conditions predisposing them to Aspergillus infections. The most common diseases were pulmonary infections (n = 15), followed by skin/nail infections (n = 6), chronic otitis externa and/or media (n = 5), wound infections (n = 2) and mastoiditis/radionecrosis (n = 1), while three were colonisations. Five patients succumbed due to the infections during the admission, and another two died 5 years later because of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Antifungal susceptibility testing showed that they possessed different susceptibility profiles compared to the classical Aspergillus species. The majority of isolates characterised were sensitive or wild-type to amphotericin B. The minimum effective concentrations for all the three echinocandins were also low.
CONCLUSION: Susceptibility testing should be performed for infections due to these rare/cryptic Aspergillus species to guide proper patient management.","['Tsang CC', 'Tang JYM', 'Ye H', 'Xing F', 'Lo SKF', 'Xiao C', 'Han L', 'Wu AKL', 'Ngan AHY', 'Law KC', 'To YN', 'Sze DTT', 'Chim OHY', 'Hui TWS', 'Leung CWH', 'Zhu T', 'Yao C', 'Tse BPH', 'Lau SKP', 'Woo PCY']",2020,63,12,Mycoses,"Tsang CC, et al.

We present a case of malignant otitis externa which presented with symptomatic palsy of IX and XII nerves sparing the VII cranial nerve. The patient though later on had internal jugular vein thrombosis, which we presume is due to the involvement of the parapharyngeal space that prompted us to reconsider the diagnosis, and later on, to aggravate the therapy.

32884561,Otological manifestations in pregnant women - A study at a tertiary care hospital of eastern India.,"BACKGROUND: There are several physiological changes found in pregnant women and amongst them, otological changes are quite important. The otological manifestations in pregnant women are mainly due to changes of sex hormones levels, which return to normal in the postpartum period.
OBJECTIVE: To report otological manifestations among pregnant women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-four pregnant women participated in this prospective study. A questionnaire was administered in all participants for assessing otological manifestations. The pregnant women were in the age range of 22-35 years. They underwent thorough otological and obstetric examinations. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) was done for assessment of hearing loss.
RESULTS: The mean age of the pregnant women in this study was 26.23 years. The most common otological manifestation was sensation of ear blockage. Eustachian tube dysfunction was common in the last trimester of pregnancy. Other manifestations included vertigo and tinnitus.
CONCLUSION: The alteration of hormonal milieu in pregnant women can lead to several otological manifestations, including eustachian tube dysfunction, hearing impairment, otitis externa, Bell's palsy, vertigo and tinnitus. Despite these otological manifestations found in pregnant women, yet they are often neglected in clinical practice.","['Swain SK', 'Pati BK', 'Mohanty JN']",2020,15,3,J Otol,"Swain SK, et al.

AIM/OBJECTIVE: to examine the factors leading to facial paralysis in these patients and clarify indications for aggressive treatment in the group most at risk.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a case-control study, demographic, clinical, laboratory, audiometric, imaging, and treatment characteristics of 139 patients in groups with and without facial paralysis were analysed.
RESULTS: 45 patients (32.4%) had facial paralysis. Compared to patients without facial nerve involvement, patients with facial palsy had a higher rate of inflammatory markers (mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate on admission [67.71 vs 51.16 mm/h], and the average of total ESR [64.27 vs 54.46 mm/h], as well as the mean C-reactive protein [38.96 vs 27.53 mg/L]). Also, the involvement of the facial canal (
CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal extension of the inflammation and facial nerve canal erosion might be useful as predictors of facial nerve dysfunction. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is correlated with the increased risk of facial paralysis, and aggressive medical management is more crucial.

32825016,Primary Oro-Facial Manifestations of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in Pediatric Age: A Bi-Institutional Retrospective Study on 45 Cases.,"AIMS: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis is a rare hematologic disorder usually affecting children and most commonly involving the head and neck region. Primary oro-facial manifestations are rare, and their diagnosis is often challenging as they are numerous and often resemble common pathologies, refractory to conventional medical and/or instrumental treatments. For such reasons, the diagnosis is frequently delayed, as is the following staging and therapy onset. We retrospectively studied 45 pediatric patients affected by Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis with onset in the head and neck, to examine their clinical and radiological features at the early stage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a retrospective bi-institutional analysis (Department of Pediatric Dentistry and Pediatric Oncology of ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Department of Interdisciplinary Medicine of the University of Bari ""Aldo Moro""), which enrolled 45 patients (age range 0-18 year-old) affected by Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis with oro-facial onset. Data regarding clinical appearance, number, site, synchronous or metachronous occurrence, involved tissues/organs, radiographic features and clinical outcomes were collected, listed and overall differentiated by two age ranges (0-10-year-olds and 10-18-year-olds).
RESULTS: Patients were 26 males and 19 females, with an average age at the time of diagnosis of 4.8 ± 3.8 years (median = 3.9 years). The most common findings were inflamed, hyperplastic, painful and often ulcerated gingival lesions (22 cases), associated with deciduous tooth mobility and/or dislocation with bone loss in 18 cases, followed by nine single eosinophilic granulomas of the mandible and two of the maxilla. Lesions of the palatal mucosa were observed in six patients; nine patients showed on radiograms the characteristic ""floating teeth"" appearance in the mandible with synchronous lesions of the maxilla in six. Paresthesia was relatively un-frequent (three cases) and the pathological fracture of the mandible occurred in six. Head/neck lymph nodes involvement was associated with oral lesions in 12 cases and skull lesions in 14. Otitis (media or externa) was detected in four instances, exophthalmia in two, cutaneous rush in nine, contextual presence or subsequent onset of insipidus diabetes in eight. As for therapy, single or multiple small jaw lesions were all surgically removed; chemotherapy with vinblastine alone or associated with corticosteroids was the principal treatment in almost the 80% of cases; more than 50% of patients received corticosteroids, while only three patients received adjunctive radiotherapy. The overall mortality account for less than 9% (four of 45 cases) and recurrence observed in eight patients after therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis may mimic several oro-facial inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Considering the potential disabling sequela following head and neck localization of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in children, especially at the periodontal tissues with teeth and alveolar bone loss, lesion recognition along with the histological examination of suspicious tissues is mandatory to achieve an early diagnosis and to prevent further organ involvement.","['Capodiferro S', 'Tempesta A', 'Limongelli L', 'Ingravallo G', 'Maiorano E', 'Sfasciotti GL', 'Bossù M', 'Polimeni A', 'Favia G']",2020,7,9,Children (Basel),"Capodiferro S, et al.

32808601,Malignant Otitis External: Our Experience and Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND Malignant external otitis (MEO) is an invasive infection that can involve the external auditory canal and the skull base up to the contiguous soft tissues. Considering the changing face of MEO, we reviewed cases of MEO treated in our Ear Nose Throat (ENT) clinic - University Federico II of Naples between 2018 and 2019 to evaluate the current epidemiology of the condition and to assess the state of art on diagnosis, therapeutic and follow-up management in our patients. CASE REPORT We present the cases of three male patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who complained of long-lasting otorrhea and pain, with clinical suspicion of MEO. In all cases, ear swab was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All our patients received a 6-week course of intravenous ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, and tazobactam, with rapid clinical symptoms improvement and complete recovery at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS MEO is difficult to treat due to the lack of standardized care guidelines. Patients with MEO often present with severe otalgia, edema, otorrhea, and facial nerve paralysis. Clinicians must suspect MEO in elderly diabetic and immunocompromised patients with persistent otalgia after external otitis. Imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) can play synergistic roles in the management of MEO. To evaluate eradication of the disease, clinicians have to assess clinical symptoms and signs as well as radiological imaging and inflammatory markers.","['Di Lullo AM', 'Russo C', 'Piroli P', 'Petti A', 'Capriglione P', 'Cantone E', 'Motta G', 'Iengo M', 'Elefante A', 'Cavaliere M']",2020,21,,Am J Case Rep,"Di Lullo AM, et al.

32808397,Aural CT characteristics of American Cocker Spaniels have features of both mesaticephalic and brachycephalic breeds.,"Otitis externa and otitis media are common in American Cocker Spaniels, however breed-specific aural CT descriptions are currently lacking. This prospective and retrospective, observational, analytical study aimed to describe quantitative CT characteristics of the horizontal ear canal and the tympanic bulla in American Cocker Spaniels versus similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs. We prospectively performed clinical examinations and aural CT scanning for 38 American Cocker Spaniels. Computed tomographic transverse area of the osseous horizontal ear canal (TA1), transverse area of the widest air-filled part of the cartilaginous horizontal ear canal (TA2), tympanic bulla volume, and tympanic bulla wall thickness were measured. The TA1 and TA2 measurements were compared with those of 23 retrospectively recruited, similar-sized mesaticephalic dogs that had undergone CT-scanning of the head for non-ear-related reasons. The TA1 and TA2 did not differ for healthy American Cocker Spaniels and mesaticephalic dogs. Severely affected American Cocker Spaniels had significantly smaller TA2 (P < .001). The intraclass correlation coefficient for intraobserver and interobserver repeatability was 0.972 and 0.983 for TA1 and 0.994 and 0.998 for TA2, respectively. Variation between individuals was subjectively noted in healthy and affected American Cocker Spaniels, but mean tympanic bulla volume was slightly smaller in relation to body weight, and the tympanic bulla wall was thicker than in previous reports for mesaticephalic dogs. The tympanic bulla wall appeared thicker rostro-ventrally than caudo-ventrally in 44% of the dogs. Our results imply that a relatively thick tympanic bulla wall may be a normal CT variation and should be interpreted cautiously in this breed.","['Kaimio MLM', 'Lappalainen AK', 'Rahmani V', 'Männikkö S', 'Laitinen-Vapaavuori OM']",2020,61,6,Vet Radiol Ultrasound,"Kaimio MLM, et al.

This case is unique because surgical fixation of the spine was delayed, and despite clearance of the infection with antibiotics, the patient developed cervical myelopathy and required instrumented spinal fusion surgery. He presented with 1 month of fever, headache and worsening neck stiffness. An MRI of his cervical spine showed C1/C2 osteomyelitis with atlantoaxial subluxation. He was initially treated non-operatively with prolonged intravenous antibiotics and external immobilisation of his cervical spine. However, the first course of antibiotics failed, and he represented with a progression of his infection to the contralateral ear. He declined surgical intervention and completed a second course of antibiotics. Unfortunately, he eventually progressed to cervical myelopathy and subsequently underwent posterior C1 decompression with occipital to C4 instrumentation. There was no biochemical or bacterial culture evidence of infection at the time of the surgery. This case highlights the potential challenges in the management of cervical osteomyelitis-optimal duration of antibiotics is not supported by strong evidence and the clinician will therefore have to decide each treatment in the context of the patient. Spinal instability may still remain an issue after adequate treatment of the infection.","['Low G', 'Leong A', 'George R', 'Tan G']",2020,4,,AME Case Rep,"Low G, et al.

32771074,Candida Skull Base Osteomyelitis: a Case Report and Literature Review.,"Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) also commonly known as malignant otitis externa was first described by Meltzer and Kelemen in 1959. Prior to the advent of the antibiotic era, this disease carried a poor prognosis with significant morbidity. It often proved fatal with mortality rates as high as 50%. Commonly seen in the immunocompromised patients, diabetes mellitus is an important associated comorbidity in the pathophysiologic development of this disease. Treatment is instituted by medical therapy with surgery having a limited role. Surgical intervention has a limited role, for example, in fungal SBO. Such cases may require local debridement and intraoperative tissue biopsies for histopathologic confirmation. This is to demonstrate fungal invasion into the skull base, as well as to exclude other sinister differential diagnoses like squamous cell carcinoma of temporal bone.

32716068,Preliminary evaluation of two commercial ear solutions in the treatment of canine otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVES: Preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of two commercial ear solutions composed of (1) chlorhexidine-Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or (2) medical grade honey, for the treatment of otitis externa in dogs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dogs affected with otitis externa housed in an animal shelter were eligible for inclusion. Treatment was applied daily for 10 days and effect was measured by otitis clinical scores and microbiological counts. One of the treatments was applied to affected left ears, while the other was applied to affected right ears.
RESULTS: A total of 24 ears from 13 dogs were included in the study. During the treatment period, with both treatments it was observed an improvement in clinical scores and a decrease in microbiological counts. At the end of the study 22 of 24 ears were deemed to have mild (4 ears), or no (18 ears) pain, with only two ears still showing pruritus.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The application of ear solutions composed of chlorhexidine-Tris-EDTA or medical grade honey, in the absence of antimicrobial treatment, might be effective for the control of clinical signs and microbial colonisation in dogs with otitis externa. Additional randomised studies on clinical patients are required to validate these findings.","['Fregeneda-Grandes JM', 'Nicolás-González JJ', 'Rejas-López J', 'Carvajal-Urueña A']",2020,61,9,J Small Anim Pract,"Fregeneda-Grandes JM, et al.

32716063,Otoscopic evaluation of epithelial remnants in the tympanic cavity after total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability to detect the presence of epithelial remnants after total ear canal ablation (TECA) and lateral bulla osteotomy (LBO) with endoscopy and to identify the most common locations of epithelial remnants after tympanic curettage.
STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study.
ANIMALS: Five fresh canine cadavers with no gross evidence of middle ear disease.
METHODS: Ten TECA-LBO were performed by four surgeons. After tympanic curettage, a 1.9-mm rigid 30° endoscope was inserted into the rostral, caudal, dorsal, ventral, and medial sections of the tympanic cavity. Three observers evaluated otoscopic images for epithelial remnants in each compartment. The median distribution of epithelial remnants was calculated for each section of the tympanic cavity with a three-dimensional tympanic cavity model.
RESULTS: Epithelial remnants were identified in at least one of the five areas of the tympanic cavity after each TECA-LBO. The rostral section contained the most epithelial remnants (35.6%), while the medial section contained the least amount (1.8%).
CONCLUSION: Use of a 1.9-mm rigid endoscope was an effective method to evaluate all sections of the tympanic cavity after curettage in TECA-LBO. Epithelial remnants were consistently found after TECA-LBO, especially in the rostral compartment.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Intraoperative endoscopy should be considered to improve removal of epithelium after initial TECA-LBO or revision surgeries.","['Watt MM', 'Regier PJ', 'Ferrigno CRA', 'McConkey MJ', 'Fox-Alvarez WA', 'Bertran J']",2020,49,7,Vet Surg,"Watt MM, et al.

32715501,Azithromycin concentration in severely inflamed canine external ear canals - a case series.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine azithromycin concentration in severely inflamed canine external ear canals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five dogs of various breeds and ages with severe and chronic otitis externa underwent ear canal reconstruction surgery. A single oral dose of azithromycin at 10 mg/kg was administered 12 to 24 hours prior to surgery. Tissue samples were collected from the excised external ear canals and azithromycin concentration was determined using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method.
RESULTS: Azithromycin concentrations ranging from 11.4 to 107.0 μg/g (mean 59.2 ± 44.6 μg/g, median 50.9 μg/g) were detected in the chronically infected external ear canal tissue 12 to 24 hours after administration.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Little information exists on antibiotic concentrations in pathological tissues of dogs. Macrolides are known to concentrate in skin tissue. In light of the present results, investigation of clinical efficacy of azithromycin in chronic canine otitis externa is warranted.","['Perry E', 'Lavy E', 'Soback S', 'Britzi M', 'Zur G']",2020,61,7,J Small Anim Pract,"Perry E, et al.

32713390,The changing nature of paediatric otomycosis in the mid-west of Ireland.,"BACKGROUND: Fungal otitis externa is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical climates; however, over the past two decades, there has been a reported increase in the prevalence of otomycosis in paediatric patients from more temperate climates. This study aimed to review the children diagnosed with otomycosis at the University Hospital Limerick with reference to frequency, causative organism, predisposing factors and management.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of paediatric patients from 2001 to 2015. Patients with positive fungal ear swabs and a diagnosis of otomycosis were identified.
RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were positive for candida (mean age, 5.8 years), 10 patients were positive for aspergillus (mean age, 9.1 years) and 1 patient had mixed fungal infection containing both fungi. There was a positive correlation between a diagnosis of otomycosis and prior treatment with topical fluoroquinolones (r = 0.8; p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of otomycosis has been increasing since 2001, which correlates with an increase in the use of topical fluoroquinolones. Previous studies identify aspergillus as the commonest causative fungi; however, this study found that candida was the commonest isolated fungi in the paediatric population.","['Westby D', ""O'Connell N"", 'Powell J', 'Fenton JE']",2020,134,7,J Laryngol Otol,"Westby D, et al.

32680509,Occurrence of various pathogenic and opportunistic fungi in skin diseases of domestic animals: a retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Fungal infection of animals or humans are common all over the world. Some of microorganisms like fungi, exist on the skin and can be transmitted onto other individuals, other animal species or even humans and cause skin infections. Moreover, they can be the causative agents of severe generalized infections especially in immunocompromised individuals. The study aimed to evaluate the most frequent etiological agents of skin diseases and to compare the prevalence of animal fungal infections in Poland, and to discuss the possibility of transmission to humans in Poland.
RESULTS: The obtained results are culture based. The fungi most frequently isolated from group of animals with skin lesions were Malassezia pachydermatis (29.14%), and Candida yeasts (27.07%), and dermatophytes (23.5%), including Microsporum canis as majority of them (59.25%), and Trichophyton genus (40.7%), most of them T. mentagrophytes, while Malassezia pachydermatis represented (80%) of isolates in animals with otitis externa. In over 19% of positive fungal cultures obtained from external ear canals Candida yeasts, mainly C. albicans, were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Dermatomycoses in companion animals are caused by both, mycelial fungi and yeasts. Most frequently isolated were Malassezia pachydermatis and Candida spp. Dermatophytes (Trichophyton, Microsporum), were also cultured, but the total number of these isolates seems to decrease. We have not found Cryptococcus neoformans in tested clinical samples.","['Dworecka-Kaszak B', 'Biegańska MJ', 'Dąbrowska I']",2020,16,1,BMC Vet Res,"Dworecka-Kaszak B, et al.

32662531,Incidence of presenting complaints and diagnoses in insured Australian dogs.,"Knowledge of the most common presenting complaints and diagnoses in companion animals is valuable in preparing veterinary students and veterinarians to manage the most frequently observed conditions in clinical practice. Pet insurance databases provide access to large sample populations and have been previously used to describe disease incidence in companion animals. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of presenting complaints and diagnoses in insured Australian dogs through the use of a pet insurance database. Analysis of a de-identified dataset containing pet insurance claims associated with presenting complaints and diagnoses from 488,472 insured Australian dogs insured in the years 2016 and 2017, was performed. Annual incidence rates of presenting complaints and diagnoses were calculated and expressed as, number of events per 1,000 dog years at risk. The presenting complaints with the highest incidence were vomiting (14.21 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2016, 15.80 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2017) and pruritus (8.79 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2016, 10.30 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2017). Presenting complaints affecting the gastrointestinal system were the most common (19.20 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2016, 20.77 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2017). The diagnoses with the highest incidence were otitis externa (34.12 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2016, 34.82 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2017) and dermatitis (28.05 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2016, 29.99 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2017). Diagnoses affecting the integument were the most common (216.56 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2016, 219.06 events per 1,000 dog years at risk in 2017). The results from this study can aid in the design of relevant veterinary curricula and may be helpful in prioritising research on common clinical conditions.","['Wolf S', 'Selinger J', 'Ward MP', 'Santos-Smith P', 'Awad M', 'Fawcett A']",2020,98,7,Aust Vet J,"Wolf S, et al.

32612744,Determination of Antimicrobial Prescribing Practices in an Integrated Health System Emergency Department.,"INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic stewardship utilizes interprofessional collaborative practices, including professionals from medicine, pharmacy, nursing, social services, and clinical laboratory science, to identify potential problems proactively. A tertiary care integrated health system's Emergency Department (ED) aimed to identify antimicrobials prescribed to the outpatient community as part of a proactive antimicrobial stewardship project.
METHODS: A pilot, prospective, snapshot of a tertiary community hospital's outpatient antimicrobial prescribing habits was conducted. All subjects were identified via a daily report of patients discharged from the ED over 30 days in the summer of 2017 and individually reviewed for prescribed antimicrobial(s). Exclusions were hospital admission, antimicrobial sensitivity, and antimicrobial courses less than five days or more than 14 days. The primary goal was determining the number of antimicrobial oral tablets/capsule prescriptions to adult outpatients within a 5 to 14-day treatment window. Secondary goals were to include the diagnosis, non-capsule/tablet antimicrobial, pediatric patients, and prescriptions outside the treatment window.
RESULTS: Total number of antimicrobial prescriptions over the 30-day period was 653 in 5,520 individual visits. Total number of adults prescribed oral antimicrobials was 467 (15.6 daily). Patients were diagnosed with infections including urinary tract, cellulitis, soft tissue injury, abscess, upper respiratory, dental caries, gastrointestinal, sexually transmitted, otitis media/externa, pneumonia, viral, pyelonephritis, tick-borne, fungal, Bell's Palsy, and sepsis. The number of non-adult, non-oral, and outside window treatment antimicrobial prescriptions were 186 (6.2 daily). With an average 184 patients treated in the ED daily, approximately 11.8% received antimicrobial treatment on discharge.
CONCLUSION: Important aspects of the project were the evaluation of antimicrobial prescribing habits for a midwest ED and identification of potential complications requiring future interventions for follow-up or preventative measures to assist in patient care and community health. Areas of practice improvement were identified inadvertently as a result of this project. Potential future studies included seasonal variability, whether the patient obtained a prescription and complied with treatment, and differences between inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial prescribing practices.","['Sartain S', 'Price J', 'Bitner B', 'Wolfe E', 'Ortiz D']",2020,13,,Kans J Med,"Sartain S, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: ENT Department in collaboration with Pathology Department, KEMU/Mayo Hospital, Lahore from 2016 to 2019.  Methodology: Patients with NOE were inducted. Studied variables included age at presentation, gender, diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, comorbid conditions, facial nerve involvement, hearing loss, CT and biopsy findings, and causative organisms; and their association with outcome was observed with significance at p<0.05.
RESULTS: Out of 28 patients, there were 17 males (60.7%) and 11 females (39.3%). Association between gender and survival showed that 41.2% (7) males and 27.3% (3) females survived; and 23.5% (4) males and 1 (9.1%) female expired within six months of diagnosis. Thinning of temporal bone (2/5=40%) was common among the expired patients. Twenty percent (1/5) patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and 80% (4/5)with granulation tissue (GT) expired (p=0.543) All ten patients (100%) that improved had mild to moderate hearing loss (p <0.001). Among expired group, 80% (4/5) had HBA1c of more than 7 and 20% (1/5) had good control of diabetes. Aspergillus (2/5=40%) and Pseudomonas (1/5=20%) were the commonest among expired patients; Staphylococcus (6/10=60%) and Pseudomonas (3/10=30%) infections were more frequent among the survived (p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: Previously pseudomonal infection was described as the only causative agent of NOE. This study showed a rising community-acquired disease with Staphylococcus aureus 6/10 (60%) and Pseudomonas 3/10 (30%) infection. Fungal infection is associated with poor survival and death, thus requiring aggressive management. Thinning of temporal bone on CT, uncontrolled diabetes, sever hearing loss and facial paralysis score V/VI were associated with poor outcome of disease.

36338183,Defining appropriate antibiotic prescribing in primary care: A modified Delphi panel approach.,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial overuse contributes to antimicrobial resistance. In the ambulatory setting, where more than 90% of antibiotics are dispensed, there are no Canadian benchmarks for appropriate use. This study aims to define the expected appropriate outpatient antibiotic prescribing rates for three age groups (<2, 2-18, >18 years) using a modified Delphi method.
METHODS: We developed an online questionnaire to solicit from a multidisciplinary panel (community-academic family physicians, adult-paediatric infectious disease physicians, and antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists) what percentage of 23 common clinical conditions would appropriately be treated with systemic antibiotics followed with in-person meetings to achieve 100% consensus.
RESULTS: The panelists reached consensus for one condition online and 22 conditions face-to-face, which took an average of 2.6 rounds of discussion per condition (range, min-max 1-5). The consensus for appropriate systemic antibiotic prescribing rates were, for pneumonia, pyelonephritis, non-purulent skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), other bacterial infections, and reproductive tract infections, 100%; urinary tract infections, 95%-100%; prostatitis, 95%; epididymo-orchitis, 85%-88%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 50%; purulent SSTI, 35%-50%; otitis media, 30%-40%; pharyngitis, 18%-40%; acute sinusitis, 18%-20%; chronic sinusitis, 14%; bronchitis, 5%-8%; gastroenteritis, 4%-5%; dental infections, 4%; eye infections, 1%; otitis externa, 0%-1%; and asthma, common cold, influenza, and other non-bacterial infections (0%). (Note that some differed by age group.).
CONCLUSIONS: This study resulted in expert consensus for defined levels of appropriate antibiotic prescribing across a broad set of outpatient conditions. These results can be applied to community antimicrobial stewardship initiatives to investigate the level of inappropriate use and set targets to optimize antibiotic use.","['Wu JH', 'Langford B', 'Ha R', 'Garber G', 'Daneman N', 'Johnstone J', 'McIsaac W', 'Sharpe S', 'Tu K', 'Schwartz KL']",2020,5,2,J Assoc Med Microbiol Infect Dis Can,"Wu JH, et al.

DATA EXTRACTION: Study demographics, underlying conditions, infectious etiology, treatments, signs and symptoms, and outcomes.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Ten studies, totalling 284 patients with a mean age of 67.8 years, were included. The time period of collected patient data ranged from 2000 to 2018. Temporal subgroup analysis was conducted before and after 2009. Cure rate was lower in the post-2009 group (76.0 versus 94.1%, p < 0.01) while disease-specific mortality remained stable. Increases in proportions of diabetes and culture negative results (p < 0.01) were also observed in this latter group. Rate of extensive surgery and the use of ciprofloxacin decreased (p < 0.01), while the use of ceftazidime increased in the post-2009 group (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: A decrease in cure rate of NOE patients was observed in the setting of an increase in prevalence of diabetes.

It is associated with bacteria and yeast, which are regarded as secondary causes. Cerumen is a biological substance playing an important role in the protection of ear skin. The involvement of cerumen in immune defense is poorly understood. MicroRNAs can modulate the host immune response and can provide promising biomarkers for several inflammatory and infectious disorder diagnosis. The aims of this study were to profile the cerumen miRNA signature associated with otitis externa in dogs, integrate miRNAs to their target genes related to immune functions, and investigate their potential use as biomarkers. Cerumen was collected from healthy and otitis affected dogs and the expression of miRNAs was profiled by Next Generation Sequencing; the validation of the altered miRNAs was performed using RT-qPCR. The potential ability of miRNAs to modulate immune-related genes was investigated using bioinformatics tools. The results pointed out that 32 miRNAs, of which 14 were up- and 18 down-regulated, were differentially expressed in healthy vs. otitis-affected dogs. These results were verified by RT-qPCR. To assess the diagnostic value of miRNAs, ROC analysis was carried out, highlighting that 4 miRNAs are potential biomarkers to discriminate otitis-affected dogs. Bioinformatics showed that cerumen miRNAs may be involved in the modulation of host immune response. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs can be efficiently extracted and quantified from cerumen, that their profile changes between healthy and otitis affected dogs, and that they may serve as potential biomarkers. Further studies are necessary to confirm their diagnostic value and to investigate their interaction with immune-related genes.","['Lecchi C', 'Zamarian V', 'Borriello G', 'Galiero G', 'Grilli G', 'Caniatti M', ""D'Urso ES"", 'Roccabianca P', 'Perego R', 'Minero M', 'Legnani S', 'Calogero R', 'Arigoni M', 'Ceciliani F']",2020,11,,Front Immunol,"Lecchi C, et al.

32505469,An emergency medicine-focused review of malignant otitis externa.,"INTRODUCTION: Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a progressive infection of the external auditory canal (EAC). This disease is rare but has severe morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVE: This narrative review provides an overview of malignant otitis externa for emergency clinicians.
DISCUSSION: MOE is an invasive external ear infection that spreads to the temporal bone and can further progress to affect intracranial structures. Complications of advanced MOE include cranial nerve involvement, most commonly the facial nerve, and intracranial infections such as abscess and meningitis. The most common causative agent of MOE is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but others include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fungi. Major risk factors for MOE include diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and advanced age. Red flags for MOE include severe otalgia (pain out of proportion to exam) or severe otorrhea, neurologic deficits (especially facial nerve involvement), previously diagnosed otitis externa not responsive to therapy, and patients with major risk factors for MOE. Examination may show purulent otorrhea or granulation tissue in the EAC, and culture of EAC drainage should be performed. Diagnosis is aided by computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast, which may demonstrate bony destruction of the temporal bone or skull base. When suspecting MOE, early consultation with an otolaryngologist is recommended and antibiotics with pseudomonal coverage are needed. Most patients with MOE will require admission to the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: MOE is a rare, yet deadly diagnosis that must be suspected when patients with immunocompromise, diabetes, or advanced age present with severe otalgia. Rapid diagnosis and treatment may prevent complications and improve outcomes.","['Long DA', 'Koyfman A', 'Long B']",2020,38,8,Am J Emerg Med,"Long DA, et al.

Progression of the disease process can result in serious sequelae, including cranial nerve palsies and death. There is currently no formal published treatment guideline.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to integrate current evidence and data from our own retrospective case series in order to develop a guideline to optimise necrotising otitis externa patient management.
METHODS: A retrospective review of necrotising otitis externa cases within NHS Lothian, Scotland, between 2013 and 2018, was performed, along with a PubMed review.
RESULTS: Prevalent presenting signs, symptoms and patient demographic data were established. Furthermore, features of cases associated with adverse outcomes were defined. A key feature of the guideline is defining at-risk patients with initial intensive treatment. Investigations and outcomes are assessed and treatment adjusted appropriately.
CONCLUSION: This multi-departmental approach has facilitated the development of a succinct, systematic guideline for the management of necrotising otitis externa. Initial patient outcomes appear promising.","['Hopkins ME', 'Bennett A', 'Henderson N', 'MacSween KF', 'Baring D', 'Sutherland R']",2020,134,6,J Laryngol Otol,"Hopkins ME, et al.

32498734,Prediction of skull base osteomyelitis in necrotising otitis externa with diffusion-weighted imaging.,"OBJECTIVE: To predict skull base osteomyelitis in patients with necrotising otitis externa using diffusion-weighted imaging.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 25 necrotising otitis externa patients with skull base osteomyelitis (n = 10) or without skull base involvement (n = 14) who underwent a single-shot diffusion-weighted imaging of the skull base.
RESULTS: The respective mean apparent diffusion coefficient values of the skull base, as determined by two reviewers, were 0.851 ± 0.15 and 0.841 ± 0.14 ×10-3mm2/s for the skull base osteomyelitis patients, and 1.065 ± 0.19 and 1.045 ± 0.20 ×10-3mm2/s for the necrotising otitis externa patients without skull base involvement. The difference in apparent diffusion coefficients between the groups was significant, for both reviewers (p = 0.008 and 0.012). The optimal threshold apparent diffusion coefficient for predicting skull base osteomyelitis in necrotising otitis externa patients was 0.945 ×10-3mm2/s and 0.915 ×10-3mm2/s, with an area under the curve of 0.825 and 0.800, accuracy of 87.5 and 83.3 per cent, sensitivity of 85.7 and 90.0 per cent, and specificity of 90.0 and 78.6 per cent, for each reviewer respectively.

32407559,Cytological and microbiological characteristics of middle ear effusions in brachycephalic dogs.,"BACKGROUND: Middle ear effusion is common in brachycephalic dogs with similarities to otitis media with effusion in children. Association with the cranial and eustachian tube morphology and bacterial infection is suspected in both species.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine cytological and bacteriological features of middle ear effusions in dogs, provide information on histological features, and further assess the dog as a model of the human disease.
ANIMALS: Sixteen live dogs, 3 postmortem cases of middle ear effusion, and 2 postmortem controls.
METHODS: Prospective; clinical investigation using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, video-otoscopy, myringotomy; cytological assessment of 30 and bacteriology of 28 effusions; histology and immunohistochemistry (CD3 for T-lymphocytes, Pax5 for B lymphocytes and MAC387 for macrophages) of 10 middle ear sections.
RESULTS: Effusions were associated with neurological deficits in 6/16 (38%) and concurrent atopic dermatitis and otitis externa in 9/16 (56%) of live cases. Neutrophils and macrophages predominated on cytology (median 60 [range 2%-95.5%] and 27 [2%-96.5%]) whether culture of effusions was positive or not. In histology sections, the mucosa was thickened in affected dogs but submucosal gland dilatation occurred in affected and unaffected dogs. There was no bacterial growth from 22/28 (79%) of effusions. Bacteria isolated from the other 6 (21%) were predominantly Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (4/6, 67%).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Clinical, morphological, and cytological findings in middle ear effusions of dogs and people suggest similar pathogeneses. Middle ear effusion of dogs could be a useful model of human otitis media with effusion.

32401207,Inner-Ear Disorders Presenting with Air-Bone Gaps: A Review.,"Air-bone gaps (ABGs) are commonly found in patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss generally due to outer- and/or middle-ear diseases such as otitis externa, tympanic membrane perforation, interruption or fixation of the ossicular chain, and chronic suppurative otitis media. ABGs can also be found in correlation with inner-ear disorders, such as endolymphatic hydrops, enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome, semicircular canal dehiscence, gusher syndrome, cochlear dehiscence, and Paget disease's as well cerebral vascular anomalies including dural arteriovenous fistula. The typical clinical presentation of inner-ear conditions or cerebral vascular anomalies causing ABGs includes audiological and vestibular symptoms like vertigo, oscillopsia, dizziness, imbalance, spinning sensation, pulsatile or continuous tinnitus, hyperacusis, autophony, auricular fullness, Tullio's phenomenon, and Hennebert's sign. Establishing a definitive diagnosis of the underlying condition in patients presenting with an ABG is often challenging to do and, in many patients, the condition may remain undefined. Results from an accurate clinical, audiological, and vestibular evaluation can be suggestive for the underlying condition; however, radiological assessment by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging is mandatory to confirm any diagnostic suspicion. In this review, we describe and discuss the most recent updates available regarding the clinical presentation and diagnostic workup of inner-ear conditions that may present together with ABGs.","['Scarpa A', 'Ralli M', 'Cassandro C', 'Gioacchini FM', 'Greco A', 'Di Stadio A', 'Cavaliere M', 'Troisi D', 'de Vincentiis M', 'Cassandro E']",2020,16,1,J Int Adv Otol,"Scarpa A, et al.

However, attempts at removal made outside the healthcare setting by untrained persons can result in complications of varying degrees. We conducted a 3-year retrospective review of 123 cases of aural foreign bodies at our hospital in Nigeria. Our patient population was made up of 80 males and 43 females, aged 2 to 67 years (mean: 13.2); almost three-fourths of these patients were aged 15 years or younger. Only 40 of them (32.5%) presented to an otolaryngologist within 12 hours of foreign-body insertion. A total of 30 patients (24.4%) had initially undergone removal attempts by a non-otolaryngologist prior to receiving trained ENT care, and 23 of them experienced a total of 41 complications: 17 cases of canal abrasion, laceration, and/or bleeding, 8 cases of otitis externa, 6 cases of tympanic membrane perforation, 5 cases of impaired hearing, 3 cases of chronic suppurative otitis media, and 2 cases of middle ear involvement. Of the 93 patients who were seen by an otolaryngologist initially, only 6 (6.5%) developed a complication: 4 cases of canal abrasion, laceration, and/or bleeding and 2 cases of otitis externa.

32367959,Diagnostic evaluation of a point-of-care test for culture and microbial susceptibility testing in canine dermatological infections in clinical practice.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Empirical antimicrobial therapy is frequently given in superficial bacterial folliculitis (SBF) and otitis externa (OE) in dogs, especially for the initial clinical presentation. Culture and subsequent antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) are generally limited to chronic cases with poor response to initial therapy. Several factors contribute to the failure to implement the use of AST in veterinary practice, i.e., long laboratory turnaround time or special requirements for sample shipping. Point-of-care (PoC) testing might reduce laboratory turnaround time and costs and the risk of emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. This study evaluated the Speed Biogram™ PoC test in canine SBF and OE compared with conventional methods for culture and AST.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four canine samples were analyzed: eleven from SBF, seven from bacterial OE, four from mixed OE, six from 
RESULTS: Se and Sp of PoC test in discriminating between healthy and unhealthy subjects were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87.66-100.00) and 100% (95% CI 54.1-100.0), respectively. For bacterial identification, the k value was 0.532. Se and Sp of PoC tests for AST were 81.73% (95% CI 72.95-88.63) and 93.10% (95% CI 88.86-96.98), respectively with a total good agreement between tests (mean k=0.714), but major (8/27) and very major (19/27) errors were observed in 55% of bacterial conventional culture-positive samples.
CONCLUSION: PoC test can identify dogs with SBF and OE, but AST is not sufficiently accurate. The lack of susceptibility testing for methicillin makes this test inappropriate for use in small animal practice.","['Perego R', 'Spada E', 'Martino PA', 'Proverbio D']",2020,13,3,Vet World,"Perego R, et al.

The synchondroses of the skull base have a significant influence on the shape of the skull. The sphenooccipital synchondrosis (SOS) is the last of the basal synchondroses to ossify. This report is about residual ossification of SOS in an elderly patient with DS.
CASE REPORT: The 65-year-old DS patient was polytraumatized by a fall. In the course of treatment, a purulent otitis externa on the right side was diagnosed, which had developed as a result of the fracture of the fossa glenoidalis. Computed tomograms of the skull base showed the fracture of the mandibular condyle, glenoid fossa and vestiges of SOS.
CONCLUSION: The coincidental finding of vestiges of SOS in an elderly patient with DS raises the question of whether cross-sectional skull base images can show differences in the ossification of SOS between DS patients and a normal population.","['Friedrich RE', 'Kohlrusch FK', 'Grzyska U']",2020,34,3,In Vivo,"Friedrich RE, et al.

32293442,Antimicrobial resistance and novel mutations detected in the gyrA and parC genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from companion dogs.,"BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolone agents, such as enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin, are commonly used for pseudomonal infection in veterinary medicine. However, the rate of resistance to fluoroquinolones is rapidly increasing, according to multiple studies in various countries. Point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) are closely related to the increased fluoroquinolone resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aim of this study was to investigate current antimicrobial susceptibility and fluoroquinolone resistance in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from dogs. The presence of point mutations in the QRDR was confirmed by gyrA and parC polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 84 nonduplicated P. aeruginosa strains were obtained from 228 healthy dogs (healthy group) and 260 dogs with clinical signs (infected group). Among these isolates, 38 strains from the healthy group were detected in several sample types, whereas 46 strains from the infected group were obtained mostly from dogs' ears with otitis externa (41/260, 15.8%). All strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, while some were also resistant to enrofloxacin (23/84, 27.4%), marbofloxacin (17/84, 20.2%), levofloxacin (12/84, 14.3%), or ciprofloxacin (11/84, 13.1%). Enrofloxacin resistance was significantly higher in strains from the infected group than in those from the healthy group (p < 0.05). Among the 23 fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, 8 and 4 different mutations were detected in the gyrA and parC genes, respectively. Mutations in gyrA were significantly common in the infected group (p < 0.05). Hotspots for the gyrA and parC mutations were Thr83 (34.8%, 8/23) and Pro116 (91.3%, 21/23), respectively. Double and triple mutations were also found in 5 of the strains.
CONCLUSION: Novel mutations in the gyrA and parC genes were first found in P. aeruginosa isolated from companion dogs in South Korea. These findings suggest that it is important to encourage prudent use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in canine pseudomonal infection treatment.","['Park Y', 'Oh J', 'Park S', 'Sum S', 'Song W', 'Chae J', 'Park H']",2020,16,1,BMC Vet Res,"Park Y, et al.

32209516,Malignant Otitis Externa: Causes for Various Treatment Responses.,"OBJECTIVES: Malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa (MOE) is an aggressive form of skin inflammation of the external ear with a tendency to spread infection to the temporal bone. The study aimed to evaluate a causal relationship between treatment responses and clinical features in patients with MOE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective, descriptive section study, the database was analyzed between January 2008 and December 2018 in our department, all patients with diagnosed MOE were identified.
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were evaluated, of which 27 men and 3 women. The youngest patient was 52 years old while he was eldest 88 years, (mean-71 years old). As the most common comorbidity, diabetes mellitus was found in 23 (76%) subjects. Median duration of symptoms was about 3 months. The most common isolated pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (47%). Patients with facial nerve palsy and erosion of temporal bone find on computerized tomography affect prolonged stationary treatment (Mean, SD 29.2±8.5 and 26,7±11.6 days), while 80% of patients with facial nerve palsy had recurrence of disease (p=0.005) with mean duration of clinical remission of 60±17.3 days. Overall length of treatment is also increased in the presence of comorbidities as well as in patients with cranial nerve involvement.
CONCLUSION: Patients with cranial nerve involvement, erosion of temporal bone and presence of comorbidities affect prolonged treatment and adverse prognosis. Early diagnosis and initiation of aggressive therapy are essential for stopping the further spread of the disease and prevention of serious complications.","['Arsovic N', 'Radivojevic N', 'Jesic S', 'Babac S', 'Cvorovic L', 'Dudvarski Z']",2020,16,1,J Int Adv Otol,"Arsovic N, et al.

Moreover, to investigate the zoonotic potential of the isolate, microbiological examinations on the family members were performed. An A. baumanniistrain was isolated from nasal swab in one of the dog owners. The identity of bacterial strains, either from dog and owner, was confirmed by phenotypic and molecular typing (wgMLST). Furthermore, to assess the pathogenic potential of the isolates a deep characterization of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes was done by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Finally, the susceptibility towards a wide panel of antimicrobials was investigated. In our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of A. baumanniiisolation from canine auricular swabs in Italy. And interestingly, this study underlines the possible spread of this microorganism from human to animal.","['Nocera FP', 'Addante L', 'Capozzi L', 'Bianco A', 'Fiorito F', 'De Martino L', 'Parisi A']",2020,70,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Nocera FP, et al.

32204657,Audiometric Outcomes and Middle Ear Disease following Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak Repair.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate audiometric outcomes and incidence of chronic ear disease following lateral skull base repair (LSBR) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
SETTING: Tertiary skull base center.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Consecutive adults undergoing LSBR of CSF leaks between 2012 and 2018 were reviewed. Audiometric data included mean air conduction pure-tone average (PTA), air-bone gap (ABG), speech recognition threshold (SRT), and word recognition score (WRS). The incidence and management of the following were collected: effusion, retraction, otitis media and externa, perforation, and cholesteatoma.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients underwent transmastoid (n = 5), middle cranial fossa (n = 2), or combined approach (n = 67) for repair of spontaneous leaks (sCSFLs, n = 41) and those occurring in the setting of chronic ear disease (ceCSFLs, n = 32). ABG decreased 7.23 dB (
CONCLUSION: Lateral skull base repair of CSF leaks maintained or improved hearing. Patients with preexisting chronic ear disease were more likely to require additional intervention to sustain adequate middle ear aeration compared to the sCSFL cohort. LSBR of sCSFL does not appear to increase risk for developing chronic ear disease.","['Yancey KL', 'Manzoor NF', 'Haynes DS', 'Bennett ML', ""O'Malley M"", 'Rivas A']",2020,162,6,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Yancey KL, et al.

32192496,Management of otitis externa with an led-illuminated gel: a randomized controlled clinical trial in dogs.,"BACKGROUND: Canine otitis externa is a painful condition which can be challenging to treat due to difficulties in the administration of otic medication. This can be due to lack of owner compliance in the application of ear drops or due to the resentment that some dogs demonstrate when attempts are made to administer topical medication into a sensitive ear canal. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a topical LED-illuminated gel (LIG) in canine otitis externa in comparison to standard of care therapy. Dogs with spontaneous otitis externa were randomly allocated in three groups: groups QW received LIG once weekly; BW received LIG twice weekly; group C received enrofloxacin and silver sulfadiazine twice daily. LIG consists of a topical application of a gel containing chromophores that, when illuminated by a LED lamp, re-emit fluorescent light which can stimulate physiological responses, promoting healing and controlling bacteria. The evaluation protocol (T
RESULTS: All groups (QW, n = 21; BW, n = 23; C, n = 20) showed improvement during the study (QW: P < 0.02 for cytological and pain scores, P < 0.003 for bacteriologic assessment, P < 10
CONCLUSIONS: All treatment groups showed a positive clinical effect. LIG administered twice-a-week was the most favourable protocol of the study. LIG may be considered beneficial in the management of canine otitis externa; it seems to be effective in controlling the clinical condition, including the signs of inflammation and local pain, the bacterial growth, and it may help increasing treatment compliance.","['Tambella AM', 'Attili AR', 'Beribè F', 'Galosi M', 'Marchegiani A', 'Cerquetella M', 'Palumbo Piccionello A', 'Vullo C', 'Spaterna A', 'Fruganti A']",2020,16,1,BMC Vet Res,"Tambella AM, et al.

32139197,Aspergillus necrotizing otitis externa with temporomandibulozygomatic involvement.,"INTRODUCTION: Aspergillus necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) is a rare disease, often associated with delayed diagnosis, the management of which is poorly defined.
SUMMARY: The authors report a case of Aspergillus flavus necrotizing otitis externa with temporomandibular arthritis and temporozygomatic osteomyelitis with Staphylococcal coinfection in a diabetic patient. The diagnosis and discontinuation of treatment were guided by PET-CT scan. A favourable course without sequelae was observed after repeated surgical curettage and 3 months of antifungal therapy.
DISCUSSION: Aspergillus flavus is the agent most commonly incriminated in NOE. Indirect diagnostic tests (serology) may be negative. The diagnosis is based on imaging-guided surgical biopsy with histological examination and standard and fungal microbiological culture. Treatment requires a combination of surgery and antifungal therapy. The duration of antifungal therapy is poorly defined and discontinuation of therapy can be guided by PET-CT scan.","['Noroy L', 'Pujo K', 'Leghzali-Moise H', 'Saison J']",2020,137,2,Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,"Noroy L, et al.

32133891,Skull Base Osteomyelitis Complicated by Petrous Internal Carotid Artery Blowout.,"Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is an invasive infection of the external auditory canal, with involvement of the skull base, typically in the elderly diabetic population. Diagnosis may be challenging, as it requires a combination of clinical, laboratory, and radiographical findings. The mainstay of treatment is long-term antibiotic therapy, but surgical debridement of the temporal bone may be necessary in refractory cases. Commonly reported complications include cranial neuropathies, meningitis, temporal lobe abscess, and dural venous sinus thrombosis. A rare and life-threatening complication of SBO is petrous internal carotid artery (ICA) blowout, which has been described as presenting with bleeding from the ear. Here, we describe the case of a 77-year-old woman with SBO complicated by a petrous ICA blowout, which presented with fulminant epistaxis. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of a massive hemorrhage from a petrous ICA blowout secondary to SBO and the first presentation with massive epistaxis. We present this case to raise awareness of this potential impending complication in patients with SBO and recommend consideration of this etiology when assessing patients with massive epistaxis in the appropriate clinical setting.

Therefore, it is important to research on alternative therapies to antibiotics. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of four garlic derivatives on microorganisms commonly isolated in ear infections.
METHODS: The antimicrobial activities of allicin, s-allyl cysteine (SAC), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and s-allyl mercaptocysteine (SAMC) were investigated on standard strains of commonly isolated microorganisms using the broth microdilution method. The test strains were selected among the microorganisms responsible for chronic suppurative otitis media and otitis externa. These microorganisms were 
RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of allicin and SAC ranged from 0.125 to 20 μg/mL for fermentative bacteria (
CONCLUSION: Both allicin and SAC showed antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms, even at low concentrations.

32052142,Surgery for necrotizing otitis externa-indications and surgical findings.,"PURPOSE: Treatment for necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) includes long term antibiotic and surgery in selected cases. Indications and extent of surgery, however, are still not defined. The aims of this study were: (1) present our experience in surgery for NOE (2) compare high-resolution computer tomography and perioperative findings (3) suggest recommendations for indications and extent of surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective case series study was conducted in a tertiary referral center. Patients hospitalized due to NOE between the years 1990-2015 and underwent surgery were included.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were included in the study. HRTBCT was performed in 17 patients. Most common radiological findings included mastoid fullness (n = 13, 76.4%) and edema of external ear canal (n = 12, 70.5%). Surgical indications included lack of response to treatment (n = 18) and facial nerve palsy (n = 2). Seven patients underwent local debridement. Most common operative findings included soft tissue necrosis (n = 4, 57.1%) and gross bony destruction of the external ear canal (n = 2, 28.5%). Thirteen patients underwent tympanomastoid surgery. Most common operative findings included granulation tissue in the mastoid (n = 7, 53.8%) and mastoid bony erosion (n = 4, 30.7%). Facial canal involvement was seen in four patients (30.7%).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to describe a large group of surgically treated NOE. Initial surgical approach should be based on clinical and HRTBCT findings. Minimal HRTBCT findings may be addressed with local debridement. Severe HRTBCT findings should be addressed with canal wall up mastoidectomy as the minimal surgical procedure. Further extent should be decided based on perioperative findings.","['Peled C', 'Parra A', 'El-Saied S', 'Kraus M', 'Kaplan DM']",2020,277,5,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Peled C, et al.

32046714,Demography and commonly recorded clinical conditions of Chihuahuas under primary veterinary care in the UK in 2016.,"BACKGROUND: The Chihuahua, the world's smallest dog breed, is a popular breed in the UK today. The VetCompass™ Programme collates de-identified clinical records from primary-care veterinary practices in the UK for epidemiological research. This study aimed to characterise the demography, age at death and common disorders of Chihuahuas under primary veterinary care during 2016 in the UK.
RESULTS: Chihuahuas comprised 11,647/336,865 (3.46%) dogs under veterinary care during 2016. The annual proportional birth rate for Chihuahuas rose from 1.01% in 2005 to 5.35% in 2016. Median adult bodyweight was 3.4 kg (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.7-4.3, range 0.8-9.8).). Median age was 2.8 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.6-4.9). Median age at death from this young expanding population was 8.2 years (IQR 3.5-12.1). Females (10.2 years) outlived males (6.9 years) (Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.005). The most common grouped causes of death were heart disease (18.8%, 95% CI: 10.9-29.0), lower respiratory tract disorder (16.3%, 95% CI: 8.9-26.2) and traumatic injury (13.8%, 95% CI: 7.1-23.3). The most common specific disorders were periodontal disease (13.5%, 95% CI: 12.6-14.4), obesity (5.9%, 95% CI: 5.3-6.5), retained deciduous dentition (5.7%, 95% CI: 5.1-6.4), anal sac impaction (4.9%, 95% CI: 4.4-5.5) and aggression (4.2%, 95% CI: 3.7-4.8). Among the 28 most common fine-level disorders, males had statistically (P <  0.005) higher probability than females for 5 disorders (aggression, heart murmur, otitis externa, conjunctivitis and upper respiratory tract infection). There were no disorders with statistically (P <  0.005) higher prevalence in females.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documented rising ownership and a currently youthful population of Chihuahuas in the UK. These results suggest that the Chihuahua is currently undergoing a popularity boom but veterinarians need to be watchful for welfare issues related to impulse purchase of Chihuahua puppies by owners with limited experience of dog care. Periodontal disease, obesity, retained deciduous dentition, anal sac impaction and aggression were identified as common health issues within the breed. The unique veterinary care needs of this popular miniature breed suggest that veterinarians should consider the value of advanced training in anesthesia and dentistry in small-sized dogs.","[""O'Neill DG"", 'Packer RMA', 'Lobb M', 'Church DB', 'Brodbelt DC', 'Pegram C']",2020,16,1,BMC Vet Res,"O'Neill DG, et al.

32036556,Aspergillus flavus malignant external otitis in a diabetic patient: case report and literature review.,"PURPOSE: Malignant external otitis is an aggressive and potentially life-threatening infection. This rare disorder is typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and affects almost exclusively elderly diabetic patients. However, fungal malignant external otitis have been identified, especially in immunocompromised hosts.
METHODS: We report a rare case of invasive malignant external otitis caused by Aspergillus flavus in a diabetic patient without other underlying immunosuppression. A review of Aspergillus spp. malignant external otitis since voriconazole became the first line for invasive aspergillosis was performed.
RESULTS: A 72-year-old man with diabetes mellitus developed invasive malignant external otitis with a vascular involvement. The patient was treated with empiric courses of antibiotics until a fungal infection was diagnosed. Proven Apsergillus infection was based on histopathological examination and isolation of A. flavus from culture of osteo-meningeal biopsies. Despite optimal antimicrobial therapy with voriconazole, the patient presented with cerebral infarction in the setting of an angioinvasive fungal infection leading to a fatal outcome. From a review of the literature, we found 39 previously published cases of proven Aspergillus spp. malignant external otitis treated with new triazoles.
CONCLUSION: Given our experience and the literature review, a fungal etiology should be considered early in the course of malignant external otitis unresponsive to a conventional broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, with the need for a tissue biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.","['Pichon M', 'Joly V', 'Argy N', 'Houze S', 'Bretagne S', 'Alanio A', 'Wassef M', 'Verillaud B', 'Yazdanpanah Y']",2020,48,2,Infection,"Pichon M, et al.

31995351,Skin Infections and Outpatient Burn Management: Skin Infections in Patients With Diabetes.,"Diabetes is associated with many complications, including foot ulcers. Individuals with diabetes have a 15% to 25% likelihood of developing a foot ulcer in their lifetime. The pathophysiologic mechanisms are multifactorial but the major etiologic factors are peripheral vascular disease and diabetic neuropathy. Foot examinations are recommended at least annually for patients with diabetes to assess the risk of foot ulcers and to detect, diagnose, and manage them. Management includes avoidance of walking, weight-bearing limitation, use of therapeutic footwear, use of dressings and debridement, and antibiotics. Due to immune dysfunction, diabetic neuropathy, and poor circulation, patients with diabetes are at increased risk of other types of infections. These include erythrasma, candidiasis, paronychia, onychomycosis, necrotizing fasciitis, Fournier gangrene, otitis externa, and nontuberculous mycobacterial skin infections.

This nationwide, population-based case-control study explored the association of MOE occurrence with previously diagnosed diabetes.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, 753 patients with MOE (cases) and 2 259 propensity score-matched patients without MOE (controls). Multiple logistic regressions were conducted to examine the association of MOE with previously diagnosed diabetes.
RESULTS: In total, 728 (24.2%) out of 3 012 sample patients had diabetes prior to the index date. Chi-square test revealed a significant difference in diabetes prevalence among cases and controls (54.8% vs 13.9%, 
CONCLUSIONS: This study found an association between MOE and diabetes. One clinical practice implication of our study is that when a patient with diabetes complains of otalgia or otorrhea, and physical examination shows swelling of the ear canal or granulation growth, physicians should consider the possibility of MOE.","['Yang TH', 'Xirasagar S', 'Cheng YF', 'Wu CS', 'Kao YW', 'Shia BC', 'Lin HC']",2020,129,6,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"Yang TH, et al.

31960536,The otic microbiota and mycobiota in a referral population of dogs in eastern USA with otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Canine otitis externa (OE) is a common inflammatory disease that is frequently complicated by secondary bacterial and/or yeast infections. The otic microbial population is more complex than appreciated by cytological methods and aerobic culture alone.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Differences in bacterial and fungal populations of the external ear canal will correlate with specific cytological and culture-based definitions of bacterial and Malassezia otitis.
ANIMALS: Forty client-owned dogs; 30 with OE and 10 with healthy ears.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Prospective study comparing cytological samples, aerobic bacterial cultures and culture-independent sequencing-based analyses of the external ear canal. Subjects with OE included 10 dogs with only cocci [≥25/high power field (HPF)] on cytological evaluation and culture of Staphylococcus spp.; 10 dogs with rods (≥25/HPF) and exclusive culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 10 dogs with only yeast on cytological results morphologically compatible with Malassezia spp. (≥5/HPF).
RESULTS: Staphylococcus was the most abundant taxa across all groups. Ears cytologically positive for cocci had decreased diversity, and all types of OE were associated with decreased fungal diversity compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Cytological and culture-based assessment of the ear canal is not predictive of the diverse microbiota of the ear canal in cases of Pseudomonas or Malassezia otitis.

31933313,"Seasonal Variation Of Acute Otitis Externa Presenting To Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad.","BACKGROUND: Otitis Externa is a common inflammatory condition of external ear. It is more common in patients having predisposing conditions like trauma, swimming, patients using hearing aids, certain skin pathologies and immunocompromised patients. Increased humidity in rainy season increases the predisposition to otitis externa.
METHODS: This descriptive study was carried over the duration of one year in ENT department of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad. Patients of all ages and both genders suffering from acute otitis externa were included in the study after taking informed consent. All the information's were recorded in predesigned proforma and then finally evaluated by using SPSS program.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients presenting to us was 39.84±14.48 years (Range 1-78 Years) more commonly in male patients (54.14%). The disease was most commonly seen in rainy season, presenting unilaterally and affecting young adults of age ranging from 31-40 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of otitis externa is more common in humid climate. Precautionary measures should be taken in rainy and humid condition such as avoidance of self cleaning the ear.","['Shah MI', 'Sajid T', 'Ali SM', 'Ibrahim M', 'Zaman A', 'Shinwari WU']",2019,31,4,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Shah MI, et al.

31931581,Differential diagnosis of ear pain.,"Ear pain, otalgia, can have many etiologies. Some of these conditions, e.g. impacted ear wax, can be solved easily directly in the outpatient office. On the other hand, inflammations and its complications can also endanger patients life. Situation is complicated due to secondary otalgia, when the source of pain is localized in another body region, e.g. oropharynx. Stubbing pain in the ear should be in this case perceived as a warning sign, because it could be caused by spread of primary disease to the parapharynx. Aim of this paper is to provide a summary of the most often causes of ear pain correlated with their typical clinical features, It should help to recognize serious conditions, which can endanger patient´s life.","['Bandúrová V', 'Plzák J', 'Bouček J']",2019,158,6,Cas Lek Cesk,"Bandúrová V, et al.

31908074,Patulous Eustachian tube and palatine defect in a Dachshund with chronic unilateral otitis externa and otitis media.,"BACKGROUND: Patulous Eustachian tube (pET) is a rare dysfunction of the Eustachian tube described in humans. It is characterized by failure of the ET to close, resulting in unrestricted passage of air, sound and material between the nasopharynx and the middle ear.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of pET associated with otitis in a dog.
ANIMAL: A 6-year old-female spayed Dachshund dog.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Otoscopic examination, cytological evaluation, culture and susceptibility, computerized tomography (CT), video-otoscopic flushing and surgery.
RESULTS: Left ear otoscopic examination revealed erythema, purulent frothy discharge, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, stenosis and a partial tear of the tympanum. Cytological evaluation from the left external canal showed neutrophils, macrophages, rods and cocci. Aerobic culture showed predominantly multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The CT findings of the left ear included chronic changes in the external canal, marked lysis of the tympanic bulla and marked dilation of the ET. During video-otoscope flushing, saline drained through the mouth. Bilateral incomplete hypoplasia of the soft palate was noted. Total ear canal ablation and bulla osteotomy with ET dissection were curative. Histopathological findings were compatible with chronic otitis externa (OE) and media.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of pET described in animals. The ET dysfunction and palatine defect were likely the cause of the otitis in this dog. Clinicians should investigate pET in animals with signs of OE characterized by frothy liquid and food fragments in the ear canal in addition to sneezing after drinking water.","['Koch SN', 'Torres SMF', 'Kramek B']",2020,31,3,Vet Dermatol,"Koch SN, et al.

The species is divided into two subspecies, S. schleiferi schleiferi and S. schleiferi coagulans. MALDI-TOF MS does not distinguish correctly these two subspecies. This study aimed to identify biomarkers that could possibly discriminate Staphylococcus schleiferi subspecies by MALDI-TOF MS. Twelve strains (eight S. schleiferi schleiferi and four S. schleiferi coagulans) were firstly identified. Each isolate was submitted to a protein extraction protocol and subjected to spectrometry on Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer. Spectra were analyzed with the BioNumerics software v7.6. Our results showed that spectra clustered according to subspecies, and a set of five MALDI-TOF MS biomarkers were selected to enable the discrimination of S. schleiferi subspecies. In addition, these biomarkers were predicted to represent highly conserved proteins, which could contribute to the identification of subspecies-specific proteins that could be used for improved subspecies identification in clinical samples.","['Assumpção YM', 'Teixeira IM', 'Paletta ACC', 'Ferreira EO', 'Pinto TCA', 'Penna BA']",2020,240,,Vet Microbiol,"Assumpção YM, et al.

31858646,Occult otitis media in dogs with chronic otitis externa - magnetic resonance imaging and association with otoscopic and cytological findings.,"BACKGROUND: Identification of perpetuating factors, such as otitis media (OM), is important for the successful management of canine chronic otitis externa (OE).
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Occult OM can occur in cases of chronic OE; a focused magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination is a useful tool in their management.
ANIMALS: One hundred twenty one client-owned dogs presented for investigation and treatment of chronic OE between 2009 and 2018.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Mixed retrospective (74 dogs) and prospective (47 dogs) study of chronic OE cases without neurological signs, describing the MRI, otoscopic and cytological findings; comparing cases with and without MRI evidence of OM.
RESULTS: A total of 123 MRI studies were analysed (two dogs scanned twice). A short, focused MRI scan allowed detection of inflammation of the mucosal bulla lining as well as excellent discrimination between avascular material and vascularised soft tissue in the tympanic cavity. OM was found in 41 of 197 (21%) ears with chronic otitis externa. On otoscopy, the tympanic membrane was intact in six of 41 ears (15%), ruptured in 16 of 41 (39%) and not visible in 14 of 41 (34%) [no data in five of 41 (12%)]. Analysis of cytological findings showed that the presence of rods was only associated with an increased likelihood of OM when found together with inflammatory cells.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Occult OM is a not uncommon finding on MRI of dogs with chronic OE. A targeted MRI study (""bulla mini-scan"") may be useful as part of the clinical investigations.","['Lorek A', 'Dennis R', 'van Dijk J', 'Bannoehr J']",2020,31,2,Vet Dermatol,"Lorek A, et al.

31793833,Partial vertical ear canal resection in two cats.,"CASE DESCRIPTION: An 18-year-old domestic medium-hair cat (cat 1) and a 16-year-old domestic shorthair cat (cat 2) were evaluated because of obstructive skin lesions involving the perimeter of the left external auditory canal.
CLINICAL FINDINGS: Otitis externa was present in affected ears secondary to obstructive soft tissue growths involving the outer margin of the external auditory canal and outer third of the vertical ear canal. Histologic examination of a preoperative biopsy sample revealed multiple ulcerated ceruminous gland adenomas in the affected ear of cat 1. Histologic examination of the submitted tissue from cat 2 confirmed ceruminous cystomatosis with surface colonization of yeast compatible with 
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Both cats underwent partial resection of the upper third of the affected vertical ear canal and associated diseased skin. The incised margin of the pinna was sutured to the margin of the remaining portion of the vertical ear canal with absorbable sutures. Both cats were disease free over a 12-month (cat 1) or 10-month (cat 2) follow-up period. Cat 1 later developed a small ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma in the adjacent rostrolateral margin of the vertical ear canal 1 year after surgery; the mass was resected, and the patient was free of recurrence 4 months later.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Partial resection was an effective alternative to complete vertical ear canal resection for lesions involving the upper third of the vertical ear canal in these cats; the partial resection procedure was deemed simpler to perform and less traumatic to the cat. Functional and cosmetic results were excellent, with preservation of the overall anatomy of the external auditory canal.",['Pavletic MM'],2019,255,12,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Pavletic MM.

31775141,Antifungal in vitro Activity of Essential Oils against Clinical Isolates of Malassezia pachydermatis from Canine Ears: A Report from a Practice Laboratory.,"BACKGROUND: The yeast Malassezia pachydermatis is a commensal but also the most isolated pathogenic yeast in canine otitis externa. Essential oils (EOs) exhibit antimicrobial activity and thus could be an alternative for treatment of otitis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the in vitro efficacy of EOs against M. pachydermatis isolates from canine ears.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two EOs were tested for their in vitro activity against 15 M. pachydermatis isolates by agar disc diffusion. In addition, diluted EOs were tested and volatile antifungal activity was analysed by vapour assay.
RESULTS: Most EOs showed in vitro efficacy against M. pachydermatis. A different susceptibility pattern of tested isolates was found. Overall, the most potential EO was lemon grass. Also, cinnamon leaf, clove, manuka, Indian melissa, oregano, palmarosa, and winter savory oil exhibited a strong antifungal activity. Volatile activity was proven by the inhibiting effect in vapour assay.
CONCLUSION: EOs show in vitro activity against M. pachydermatis. This study gives scientific background for the use of EOs in veterinary medicine. Diverse susceptibility patterns of different M. pachydermatis strains emphasise the helpfulness of an aromatogram as one lead for the best choice of an EO for therapy.","['Bismarck D', 'Dusold A', 'Heusinger A', 'Müller E']",2020,27,3,Complement Med Res,"Bismarck D, et al.

31758583,Thirty-Day Readmission and Prolonged Length of Stay in Malignant Otitis Externa.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine independent risk factors for 30-day readmission, prolonged length of stay (PLOS), and discharge to a rehabilitation facility for those with malignant otitis externa.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with malignant otitis externa (International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, code 380.14) in the Nationwide Readmissions Database (2013-2014). Overall and disease-specific complication and mortality data were analyzed using chi-squared and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: There were 1267 cases of malignant otitis externa extracted. A PLOS of ≥8 days (90th percentile) was found in 14.2% (n = 180) of patients, and 13.7% (n = 174) were discharged to a facility. Patients were readmitted within 30 days at a rate of 12.5% (n = 159). The overall rates of uncomplicated and complicated diabetes were found to be 42.1% and 17.8%, respectively. Factors independently associated with PLOS included undergoing a surgical procedure (odds ratio [OR] 2.08, P < .001), and having central nervous system complications (OR 3.21, P < .001). Independent risk factors for disposition to a facility included nutritional deficiency (OR 1.91, P = .029), PLOS (OR 4.61, P < .001), and age 65-79 years (OR 6.57, P = .001). Readmission was independently linked to PLOS (OR 3.14, P < .001). Diabetes was not an independent risk factor for any outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-day readmission, PLOS, and ultimate discharge to a rehabilitation facility were common and closely intertwined. Despite the classic association between diabetes and malignant otitis externa, diabetes was not an independent risk factor for any of our outcomes.

31750969,Meta-analysis does not support routine traditional nuclear medicine studies for malignant otitis.,"OBJECTIVES: The role of traditional nuclear medicine studies in the management of malignant otitis externa (MOE) is unclear and there are ongoing debates regarding their diagnostic value. The authors perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the sensitivity and specificity of traditional nuclear medicine studies in the diagnosis of MOE.
METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, a query of the Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was undertaken. The primary outcomes of interest were the sensitivity and specificity of traditional nuclear medicine studies to detect MOE.
RESULTS: Of the initial 1317 hits from the four databases, 20 articles with a combined 608 patients were ultimately included in the review. The pooled sensitivities for Technetium-99 and Gallium-67 were 85.1% (95% CI, 72.0-98.1%) and 71.2% (95% CI, 55.1-87.3%) respectively. The available evidence suggested poor specificity of these modalities, but was insufficient for meta-analysis. Neither modality was shown to be effective in the assessment of disease resolution.
CONCLUSION: The sensitivities of Technetium-99 and Gallium-67 to detect MOE are less favorable than was initially thought. Given this finding and their poor specificity, lack of anatomic resolution, unproven ability to detect disease resolution and variable availability, this review does not support the routine use of these studies in the management of MOE.

31743076,Appropriateness of Otic Quinolone Use among Privately Insured US Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Considering emerging safety concerns involving otic quinolones, we assessed the extent of otic quinolone use for questionable indications.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study of a national sample of privately insured patients.
SETTING: Outpatient encounters in the United States.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Children and adults with outpatient pharmacy-dispensing claims for new prescriptions of otic or ophthalmic quinolones in 2017 were identified within the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims & Encounters and the Medicare Supplemental Database. Each dispensing ≥30 days apart constituted a unique episode. Only claims with supporting ear-related diagnoses on outpatient encounters ±3 days of dispensing were considered. Ophthalmic drops were excluded if eye-related diagnoses were found ±30 days. Prescribing was classified as appropriate, questionable, or undetermined.
RESULTS: We found 214,897 episodes in 200,270 patients. Adults were twice as likely as children to have otic treatment with questionable indications (6.2% vs 3.0%). Sensitivity analyses with broader time windows to ascertain diagnoses showed similar proportions of questionable use. Otalgia and cerumen impaction constituted 90% of questionable indications. Family physicians (6.8%) and internists (8.0%) had higher percentages of questionable use than other specialties.
CONCLUSION: Based on the demonstrated risks of quinolone ear drops, opportunities exist to decrease otic quinolone use, especially in adults.","['Tran PT', 'Winterstein AG', 'Wang X', 'Rhew K', 'Antonelli PJ']",2020,162,1,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Tran PT, et al.

We sought to assess clinicians' adherence as well as referral patterns.
STUDY DESIGN: Survey.
METHODS: A 23-question survey was distributed to regional primary care clinicians evaluating demographic data, perception of the clinical practice guideline (CPG), adherence, and details of specialist referral. Statistical analysis was performed to compare adherence and referral patterns using the Fisher exact test or the χ
RESULTS: One hundred seventeen clinicians completed the survey. Fifteen respondents (12.8%) had reviewed the CPG. The recommendations with the least reported adherence were pain management (39.1%) and accounting for prior radiotherapy as a modifying factor (43.0%). The recommendations of prescribing ototopical therapy and avoiding systemic antimicrobials in uncomplicated acute otitis externa had adherence of 94.0% and 83.8%, respectively. When analyzed by provider type (e.g., resident, nurse practitioner/physician assistant), there were no significant differences in adherence. No significant differences in adherence were observed based on previous review of the CPG. When reporting frequency of specialist referral, the majority of respondents selected rarely (53.9%). The most favored reason for referral was symptoms >4 weeks (86.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Of the providers who responded, very few had reviewed the CPG-AOE. Despite the added emphasis on pain management in the CPG update, this recommendation had the lowest adherence. Rates of adherence were similar across provider types and did not differ significantly if the CPG was reviewed. Efforts at improved provider education should be considered to increase adherence to the CPG.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: To examine the antibacterial effects of manuka oil combined with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-tromethamine (Tris-EDTA) against Gram-negative bacteria isolates from dogs with otitis externa.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 53 clinical isolates including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using disk diffusion; the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of manuka essential oil, with or without Tris-EDTA, were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 44 isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 19 strains were multidrug-resistant, with resistance to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial classes. The MICs and MBCs of manuka oil alone were ≥1% (v/v) and ≥2% (v/v), respectively. There was no antimicrobial effect of Tris-EDTA (1.125:0.3 mg/mL) without manuka oil. However, the combination of manuka oil with Tris-EDTA significantly decreased the MICs (ranging from 0.06% to 0.5%, v/v; P < 0.001) and MBCs (ranging from 0.06% to 1%, v/v; P < 0.001). There also was no significant difference between multidrug-resistant and nonresistant bacterial isolates in terms of the antimicrobial activity of manuka oil with Tris-EDTA.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The study findings suggest that manuka oil, especially when combined with Tris-EDTA, may be a promising alternative therapeutic option for Gram-negative otic pathogens.

31723568,Diagnosis and Antibiotic Management of Otitis Media and Otitis Externa in United States Veterans.,"BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) occur primarily in children, whereas acute otitis externa (AOE) occurs with similar frequency in children and adults. Data on the incidence and management of otitis in adults are limited. This study characterizes the incidence, antibiotic management, and outcomes for adults with otitis diagnoses.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of ambulatory adult veterans who presented with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) diagnoses at 6 VA Medical Centers during 2014-2018 was created. Then, a subcohort of patients with acute otitis diagnoses was developed. Patient visits were categorized with administrative diagnostic codes for ARI (eg, sinusitis, pharyngitis) and otitis (OME, AOM, and AOE). Incidence rates for each diagnosis were calculated. Proportions of otitis visits with antibiotic prescribing, complications, and specialty referral were summarized.
RESULTS: Of 46 634 ARI visits, 3898 (8%) included an otitis diagnosis: OME (22%), AOM (44%), AOE (31%), and multiple otitis diagnoses (3%). Incidence rates were otitis media 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-4.2) and AOE 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9-2.1) diagnoses per 1000 patient-years. By comparison, the incidence rates for pharyngitis (8.4; 95% CI, 8.2-8.6) and sinusitis (15.2; 95% CI, 14.9-15.5) were higher. Systemic antibiotics were prescribed in 75%, 63%, and 21% of AOM, OME, and AOE visits, respectively. Complications for otitis visits were low irrespective of antibiotic treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Administrative data indicated that otitis media diagnoses in adults were half as common as acute pharyngitis, and the majority received antibiotic treatment, which may be inappropriate.

31723424,Case Report: Case report: A rare case of middle-ear Rhabdomyosarcoma in a 4-year-old boy.,"We present a rare case of a four-year-old boy with a botyroid embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the right middle ear. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue malignancy which is thought to originate from embryonic mesenchymal cells of striated skeletal muscle.  It is a disease primarily of children and is exceptionally rare in parameningeal regions.  The diagnosis is often delayed and easily misdiagnosed as aural polyp. Therefore, advanced disease is common at the time of diagnosis.  A four-year-old boy presented with a four-month history of recurrent left ear blood and pus discharge, otalgia and fevers. He attended his GP three times and paediatric A&E 13 times where he received antibiotics for presumed otitis media and externa. He was eventually referred to the otolaryngology department and underwent an examination under anaesthesia of ear and excisional biopsy of a suspicious aural polyp.  Staging chest CT and PET scan showed no loco-regional spread or distal metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated absence of invasion into adjacent organs.  Histology confirmed embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, botryoid subtype.  Subsequent to the initial excision of the polyp, he was started on an ifosfamine, vincristine and actinomycin (IVA) chemotherapy regime in three weekly cycles for nine cycles with concomitant radiotherapy. Two weeks subsequent to his first chemotherapy dose he presented with a House-Brackmann II-III facial nerve palsy but no other middle ear complications. He was started on intravenous antibiotics and dexamethasone. The facial nerve palsy incompletely resolved with treatment.","['Menzies-Wilson R', 'Wong G', 'Das P']",2019,8,,F1000Res,"Menzies-Wilson R, et al.

31710159,In vitro antimicrobial activity of narasin and monensin in combination with adjuvants against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of antimicrobial resistance represents a serious human and animal health risk. Good antimicrobial stewardship is essential to prolong the lifespan of existing antibiotics, and new strategies are required to combat infections in man and animals.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro interaction of ionophores (narasin or monensin) with antimicrobial adjuvants (N-acetylcysteine (NAC), Tris-EDTA or disodium EDTA) against bacterial strains representing pathogens associated with canine otitis externa (OE).
ANIMAL/ISOLATES: American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains Staphylococcus aureus 29213, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 and P. aeruginosa biofilm producer PAO1, and a clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis from a case of canine OE were tested.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 2D microdilution checkerboard method was used, allowing calculation of fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), dose reduction index (DRI) and plotting of isobolograms.
RESULTS: The combination of narasin with either Tris-EDTA or disodium EDTA produced additive effects (FICI = 0.75) against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and P. aeruginosa biofilm producer ATCC PAO1. An additive effect (FICI = 0.53-0.75) was found against S. aureus ATCC 29213 when narasin or monensin were combined with NAC. The highest DRI (32-fold) was found with monensin/NAC where the MIC of monensin was reduced from 4 to 0.125 μg/mL.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The combination of narasin with Tris-EDTA or disodium EDTA is a promising strategy to inhibit the intrinsic resistance elements of Gram-negative bacteria. These novel combinations potentially could be useful as a multimodal approach to treat mixed infections in canine OE.","['Chan WY', 'Hickey EE', 'Khazandi M', 'Page SW', 'Trott DJ', 'Hill PB']",2020,31,2,Vet Dermatol,"Chan WY, et al.

In the current study, genotypic and phenotypic correlates associated with S. pseudintermedius causing canine otitis externa were evaluated using 41 S. pseudintermedius strains isolated from dogs with otitis externa (n = 26) and healthy dogs (n = 15). The S. pseudintermedius strains were subjected to a comparative analysis of (i) genotypes (multilocus sequence typing, agr, and spa types), (ii) methicillin resistance and SCCmec types, (iii) multidrug resistance (MDR), (iv) biofilm formation, and (v) susceptibility to canine cathelicidin (K9CATH). A high degree of genetic diversity was observed in both groups of S. pseudintermedius strains, regardless of methicillin resistance. Almost all methicillin-resistant strains (>95%) harbored SCCmec V and displayed MDR. Although there was no difference in biofilm formation, S. pseudintermedius strains derived from otitis externa exhibited enhanced resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptide (K9CATH) compared with strains from healthy dogs. The high degree of heterogeneity in MLST, agr, and spa types prevented the identification of correlations between any specific genotype and virulence phenotype in otitis externa caused by S. pseudintermedius, These findings provide an important basis for monitoring and treating canine skin and soft tissue infections in Korea.","['Lee GY', 'Yang SJ']",2020,70,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,Lee GY and Yang SJ.

31535370,Headache in Petrous Apicitis: A Case Report of Chronic Migraine-like Headache Due to Peripheral Pathology.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of petrous apicitis that manifested as chronic migraine without aura and to discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms behind this presentation.
BACKGROUND: Petrous apicitis is a rare complication of acute otitis media with varied clinical presentations that stem from the close proximity of the petrous apex to numerous neurovascular structures. Headache is among the common symptoms of petrous apicitis.
METHODS: A case of new onset headache in the setting of petrous apicitis with symptomatic response to antibiotic therapy was reported. We provided a brief review of peripheral pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine and correlated to mechanism of headache in petrous apicitis.
RESULTS: A 65-year-old man with chronic otitis externa/media presented with ongoing headache fulfilling International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria for chronic migraine without aura that persisted despite undergoing right mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty with multiple courses of oral antibiotic therapy for his chronic otitis. MRI brain revealed petrous apicitis, otomastoiditis, and clival osteomyelitis. His imaging findings improved and his migraine-like headache completely resolved after treatment with a prolonged course of antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Petrous apicitis can present as a headache with features of migraine, and in this case in particular, as chronic migraine without aura. The pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie the generation of migraine-like headache in petrous apicitis may include the activation of nociceptive fibers within the periosteum of the petrous apex and clivus whose cell bodies originate in the trigeminal ganglion and upper cervical dorsal root ganglia. By treating the peripheral pathology, resolution of the headache may be achieved.","['Mancini AJ', 'Glassman RD', 'Chang YM', 'Burstein R', 'Ashina S']",2019,59,10,Headache,"Mancini AJ, et al.

31524361,Otitis Media: Rapid Evidence Review.,"Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common diagnosis in childhood acute sick visits. By three years of age, 50% to 85% of children will have at least one episode of AOM. Symptoms may include ear pain (rubbing, tugging, or holding the ear may be a sign of pain), fever, irritability, otorrhea, anorexia, and sometimes vomiting or lethargy. AOM is diagnosed in symptomatic children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not caused by acute otitis externa, and in children with mild bulging and either recent-onset ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema of the tympanic membrane. Treatment includes pain management plus observation or antibiotics, depending on the patient's age, severity of symptoms, and whether the AOM is unilateral or bilateral. When antibiotics are used, high-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day in two divided doses) is first-line therapy unless the patient has taken amoxicillin for AOM in the previous 30 days or has concomitant purulent conjunctivitis; amoxicillin/clavulanate is typically used in this case. Cefdinir or azithromycin should be the first-line antibiotic in those with penicillin allergy based on risk of cephalosporin allergy. Tympanostomy tubes should be considered in children with three or more episodes of AOM within six months or four episodes within one year with one episode in the preceding six months. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and exclusive breastfeeding until at least six months of age can reduce the risk of AOM.","['Gaddey HL', 'Wright MT', 'Nelson TN']",2019,100,6,Am Fam Physician,"Gaddey HL, et al.

31430365,Antibiotic choice in UK general practice: rates and drivers of potentially inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify the rates of potentially inappropriate antibiotic choice when prescribing for common infections in UK general practices. To examine the predictors of such prescribing and the clustering effects at the practice level.
METHODS: The rates of potentially inappropriate antibiotic choice were estimated using 1 151 105 consultations for sinusitis, otitis media and externa, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and urinary tract infection (UTI), using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Multilevel logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of inappropriate prescribing and to quantify the clustering effect at practice level.
RESULTS: The rates of potentially inappropriate prescriptions were highest for otitis externa (67.3%) and URTI (38.7%) and relatively low for otitis media (3.4%), sinusitis (2.2%), LRTI (1.5%) and UTI in adults (2.3%) and children (0.7%). Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for all respiratory tract infections, except URTI. Amoxicillin accounted for 62.3% of prescriptions for otitis externa and 34.5% of prescriptions for URTI, despite not being recommended for these conditions. A small proportion of the variation in the probability of an inappropriate choice was attributed to the clustering effect at practice level (8% for otitis externa and 23% for sinusitis). Patients with comorbidities were more likely to receive a potentially inappropriate antibiotic for URTI, LRTI and UTI in adults. Patients who received any antibiotic in the 12 months before consultation were more likely to receive a potentially inappropriate antibiotic for all conditions except otitis externa.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prescribing did not always align with prescribing guidelines, especially for URTIs and otitis externa. Future interventions might target optimizing amoxicillin use in primary care.","['Nowakowska M', 'van Staa T', 'Mölter A', 'Ashcroft DM', 'Tsang JY', 'White A', 'Welfare W', 'Palin V']",2019,74,11,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Nowakowska M, et al.

31395661,A Persistent Foramen of Huschke: A Small Road to Misery in Necrotizing External Otitis.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Necrotizing external otitis is a serious complication of external otitis with different spreading patterns. A persistent foramen of Huschke is a dehiscence located antero-inferior in the osseous external ear canal and posterior-medial to the temporomandibular joint. This dehiscence can facilitate extension of infection in an anterior pattern next to classic spread along the fissures of Santorini. The aim of this study was to define the prevalence and size of a persistent foramen of Huschke in patients with necrotizing external otitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined 78 CT temporal bone studies (39 patients with necrotizing external otitis, 39 control subjects). The side and presence of the foramen were noted, and its prevalence was calculated. The maximal width of the foramen of Huschke was measured in the axial plane and classified as subtle, mild, moderate, or extensive.
RESULTS: A persistent foramen of Huschke was present in 21 patients (26 ears) and 7 control subjects (9 ears). Prevalence was 50% (20/40) and 11.5% (9/78) in affected ears of patients with necrotizing external otitis and control subjects, respectively. Almost all affected ears showed an anterior distribution pattern of necrotizing external otitis. The extensive dehiscence was most common in affected ears.
CONCLUSIONS: An anterior necrotizing external otitis spreading pattern is associated with the presence and increased size of a persistent foramen of Huschke. These findings facilitate the theory that a persistent foramen of Huschke is an additional risk factor the development of necrotizing external otitis.","['van der Meer WL', 'van Tilburg M', 'Mitea C', 'Postma AA']",2019,40,9,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,"van der Meer WL, et al.

31370128,Oral corticosteroids for painful acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear): A triple-blind randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute otitis externa is often painful. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 10 mg oral prednisolone twice daily for four days in addition to conventional therapy.
METHOD: Patients attending general practice clinics in Far North Queensland, Australia, for acute painful otitis externa were given a study capsule with either 10 mg prednisone or placebo.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were randomised. Results from 19 patients in the intervention group and 11 patients in the control group were analysed. Oral corticosteroids did not decrease the time to being completely pain-free but decreased the time for pain to reduce from more than 'moderate pain' to less than 'moderate pain', from 3.7 days to 2.4 days (P = 0.012, log rank test).
DISCUSSION: Oral corticosteroids seem to be effective in reducing more than 'moderate pain' to less than 'moderate pain'. However, this result needs to be confirmed in a larger trial.","['Balch G', 'Heal C', 'Cervin A', 'Gunnarsson R']",2019,48,8,Aust J Gen Pract,"Balch G, et al.

31369898,Melioidosis in travelers: An analysis of Dutch melioidosis registry data 1985-2018.,"BACKGROUND: Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is an opportunistic infection across the tropics. Here, we provide a systematic overview of imported human cases in a non-endemic country over a 25-year period.
METHODS: All 55 Dutch microbiology laboratories were contacted in order to identify all B. pseudomallei positive cultures from 1990 to 2018. A response rate of 100% was achieved. Additionally, a systematic literature search was performed, medical-charts reviewed, and tissue/autopsy specimens were re-assessed.
RESULTS: Thirty-three travelers with melioidosis were identified: 70% male with a median-age of 54 years. Risk factors were present in most patients (n = 23, 70%), most notably diabetes (n = 8, 24%) and cystic fibrosis (n = 3, 9%). Countries of acquisition included Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia, Panama, and The Gambia. Disease manifestations included pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscesses, otitis externa, genitourinary, skin-, CNS-, and thyroid gland infections. Twelve (36%) patients developed sepsis and/or septic shock. Repeat episodes of active infection were observed in five (15%) and mortality in four (12%) patients. Post-mortem analysis showed extensive metastatic (micro)abscesses amongst other sites in the adrenal gland and bone marrow.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of imported melioidosis is likely to increase, given rising numbers of (immunocompromised) travelers, and increased vigilance of the condition. This first systematic retrospective surveillance study in a non-endemic melioidosis country shows that imported cases can serve as sentinels to provide information about disease activity in areas visited and inform pre-travel advice and post-travel clinical management.","['Birnie E', 'Savelkoel J', 'Reubsaet F', 'Roelofs JJTH', 'Soetekouw R', 'Kolkman S', 'Cremers AL', 'Grobusch MP', 'Notermans DW', 'Wiersinga WJ', 'Dutch Melioidosis Study Group']",2019,32,,Travel Med Infect Dis,"Birnie E, et al.

31366680,Assessing patient satisfaction with a microsuction service in general practice: a comparative study.,"BACKGROUND: In the UK, about 2.3 million people each year require intervention for wax impaction, while otitis externa accounts for just over 1% of general practice consultations. Aural microsuction of debris from the ear canal is a commonly performed procedure within the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient clinic. This article examines the patient acceptability of an aural microsuction service delivered in general practice.
AIM: To determine patient satisfaction following the introduction of a new microsuction service in general practice compared with a hospital-delivered service.
DESIGN & SETTING: This is a prospective comparative study in two rural general practices in Ireland and the emergency department (ED) of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital (RVEEH), Dublin.
METHOD: A 3-month period of data collection on usual care of 56 patients in general practice was followed by a 3-month period of GP-intervention data collection on 67 patients. Comparative data were collected on 37 patients who attended the RVEEH for the same intervention procedure. Patients completed a validated patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ-18).
RESULTS: Both general practice groups scored significantly higher in all seven aspects of medical care than the RVEEH cohort. Patients in the GP-intervention group scored significantly higher in terms of satisfaction with procedure technique compared with the usual care GP group.
CONCLUSION: The provision of microsuction as a service in general practice confers as much or more patient satisfaction as the provision of the service in a hospital setting.","['Hasson R', 'McDermott E', 'Hanley K', 'Carroll C', 'Collins C']",2019,3,2,BJGP Open,"Hasson R, et al.

31356482,Osteonecrosis of the External Auditory Canal Associated With Oral Sorafenib Therapy: Sorafenib and Temporal Bone Osteonecrosis.,"OBJECTIVE: To present the first case of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal associated with sorafenib treatment.
PATIENT: 58-year-old patient with right-sided otorrhea and otalgia was treated for otitis externa for 1 month without improvement. Otoscopic examination revealed a large defect in the inferior wall of the tympanic bone filled with skin debris and bony fragments. Previous medical history included treatment with sorafenib for metastatic renal cell cancer; he had never been exposed to radiotherapy. Computed tomography of the temporal bone showed a large right external auditory canal bony erosion with involvement of the tympanic bone and bony sequestra extending to the mastoid cells and temporomandibular joint. Histologic examination revealed necrotic bone and inflammatory changes with no signs of malignancy. A diagnosis of osteonecrosis of external auditory canal was made.
INTERVENTION: Right subtotal petrosectomy with obliteration of surgical cavity with abdominal fat was performed.
RESULTS: Final histological report revealed avascular necrosis of the bone with perivascular lymphocitic infiltration of the soft tissues. Diagnosis of medication-related external auditory canal osteonecrosis was confirmed.
CONCLUSION: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the temporal bone is not a well-known entity among otolaryngologists and could therefore be misclassified as another diagnosis. In patients with othorrea and earache following sorafenib treatment, temporal bone osteonecrosis should be suspected.","['Canzano F', 'Di Lella F', 'Manuguerra R', 'Vincenti V']",2019,40,8,Otol Neurotol,"Canzano F, et al.

31336457,Diabetes in the practice of otolaryngology.,"Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disease, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemic milieu leads to endothelial injury in blood vessels of variant size, which results in microangiopathy and macroangiopathy (atherosclerosis). Consequential ischemia of nerves and hyperglycemia by itself lead to nerve degeneration and generalized neuropathy, affecting most often the sensory peripheral nerves and the autonomic nervous system. Auditory, vestibular and olfactory sensorium may be compromised by DM. People with DM have an increased susceptibility to infection, as a result of neutrophil dysfunction and impaired humoral immunity. Therefore DM predisposes to certain infectious diseases, such as fungal sinusitis or malignant otitis externa, which are rare in general population. Recovery from infections or from injuries may be compromised by coexisting DM. In this review we discuss complications of DM in the head and neck region. Otolaryngologists and general practitioners should be alert to specific conditions related to DM and be minded of the relevant complications and consequences.","['Cohen Atsmoni S', 'Brener A', 'Roth Y']",2019,13,2,Diabetes Metab Syndr,"Cohen Atsmoni S, et al.

31335800,Incidence and Risk of Various Disorders of the External Ear in Patients With Hearing Aids Treated in ENT Practices in Germany.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between the presence of a hearing aid (HA) and the occurrence of various disorders of the external ear, using data from ear, nose, and throat (ENT) practices in Germany from a nationwide, representative practice database.
METHODS: In the period between 2012 and 2016, the incidences of disorders of the external ear (ICD-10 groups H60 and H61) in patients with HA prescriptions were compared retrospectively with a control group without HA prescriptions (1:1 matching).
RESULTS: A total of 20,127 patients with HA prescriptions were compared with 20,127 controls. The highest 12-month incidences (HA vs. controls) were determined for ""Impacted cerumen"" (H61.2) (16.5% vs. 4.2%), ""Unspecified otitis externa"" (H60.9) (2.6% vs. 1.2%) and 'Acute noninfective otitis externa' (H60.5) (2.3% vs. 0.7%). The most significant risk increases for HA wearers were found for ""Abscess of external ear' (H60.0, OR 10.03), ""Other otitis externa' (H60.8, OR 6.00), and ""Impacted cerumen' (H61.2, OR 4.55). A smaller risk increase was found for ""Cholesteatoma of external ear' (H60.4, OR 2.26), among others.
CONCLUSION: In HA wearers, the risk of developing almost all of the diagnoses reviewed is significantly increased, especially for external auditory canal (EAC) furuncle, chronic otitis externa, and impacted cerumen. This study provides the first epidemiological evidence for HA as a risk factor for the rare EAC cholesteatoma.","['Seidel DU', 'Park JJ', 'Sesterhenn AM', 'Kostev K']",2019,40,8,Otol Neurotol,"Seidel DU, et al.

31321462,Imaging of temporal bone inflammations in children: a pictorial review.,"PURPOSE: Understanding the underlying pathophysiology and the patterns of disease spread is crucial in accurate image interpretation. In this pictorial review, the common and important inflammatory processes of the temporal bone in children will be discussed, and key computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features described.
METHODS: Inflammatory processes are categorized by anatomical location: the petrous apex and the inner, middle and outer ear. A complete review of the literature is provided.
RESULTS: Cholesteatoma, cholesterol granuloma and mucoceles are inflammatory processes that occur across the anatomical subsites of the temporal bone, whilst site-specific inflammatory processes include labyrinthitis ossificans in the inner ear and keratosis obturans in the external ear. Infection is a key cause of inflammation in the temporal bone, and specific infections include petrous apicitis, otitis media and necrotizing otitis externa. Finally, important mimics and do-not-touch lesions are considered. CT and MRI are complementary in assessing these disorders, as two of the most important diagnostic clues are the presence of bone erosion, best appreciated on CT, and true diffusion restriction as seen on MRI. Flow charts to assist in the diagnosis of paediatric temporal bone inflammatory disease are also provided.
CONCLUSION: Paediatric temporal bone inflammatory processes are common and can have severe clinical sequelae. Timely intervention, facilitated by correct radiological diagnosis, can often prevent progression of disease, loss of hearing and systemic illness.","['Campion T', 'Taranath A', 'Pinelli L', 'Ugga L', 'Nash R', 'Talenti G', 'Dahmoush H', ""D'Arco F""]",2019,61,9,Neuroradiology,"Campion T, et al.

Under the aspect/concept of One Health, those strains pose a risk to human health due to the presence in canine pets where the transfer of resistant genetic markers might occur to other staphylococci species. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial resistance pattern among Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) isolated from asymptomatic dogs and those affected by topic infections. Swabs from 254 dogs were first seeded in Mannitol Salt Agar. Species identification was conducted by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption ionization - time of flight (MALDI-TOF ms) as previously described. The susceptibility test was performed by disk diffusion according to CLSI standards. Detection of mecA gene was performed. CoNS could be recovered from both groups of dogs and an alarming presence of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) was confirmed, in 10.2% (17/166) of the samples.

31259420,Extended palatoplasty as surgical treatment for nasopharyngeal stenosis in six cats.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of extended palatoplasty as treatment of caudal nasopharyngeal stenosis in cats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT was used to confirm the diagnosis in cats with clinical signs consistent with nasopharyngeal stenosis. Extended palatoplasty rostral to the tonsils using monopolar electrocautery allowed simultaneous removal of the caudal soft palate together with the stenotic area. Cats were re-evaluated 2 weeks postoperatively. Telephone interview was used to obtain long-term follow-up.
RESULTS: Six domestic shorthair cats were diagnosed with nasopharyngeal stenosis, with clinical signs of snoring (n=4), stertor (n=4), nasal discharge (n=3) and sneezing (n=1). CT scan identified a soft-tissue stricture at the level of the caudal nasopharynx in all cats. Other abnormalities included bilateral rhinitis (n=3), retropharyngeal adenomegaly (n=2), unilateral sinusitis (n=1) and bilateral otitis externa with unilateral otitis media (n=1). Excision of the caudal soft palate and the entire stenotic soft-tissue membrane was successful in all six cats. No pre-, intra- or postoperative complications were observed. Short-term outcome revealed clinical improvement in all cases. Long-term outcome revealed no recurrence of clinical signs in four cats. In one cat, occasional sneezing was reported. One cat died 1 month postoperatively for reasons unrelated to the respiratory condition.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Extended palatoplasty was an effective technique to treat caudal nasopharyngeal stenosis and provide improvement of clinical signs without postoperative complications in all cases.","['Sériot P', 'Gibert S', 'Poujol L', 'Bernardin F', 'Blond L', 'Dunié-Mérigot A']",2019,60,9,J Small Anim Pract,"Sériot P, et al.

31243455,Macrococcus canis contains recombinogenic methicillin resistance elements and the mecB plasmid found in Staphylococcus aureus.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the genetic context of mecB in two Macrococcus canis strains from dogs, compare the mecB-containing elements with those found in other Macrococcus and Staphylococcus species, and identify possible mobilizable mecB subunits.
METHODS: Whole genomes of the M. canis strains Epi0076A and KM0218 were sequenced using next-generation sequencing technologies. Multiple PCRs and restriction analysis confirmed structures of mecB-containing elements, circularization and recombination of mecB subunits.
RESULTS: Both M. canis strains contained novel composite pseudo (Ψ) staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements. Integration site sequences for SCC flanked and subdivided composite ΨSCCmecEpi0076A (69569 bp) into ΨSCC1Epi0076A-ΨSCCmecEpi0076A-ΨSCC2Epi0076A and composite ΨSCCmecKM0218 (24554 bp) into ΨSCCKM0218-ΨSCCmecKM0218. Putative γ-haemolysin genes (hlgB and hlgC) were found at the 3' end of both composite elements. ΨSCCmecKM0218 contained a complete mecB gene complex (mecIm-mecR1m-mecB-blaZm) downstream of a new IS21-family member (ISMaca1). ΨSCCmecEpi0076A carried a blaZm-deleted mecB gene complex similar to that reported in 'Macrococcus goetzii' CCM4927T. A second mecB gene was found on the 81325 bp MDR plasmid pKM0218 in KM0218. This plasmid contained a complete Tn6045-associated mecB gene complex distinct from that of ΨSCCmecKM0218. pKM0218 was almost identical to the mecB-containing plasmid recently reported in Staphylococcus aureus (overall 99.96% nucleotide identity). Mobilization of mecB within an unconventional circularizable structure was observed in Epi0076A as well as chromosomal plasmid insertion via recombination of mecB operons in KM0218.

31242524,[Analysis of the emergency patients of a university ENT hospital].,"OBJECTIVE: The number of patients visiting emergency departments has substantially increased in recent years. The time of visiting an emergency room does not say anything about the true urgency of the treatment. The aim was to analyse the patient population of the emergency outpatient department of a university ENT hospital.
METHODS: All patients presenting as an emergency in an ENT university hospital in 2014 were evaluated with regard to demographic data, time of presentation, type of admission, diagnosis and therapy.
RESULTS: 4234 patients were treated as emergencies. 56 % presented without referral on their own initiative, 24 % were referred by the general practitioner or ENT specialist, 8 % came by ambulance. 66 % presented outside regular working hours. The highest number of emergencies occurred on Saturdays, followed by Fridays and Sundays. The ten most frequent diagnoses were epistaxis, peripheral-vestibular vertigo, cerumen, tinnitus, otitis externa and media, tonsillitis, nasal bone fracture, acute hearing loss and sinusitis. 715 patients (17 %) were admitted to hospital. In 123 patients surgery was performed under general and in 204 patients under local anesthesia. The most frequent diagnosis of patients presented on their own initiative was cerumen obturans. 8 % presented on their own initiative did not show any pathological findings.
CONCLUSION: As there is no ENT emergency service available in the region outside normal office hours, this gap is closed by the emergency outpatient department of the ENT University Hospital. A triage of the patients is necessary in order to distinguish the real emergencies from the easy cases.","['Kuhr E', 'Werner JA', 'Dietz A', 'Wiegand S']",2019,98,9,Laryngorhinootologie,"Kuhr E, et al.

31223303,A retrospective review of 14 cases of malignant otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Malignant otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external ear which has the propensity to spread to the skull base. It can be a difficult entity to treat as clinical presentation varies and response to treatment differs between patients. We reviewed cases of malignant otitis externa in our setup to document the epidemiology and outcome of management.
METHODS: This is a retrospective case review observational study from January 2013-December 2017. Fourteen patients diagnosed with malignant otitis externa in our tertiary referral centre were included in the study. Based on hospital protocol, empiric treatment was started. After discharge, the patients follow up visits to the hospital were also documented.
RESULTS: Otalgia was the most common symptom. Edema and congestion of the external auditory canal were observed in most cases. Diabetes was present in all patients. Three cases had associated facial palsy, and one patient had involvement of 7th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, malignant otitis externa invariably presented with severe otalgia. Lower cranial palsies were also seen. Methods to evaluate complete eradication of disease should be centered on clinical symptoms and signs, but the measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate or radiological imaging may be used as a useful adjunct when there is uncertainty.","['Marina S', 'Goutham MK', 'Rajeshwary A', 'Vadisha B', 'Devika T']",2019,14,2,J Otol,"Marina S, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical signs, treatment regimens and prognosis of otitis externa in horses.
ANIMALS: Eight horses diagnosed with otitis externa during 2011-2018.
METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records and follow-up contact with owners.
RESULTS: Common clinical signs seen in affected horses were pruritus, ear discharge and ear droop of affected ears. The most common cytological findings were neutrophils, bacteria and yeast. All horses responded well to treatment; two horses were reported to have recurrent problems.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Otitis externa in horses is a rare and treatable condition. The condition may be present for prolonged periods before owners become aware, compromising the welfare of affected horses. Untreated otitis externa is a suggested cause of otitis media and temporohyoid osteoarthropathy, emphasizing the importance of identifying and treating this condition at an early stage. For this reason, clinicians should include a brief inspection of the pinnae and external ear canal in the clinical examination of horses.","['Odelros E', 'Kendall A', 'Wulcan S', 'Bergvall K']",2019,30,5,Vet Dermatol,"Odelros E, et al.

31199837,The association between Parkinson's disease and temporomandibular disorder.,"The prevalence of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) among elderly people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is relatively high, but a population-based study of the relationship between PD and TMD is still lacking. This study, therefore, sought to investigate the association between TMD and PD by using data for one million randomly sampled beneficiaries of Taiwan's National Health Insurance program, including 6,185 PD patients who were matched through propensity score matching with 18,555 non-PD patients. Both the PD and non-PD cohorts were followed until death, any diagnosis of TMD, or December 31, 2013, whichever occurred first. Each diagnosis of TMD was made by a qualified physician according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), using the diagnosis codes 524.60, 524.62, 524.63, and 524.69 while excluding tooth abscess, wisdom tooth eruption, herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia, mastoiditis, otitis externa, otitis media, parotitis, sialadenitis, and trigeminal neuralgia. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to calculate the relative risk of TMD and found a 2.11-fold (95% CI: 1.35-3.30) increased risk of TMD overall in the PD group compared with the non-PD group. Stratified by follow-up period, there was a 4.25-fold (95% CI: 1.51-11.93) increased risk in the PD group in the first year after the initial PD diagnosis and a 3.88-fold (95% CI: 1.33-11.28) increased risk in the second year. Over the long-term (>5 years), PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of TMD. These findings suggest that it is important to closely monitor the temporomandibular joint health of PD patients.","['Chen YY', 'Fan HC', 'Tung MC', 'Chang YK']",2019,14,6,PLoS One,"Chen YY, et al.

31199041,Otitis externa-climatic associations and evidence-based management strategies for Australian practice.,"OBJECTIVES: There is a lack of consensus for the management of otitis externa. In addition to looking at seasonal trends surrounding otitis externa, this article also reviews a collection of local and international guidelines on the management of this condition.
DESIGN: Retrospective case audit of clinician-diagnosed otitis externa at the Hedland Health Campus over 18 months. Review of 2007-2017 evidence-based guidelines relevant to area of practice.
SETTING: Hedland Health Campus Emergency Department in the remote Pilbara region of Western Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: Two-hundred-thirty-six otitis externa cases in 193 individuals were seen by our service.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURED: Number of otitis externa presentations each month.
RESULT: Nine guidelines were reviewed, which varied widely in recommendations. An overrepresentative proportion of patients identified as either Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. There was a strong positive correlation between the monthly rainfall and otitis externa, moderate correlation between higher monthly minimum temperatures and no correlation with maximum temperature. Given the variety of guidelines available, it was difficult to assess whether prescribing was always consistent with guidelines.
CONCLUSION: This research makes evidence-based suggestions for Australian practitioners. Patients should be treated with oral analgesia, ear toileting and targeted topical therapy. There is no evidence for swabs, ear wicks and oral antibiotics. The authors hypothesise that re-presentation rates might be in part attributable to freshwater pseudomonal infection.","['Chidlow C', 'van Bockxmeer J']",2019,27,3,Aust J Rural Health,Chidlow C and van Bockxmeer J.

31188857,Disorders of Bulldogs under primary veterinary care in the UK in 2013.,"The Bulldog is a popular companion breed in the UK despite widely reported disease predispositions. This study aimed to characterise the demography, mortality and common disorders of Bulldogs under veterinary care in the UK during 2013. VetCompass collates anonymised clinical data from UK primary-care veterinary practices for epidemiological research. The clinical records of all Bulldogs available in the VetCompass study dataset were reviewed manually in detail to extract the most definitive diagnoses recorded for all disorders that existed during 2013 and for all deaths. Bulldogs comprised 1621 (0.36%) of 445,557 study dogs. Bulldogs increased from 0.35% of the 2009 birth cohort to 0.60% in 2013. Median longevity was 7.2 years, which was lower in males (6.7 years) than females (7.9 years) (P = 0.021). The most prevalent fine-level precision disorders recorded were otitis externa (n = 206, prevalence 12.7%, 95% CI: 11.1-14.4), pyoderma (142, 8.8%, 95% CI: 7.4-10.2) and overweight/obesity (141, 8.7%, 95% CI: 7.4-10.2). The most prevalent disorder groups were cutaneous (n = 463, prevalence: 28.6%, 95% CI: 26.4-30.8), ophthalmological (292, 18.0%, 95% CI: 16.2-20.0), aural (211, 13.0%, 95% CI: 11.4-14.8), enteropathy (188, 11.6%, 95% CI: 10.1-13.3) and upper respiratory tract (171, 10.5%, 95% CI: 9.1-12.1). Provision of an evidence base on the most common disorders and causes of mortality within breeds can support owners, breeders and the veterinary profession to improve health and welfare within these breed.","[""O'Neill DG"", 'Skipper AM', 'Kadhim J', 'Church DB', 'Brodbelt DC', 'Packer RMA']",2019,14,6,PLoS One,"O'Neill DG, et al.

However, despite optimum treatment and resolution of her otitis externa, she went on to develop an ipsilateral facial nerve palsy and sensorineural hearing loss. After further investigation, it was discovered that varicella-zoster meningitis was causing her polyneuropathy. She eventually responded to antivirals and steroids and, at follow-up, her sixth and seventh cranial nerve palsies had completely resolved, though a hearing deficit remained. This case highlights the importance of keeping a diagnosis under review, with the help of the multidisciplinary team, when the clinical course is not progressing as expected.","['Cunniffe HA', 'Cunniffe NG']",2019,12,6,BMJ Case Rep,Cunniffe HA and Cunniffe NG.

31165255,Malignant (necrotizing) externa otitis: the experience of a single hyperbaric centre.,"INTRODUCTION: Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a potentially life-threatening infection of the soft tissues of the external ear, quickly spreading to involve the periosteum and bone of the skull base. Treatment includes antibiotics and eventually surgery. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy. However, in the tenth consensus conference, this disease was considered as a non-indication for HBOT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of HBOT in MOE treatment.
METHODS: Retrospective and observational study was conducted of patients with MOE treated in our centre. Staging of the disease was made according to the clinicopathological classification system.
RESULTS: From March 1998 to November 2016, 16 patients were referred. 6% patients were on stage 1 of the disease at the time they were referred, 20% in stage 2, 7% in stage 3a, 13% in stage 3b and 53% in stage 4. Seven (43.75%) patients had VII nerve palsy and three (18.75%) patients had multiple nerve palsy. Average length of symptoms of disease was 5 months (maximum 11 months). Average number of sessions was 33 and the length of hospitalization prior to HBOT (median 90 days) was significantly longer than the time between beginning HBOT and cure (p = 0.028, Wilcoxon signed rank test). There were no fatalities due to MOE and all patients were considered free of disease after HBOT.
CONCLUSION: HBOT was well tolerated and revealed to be a helpful adjuvant treatment in MOE. According to our data, HBOT should be considered for patients who failed conventional treatments and in severe cases.","['Amaro CE', 'Espiney R', 'Radu L', 'Guerreiro F']",2019,276,7,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Amaro CE, et al.

31147450,Computed tomographic grading of middle ear disease in domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculi).,"Ear disease, involving the middle and external ear, is commonly reported in pet rabbits, with lop-eared breeds predisposed. CT is the most reliable imaging modality for identifying otitis media (OM) in rabbits. This study aimed to develop a CT-based grading scale to classify the severity of CT changes in rabbits with presumed OM. Three observers independently reviewed CT images of 36 rabbits with OM. For both OM and material within the external ear canal, a grade of I to IV was used, (I=mild, IV=severe disease) and the level of agreement between reviewers was statistically evaluated. The study demonstrated that grades from the three reviewers showed a strong level of interobserver agreement. Comparisons between clinical signs and CT grade were also evaluated. Rabbits with grade IV OM had a high grade of material in the external ear canal. A high proportion of rabbits (83 per cent) underwent CT scanning conscious, demonstrating that diagnostic quality CT images are achievable without the need for anaesthetic intervention, minimising patient risk. This novel CT-based grading scale provides a methodology to correlate grade of disease with clinical signs, ear canal cytology, predisposing factors, treatment options and outcomes for rabbits with ear disease.","['Richardson J', 'Longo M', 'Liuti T', 'Eatwell K']",2019,184,22,Vet Rec,"Richardson J, et al.

DATA SOURCES: Literature review from 1999 to 2019, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline.
STUDY SELECTION: We searched for eligible articles concerning the clinical entity of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis. Case series and clinical trials were the types of articles included for this review.
DATA EXTRACTION: All the articles described in the study selection were used for this review.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Statistical techniques were not used.
CONCLUSION: Based on the available literature, it seems that tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis is not uncommon. The presence of this complication is associated with 2 problems: Antimycotic solutions are irritant to middle ear and may be ototoxic to the cochlea. Although most cases of fungus caused tympanic membrane (TM) perforation resolve with proper medical treatment, in a few patients a tympanoplasty may be required.","['Koltsidopoulos P', 'Skoulakis C']",2020,99,8,Ear Nose Throat J,Koltsidopoulos P and Skoulakis C.

31133058,Medicinal plants as therapeutic options for topical treatment in canine dermatology? A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants have been used traditionally since centuries for wound care and treatment of skin diseases both in human and animals. Skin diseases are one of the most common reasons for owners to take their dog to the veterinarian. The demands for treatment and prophylaxis of these diseases are broad. A wide range of bacteria including antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be involved, making the treatment challenging and bear an anthropo-zoonotic potential. The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate based on recent scientific literature, the potential of four medicinal plants to enrich the therapeutic options in pyoderma, canine atopic dermatitis, otitis externa, wounds and dermatophytosis in dogs.
RESULTS: Based on four books and a survey among veterinarians specialized in phytotherapy, four medicinal plants were chosen as the subject of this systematic review: Calendula officinalis L. (Marigold), Hypericum perforatum L. agg. (St. John's Wort), Matricaria chamomilla L. (syn. Matricaria recutita L., Chamomile) and Salvia officinalis L. (Sage). According to the PRISMA statement through literature research on two online databases a total of 8295 publications was screened and narrowed down to a final 138 publications for which full-text documents were analyzed for its content resulting in a total of 145 references (21 clinical, 24 in vivo and 100 in vitro references).
CONCLUSIONS: All four plants were proven to have antibacterial and antifungal effects of a rather broad spectrum including antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This makes them an interesting new option for the treatment of pyoderma, otitis externa, infected wounds and dermatophytosis. Marigold, St. John's Wort and Chamomile showed wound-healing properties and are thus promising candidates in line to fill the therapeutic gap in canine wound-healing agents. St. John's Wort and Chamomile also showed anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects on healthy skin. Due to the wide range of beneficial effects of these medicinal plants, they should be taken into account for the treatment of dermatologic diseases in dogs at least in future clinical research.","['Tresch M', 'Mevissen M', 'Ayrle H', 'Melzig M', 'Roosje P', 'Walkenhorst M']",2019,15,1,BMC Vet Res,"Tresch M, et al.

31118035,Health-related welfare prioritisation of canine disorders using electronic health records in primary care practice in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based comparison of the disorder-specific welfare burdens of major canine conditions could better inform targeting of stakeholder resources, to maximise improvement of health-related welfare in UK dogs. Population-level disease related welfare impact offers a quantitative, welfare-centred framework for objective disorder prioritisation, but practical applications have been limited to date due to sparse reliable evidence on disorder-specific prevalence, severity and duration across the canine disease spectrum. The VetCompass™ Programme collects de-identified electronic health record data from dogs attending primary-care clinics UK-wide, and is well placed to fill these information gaps.
RESULTS: The eight common, breed-related conditions assessed were anal sac disorder, conjunctivitis, dental disease, dermatitis, overweight/obese, lipoma, osteoarthritis and otitis externa. Annual period prevalence estimates (based on confirming 250 cases from total potential cases identified from denominator population of 455, 557 dogs) were highest for dental disorder (9.6%), overweight/obese (5.7%) and anal sac disorder (4.5%). Dental disorder (76% of study year), osteoarthritis (82%), and overweight/obese (70%) had highest annual duration scores. Osteoarthritis (scoring 13/21), otitis externa (11/21) and dermatitis demonstrated (10/21) highest overall severity scores. Dental disorder (2.47/3.00 summative score), osteoarthritis (2.24/3.00) and overweight/obese (1.67/3.00) had highest VetCompass Welfare Impact scores overall.
DISCUSSION: Of the eight common, breed-related disorders assessed, dental disorder, osteoarthritis and overweight/obese demonstrated particular welfare impact, based on combinations of high prevalence, duration and severity. Future work could extend this methodology to cover a wider range of disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Dental disorders, osteoarthritis and overweight/obese have emerged as priority areas for health-related welfare improvement in the UK dog population. This study demonstrated applicability of a standardised methodology to assess the relative health-related welfare impact across a range of canine disorders using VetCompass clinical data.","['Summers JF', ""O'Neill DG"", 'Church D', 'Collins L', 'Sargan D', 'Brodbelt DC']",2019,15,1,BMC Vet Res,"Summers JF, et al.

We aimed to explore the bacterial findings and evaluate the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimes in the treatment of patients with perichondritis.
METHODS: All patients treated for perichondritis at the two Ear-Nose-Throat Departments in Central Denmark Region (covering 20% of the Danish population) from January 1990 to October 2018 were included.
RESULTS: In total, 112 patients with (n = 12) or without (n = 100) abscess were included in the study. Potential pathogens were found in 40 of 55 cultures. P. aeruginosa was recovered in 58% of abscess cases, while Staphylococcus aureus was predominant in non-abscess infections (49%). Eighty-two percent of S. aureus recovered were isolated as heavy or moderate growth. In non-abscess cases, no significant differences in clinical progress (p = 0.65), alteration in antibiotic therapy (p = 0.31), duration of hospitalization (p = 0.65), or frequency of relapse of infection (p = 1.00) or sequelae (p = 0.38) were found between patients treated with antibiotics covering S. aureus vs. P. aeruginosa.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that intravenous antibiotic therapy covering S. aureus is sufficient and appropriate empirical treatment in the majority of patients with non-abscess perichondritis. Antibiotic coverage should be expanded to include P. aeruginosa if the clinical response is disappointing or cultures grow P. aeruginosa. The risks and downsides to this approach seems limited as only a minority of patients suffered (minor) cosmetic sequelae and relapse of infection in our cohort of non-abscess perichondritis patients initially treated with antibiotics not covering P. aeruginosa.","['Klug TE', 'Holm N', 'Greve T', 'Ovesen T']",2019,276,8,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Klug TE, et al.

RESULTS: We searched two databases on August 7, 2018, for articles reporting detailed data on the signalment and clinical signs of at least one dog or cat with a cutaneous AFR (CAFR). We identified 233 and 407 citations from which were selected 32 articles reporting original information. Twenty-two articles included data on 825 dogs with CAFRs. The reported age of onset varied from less than one to 13 years of age; a beginning of signs by 6 or 12 months of age was noted in 22 to 38% of dogs, respectively. The female-to-male ratio also varied considerably. Four breeds (German shepherd dogs, West Highland white terriers, Labrador and golden retrievers) accounted for about 40% of affected dogs. Most dogs diagnosed with a CAFR were pruritic, most often in a generalized pattern, with the ears, feet, and abdomen also being frequently affected; the perineum was uncommonly targeted, however. Canine CAFRs presented mainly as recurrent bacterial skin infections, otitis externa and atopic dermatitis. Twelve articles reported novel information on 210 cats with this syndrome. There was no apparent breed and gender predisposition for feline CAFRs, but cats appeared to develop signs later than dogs with the same syndrome. Most cats with a CAFR were pruritic, especially on the head/face and neck, with the abdomen and ears also commonly involved. Symmetric self-induced alopecia, a head-and-neck self-traumatic dermatitis, miliary dermatitis and variants of eosinophilic diseases were the most common manifestations of feline CAFRs.
CONCLUSIONS: CAFRs affect dogs and cats of any age, any breed, and both genders, with the proportion of juvenile dogs diagnosed about twice that of cats. There are no reliable breed predisposition data. Most patients are pruritic, with half the dogs having generalized pruritus and half the cats scratching their face/head or neck. Canine CAFRs most often manifest as bacterial skin infections, otitis externa or atopic dermatitis; cats with CAFRs will exhibit the expected clinical phenotypes associated with feline hypersensitivity dermatitides.","['Olivry T', 'Mueller RS']",2019,15,1,BMC Vet Res,Olivry T and Mueller RS.

31064650,Otitis Externa.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa has a lifetime prevalence of 10% and can arise in acute, chronic, and necrotizing forms.
METHODS: This review is based on publications retrieved by a selective search of the pertinent literature.
RESULTS: The treatment of acute otitis media consists of anal- gesia, cleansing of the external auditory canal, and the appli- cation of antiseptic and antimicrobial agents. Local antibiotic and corticosteroid preparations have been found useful, but there have been no large-scale randomized controlled trials of their use. Topical antimicrobial treatments lead to a higher cure rate than placebo, and corticosteroid preparations lessen swelling, erythema, and secretions. Oral antibiotics are indi- cated if the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or immuno- suppression. Chronic otitis externa is often due to an under- lying skin disease. Malignant otitis externa, a destructive infection of the external auditory canal in which there is also osteomyelitis of the petrous bone, arises mainly in elderly diabetic or immunosuppressed patients and can be life- threatening.
CONCLUSION: With correct assessment of the different types of otitis externa, rapidly effective targeted treatment can be initi- ated, so that complications will be avoided and fewer cases will progress to chronic disease.","['Wiegand S', 'Berner R', 'Schneider A', 'Lundershausen E', 'Dietz A']",2019,116,13,Dtsch Arztebl Int,"Wiegand S, et al.

31060514,Clinical spectrum and factors impacting outcome of Candida auris: a single center study from Pakistan.,"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Candida auris began globally in 2014 including Pakistan and since then it has emerged as a nosocomial multi-drug resistant pathogen. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical spectrum and outcome of patients, from a single center in Pakistan, in whom C. auris was isolated.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 92 patients; ≥16 years with at least one culture positive for C. auris, at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, Pakistan from Sept 2014-Mar 2017.Demographics, clinical history, management and outcome were studied. A logistic regression model was used to identify the risk factors for mortality.
RESULTS: We identified 92 patients with C. auris (193 isolates), of whom 52.2% were males. Mean age was 54.14 ± 20.4 years. Positive cultures were obtained after a median hospital stay of 14 days. Most patients had a history of surgery (57.6%), antibiotic use (95.6%), ICU stay (44.6%), indwelling lines (88.04%) and isolation of another multi-resistant organism (52.2%).Most patients were symptomatic (70.7%). Amongst these, 38 had candidemia while 27 had non-candidemia infections. Sites of infection included central lines (35), urinary tract (19), peritonitis (4), nosocomial ventriculitis (1), empyema (1), fungal keratitis (1) otitis externa (1) and surgical site (1). Fluconazole resistance was 100% while 28.5 and 7.9% were Voriconazole and Amphotericin resistant respectively. Overall crude mortality was 42.4% while 14-day mortality was 31.5%. Both infected and colonized cases shared similar mortality (46.2% vs 33.3%; p-value = 0.25). Among infected cases mortality was high in candidemia compared to non-candidemia (60.5% vs 25.9%) in which deaths related to C. auris were 34.2% vs 22.2% respectively. On multivariate analysis candidemia (AOR 4.2, 95% CI: 1.09-16.49; p-value = 0.037) was associated with greater mortality with source control being the only protective factor for mortality (AOR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.92; p-value0.038] while ICU stay, rapidity of blood culture clearance, DM, malignancy and MDR co-infection had no impact.
CONCLUSION: Patients with C.auris from a single center in Pakistan have a wide clinical spectrum with line associated infection being the predominant site of infection. Candidemia leads to high mortality while source control improves outcome.","['Sayeed MA', 'Farooqi J', 'Jabeen K', 'Awan S', 'Mahmood SF']",2019,19,1,BMC Infect Dis,"Sayeed MA, et al.

31049113,Outer Ear Infections in Iran: A Review.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is the fungal and bacterial infection of the outer ear.
AIM: We aimed to investigate the published papers about the outer ear infections in Iran and suggest standardised investigations and treatments.
METHODS: We used different electronic databases like PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Iranmedex, Google Scholar, and Magiran with specific keywords.
RESULTS: We obtained forty published full-text articles for review of data. Our results indicated the women were more infected than men. The ages of patients were < 1-81 years. As clinically symptoms, itching and Feel the ear fairy were the most common presenting complaints in most cases. Most infections were the pure bacterial and fungal origin, respectively. However, some of the studies were mixed fungal-bacterial infections - Pseudomonas spp. And Aspergillus niger were the most common bacteria and fungi isolates respectively in Iranian patents.
CONCLUSION: Fungal and bacterial specific cultures may be recommended, and anti-fungal drugs may be added, to treatment regimens in patients with otitis externa to reduce the clinical symptoms.","['Kiakojuri K', 'Armaki MT', 'Rajabnia R', 'Pournajaf A', 'Karami M', 'Khademian A', 'Omran SM']",2019,7,7,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,"Kiakojuri K, et al.

31044229,Risk for Tympanic Membrane Perforation After Quinolone Ear Drops for Acute Otitis Externa.,"BACKGROUND: This study examined whether the use of quinolone ear drops increased the risk of perforation with intact tympanic membranes and acute otitis externa (AOE).
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using Medicaid clinical encounter and pharmacy billing records from 1999 through 2010. Children and adults had to have 24 months continuous enrollment in Medicaid prior to the first antibiotic ear drop dispensing (index date), and they had to maintain their enrollment for at least 18 months thereafter. Included ear drops were ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone, and neomycin plus hydrocortisone. Tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) was identified as 2 inpatient or outpatient encounters associated with TMP diagnosis at least 30 days apart. A Cox regression model adjusting for patient demographics, calendar year, and the number of ear drop prescriptions was used to compare TMP risk between quinolone and neomycin-exposed patients.
RESULTS: A total of 94 333 patients entered the study cohort. Use of quinolone ear drops was associated with increased risk for TMP compared with neomycin plus hydrocortisone, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.26 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-3.83). Adjusted hazard ratios were 2.53 (95% CI, 1.27-5.05) for ofloxacin, 2.24 (95% CI, 1.03-4.85) for ciprofloxacin plus hydrocortisone, and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.09-4.87) for ciprofloxacin plus dexamethasone. Sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of quinolone ear drops to treat AOE is associated with a previously unreported increased risk of developing TMPs. Selection of otic preparations to treat self-limited conditions with intact tympanic membranes should consider TMP risk.","['Wang X', 'Winterstein AG', 'Alrwisan A', 'Antonelli PJ']",2020,70,6,Clin Infect Dis,"Wang X, et al.

31043072,Effective Inexpensive Management of Necrotizing Otitis Externa Is Possible in Resource-Poor Settings.,"INTRODUCTION: Necrotizing otitis externa resolves best with antimicrobial treatment. How to care for these patients and monitor their resolution remains a problem. Our protocol in Bangalore can manage these patients inexpensively and well.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who were referred to our patients became the subjects for this paper. They were managed through our protocol, which consists of IV ciprofloxacin and meropenem, weekly labs, weekly examinations, and photodocumention.
RESULTS: Fifty-one people presented with necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) between October 2015 and November 2017 and completed our entire protocol. Forty-six had complete resolution of their disease, while 5 had to undergo surgical removal of necrotic bone. Six of 8 patients with facial weakness had improvement in their House-Brackmann scores. Reduction of self-reported nocturnal pain, dissolution of ear canal granulations, and normalization of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) proved to be the most accurate indicators of disease regression.
CONCLUSION: Patients are monitored closely with review of their otalgia, examination of their canal, repeated ESRs, effective control of their diabetes, and radiological imaging. All this can be done in a resource-poor country, which in turn serves as a model for the wealthier nations.","['Honnurappa V', 'Ramdass S', 'Mahajan N', 'Vijayendra VK', 'Redleaf M']",2019,128,9,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"Honnurappa V, et al.

31039989,Lifetime prevalence of exostoses in New Zealand surfers.,"INTRODUCTION External auditory exostosis (EAE) is a benign, irreversible bony outgrowth that arises from the temporal bone. EAE projects into the external ear canal, potentially causing recurrent otitis externa and conductive hearing loss. AIM To determine lifetime prevalence of EAE in New Zealand (NZ) surfers. METHODS This study used an online national survey. RESULTS Respondents were 1376 NZ surfers (recreational = 868, competitive = 508). Mean surfing experience was 16.2 years. Most self-classified as advanced surfers (36.5%), followed by intermediate (30.2%), expert (20.1%) and beginner (13.2%). Surfers reported an average of 214.2 h surfing (28.6% during winter) for the previous year. Overall lifetime prevalence of EAE was 28.9% (32.1% male, 14.6% female; P < 0.001), with the highest proportion of EAE was observed bilaterally (21.3%). Competitive surfers reported a significantly (P < 0.001) higher lifetime prevalence of EAE than recreational surfers (45.3% vs. 19.2%). A significantly higher (P < 0.001) lifetime prevalence of EAE was identified as skill level increased (7.1% in beginners to 55.6% in experts) and a two-fold increase (P < 0.001) of EAE in the highest (vs. lowest) quartile of surfing exposure. Neither winter surfing exposure nor which Island surfed were associated with EAE prevalence. DISCUSSION Although not as prevalent as in previous NZ research using otologic examinations, this study indicated that almost one-third of NZ surfers reported having had a diagnosis of EAE. Regular general practitioner otologic assessment and advice on appropriate prevention strategies for patients who surf may help prevent large lesions, recurrent ear infections and progressive hearing loss.","['Simas V', 'Remnant D', 'Furness J', 'Bacon CJ', 'Moran RW', 'Hing WA', 'Climstein M']",2019,11,1,J Prim Health Care,"Simas V, et al.

31005959,Fungal Malignant Otitis Externa Involves a Cascade of Complications Culminating in Pseudoaneurysm of Internal Maxillary Artery: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Pseudomonal infection is the most common cause of malignant otitis externa (MOE), which typically affects elderly diabetic patients. Fungi are a rare cause of MOE. MOE can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated promptly. It can result in a wide spectrum of complications, including skull-base osteomyelitis, cranial nerve palsy, cerebral venous thrombosis, and brain abscess. Pseudoaneurysm formation of the intracranial vessels is a life-threatening complication of MOE that is seldom reported in the literature. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 66-year-old diabetic man with MOE who was initially treated with antipseudomonal antibiotics after negative initial culture results. His MOE resulted in a cascade of complications, including facial nerve palsy, skull base osteomyelitis, and sigmoid sinus thrombosis, and culminated in left maxillary artery pseudoaneurysm formation resulting in massive epistaxis and hemodynamic instability. Endovascular embolization resulted in a successful obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm. A subsequent functional endoscopic sinus surgical (FESS) tissue biopsy confirmed Candida glabrata as the etiological agent. The patient was successfully treated with antibiotics and antifungal and anticoagulation therapy, and was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS A high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of fungal MOE, particularly in intractable cases of MOE with negative initial cultures, should be maintained. Pseudoaneurysm formation is a life-threatening complication of MOE that is seldom reported in the literature and should be suspected in any patient with MOE who presents with epistaxis or intracranial bleeding.","['Chaudhary HA', 'Ibrahim WH', 'Yousaf Z', 'Abubeker IY', 'Kartha A']",2019,20,,Am J Case Rep,"Chaudhary HA, et al.

Tuberculosis has varied clinical presentations, varying from common primary pulmonary tuberculosis to the extremely rare tubercular otitis externa, as in this case. Tubercular otitis externa has an extremely low clinical incidence.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of an immunocompetent elderly male with chronic otorrhea, otalgia, and pale granulation tissue at the ear canal with a positive biopsy report for tuberculosis, confirming the diagnosis. Subsequently, sputum culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis indicated disseminated tuberculosis. The patient's symptoms resolved after antitubercular therapy (ATT).
CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis at a rare location such as the external auditory canal is possible in regions like India where tuberculosis has the highest burden in the world. In the case of chronic ear discharge resistant to routine antibiotic treatment, the clinician should not rule out suspicion of tuberculosis.","['Swain SK', 'Sahu MC']",2019,31,103,Iran J Otorhinolaryngol,Swain SK and Sahu MC.

30987522,Efficacy of HRCT Imaging vs SPECT/CT Scans in the Staging of Malignant External Otitis.,"OBJECTIVE: The prognosis of patients with malignant external otitis (MEO) depends on the extent of the inflammatory changes in the temporal bone and skull base. The efficacy of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging in accurately assessing the extent of disease is compared with that of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) scan.
STUDY DESIGN: A clinical chart review was conducted with medical records and radiologic images.
SETTING: Tertiary care medical college hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study involved patients with clinically diagnosed MEO who underwent both modalities of imaging of the skull base. Staging of the disease extent was compared between the imaging systems among patients. Symptom control and survival rates were analyzed with respect to the SPECT/CT staging of MEO.
RESULTS: Out of 28 patients included in this study, 72% had SPECT/CT scans showing higher staging than the HRCT imaging. Four patients had mild uptake (stage 1), and 15 had disease confined to the mastoid/temporal bone, not reaching midline (stage 2). All patients in stages 1 and 2 were surviving with good symptom control. Five patients with petrous involvement reaching midline (stage 3) had persistent symptoms, and all 4 cases with SPECT/CT showing sphenoid involvement and crossing midline (stage 4) died within a year of diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: SPECT/CT scan is more sensitive than HRCT imaging in detecting the extent of disease and is a better prognosticator for patients with MEO.","['Balakrishnan R', 'Dalakoti P', 'Nayak DR', 'Pujary K', 'Singh R', 'Kumar R']",2019,161,2,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Balakrishnan R, et al.

With an ageing population and increasing prevalence of diabetes, the incidence of malignant otitis externa in the British population is rising. To date, there remain no accepted diagnostic criteria, few prognostic indicators and no consensus treatment pathways.
METHOD: A prospective case series was conducted at a tertiary referral teaching hospital.
RESULTS: A cohort of susceptible individuals predominates (elderly, male, with immunosuppression and diabetes), with 25 per cent reporting a preceding incident. Otorrhoea, otalgia and canal granulation were the commonest presenting features, alongside positive pseudomonas cultures. No clear markers for predicating disease severity were isolated; however, a high initial haemoglobin A1c level demonstrated a significant moderately positive correlation with length of treatment.

30943876,Quantification of Malassezia pachydermatis by real-time PCR in swabs from the external ear canal of dogs.,"Malassezia pachydermatis is part of the normal microbiota of canine skin and external ear canal, and is also associated with otitis externa in dogs. Laboratory detection of Malassezia otitis relies on the presence of elevated numbers of the yeast on cytologic examination of otic exudate. Although cytology has high specificity, it has low sensitivity, resulting in false-negatives and posing a challenge for clinicians to accurately diagnose Malassezia otitis. We developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) to detect and quantify M. pachydermatis yeasts and validate the method with swabs from external ear canals of dogs. Our qPCR uses the β-tubulin gene, a single-copy gene, as a target. The limit of quantification was established as 0.18 ng/reaction, equivalent to 2.0 × 10","['Puig L', 'Castellá G', 'Cabañes FJ']",2019,31,3,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Puig L, et al.

30930369,[Atypical skull base osteomyelitis suspected of spreading inflammation from the ear canal with unilateral multiple cranial neuropathy and cerebral infarctions].,"A 76-year-old man, who had undergone surgery for esophageal cancer in 2010, presented to our hospital in April 2017 complaining of prolonged slight fever, loss of appetite, and dysphagia. Initial evaluation revealed a paralyzed left vocal cord, slight muscle weakness of the extremities, left facial paralysis, hoarseness, left sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscle weakness, tongue deviation to the left, and left hypacusia-suggesting a diagnosis of Garcin's syndrome. Laboratory tests revealed increased white blood cells and C-reactive protein. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild pleocytosis (predominantly polymorphonuclear cells), elevated protein, and low CSF/plasma glucose ratio. CT showed mild clival erosion, with no evidence of carcinoma recurrence. Brain contrast-enhanced MRI showed abnormal clival marrow, enhanced soft tissue and dura matter from the clivus to the atlantoaxial joint, enhanced soft tissue around the left ear canal, multiple cerebral infarctions in the left watershed zones, and left internal carotid stenosis. There was excessive ear wax and inflammation of the left external acoustic meatus but no otorrhea or otalgia. On the basis of his overall presentation, he was diagnosed with atypical skull base osteomyelitis due to external otitis. He was treated with antibiotic treatment that included ceftazidime for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa detected on bacterial cultures. He did not respond to treatment and died approximately 4 months later. Skull base osteomyelitis is thus an important differential diagnosis candidate after finding unilateral, multiple cranial neuropathy, underscoring the importance of prompt treatment when suspected.","['Hashimoto Y', 'Tateishi T']",2019,59,4,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,Hashimoto Y and Tateishi T.

30919672,Effects of an enrofloxacin-silver sulfadiazine emulsion in the ears of rabbits with perforated tympanic membranes.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an enrofloxacin-silver sulfadiazine emulsion (ESS) labeled for treatment of otitis externa in dogs has ototoxic effects in rabbits following myringotomy.
ANIMALS: 6 healthy adult New Zealand White rabbits.
PROCEDURES: Rabbits were anesthetized for brainstem auditory-evoked response (BAER) tests on day 0. Myringotomy was performed, and BAER testing was repeated. Saline (0.9% NaCl) solution and ESS were then instilled in the left and right middle ears, respectively, and BAER testing was repeated prior to recovery of rabbits from anesthesia. Application of assigned treatments was continued every 12 hours for 7 days, and rabbits were anesthetized for BAER testing on day 8. Rabbits were euthanized, and samples were collected for histologic (6 ears/treatment) and scanning electron microscopic (1 ear/treatment) examination.
RESULTS: Most hearing thresholds (11/12 ears) were subjectively increased after myringotomy, with BAER measurements ranging from 30 to 85 dB in both ears. All day 8 hearing thresholds exceeded baseline (premyringotomy) values; results ranged from 30 to 85 dB and 80 to > 95 dB (the upper test limit) in saline solution-treated and ESS-treated ears, respectively. All ESS-treated ears had heterophilic otitis externa, epithelial hyperplasia of the external ear canal, various degrees of mucoperiosteal edema, and periosteal new bone formation on histologic examination. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that most outer hair cells in the ESS-treated ear lacked stereocilia or were absent.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results supported that ESS has ototoxic effects in the middle ear of rabbits. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. Myringotomized laboratory rabbits may be useful to study ototoxicity of drugs used in human medicine.","['Bateman FL', 'Kirejczyk SGM', 'Stewart GV', 'Cutler DC', 'Quilling LL', 'Howerth EW', 'Mayer J']",2019,80,4,Am J Vet Res,"Bateman FL, et al.

30876854,Schwannoma of the external auditory canal: An exceptional site.,"INTRODUCTION: Schwannomas are benign solitary neural tumours that are only exceptional located in the external auditory canal, as only a few cases have been reported in the literature.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of schwannoma of the external auditory canal in an 18-year-old man admitted for an isolated mass of the initial segment of the right external auditory canal visible to the naked eye, obstructing all of the external auditory meatus. Computed tomography of the temporal bone showed an isolated mass of the external auditory canal. Management of this patient consisted of biopsy-excision of the mass, histological examination of which confirmed a schwannoma of the external auditory canal.
DISCUSSION: Although rare, the possibility of a nerve tumour of the external auditory canal should always be considered. These tumours may be isolated or may occur in the context of von Recklinghausen's disease. The clinical presentation in the external auditory canal may correspond to recurrent otitis externa secondary to obstruction of the canal by the tumour, as in the case reported here. The definitive diagnosis must be based on the results of histological and immunohistochemical examination.","['Sbai A', 'Lachkar A', 'Elayoubi F', 'Ghailan R']",2019,136,3,Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,"Sbai A, et al.

30840222,Skull base osteomyelitis: factors implicating clinical outcome.,"Skull base osteomyelitis is a serious disease with a high risk of complications including neuroinfection. Typically, the inflammation of the skull base results from infection from neighboring tissues. In case of malignant otitis externa, inflammation disseminates from the external auditory canal. In this study, we present our experience with seven patients diagnosed with skull base osteomyelitis that began with otitis externa and have been treated in our department for the last 10 years. Department Patient Database was searched for the diagnosis skull base osteomyelitis. The search covered the last 10 years. The search revealed seven patients who met the above-described criteria. Medical records of those patients were carefully analyzed including age, gender, symptoms and signs, diagnostics details, treatment, performed procedures, number of hospitalization days, comorbid diseases, and complications including any cranial nerve palsy. Detailed analysis of medical records of patients included in this study showed that skull base osteomyelitis presents a challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Treatment strategy requires prolonged aggressive intravenous antibiotic therapy, and in some cases combined with surgical intervention. Cranial nerve paresis indicates progression of the disease and is associated with longer hospital stay. Similar relationship is observed in patients with skull base osteomyelitis that required surgery. Diabetes in patient's medical history may complicate the healing process. Diabetes, neural involvement, and surgery may overlap each other resulting in longer hospital stay. Cranial nerve paresis may not resolve completely and some neural deficits become persistent.","['Sokołowski J', 'Lachowska M', 'Karchier E', 'Bartoszewicz R', 'Niemczyk K']",2019,119,3,Acta Neurol Belg,"Sokołowski J, et al.

30829050,OTO-201 for the Treatment of Acute Otitis Externa: Results from a Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Study.,"OBJECTIVES: OTO-201 is a ciprofloxacin otic suspension previously approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat children with bilateral otitis media with effusion requiring tympanostomy tube placement. In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, prospective, sham-controlled, multicenter study, a single dose of OTO-201 was administered to the external auditory canal in subjects with unilateral or bilateral acute otitis externa.
METHODS: Two hundred sixty-two subjects, 3 to 83 years of age, were randomized, and 260 subjects were included in the intent-to-treat analysis population: OTO-201 (0.2 mL, 12 mg, n = 130) or sham (air injection, n = 130). The primary efficacy measure was clinical cure (CC) on day 8, judged by blinded assessor for erythema, edema, otorrhea, and tenderness. Subjects were monitored over 28 days for efficacy and safety.
RESULTS: OTO-201 demonstrated a significant increase in CC compared with sham at day 8 (69.2% vs 46.1%, P < .001). Higher CC was also noted on day 4 ( P = .028), day 15 ( P < .001), and day 29 ( P < .001). A similar effect was observed in the pathogen-positive population. Single OTO-201 administration in the office setting was well tolerated by subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study in subjects with acute otitis externa, a single administration of 12 mg OTO-201 to the external auditory canal demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of subjects with CC and bacterial eradication compared with sham starting on day 4 and on all other observation days through day 29, with no safety or tolerability concerns identified.

The diversity of the cutaneous microbiota in dogs appears to decrease in diseased states. However, little is known about the microbiota of the canine ear and how it is altered by disease.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To describe the otic bacterial microbiota in dogs with otitis externa compared to healthy dogs.
ANIMALS: Samples were collected from 18 dogs with clinical and cytological evidence of otitis externa, and eight clinically normal dogs without cytological evidence of otitis externa.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: DNA from each sample was isolated and Illumina
RESULTS: Bacteria from 27 different phyla were identified. Affected ears had significantly decreased alpha diversity when compared to healthy ears. Community structure and membership also differed between the two groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis identified 153 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were differentially abundant. Eleven OTUs were over-represented in the affected ears, including Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Parvimonas.
CONCLUSIONS: The otic bacterial microbiota is much more complex than has been identified with previous culture-based studies; otitis externa is accompanied by broad and complex differences in the microbiota.","['Korbelik J', 'Singh A', 'Rousseau J', 'Weese JS']",2019,30,3,Vet Dermatol,"Korbelik J, et al.

30698313,Malignant otitis externa in Australian Aboriginal patients: A 9-year retrospective analysis from the Northern Territory.,"OBJECTIVE: In the Australian Aboriginal population, type 2 diabetes occurs at a much higher prevalence, with a much younger age of onset of the disease and its complications. Despite the clear association with malignant otitis externa, no previous studies have examined malignant otitis externa in this population. This study explores the pattern of malignant otitis externa amongst Australian Aboriginal patients in the Northern Territory.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: Otolaryngology unit in a tertiary referral hospital in Northern Territory, Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted with malignant otitis externa between January 2007 and October 2016 were identified by reviewing case notes. Patients diagnosed with malignant otitis externa based on results from clinical, microbiological and radiological criteria were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications rates, duration of hospital stay and parenteral antibiotics, age of onset and causative organisms.
RESULTS: Nine patients were included. Six were Australian Aboriginal - all from regional centres. The most common causative organism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was a higher-than-expected occurrence of fungal malignant otitis externa (33% of Australian Aboriginal patients), who tended to be younger at diagnosis, had longer hospital stays and had a higher disease-specific mortality. Over half of the patients did not receive follow-up gallium bone scans to monitor disease resolution, reflecting the limitations of rural health care.
CONCLUSION: Malignant otitis externa in the Australian Aboriginal population is a challenging disease with high complication and mortality rates. Their rural and remote distribution is a significant barrier to specialist investigation and care. Providing effective care for this disease requires improved access to high-quality primary health care and tertiary specialist services.","['Loh TL', 'Renger L', 'Latis S', 'Patel H']",2019,27,1,Aust J Rural Health,"Loh TL, et al.

Similarly, very few were aware of the risks of MOE (2.5%), complications associated with it (17.3%) and the necessary procedures for managing patients (24.2%). The awareness of doctors in the primary health clinics about MOE was significantly better than those in hospitals (
CONCLUSION: There was a significant deficiency in the knowledge of GPs on MOE. Therefore, health education and awareness programs on MOE are recommended. Furthermore, we recommend that it is necessary to encourage the use of the term ""Diabetic EAR ""to increase the level of awareness of physicians about MOE.","['AlEnazi AS', 'Al Sharhan SS', 'Telmesani LM', 'Aljazan NA', 'Al Qahtani BM', 'Lotfy MA']",2019,26,1,J Family Community Med,"AlEnazi AS, et al.

30663140,Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations for silver sulfadiazine and other topical antimicrobial agents against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from canine otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is a common presenting complaint in practice. Ear infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are particularly problematic due to the organism's high level of resistance and ability to damage the tympanum. Treatment should be based on susceptibility testing although minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are not available for all treatment options. Silver sulfadiazine has been used in cases of recurrent P. aeruginosa otitis, although a MIC for silver sulfadiazine as a single agent has not been established.
OBJECTIVES: To describe susceptibility patterns of P. aeruginosa isolated from canine otitis externa and determine the MIC for silver sulfadiazine and other topical antimicrobials.
ANIMALS: Thirty-six P. aeruginosa isolates were collected from client-owned dogs, suffering from otitis externa.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Susceptibility patterns were established using disc diffusion susceptibility testing against 17 antimicrobial agents. For determination of the MIC, selected strains were tested against increasing concentrations of marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, polymyxin B and silver sulfadiazine using broth microdilution.
RESULTS: For nine of 17 antimicrobial agents, complete resistance was seen in all isolates tested via disk diffusion susceptibility testing. Approximately 94% and 96% of isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and imipenem, respectively. These findings were consistent with broth dilution, where all strains were susceptible to gentamicin. Resistance was higher against polymyxin B and the fluoroquinolones. Silver sulfadiazine was effective in vitro with a MIC ranging from 1 to 64 μg/mL.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: As the MIC of silver sulfadiazine was lower than the concentration in a 1% preparation, such a product potentially represents a treatment option for dogs with P. aeruginosa otitis.","['von Silva-Tarouca MSE', 'Wolf G', 'Mueller RS']",2019,30,2,Vet Dermatol,"von Silva-Tarouca MSE, et al.

30637895,Clinical analysis and nonsurgical management of 11 dogs with aural cholesteatoma.,"BACKGROUND: Aural cholesteatomas, also called tympanokeratomas, are destructive and expansile growths of keratinizing epithelium that develop in the middle ear. They have been reported sporadically in dogs, and surgery is usually the recommended treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the common clinical, radiological and histological findings of cholesteatoma; to report on the outcome of conservative management.
ANIMALS: Eleven dogs (13 ears) with cholesteatomas.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records were reviewed for dogs diagnosed with cholesteatoma between 2012 and 2018. All dogs had computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by trans-canal endoscopic procedure (TEP) for removal and biopsy of middle ear lesions. Dogs were then treated with in-clinic flushing initially weekly tapered to monthly, as well as at-home ear cleaning and application of topical otic steroid medication, initially daily then tapered to once or twice weekly.
RESULTS: Nine dogs had a history of chronic otitis externa; head tilt or facial paralysis was present in seven and four cases, respectively. Otic examination identified a protruding nodule in seven ears. CT demonstrated soft tissue-like material in 12 bullae and expansion in seven bullae. MRI revealed minimally contrast-enhancing bulla contents in 12 ears. Post-TEP and with maintenance medical treatment, nine ears had no further signs of middle ear disease during a mean follow-up of 27.9 months.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The results suggest that otitis externa may not necessarily precede cholesteatoma in all dogs. MRI appears to be more sensitive than CT for identifying cholesteatomas. Conservative treatment of cholesteatomas could be useful before or as an alternative to surgery.","['Imai A', 'Kondo H', 'Suganuma T', 'Nagata M']",2019,30,1,Vet Dermatol,"Imai A, et al.

Although various pathogens have been implicated, to our knowledge, primary nocardial clival osteomyelitis has never been reported. We describe a 74-year-old woman who presented with headaches, abducens and hypoglossal nerve palsies, facial numbness, photophobia, and neck stiffness. Imaging revealed a heterogeneous mass within the sphenoid sinus with clival extension. The lesion was extirpated via a binostril endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Histopathological and microbiological examination revealed a nocardial source. Clival osteomyelitis associated with sphenoid sinusitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of progressive skull base lesions in the setting of an underlying infection.

CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old woman was initially treated with meatoplasty for suspected chronic obliterating otitis externa. She remained symptom-free for 5 years, before the disease recurred, affecting other body surfaces as well. Otorrhoea, conductive hearing loss and pruritus worsened, and a canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy was performed, removing the skin of the external auditory canal and the tympanic membrane completely. Lichen planus was confirmed histopathologically.
DISCUSSION: Very few surgical results have been published on stenosis of the external auditory canal caused by lichen planus. Complete medial external auditory canal skin elevation and removal with postoperative split-skin grafting is advised for initial treatment. We discuss treatment options and surgical outcome after initial surgical failure.","['Košec A', 'Kostić M', 'Ajduk J', 'Ries M']",2019,136,2,Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,"Košec A, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To describe effective probiotic and photodynamic therapy of a dog with gut colonization and ear infection caused by a hospital-associated lineage of carbapenemase (VIM-2)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
ANIMALS: A 5-year-old Lhasa apso dog presented with otitis externa.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Unilateral otitis externa caused by carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa was treated with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) using methylene blue as photosensitizer [wavelength 660 nm, fluence 140 J/cm
RESULTS: Complete resolution of clinical signs was achieved by Day 7 after aPDT. Samples collected immediately and after seven and 14 days following aPDT were negative for VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa. Oral and rectal swabs collected on days 7, 14 and 21 after probiotic therapy, confirmed effective gastrointestinal decolonization.

30551696,A Lateral Neck Myeloid Sarcoma Presenting as Acute Otitis Externa.,"Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a solid extra-medullary tumor of immature myeloid cells which could occur before, during or after remission of acute leukemia at any site on the body. Owing to variation in differential diagnosis, pathologic evaluation and immunohistochemical staining are essential for definitive diagnosis. Rarely, MS has been shown as an isolated extramedullary relapse (iEMR) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), which often does not necessarily result in bone marrow involvement. It seems that despite chemotherapy and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects on bone marrow, leukemic cells could remain alive in the extra-medullary region. However, in order to achieve longer survival, timely diagnosis as well as combined systemic, local, and cellular therapeutic modalities should be considered in any patient with iEMR after allo-SCT. We report a left lateral neck isolated MS presented as acute otitis externa in a patient with prior allo-SCT due to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, MS should be considered in patients with any history of acute leukemia even if the patient presents with signs and symptoms of an infectious disease.","['Mozafari R', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Sotoude H', 'Asadollahi-Amin A']",2018,21,11,Arch Iran Med,"Mozafari R, et al.

30549258,FDG-PET/CT for diagnosis and follow-up of necrotizing (malignant) external otitis.,"OBJECTIVE: Imaging is important for the diagnosis and follow-up of necrotizing external otitis (NEO). The best imaging modality is controversy. To suggest 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) as an alternative to technetium-99m and gallium-67 scans for diagnosis and assessment of response to treatment for patients with NEO.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series.
METHODS: Tertiary referral center. From 2013 through 2017, 12 patients were diagnosed with NEO based on clinical features and positive FDG uptake within the temporal bone on PET/CT. Mean age was 74 ± 11.5; 83% of the patients were male; and 83% had diabetes.
RESULTS: PET/CT scans were reviewed independently by two nuclear medicine specialists. Imaging located osteomyelitis in external ear canal, mastoid, temporomandibular joint, and nasopharyngeal region (100%, 50%, 16%, 8%, respectively). Mean follow-up was 16 months. Eight patients (67%) underwent a second PET/CT scan after active otitis resolved and after at least 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment. The scan demonstrated no or substantially reduced FDG uptake and treatment was stopped. The patients had no NEO symptoms at the end of follow-up. One patient had significant uptake, and antibiotic treatment was continued until a third scan demonstrated no FDG uptake. Two patients died before the second PET/CT, and two were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: 18F-FDG-PET/CT is a reliable imaging modality for diagnosis, disease localization, and decision making regarding treatment cessation. 18F-FDG-PET/CT should be considered as the imaging modality of choice for initial diagnosis and follow-up in NEO patients. Larger, controlled studies are warranted.

30548715,In vitro antimicrobial activity of seven adjuvants against common pathogens associated with canine otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: An antibiotic adjuvant is a chemical substance used to modify or augment the effectiveness of primary antimicrobial agents against drug-resistant micro-organisms. Its use provides an alternative approach to address the global issue of antimicrobial resistance and enhance antimicrobial stewardship.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the antimicrobial activity of a panel of potential antimicrobial adjuvants against common pathogens associated with canine otitis externa (OE).
ANIMALS/ISOLATES: A number of type strains and clinical isolates (n = 110) from canine OE were tested including Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, β-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Malassezia pachydermatis.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Antimicrobial activities of monolaurin, monocaprin, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), polymyxin B nonapeptide, Tris-EDTA, Tris-HCL and disodium EDTA were tested using microdilution methodology according to CLSI guidelines.
RESULTS: N-acetylcysteine, Tris-EDTA and disodium EDTA had antimicrobial activity against both type strains and otic pathogens. The other adjuvants tested had limited to no efficacy. NAC had a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 2,500-10,000 μg/mL for the various organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were eight times more susceptible to disodium EDTA in the presence of Tris-HCL in comparison to disodium EDTA alone. Malassezia pachydermatis isolates were most susceptible to Tris-EDTA (MIC
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: N-acetylcysteine, Tris-EDTA and disodium EDTA have intrinsic antimicrobial activity and represent promising adjuvants that could be used to enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotics against Gram-negative and multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

30545614,"The proportion, conditions, and predictors of emergency department visits that can be potentially managed by pharmacists with expanded scope of practice.","BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have been shown to be beneficial for inclusion in emergency department (ED) services; however, little has been done to assess these benefits with pharmacists having even wider scopes of practice, including limited prescribing authority.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of ED visits that can potentially be managed by pharmacists, the most prevalent conditions within these cases, and the factors associated with patients presenting with such cases to the ED.
METHODS: This was a retrospective quantitative cohort study using administrative databases from 2010 to 2017. Among all unscheduled ED visits in Ontario, all visits with a Family Practice Sensitive Condition and Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale score of IV or V were identified, in addition to conditions that can be managed by pharmacists with expanded scope. Logistic regression was performed to identify determinants of having a potentially pharmacist-manageable condition.
RESULTS: Of 34,550,020 ED visits identified, 12.4% (n = 4,293,807) were considered FPSC with CTAS IV or V. Of these, 1,494,887 (34.8%) were for conditions considered to be potentially manageable by pharmacists, representing 4.3% of all ED visits. The most frequent diagnoses observed were: acute pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, rash and other nonspecific skin eruption, otitis externa, cough, acute sinusitis, and dermatitis. Female gender, having a family physician or presenting with a CTAS of IV were associated with higher odds of presenting to the ED, while increased age and income were associated with lower odds.
CONCLUSIONS: Under an expanded scope, pharmacists could potentially have managed nearly 1.5 million cases presenting to the ED over the study period.

It was intended to assess auditory and histopathological safety of ototopical use of mercurochrome solution in rats with induced tympanic membrane perforation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 21 female Wistar-Albino rats which were randomly assigned into 3 groups. In all rats, perforation was performed at right tympanic membrane. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) measurements were performed at frequencies of 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz (with L1/L2: 70 /70 dB at 2f1-f2 frequency; f2/f1 ratio: 1:22) before recovery from anesthesia and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were recorded. Normal saline, 2% mercurochrome and gentamicin were given to group 1, 2 and 3 twice daily over a week, respectively. Rats were sacrificed after DPOAE measurements on day 14. Right temporal bone specimens were examined under light microscope after processing.
RESULTS: Based on DPOAE results, there was no significant difference among groups before treatment. On day 14, significant differences were found in DPOAE measurements at 3000 and 4000 Hz, and in mean SNR values in 2% mercurochrome and gentamicin groups when compared to normal saline group while no significant difference was detected at 2000 Hz among groups. In addition, significant degeneration was detected in Corti organs, spiral ganglions and stria vascularis in groups 2 and 3.
CONCLUSION: In this study, it was observed that mercurochrome use in external otitis and otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation could cause ototoxicity and concluded that the solution should be used cautiously.","['Korkmaz S', 'Ceylan ME', 'Ceylan G', 'Dalgıç A', 'İnan S', 'Olgun L', 'Özüer MZ']",2019,15,1,J Int Adv Otol,"Korkmaz S, et al.

30459850,A Comprehensive Review of Skull Base Osteomyelitis: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges among Various Presentations.,"Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is a complex and fatal clinical entity that is often misdiagnosed for malignancy. SBO is commonly a direct complication of otogenic, sinogenic, odontogenic, and rhinogenic infections and can present as central, atypical, or pediatric clival SBO. This review describes the clinical profile, investigational approach, and management techniques for these variants. A comprehensive literature review was performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, Research Gate, EMBASE, Wiley Online Library, and various Neurosurgical and Neurology journals with the keywords including: SBO, central or atypical SBO, fungal osteomyelitis, malignant otitis externa, temporal bone osteomyelitis, and clival osteomyelitis. Each manuscript's reference list was reviewed for potentially relevant articles. The search yielded a total of 153 articles. It was found that with early and aggressive culture guided long-term intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy decreases post-infection complications. In cases of widespread soft tissue involvement, an early aggressive surgical removal of infectious sequestra with preferentially Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is associated with better prognosis of disease, less neurologic sequelae and mortality rate. Complete resolution of the SBO cases may take several months. Since early treatment can improve mortality rates, it is paramount that the reporting radiologists and treating clinicians are aware of the cardinal diagnostic signs to improve clinical outcomes of the disease. It will decrease delayed diagnosis and under treatment of the condition. However, due to rarity of the condition, complete prognostic factors have not fully been analyzed and discussed in the literature.","['Khan MA', 'Quadri SAQ', 'Kazmi AS', 'Kwatra V', 'Ramachandran A', 'Gustin A', 'Farooqui M', 'Suriya SS', 'Zafar A']",2018,13,4,Asian J Neurosurg,"Khan MA, et al.

METHODS: Sixteen cats experimentally infested with O. cynotis were allocated randomly to two groups of 8 cats each. One group was treated topically with the fixed combination of fluralaner plus moxidectin at the minimum dose rate of 40 mg fluralaner and 2 mg moxidectin/kg body weight. The other group was treated with physiological saline solution. Before and 14 and 28 days after treatment the ears of all cats were examined otoscopically for live mites and for the amount of debris and cerumen. Twenty-eight days after treatment, the cats were sedated and had both ears flushed to obtain the total number of live mites per animal. Efficacy was calculated, based on the results of the ear flushing, by comparing mean live mite counts in the fluralaner plus moxidectin treated group versus the saline group.
RESULTS: A single topical application of the fixed combination of fluralaner plus moxidectin to cats reduced the mean mite counts by 100% (P < 0.001) by 28 days after treatment. No mites were visible during otoscopic examination at either 14 or 28 days after treatment. All fluralaner plus moxidectin treated cats had less ceruminous exudate 28 days after treatment compared to pre-treatment and 14 days after treatment. No treatment related adverse events were observed in any cats enrolled in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Single topical application of the fixed combination of fluralaner plus moxidectin was highly effective against O. cynotis infestations in cats.","['Taenzler J', 'de Vos C', 'Roepke RKA', 'Heckeroth AR']",2018,11,1,Parasit Vectors,"Taenzler J, et al.

30419045,Use of physician billing claims to identify infections in children.,"While medical records have detailed information, they are limited in reach to the availability and accessibility of those records. On the other hand, administrative data while limited in scope, have a much further reach in coverage of an entire population. However, few studies have validated the use of administrative data for identifying infections in pediatric populations. Pediatric patients from Ontario, Canada aged <18 years were randomly sampled from the Electronic Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD). Using physician diagnoses from the electronic medical record (EMR) as the reference standard, we determined the criterion validity of physician billing claims in administrative data for identifying infectious disease syndromes from 2012 to 2014. Diagnosis codes were assessed by infection category (respiratory, skin and soft tissue, gastrointestinal, urinary tract and otitis externa) and for all infections combined. Sensitivity analyses assessed the performance if patients had more than one reason to visit the physician. We analysed 2,139 patients and found 33.3% of all visits were for an infection, and respiratory infections accounted for 67.6% of the infections. When we combined all infection categories, sensitivity was 0.74 (95% CI 0.70-0.77), specificity was 0.95 (95% CI 0.93-0.96), positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.90), and negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.88 (95% CI 0.86-0.89). For respiratory infections, sensitivity was 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.81), specificity was 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97), PPV was 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88), and NPV was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.95). Similar performance was observed for skin and soft tissue, gastrointestinal, urinary tract, and otitis externa infections, but with lower sensitivity. Performance measures were highest when the patient visited the physician with only one health complaint. We found when using linked EMR data as the reference standard, administrative billing codes are reasonably accurate in identifying infections in a pediatric population.","['Hwee J', 'Sung L', 'Kwong JC', 'Sutradhar R', 'Tu K', 'Pole JD']",2018,13,11,PLoS One,"Hwee J, et al.

30379394,Acute otitis externa because of negative pressure wound therapy applied over the head and ear canal for scalping treatment.,"Scalping is considered a complex wound with difficult treatment, requiring early surgical intervention, reconstructive plastic surgery, and a multidisciplinary team. The reconstruction of the scalp frequently requires a combination of therapies, including temporary coverage, such as negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Complications of NPWT, such as bleeding, infection, and pain, have been described. However, there is no report of acute otitis externa (AOE) because of NPWT. In this article, we present an unprecedented clinical case - a female patient who developed AOE after scalping treatment with NPWT applied over the head and ear canal. We consider that it may be a result of the direct physical action of subatmospheric pressure, the presence of dressing covering the external meatus, and alteration of the bacterial population.","['Castro JCD', 'Coltro PS', 'Jorge JLG', 'Farina Junior JA']",2019,16,2,Int Wound J,"Castro JCD, et al.

This study aimed to describe demography, mortality and commonly recorded diseases in Labrador retrievers under UK veterinary care.
METHODS: The VetCompass™ programme collects electronic patient record data on dogs attending UK primary-care veterinary practices. Demographic analysis covered all33,320 Labrador retrievers in the VetCompass™ database under veterinary care during 2013 while disorder and mortality data were extracted from a random sample of 2074 (6.2%) of these dogs.
RESULTS: Of the Labrador retrievers with information available, 15,427 (46.4%) were female and 15,252 (53.6%) were male. Females were more likely to be neutered than males (59.7% versus 54.8%, 
CONCLUSIONS: The current study assists prioritisation of health issues within Labrador retrievers. The most common disorders were overweight/obesity, otitis externa and degenerative joint disease. Males were significantly heavier females.

30370887,Hearing loss in the trenches - a hidden morbidity of World War I.,"BACKGROUND: One hundred years ago, millions of British and Allied troops were fighting in the trenches of the Great War. With a tenth of soldiers losing their lives, hearing loss seemed a low priority; however, vast numbers of troops sustained significant hearing loss.
METHOD: A review was conducted of literature published between 1914 and 1925.
RESULTS: Soldiers were exposed to up to 185 dB of sustained noise from new, high-energy weapons, which caused 'labyrinthine concussion'. Traumatic injuries, non-organic hearing loss and malingering were also common. One source estimated that 2.4 per cent of the army was disabled by hearing loss. However, many British doctors viewed this 'soldier's deafness' as a temporary affliction, resulting in soldiers being labelled as malingerers or 'hysterical'.
CONCLUSION: Today, one can recognise that a scant evidence base and misconceptions influenced the mismanagement of hearing loss by otolaryngologists in World War I. However, noise-induced hearing loss is still very much a feature of armed conflict.","['Conroy K', 'Malik V']",2018,132,11,J Laryngol Otol,Conroy K and Malik V.

30350895,Exserohilum infections in Australian Queensland children.,"BACKGROUND: Exserohilum species are environmental moulds that can cause skin infection and sinusitis in both normal and immunosuppressed children. This study reviews paediatric cases of Exserohilum infection in Queensland, Australia, to identify the spectrum of disease and its clinical course.
METHODS: All culture-positive samples of Exserohilum species in children <18 years of age were identified from the Queensland Health Laboratory database (April 2003-April 2018). Clinical information was recorded from medical records.
RESULTS: Eleven children were identified, and all had isolated Exserohilum rostratum. The mean age was 7.4 years (range 2.3-17.8) and 64% female. Four immunocompetent children (36%) had a skin infection (2/4), chronic sinusitis (1/4) or otitis externa (1/4). Seven children (64%) had an underlying oncological diagnosis with E. rostratum causing local skin infection (2/7), invasive rhinosinus disease (3/7) or disseminated infection (2/7). All oncological patients were empirically started on liposomal amphotericin B with addition, or switch, to posaconazole or voriconazole.
CONCLUSION: Exserohilum rostratum infection of the skin has a favourable course, whereas rhinosinus infection can be rapidly invasive in the immunocompromised child requiring prompt surgical intervention and antifungal therapy.

30305092,"A randomized, controlled, single-blinded, multicenter evaluation of the efficacy and safety of a once weekly two dose otic gel containing florfenicol, terbinafine and betamethasone administered for the treatment of canine otitis externa.","BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is a common problem in small animal practice. Compliance with daily treatment is a major cause of treatment failure. The hypothesis tested is that a novel otic gel applied to the ear canal twice with a one-week interval is as efficacious as a daily otic suspension in the treatment of canine otitis externa. The study included 286 privately owned dogs with otitis externa. In this single blinded randomized study, enrolled dogs received either an otic gel containing 1% florfenicol, 1% terbinafine and 0.1% betamethasone acetate twice with a one-week interval or a suspension containing hydrocortisone aceponate, miconazole and gentamicin daily for 5 days. Ears were cleaned with saline prior to administration of the first dose of medication. Dogs were evaluated at day (D) 0, 7, 28 and 56 with an otitis index score (OTIS-3), otic culture and cytology, pain and pruritus, and overall response to treatment (owner and investigator evaluation). Outcome measures were improvement of the OTIS-3 and number of dogs in clinical remission at each time point.
RESULTS: OTIS-3 decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) by 63 and 64% for the otic gel and by 63 and 61% for the suspension on D28 and D56 respectively. There was no significant difference between groups at any time point with regard to clinical success, pain, pruritus, overall assessments or otic cytology and culture. The treatment response was considered excellent or good by approximately three quarters of both the clinicians and Owners. Otitis recurrence at D56 was seen in 11% of both groups. Adverse events attributable to the ear medications were not noted.

30291437,The significance of tissue biopsy for fungi in necrotizing otitis externa.,"INTRODUCTION: The conventional treatment for necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) is prolonged anti-pseudomonas therapy, with surgical treatment in non-responsive patients. The aim of the present study is to describe the course of management of patients with non-responsive NOE undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), and to investigate the importance of tissue biopsy for fungi in this group of patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study conducted between January 2010 and December 2013 at an Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Department. Included were all 52 patients with NOE referred to our Medical Centre for further treatment including HBOT.
RESULTS: Fifty-two consecutive patients, 29 men and 23 women, with a mean age of 70.6 years, were included in our study. Twenty seven (51.9%) underwent surgical debridement. No significant difference was found between the group having surgical intervention, and those who did not, with regard to sex, age, comorbidities, cranial nerve involvement or laboratory results. However, those who had surgical intervention had a statistically significant higher rate of fungal infection (P = 0.049). After completing 7 weeks of HBOT, a significantly lower WBC count was observed in the fungus-infected group (7000 vs 7.800, P = 0.03), and a tendency towards lower CRP levels in the fungus-infected group (16 vs 58, P = 0.087).
CONCLUSION: Patients with NOE should have a comprehensive surgical intervention when delayed healing is observed, because proper fungal culturing might change the course of treatment and improve prognosis.

32336859,Infections and foreign bodies in ENT.,"Infections of the ear, nose and throat are common. The majority of these infections are managed by the primary care physicians and they settle with conservative and medical management. However, a small group can progress to become troublesome and develop complications to the extent that they may require surgical intervention. Some of the infections can lead to life-threatening complications therefore awareness and correct diagnosis along with appropriate management is paramount. Foreign bodies in the ear, nose and throat are commonly encountered. The location and type of foreign body can have an implication on the urgency of action and the possible complications. In this article the common ENT infections and foreign bodies and their management are discussed.","['De M', 'Anari S']",2018,36,10,Surgery (Oxf),De M and Anari S.

30251451,Oxythiamine improves antifungal activity of ketoconazole evaluated in canine Malassezia pachydermatis strains.,"BACKGROUND: Malassezia pachydermatis is an opportunistic yeast involved in skin and ear canal infections of dogs and cats. Reports suggest that strains of M. pachydermatis resistant to commonly used antifungal agents may be emerging. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies should be explored.
OBJECTIVES: The synergistic effect of oxythiamine (OT) and ketoconazole (KTC) was analysed using a reference strain and field isolates (n = 66) of M. pachydermatis. Hydrogel formulations containing these components also were evaluated.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of OT, KTC and their mixtures were determined by a broth macrodilution method. The antifungal effects of hydrogel formulations were determined by a plate diffusion method.
RESULTS: The MIC and MFC values of OT were in the range 0.08 × 10
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Synergy of these drugs may allow for successful topical treatment which utilizes lower doses of KTC without changing its therapeutic effectiveness. Hydrogel formulations proved to be attractive drug carriers for potential topical use.","['Siemieniuk M', 'Sosnowska K', 'Czerniecki J', 'Czyzewska U', 'Winnicka K', 'Tylicki A']",2018,29,6,Vet Dermatol,"Siemieniuk M, et al.

30247457,Acupuncture as a Nonpharmacologic Treatment for Pain in a Pediatric Emergency Department.,"OBJECTIVES: With epidemic opioid deaths and abuse in the United States, government agencies recommend nonpharmacological treatments for pain. However nonopioid treatment options for moderate to severe pain in the pediatric emergency department (PED) are limited. Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using traditional acupuncture (TA) and battlefield acupuncture (BFA) in the treatment of pain in the PED.
METHODS: A pediatric cohort treated with acupuncture for pain in an urban PED was assessed. All subjects received TA or BFA as treatment, and pre/postacupuncture pain scores, feedback, and adverse events were assessed. The primary outcome was a change in pain score.
RESULTS: Twelve patients received BFA, and 13 received TA for these pain conditions: headaches, sciatica, paraphimosis, torticollis, joint pains (knee, shoulder, jaw), sprains (foot, wrist, thumb), dysmenorrhea, otitis externa, sickle cell, and muscle knot. The mean ± SD pain score change, 5.8 ± 2.5 (P < 0.05; 95% confidence interval, 4.9-7.0), was clinically and statistically significant. Over 90% of subjects reported significant improvement or resolution of pain; 96% were satisfied with pain relief and would receive acupuncture again. Two adverse events were noted: one patient reported dizziness, and another, a tinge of blood at 1 of 90 needled points.

30239427,Necrotizing Otitis Externa-Analysis of 83 Cases: Clinical Findings and Course of Disease.,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the relationship between clinical findings and course of disease among patients with necrotizing otitis externa (NOE).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series review.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Adult patients with no previous history of chronic ear disease, hospitalized due to NOE between the years 1990 to 2015.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 1) Duration of hospitalization and 2) necessity for surgery.
RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were included in the study, corresponding to 83 effected ears. Thirty-two patients (38.5%) were hospitalized longer than 20 days and 20 patients (24.0%) underwent surgery. Otalgia was the most common complaint (n = 71, 85.5%). Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA) was the most common isolated bacteria (n = 40, 48.1%). Shifting incidence of culture results was noted, as rates of PA NOE decreased and rates of sterile culture and fungal NOE increased. Duration of complaints and presence of aural discharge at admission were associated with prolonged hospitalization (p = 0.010, p = 0.011, respectively). Advanced age, duration of hospitalization, and rates of readmission were associated with surgery (p = 0.037, p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Duration of complaints and presence of aural discharge may indicate advanced NOE and require longer in-hospital treatment. Elderly patients are at increased risk for conservative treatment failure and are more likely to require surgery. With shifting incidence of pathogens, a wider empirical treatment covering nontraditional pathogens should be considered.","['Peled C', 'El-Seid S', 'Bahat-Dinur A', 'Tzvi-Ran LR', 'Kraus M', 'Kaplan D']",2019,40,1,Otol Neurotol,"Peled C, et al.

30211103,Role of Electronystagmography in Diagnosis of Secondary BPPV in Elderly Patients with Vertigo: A Retrospective Study.,"Elderly population is frequently affected by vertigo which affects their mobility and makes them vulnerable to fall and other morbidities. Often these patient visit neurologist and are often subjected to CT scan, MRI brain etc. to rule out a central cause of vertigo; whereas majority of these patients suffer from vestibular cause of vertigo. A schematic approach by detailed history, simple tests for vestibular functions like Dix Hallpike, supine roll and head impulse test give important clue to diagnosis. Often the diagnosis is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) which is treated by repositioning maneuver. There are often other vestibular causes which may be diagnosed by Electronystagmography (ENG), electrocochleography and other tests. This study was undertaken to study occurrence of secondary BPPV utilizing various parameters of ENG. The study group comprised of 131 patients from the neuro-otology proforma data base at ENT centre and vertigo clinic from January 2015 to December 2017. Inclusion criterion was male and female aged 51 years and above presenting with dizziness, imbalance, rotational vertigo, unsteadiness as the chief complaint. Exclusion criterion was BPPV relieved after Epley's maneuver, Otitis externa, acute Otitis media, Suppurative Otitis media, pre existing neurological condition and history of ear surgery. Neuro-otology Data obtained and the ENG findings were tabulated in the master chart and the observations interpreted and transferred to Claussen's butterfly chart. The study group comprised of 58 male (44.27%) and 73 female (55.73%) with a male female ratio of 1:1.25. ENG exhibited 36 patients (27.49) to have recurrent BPPV, 53 (40.45%) were found to have unilateral/bilateral canal paresis.

30197809,Malignant Otitis Externa: A Retrospective Analysis and Treatment Outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze previous treatments and outcomes in patients with malignant otitis externa (MOE) retrospectively. The efficacy of medical and surgical treatments was also evaluated.
METHODS: This study included 25 patients diagnosed with MOE and treated at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Ege University School of Medicine between 2006 and 2017. The duration of hospitalization, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of the patients, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), source of the infection, complications, and previous medical and surgical treatments were also retrospectively assessed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients (7 females and 18 males) was 69.68±11.29 years. The mean length of hospital stay in patients with HbA1c levels ≤6 and in patients with HbA1c levels >6 was 26.86 and 33.39 days, respectively. The mean hospitalization time was significantly longer in patients with HbA1c levels >6 (p<0.05). Additionally, elderly patients (age>65 years) had a significantly longer hospital stay in our study (p<0.05). ESR was found to be 52.76±32.49 (9-108) mm/h at the first examination and 14.92±1.22 (4-32) mm/h at the time of discharge.
CONCLUSION: MOE is an aggressive disease that requires conservative management, and ESR proved to be a good indicator of treatment response.

30170597,"A randomized placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of a terbinafine, florfenicol and betamethasone topical ear formulation in dogs for the treatment of bacterial and/or fungal otitis externa.","BACKGROUND: Treatment of infected otitis externa (OE) relies on the topical application of specific formulations that most often contain an antibiotic, an antifungal and a glucocorticoid. This study is to report the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled field trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of OSURNIA™ (Elanco Animal Health, a division of Eli Lilly and Company, Greenfield, IN), a novel topical ear medication containing florfenicol, terbinafine and betamethasone acetate in an adaptable gel. The study includes 284 dogs with bacterial and/or fungal OE who were randomly assigned to receive two doses of Osurnia or its vehicle, one week apart. Dogs were evaluated at various time points through Day 45, and a total clinical score (TCS) was calculated based on pain, erythema, exudate, swelling, odor and ulceration. The primary outcome measure was the rate of treatment success (RTS), defined as a TCS of 0, 1 or 2 on Day 45. Before and after treatment, a ""clap test"" was performed to subjectively assess hearing, and blood and urine were collected for routine clinical pathology.
RESULTS: The RTS was significantly higher in ears treated with Osurnia (64.78%) than with placebo (43.42%). There was no significant interaction between efficacy and duration of history, recurrence of otitis or body weight. Adverse events were similar between groups. All dogs treated with Osurnia maintained their hearing, and there were no relevant clinical pathology changes.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of two doses of Osurnia, one week apart, is effective and safe to treat microbial otitis externa in dogs.","['Forster SL', 'Real T', 'Doucette KP', 'King SB']",2018,14,1,BMC Vet Res,"Forster SL, et al.

30149824,Diagnosis and treatment of necrotising otitis externa and diabetic foot osteomyelitis - similarities and differences.,"OBJECTIVE: Necrotising otitis externa is a severe inflammatory process affecting soft tissue and bone, mostly in diabetic patients. Diabetic patients are also at risk of diabetic foot osteomyelitis, another inflammatory condition involving soft tissue and bone. This review aimed to describe the similarities and differences of these entities in an attempt to further advance the management of necrotising otitis externa.
METHOD: A PubMed search was conducted using the key words 'otitis externa', 'necrotising otitis externa', 'malignant otitis externa', 'osteomyelitis' and 'diabetic foot'.Results and conclusionThe similarities regarding patient population and pathophysiology between necrotising otitis externa and diabetic foot osteomyelitis raise basic questions concerning the effects of long-standing diabetes on the external ear. The concordance between local swabs and bone cultures in diabetic foot osteomyelitis is less than 50 per cent. If this holds true also to necrotising otitis externa, the role of deep tissue cultures should be strongly considered. Similar to diabetic foot osteomyelitis, magnetic resonance imaging should be considered in selected necrotising otitis externa subgroups.","['Peled C', 'Kraus M', 'Kaplan D']",2018,132,9,J Laryngol Otol,"Peled C, et al.

30130476,Genetic relationships and population structure of Malassezia pachydermatis strains isolated from dogs with otitis externa and healthy dogs.,"Malassezia pachydermatis causes infections of the skin and mucous membranes, especially in animals. It is commonly accepted that symptom manifestation depends on the physiological status of the host (different metabolic, hormonal, and immunological disorders). However, it should be considered whether distinct strains of M. pachydermatis could have different pathogenic potential and maintain opposite relations with the host, such as commensalism or parasitism. The scope of this study was to explore the population structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of M. pachydermatis strains isolated from dogs with clinical symptoms of otitis externa and from healthy dogs in order to investigate their relationships and evolutionary history. For all tests, a group of 30 strains derived from dogs with otitis externa and 34 strains from healthy dogs were used. The level of genetic diversity was initially assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR), whereas evolutionary history was assessed by comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer ITS1 region of nuclear rDNA. RAPD-PCR fingerprinting revealed a high level of genetic polymorphism in both tested groups (85% of unique profiles), but clinical isolates usually grouped together with other strains from otitis externa cases. Sequencing analysis identified 17 distinct genotypes with 59 polymorphic sites within both populations; however, putatively virulent strains were more closely related, indicating a probable correlation between the genotype and the virulence potential. Therefore, the hypothesis that M. pachydermatis virulence depends solely on the host's properties should be reconsidered including evolutionary and epidemiological data.","['Czyzewska U', 'Bartoszewicz M', 'Siemieniuk M', 'Tylicki A']",2018,110,4,Mycologia,"Czyzewska U, et al.

30124617,Use of Systemic Antibiotics for Acute Otitis Externa: Impact of a Clinical Practice Guideline.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of systemic antibiotic use among patients with acute otitis externa (AOE), as well as the impact of an AOE clinical practice guideline publication in 2006.
STUDY DESIGN: Interrupted time series study of retrospective data.
SETTING: Medicaid billing data from 29 states between 2002 and 2010.
PATIENTS: Patients with age less than 65 years, continuous Medicaid eligibility for 12 months before AOE diagnosis, and dispensation of antibiotics within 1 day before through 3 days after AOE diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of AOE visits that received systemic antibiotics among all AOE visits that were dispensed any antibiotics, systemic or topical.
RESULTS: We found 682,865 AOE visits that received systemic or topical antibiotics for AOE. The proportion of systemic antibiotic therapy either with or without topical therapy was 43.1% before and 38.3% after AOE guideline publication. There was no significant immediate drop (-0.01; 95%CI, -0.031-0.011) or change in trend (0.002; 95%CI, -0.001-0.004) in the prevalence of systemic antibiotic therapy after guideline publication.
CONCLUSION: Publication of an AOE clinical guideline did not lead to a decline in systemic antibiotic therapy as initial AOE treatment.

30109742,Comparison of two ear cytological collection techniques in dogs with otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Canine otitis externa is a common disease. Cytological evaluation of otic exudate is a useful diagnostic test to direct and monitor treatment for otitis externa. One method of collecting ear cytological specimens utilizes a cotton-tipped swab inserted into the vertical ear canal. A proposed alternative method is to aspirate exudate from the deep horizontal canal using a rubber tube.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To compare cytological findings between two different collection techniques by evaluating the numbers of bacteria, Malassezia yeast and inflammatory cells.
ANIMALS: Thirty client-owned dogs with otitis externa.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prospective, randomized, blinded comparison study. Ear canals from each dog were sampled using cotton swab and rubber tube. Ear cytological preparations were evaluated independently by two investigators for polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN), monocytes/lymphocytes, macrophages, yeast, intracellular (IC) cocci, extracellular (EC) cocci, IC bacilli and EC bacilli.
RESULTS: A paired Student's t-test was used to compare the two techniques. The inter-investigator reliability for PMN, EC bacilli and yeast was good, and for EC cocci was moderate. There were significantly higher numbers of PMNs obtained by the tube method (P = 0.0024) than by the cotton swab method. There were no statistically significant differences between cotton swab and rubber tube methods for monocytes/lymphocytes (P = 0.7780), macrophages (P = 0.1751), EC cocci (P = 0.1262), EC bacilli (P = 0.1162), yeast (P = 0.5371), IC cocci (P = 0.6606) or IC bacilli (P = 0.6761). The technique was well tolerated.

30088292,Analysis of the otic mycobiota in dogs with otitis externa compared to healthy individuals.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is a common multifactorial disease with a prevalence in dogs as high as 10-20%. In humans, the diversity of the cutaneous mycobiota appears to increase in diseased states, whereas one canine study identified a decrease in diversity of the cutaneous mycobiota in atopic dogs compared to healthy individuals.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To describe the otic mycobiota in dogs with otitis externa compared to healthy dogs.
ANIMALS: Samples were collected from six dogs with clinical and cytological evidence of otitis externa and five clinically normal dogs.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Swabs were collected from the ears of six dogs with fungal otitis externa. DNA from each sample was isolated and Illumina sequencing was performed targeting the internal transcribed spacer region. Sequences were processed using the bioinformatics software MOTHUR.
RESULTS: Fungi from ten different phyla were identified. The mycobiota of all affected ears was dominated by the genera Malassezia, which accounted for 55.7-98.4% of sequences (median 96.8%). Affected ears had significantly decreased observed richness, estimated richness and inverse Simpson's diversity index compared to controls (P = 0.008). Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis identified 42 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were differentially abundant (P < 0.05). Three OTUs were over-represented in the affected ears, including M. pachydermatis, whereas 39 OTUs were over-represented in healthy ears.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced fungal richness and diversity was present in affected ears, with markedly higher relative abundances of Malassezia. The otic fungal mycobiota is much more complex than has been identified with culture-based studies.","['Korbelik J', 'Singh A', 'Rousseau J', 'Weese JS']",2018,29,5,Vet Dermatol,"Korbelik J, et al.

30084115,Ear canal microbiota - a comparison between healthy dogs and atopic dogs without clinical signs of otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: The canine skin microbiota has been evaluated using relatively new microbiological techniques; studies have shown a difference in the composition of bacterial populations between healthy dogs and those with canine atopic dermatitis (cAD). However, little has been reported concerning the ear canal microbiota despite the fact that otitis externa is a common problem in dogs with cAD.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The study evaluated the ear canal microbiota of healthy dogs and atopic dogs without clinical signs of otitis.
ANIMALS: Nine healthy privately owned dogs and 11 dogs with a diagnosis of cAD.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ear swabs from the two groups were used for global bacterial DNA extraction. V1-V3 hypervariable 16S rDNA amplicon libraries were prepared for each sample and sequenced with MiSeq Illumina sequence (V3 kit). Taxonomical assignment and clustering were performed with Mothur using SILVA database.
RESULTS: The ear canal microbiota showed changes in diversity similar to those reported for canine skin and seemed to be stable during the period of the study (28 days). Evidence of dysbiosis was observed in the atopic dogs, with increased abundance of Staphylococcus spp. and Ralstonia spp. (P < 0.05). Escherichia spp. also were found to be more abundant in healthy dogs.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study demonstrated a shift in bacterial populations between allergic and healthy dogs. The observed results in the ear canal are similar to those reported on the skin and could explain the propensity of allergic dogs to develop bacterial otitis.","['Ngo J', 'Taminiau B', 'Fall PA', 'Daube G', 'Fontaine J']",2018,29,5,Vet Dermatol,"Ngo J, et al.

30080680,Characterisation of Staphylococcus felis isolated from cats using whole genome sequencing.,"This study used phenotypic tests and whole genome sequencing to characterise a collection of 37 clinical Staphylococcus felis isolates from cats. Samples were isolated from a range of diseases including feline lower urinary tract disease (n = 15), otitis externa (n = 13), and ocular disease (n = 2). Isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF MS and by BLASTn analysis of S. felis-specific 16S rRNA, rpoB and nuc genes in whole genome sequence-based contigs. Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance was determined using disk diffusion and broth microdilution. Coagulase activity was assessed using feline and rabbit plasma. Genomes were screened for putative virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes using the sequences of known genes from other staphylococci as homologous references. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using single nucleotide polymorphisms. One isolate was coagulase-positive when tested with feline plasma but all isolates were rabbit plasma coagulase-negative. No genetic determinant of coagulase activity was identified in this isolate. A range of putative virulence genes were found amongst isolates including genes associated with adhesion, toxin production and immune evasion. Ninety two percent of isolates were fully susceptible to all antimicrobials tested, which was reflected by a general absence of resistance genes. Clustering within the phylogenetic tree suggested a multiclonal population structure; this clustering did not correlate with disease syndrome or geographic origin of the isolate. Future studies of veterinary staphylococci will benefit from the publicly available S. felis draft genomes that were generated in this study.","['Worthing K', 'Pang S', 'Trott DJ', 'Abraham S', 'Coombs GW', 'Jordan D', 'McIntyre L', 'Davies MR', 'Norris J']",2018,222,,Vet Microbiol,"Worthing K, et al.

30017076,In vitro antimicrobial activity of monensin against common clinical isolates associated with canine otitis externa.,"Antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship are of ever-increasing importance in veterinary medicine. Multidrug-resistant infections of the canine skin and ear continue to emerge, but the use of antibiotic classes of critical importance to human medicine may not represent good antimicrobial stewardship. Repurposing of old drugs that are not used in human medicine is one approach that addresses both these issues. In this study, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of monensin for 111 bacterial and yeast canine otitis isolates was determined using microdilution methodology according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Monensin was effective against all Gram-positive bacteria including the multidrug-resistant staphylococcal strains with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 μg/ml, but lacked antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria and yeast isolates. Monensin has potential to be incorporated as one of the main components in an otic formulation.","['Chan WY', 'Hickey EE', 'Khazandi M', 'Page SW', 'Trott DJ', 'Hill PB']",2018,57,,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Chan WY, et al.

30013835,Major medical causes by breed and life stage for dogs presented at veterinary clinics in the Republic of Korea: a survey of electronic medical records.,"BACKGROUND: Age and breed are considered the greatest risk factors for disease prevalence and mortality in companion dogs. Understanding the prevalence of diseases, in relation to age and breed, would support appropriate guidance for future health care strategies and provide useful information for the early diagnosis of diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the major medical causes for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics in the Republic of Korea, stratified by age and breed.
METHODS: A total of 15,531 medical records of canine patients were analyzed from 11 veterinary clinics who shared data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. An electronic medical record (EMR) system was used for data collection, which included the animal identification number, age, breed, gender, neuter status, clinical information, and diagnosis. EMR data were classified using the International Classification of Disease system from the World Health Organization; presenting signs or diagnoses were identified according to breed and life stage.
RESULTS: Within the age groups, preventive medicine (16.7% confidence intervals (CI) [15.9-17.5]) was the most common cause for clinic visits for the <1 year and 1-3 year groups. Additionally, neutering surgery (6.6% CI [6.0-7.1]) and patella luxation (1.4% CI [1.8-2.7]) were frequently performed in these age groups. In the 4-6 year group, otitis externa (8.8% CI [7.8-10.0]) and dermatitis or eczema (8.5% CI [7.5-9.6]) were common medical problems. In older dogs (>10 year), the prevalences of heart disease, kidney disease, Cushing's disease, and mammary tumors were higher than in the other age groups. Small and toy breed dogs comprised 67.7% of all dogs in this analysis. For all breeds, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, and diarrhea were common medical problems.
DISCUSSION: This study identified the most common medical disorders and differences in prevalences of diseases, according to age and breeds. The information from EMRs for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics can provide background knowledge that is required to enable a better understanding of disease patterns and occurrence by age and breeds. The information from this study could enable the creation of strategies for preventing diseases and enable the identification of health problems for more effective disease management in companion dogs.","['Kim E', 'Choe C', 'Yoo JG', 'Oh SI', 'Jung Y', 'Cho A', 'Kim S', 'Do YJ']",2018,6,,PeerJ,"Kim E, et al.

29985376,[The treatment of the patients suffering from acute bacterial external otitis with the use of intravenous blood illumination by low-intensity laser radiation at a wavelength of 445 nm].,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic reactions to the pharmaceutical products and the development of antibiotic resistance limit the provision of the high-quality medical care to the patients presenting with acute bacterial external otitis media (ABEO).
AIM: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment of the patients suffering from ABEO with the application of the new technique based on intravenous blood illumination by low-intensity laser radiation at a wavelength of 445 nm (ILBI-445).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This open comparative clinical study was carried out from April 2017 till June 2017 and included the patients with ABEO who were divided into two groups. The patients of the main group underwent the standard treatment in the combination with low-intensity laser radiation at a wavelength of 445 nm. Those comprising the control group were given the conventional treatment alone. The end point of the study was the complete disappearance of local inflammatory signs in the region of the external auditory canal (EAC) and auricle, the restoration of the volume of the EAC, the absence of complaints estimated based on the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the complete disappearance of symptoms of intoxication. The local signs of inflammation in the region of the EAC and auricle were assessed from the otoscopic picture. The measurement of the volume of the external auditory canal were carried out by filling it with a furacilin solution at a temperature of 36
RESULTS: The combined treatment of the patients with ABEO using ILBI-445 resulted in their earlier recovery in comparison with that achieved by means of the standard therapy. The differences were especially pronounced on the 5th day of treatment. Complaints of pain and the loss of hearing were documented only in the patients of the control group. Itching was a significantly less serious trouble in the patients of the main group than it was in those comprising the control group. The volume of the external auditory canal in the patients of the main group on the 5
CONCLUSIONS: The high therapeutic effectiveness and simplicity of the approach employed in the present study taken together with a minimum of contraindications for its application give reason to recommend intravenous blood illumination by low-intensity laser radiation at a wavelength of 445 nm for the treatment of the patients suffering from acute bacterial external otitis.","['Mosikhin SB', 'Bezbryazov AV', 'Moskvin SV']",2018,95,3,Vopr Kurortol Fizioter Lech Fiz Kult,"Mosikhin SB, et al.

The disease is common and shows a seasonal variation with a greater incidence in warmer months. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in otitis externa and in this retrospective study, we show a corresponding seasonal variation in the proportional incidence of P. aeruginosa isolates from otitis externa in South East England. In total 7770 patients were diagnosed with otitis externa over a period of 9 years from January 2008 to December 2016. P. aeruginosa was isolated from 2802 patients (proportional incidence of 36%). Incidence was higher in the months of August, September and October and in patients between 5 and 15 years of age. We postulate a combination of increased contact with water during warm weather in the holiday season and increased rainfall in the preceding season as a putative mechanism for the seasonal trends.","['Villedieu A', 'Papesh E', 'Weinberg SE', 'Teare L', 'Radhakrishnan J', 'Elamin WF']",2018,146,14,Epidemiol Infect,"Villedieu A, et al.

29962250,Malignant Otitis Externa Outcomes: A Study of the University HealthSystem Consortium Database.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize factors that affect outcomes for patients with malignant otitis externa (MOE).
METHODS: Retrospective review of inpatients with MOE was performed. Patient demographics, comorbid conditions, complications, procedures, and mortalities were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 786 patients with MOE were identified. The mean hospitalization length of stay (LOS) was 18.6 days (SD = 19.7). The overall mortality rate was 2.5% (n = 20), and complication rate was 4.3% (n = 34). Increasing age significantly and positively correlated with the incidence of MOE (r = 0.979, P < .0001). Factors that were associated with an increased rate of mortality were sepsis (odds ratio [OR] = 18.5; ES = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.47-1.42), congestive heart failure (OR = 3.1; ES = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.02-0.82), weight loss (OR = 10.2; ES = 1.23; 95% CI, 0.61-1.85), and coagulopathy (OR = 8.8; ES = 1.84; 95% CI, 0.91-2.77). Surgical intervention was performed in 19.2% (n = 151) of patients.

29921359,Aviation Fuel Exposure Resulting in Otitis Externa with Vertigo.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa secondary to irritant or chemical exposure is well documented; however, specifically secondary to jet fuel exposure and its associated toxicology is not. Over 2 million military and civilian personnel per year are occupationally exposed to aviation fuels.
CASE REPORT: An aircraft maintainer presented with noninfectious acute otitis externa secondary to external ear canal exposure to JP-5 jet fuel. Proper exposure guidelines were followed, but it was not realized that the external ear canal was involved. The first symptoms to emerge were vertigo, dizziness, and disequilibrium; however, on physical exam it appeared that there was no middle ear involvement.
DISCUSSION: Otitis externa normally does not present with vestibular symptoms as the pathology affects the external ear canal dermal tissue. Upon review of JP-5's toxicology profile, dermal absorption is a route of entry and can cause general neurological symptoms, including loss of coordination. This case highlights potential deficiencies in the standardized safety data sheets that are used after exposure. Without mention of possible auricular exposure one may focus on the logical protection of the eyes, mouth, and visible skin. This is concerning due to potential delayed exposure symptoms, dermal absorption, high level of dermal destruction, and the close proximity to the sensory system. The goal of this case report is to improve the knowledge of providers caring for personnel who may be exposed and to suggest possible revisions to the Safety Data Sheets for jet fuel.Long RJ, Charles RA.

29895341,Comparison of clinical outcomes of three different packing materials in the treatment of severe acute otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical outcomes of biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam versus ribbon gauze and ear wick in the treatment of severe acute otitis externa.
METHODS: Ninety-two adults with severe acute otitis externa were randomly assigned to groups receiving ear wick (n = 28), ribbon gauze (n = 34) or biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam (n = 30). Clinical efficacy, in terms of otalgia, oedema, erythema and tenderness of the external auditory canal, was assessed before packing was applied and at follow up on the 3rd and 7th days of presentation.
RESULTS: All packing materials were associated with improved otalgia and oedema on the 3rd day; however, there were significant differences between biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam and the other packing materials, and there was no significant reduction in tenderness in the biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam group on the 3rd day. In the ribbon gauze and ear wick groups, improvements in all clinical efficacy scores were statistically significant for all pairwise comparisons.
CONCLUSION: The three packing materials were all quite effective in treating severe acute otitis externa, but ear wick and ribbon gauze were superior to biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam for relieving signs and symptoms, especially on the 3rd day.","['Demir D', 'Yılmaz MS', 'Güven M', 'Kara A', 'Elden H', 'Erkorkmaz Ü']",2018,132,6,J Laryngol Otol,"Demir D, et al.

29891017,An alternative approach to mixed hearing loss in otosclerosis: stapes surgery combined with an active middle-ear implant.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a novel management strategy for mixed hearing loss in advanced otosclerosis.
METHODS: A 50-year-old male was referred to St Thomas' Hearing Implant Centre with otosclerosis; he was no longer able to wear conventional hearing aids because of recurrent otitis externa. The patient underwent short process incus vibroplasty (using the Med-El Vibrant Soundbridge device), followed at a suitable interval (six weeks) by stapes surgery. The main outcome measures were: pure tone audiometry, functional gain and monosyllabic word recognition scores.
RESULTS: Post-operative pure tone audiometry showed a reduction of the mean air-bone gap from 55 dB HL to 20 dB HL. The residual mixed hearing loss was rehabilitated with the Vibrant Soundbridge, with an average device gain of 32 dB. The monosyllabic word recognition scores in quiet at 65 dB improved from 37 to 100 per cent when using the Vibrant Soundbridge at six months after switch-on of the device.
CONCLUSION: Stapedotomy in conjunction with incus short process vibroplasty (i.e. inner-ear vibroplasty) is a safe and promising procedure for managing advanced otosclerosis with mixed hearing loss in selected patients.","['Powell HRF', 'Pai I', 'Ghulam H', 'Jiang D']",2018,132,5,J Laryngol Otol,"Powell HRF, et al.

METHODS: A retrospective case study was conducted of patients suffering from external auditory canal cholesteatoma and benign necrotising otitis externa admitted to tertiary hospitals, in the Capital Region of Denmark, over a five-year period.
RESULTS: Eighty-three patients (95 ears) with external auditory canal cholesteatoma or benign necrotising otitis externa were identified. A minimum incidence rate of 0.97 per 100 000 inhabitants per year was demonstrated. Sixty-eight per cent of cases had a history of smoking. Most lesions (74 per cent) were localised in the floor of the ear canal. Treatment time was 3.2 months for patients who had surgery and 6.0 months for those who received conservative treatment.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that external auditory canal cholesteatoma and benign necrotising otitis externa are in fact the same disease, and therefore the diagnosis of external auditory canal cholesteatoma should be changed to benign necrotising otitis externa. Microangiopathy has a leading role in the aetiology. Surgery should be conducted in most cases.","['Hertz J', 'Siim C']",2018,132,6,J Laryngol Otol,Hertz J and Siim C.

29851309,Description of a new approach for great auricular and auriculotemporal nerve blocks: A cadaveric study in foxes and dogs.,"Otitis externa is a painful condition that may require surgical intervention in dogs. A balanced analgesia protocol should combine systemic analgesic agents and local anaesthesia techniques. The aim of the study was to find anatomical landmarks for the great auricular and the auriculotemporal nerves that transmit nociceptive information from the ear pinna and to develop the optimal technique for a nerve block. The study consisted of two phases. In phase I, one fox cadaver was used for dissection and anatomical localization of the auricular nerves to derive landmarks for needle insertion. Eight fox cadavers were subsequently used to evaluate the accuracy of the technique by injecting methylene blue bilaterally. In phase II findings from phase I were applied in four Beagle canine cadavers. A block was deemed successful if more than 0.6 cm of the nerve's length was stained. Successful great auricular nerve block was achieved by inserting the needle superficially along the wing of the atlas with the needle pointing towards the jugular groove. For the auriculotemporal nerve block the needle was inserted perpendicular to the skin at the caudal lateral border of the zygomatic arch, close to the temporal process. The overall success rate was 24 out of 24 (100%) and 22 out of 24 (91%) for the great auricular and the auriculotemporal nerves, respectively, while the facial nerve was stained on three occasions. Our results suggest that it is feasible to achieve a block of the auricular nerves, based on anatomical landmarks, without concurrently affecting the facial nerve.","['Stathopoulou TR', 'Pinelas R', 'Haar GT', 'Cornelis I', 'Viscasillas J']",2018,4,2,Vet Med Sci,"Stathopoulou TR, et al.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 68-year-old man with diabetes, who had been diagnosed as intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma of the right mandible, underwent surgical resection. He received a total of 60 Gy/30Fr postoperative radiation. Four months after the course of radiation, he suffered from right aural fullness, otalgia and otorrhea.
DIAGNOSES: Clinical examination revealed granulation and existence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the external auditory canal. Computed tomography showed expansive inflammation and erosion in the temporal bone. The patient is elderly and diabetes. These findings led to the diagnosis of malignant external otitis.
INTERVENTIONS: The ear irrigation and administration of quinolones were started. Afterwards, fistula was formed in the oral cavity, and connected to the right external auditory canal. Therefore, irrigations were performed not only from ear but also from the oral fistula.
OUTCOMES: Eight weeks after starting treatment, the malignant external otitis was completely healed.
LESSONS: Physicians should raise awareness of malignant external otitis in immunosuppressed patients with oral cancer after radiotherapy.","['Eguchi T', 'Basugi A', 'Kanai I', 'Miyata Y', 'Nasuno T', 'Hamada Y']",2018,97,21,Medicine (Baltimore),"Eguchi T, et al.

29788991,"Bilateral tympanokeratomas (cholesteatomas) with bilateral otitis media, unilateral otitis interna and acoustic neuritis in a dog.","BACKGROUND: An aural cholesteatoma, more appropriately named tympanokeratoma, is an epidermoid cyst of the middle ear described in several species, including dogs, humans and Mongolian gerbils. The cyst lining consists of stratified, keratinizing squamous epithelium with central accumulation of a keratin debris. This case report describes vestibular ganglioneuritis and perineuritis in a dog with chronic otitis, bilateral tympanokeratomas and presumed extension of otic infection to the central nervous system.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-year-old intact male Dalmatian dog with chronic bilateral otitis externa and sudden development of symptoms of vestibular disease was examined. Due to the dog's old age the owner opted for euthanasia without any further examination or treatment and the dog was submitted for necropsy. Transection of the ears revealed grey soft material in the external ear canals and pearly white, dry material consistent with keratin in the tympanic bullae bilaterally. The brain and meninges were grossly unremarkable. Microscopical findings included bilateral otitis externa and media, unilateral otitis interna, ganglioneuritis and perineuritis of the spiral ganglion of the vestibulocochlear nerve and multifocal to coalescing, purulent meningitis. A keratinizing squamous epithelial layer continuous with the external acoustic meatus lined the middle ear compartments, consistent with bilateral tympanokeratomas. Focal bony erosion of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and squamous epithelium and Gram-positive bacterial cocci were evident in the left cochlea. The findings suggest that meningitis developed secondary to erosion of the temporal bone and ganglioneuritis and/or perineuritis of the vestibulocochlear nerve.
CONCLUSIONS: Middle ear tympanokeratoma is an important and potentially life-threatening otic condition in the dog. Once a tympanokeratoma has developed expansion of the cyst can lead to erosion of bone and extension of otic infection to the inner ear, vestibulocochlear ganglion and nerve potentially leading to bacterial infection of the central nervous system.","['Østevik L', 'Rudlang K', 'Holt Jahr T', 'Valheim M', 'Njaa BL']",2018,60,1,Acta Vet Scand,"Østevik L, et al.

29771872,"Outbreaks Associated with Treated Recreational Water - United States, 2000-2014.","Outbreaks associated with exposure to treated recreational water can be caused by pathogens or chemicals in venues such as pools, hot tubs/spas, and interactive water play venues (i.e., water playgrounds). During 2000-2014, public health officials from 46 states and Puerto Rico reported 493 outbreaks associated with treated recreational water. These outbreaks resulted in at least 27,219 cases and eight deaths. Among the 363 outbreaks with a confirmed infectious etiology, 212 (58%) were caused by Cryptosporidium (which causes predominantly gastrointestinal illness), 57 (16%) by Legionella (which causes Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia, and Pontiac fever, a milder illness with flu-like symptoms), and 47 (13%) by Pseudomonas (which causes folliculitis [""hot tub rash""] and otitis externa [""swimmers' ear""]). Investigations of the 363 outbreaks identified 24,453 cases; 21,766 (89%) were caused by Cryptosporidium, 920 (4%) by Pseudomonas, and 624 (3%) by Legionella. At least six of the eight reported deaths occurred in persons affected by outbreaks caused by Legionella. Hotels were the leading setting, associated with 157 (32%) of the 493 outbreaks. Overall, the outbreaks had a bimodal temporal distribution: 275 (56%) outbreaks started during June-August and 46 (9%) in March.

29750111,Demography and disorders of the French Bulldog population under primary veterinary care in the UK in 2013.,"BACKGROUND: Despite its Gallic name, the French Bulldog is a breed of both British and French origin that was first recognised by The Kennel Club in 1906. The French Bulldog has demonstrated recent rapid rises in Kennel Club registrations and is now (2017) the second most commonly registered pedigree breed in the UK. However, the breed has been reported to be predisposed to several disorders including ocular, respiratory, neurological and dermatological problems. The VetCompass™ Programme collates de-identified clinical data from primary-care veterinary practices in the UK for epidemiological research. Using VetCompass™ clinical data, this study aimed to characterise the demography and common disorders of the general population of French Bulldogs under veterinary care in the UK.
RESULTS: French Bulldogs comprised 2228 (0.49%) of 445,557 study dogs under veterinary care during 2013. Annual proportional birth rates showed that the proportional ownership of French Bulldog puppies rose steeply from 0.02% of the annual birth cohort attending VetCompass™ practices in 2003 to 1.46% in 2013. The median age of the French Bulldogs overall was 1.3 years (IQR 0.6-2.5, range 0.0-13.0). The most common colours of French Bulldogs were brindle (solid or main) (32.36%) and fawn (solid or main) (29.9%). Of the 2228 French Bulldogs under veterinary care during 2013, 1612 (72.4%) had at least one disorder recorded. The most prevalent fine-level precision disorders recorded were otitis externa (14.0%, 95% CI: 12.6-15.5), diarrhoea (7.5%, 95% CI: 6.4-8.7), conjunctivitis (3.2%, 95% CI: 2.5-4.0), nails overlong (3.1%, 95% CI% 2.4-3.9) and skin fold dermatitis (3.0%, 95% CI% 2.3-3.8). The most prevalent disorder groups were cutaneous (17.9%, 95% CI: 16.3-19.6), enteropathy (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.2-18.3), aural (16.3%, 95% CI: 14.8-17.9), upper respiratory tract (12.7%, 95% CI: 11.3-14.1) and ophthalmological (10.5%, 95% CI: 9.3-11.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Ownership of French Bulldogs in the UK is rising steeply. This means that the disorder profiles reported in this study reflect a current young UK population and are likely to shift as this cohort ages. Otitis externa, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis were the most common disorders in French Bulldogs. Identification of health priorities based on VetCompass™ data can support evidence-based reforms to improve health and welfare within the breed.","[""O'Neill DG"", 'Baral L', 'Church DB', 'Brodbelt DC', 'Packer RMA']",2018,5,,Canine Genet Epidemiol,"O'Neill DG, et al.

29738387,Imaging in the Diagnosis and Management of Necrotizing Otitis Externa: A Survey of Practice Patterns.,"OBJECTIVE: To survey neurotologists and head and neck radiologists regarding use of imaging in the diagnosis and management of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE).
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study.
SETTING: Online survey distributed through email to specialty society membership lists.
PARTICIPANTS: Neurotologists and head and neck radiologists with membership in either the American Neurotology Society or The American Society of Head and Neck Radiology.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Responses to survey consisting of two demographic and seven clinically oriented questions related to the use of imaging in the diagnosis and management of NOE.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six participants responded to the survey. The imaging modality of choice in establishing the diagnosis of NOE selected by the respondents was computed tomography (CT) (37.5%) followed by technetium scintigraphy (21.3%). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was the preferred investigation by 41.9% of participants for determining extent of disease. Gallium scanning was the imaging modality preferred by 32.4% of respondents for determining when to cease medical therapy. Ninety-five percent of participants responded that CT scans were always or frequently used in the diagnosis and management of NOE compared with 72.8% for MRI, 34.5% for gallium scans, and 34.2% for technetium scans.
CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity in the preferred imaging modalities used in the diagnosis and management of NOE. CT and MRI are the preferred contemporary modalities used by many physicians, demonstrating a shift away from the historic use of nuclear medicine scans.","['Cooper T', 'Hildrew D', 'McAfee JS', 'McCall AA', 'Branstetter BF', 'Hirsch BE']",2018,39,5,Otol Neurotol,"Cooper T, et al.

29673769,Successful treatment of a recurrent Aspergillus niger otomycosis with local application of voriconazole.,"Fungal otitis (otomycosis) is a common infection encountered by otolaryngologists. Nevertheless, its management can be challenging because of its high recurrence rate and of the limited therapeutic options. A 45-year-old woman suffered from recurrent otomycosis. The ineffectiveness of successive antibiotic cures and repeated topical treatments with nystatin and then with econazole cream led to perform microbiological analyses. Culture of ear swab grew Aspergillus niger. The use of a 1% voriconazole sterile solution previously validated for treatment of eye infections was considered after ensuring the absence of known ototoxic effects of the antifungal and of the excipients. The patient was advised to apply locally this voriconazole solution daily for 14 days (3 drops, 3-4 times a day). Full recovery was obtained at the end of the treatment, and no relevant side effects were noticed. More than one year after completion of therapy, there was no recurrence. Our observation shows that voriconazole 1% solution is an interesting option for treating otomycosis which failed to respond to usual therapeutic options. Further prospective studies are now warranted to confirm these findings.","['Chappe M', 'Vrignaud S', 'de Gentile L', 'Legrand G', 'Lagarce F', 'Le Govic Y']",2018,28,2,J Mycol Med,"Chappe M, et al.

29659020,Surgical management of chronic otitis secondary to craniomandibular osteopathy in three West Highland white terriers.,"Three West Highland white terriers were presented for investigation of left-sided para-aural abscessation. CT revealed chronic otitis media with extensive osseous proliferation surrounding the horizontal and vertical ear canals contiguous with the expanded temporal bone, consistent with a unilateral variant of craniomandibular osteopathy. A left total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy was performed in all dogs. An ultrasonic bone curette (Sonopet; Stryker) proved useful when removing the osseous proliferation in two dogs. Histopathological examination of the ear canals was consistent with craniomandibular osteopathy and the treatment led to resolution of the presenting clinical signs in all dogs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of craniomandibular osteopathy engulfing the external ear canal, presumably leading to chronic otitis media and para-aural abscess formation. This is also the first reported use of an ultrasonic bone curette in canine otic surgery.","['Beever L', 'Swinbourne F', 'Priestnall SL', 'Ter Haar G', 'Brockman DJ']",2019,60,4,J Small Anim Pract,"Beever L, et al.

29557264,Opioids and the Otolaryngologist: An Ambulatory Assessment.,"Objectives To recognize current opioid prescription patterns in otolaryngology and determine changes in rates of outpatient opioid prescribing over time. Study Design Cross-sectional analysis of national survey database. Setting Ambulatory care settings in the United States. Subjects and Methods The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2006 to 2013 was analyzed for outpatient otolaryngology visits. The rate of opioid medication prescribing was determined with patient and visit characteristics associated with an opioid prescription, including corresponding diagnoses. Calendar trends for the rate of opioid prescribing were determined and compared biennially. Results Among 19.2 ± 1.7 million otolaryngology visits annually (raw N = 11,905), there were 728,000 ± 96,000 visits with an opioid prescription (3.8% ± 0.4%). Adults were more likely than children to receive a narcotic (4.3% vs 1.9%, P < .001); there was no significant difference according to sex (3.9% female vs 3.7% male, P = .567). With respect to calendar trend, the opioid prescription rate increased significantly from 2.3% in 2006-2007 to 4.6% in 2008-2011 and then decreased to 3.5% in 2012-2013 ( P < .031). The most common visit diagnosis categories associated with opioid prescribing were as follows: postoperative care (19.7% of prescriptions), adenotonsillitis (13.9%), chronic otitis media (8.7%), otitis externa (6.2%), and nasal obstruction (5.6%). Conclusion Despite the opioid epidemic in the United States, only a small portion of otolaryngology visits were associated with opioid prescription. However, given the significant increase in prescribing from 2008 to 2011, continued surveillance of prescribing patterns is warranted.","['Mohan S', 'Bhattacharyya N']",2018,159,1,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Mohan S and Bhattacharyya N.

29529928,In Vitro Susceptibility of Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to Ototopical Therapy.,"Objective Despite the rising incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) otologic infections, choice of treatment remains controversial. Only fluoroquinolone-containing ototopical preparations are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for middle ear application. Furthermore, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation guidelines advocate ototopical monotherapy for both tympanostomy tube otorrhea and acute otitis externa. Unfortunately, MRSA may be ciprofloxacin resistant. This causes confusion regarding antibiotic selection, because susceptibility profiles reflect a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), referenced against systemic, not ototopical, drug delivery dosing. The goal of this study is to determine the ciprofloxacin MIC for ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates from otologic infections and compare that value to the expected drug concentration achieved by fluoroquinolone ear drops and determine MRSA genotype for each isolate. Study Design In vitro assay with retrospective medical record review. Setting Tertiary care university hospital. Subjects and Methods Thirty otologically sourced ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates collected from adult and pediatric patients. MICs were calculated by broth dilution method. Isolates underwent multilocus sequence typing and polymerase chain reaction for arcA and Panton-Valentine leukocidin to establish the genotype. Results MICs ranged from 16 to 1025 µg/mL. There was a relationship between MIC and genotype; of the 7 isolates with an MIC value greater than 512 µg/mL, 6 were sequence type (ST)8. Conclusion These findings support the practice of ototopical monotherapy for patients with uncomplicated ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA otitis externa. However, they raise concern that ototopical therapy may not be adequate to treat highly resistant strains of MRSA infecting the middle ear space.","['Walker DD', 'David MZ', 'Catalano D', 'Daum R', 'Gluth MB']",2018,158,5,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Walker DD, et al.

Despite this, few studies have investigated the microbiology and antimicrobial resistance of otitis externa. This study aimed to examine these issues.
METHODS: Analysis identified 302 swabs taken from 217 patients (100 male, 117 female), between 1 January 2015 and 30 March 2016, at our rapid access otolaryngology clinic.
RESULTS: In total, 315 organisms were isolated; the most frequent was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1 per cent), followed by candida species (22.9 per cent) and Staphylococcus aureus (11.7 per cent). P aeruginosa was sensitive to ciprofloxacin in 97.7 per cent of cases and to gentamicin in 78.4 per cent.
CONCLUSION: Compared with studies worldwide, the relative proportions of different organisms causing otitis externa and the patterns of antimicrobial resistance differ. Increasing resistance of P aeruginosa to aminoglycosides demonstrates a changing pattern of antimicrobial resistance that has not been previously reported. Reassuringly, quinolone antibiotics remain highly effective when treating P aeruginosa.","['Heward E', 'Cullen M', 'Hobson J']",2018,132,4,J Laryngol Otol,"Heward E, et al.

29397464,Recognizing intraventricular silicone.,"Retinal detachment with subsequent silicone oil retinopexy is not uncommon. A known complication of silicone retinopexy is intraventricular migration of the intraocular silicone oil. While the oil itself does not result in direct pathology, misdiagnosis may lead to an unnecessary diagnostic workup and possibly predispose the patient to surgery intervention. Silicone oil typically appears hyperdense on computer tomography (CT) and hyperintense on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR). These imaging findings may mimic a mass or blood products. However, MR imaging of silicone results in chemical shift artifact which should help narrow the imaging differential. We present a patient with incidental CT and MRI findings which resulted in a prolonged hospital course following misidentification of intraventricular silicone oil. Although the imaging differential for an intraventricular lesion may include metastasis, lymphoma, hemorrhage, choroid plexus papilloma/carcinoma, meningioma, subependymoma, and ependymoma, secondary imaging findings should be noted to ensure an accurate diagnosis. In patients with evidence of prior silicone retinopexy, visualization of an intraventricular lesion with associated chemical shift artifact should raise the possibility of intraventricular silicone oil migration.","['Mayl JJ', 'Flores MA', 'Stelzer JW', 'Liu B', 'Messina SA', 'Murray JV']",2018,25,2,Emerg Radiol,"Mayl JJ, et al.

29365233,Ear Pain: Diagnosing Common and Uncommon Causes.,"Otalgia (ear pain) is a common presentation in the primary care setting with many diverse causes. Pain that originates from the ear is called primary otalgia, and the most common causes are otitis media and otitis externa. Examination of the ear usually reveals abnormal findings in patients with primary otalgia. Pain that originates outside the ear is called secondary otalgia, and the etiology can be difficult to establish because of the complex innervation of the ear. The most common causes of secondary otalgia include temporomandibular joint syndrome and dental infections. Primary otalgia is more common in children, whereas secondary otalgia is more common in adults. History and physical examination usually lead to the underlying cause; however, if the diagnosis is not immediately clear, a trial of symptomatic treatment, imaging studies, and consultation may be reasonable options. Otalgia may be the only presenting symptom in several serious conditions, such as temporal arteritis and malignant neoplasms. When risk factors for malignancy are present (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, age 50 years or older), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or otolaryngology consultation may be warranted.","['Earwood JS', 'Rogers TS', 'Rathjen NA']",2018,97,1,Am Fam Physician,"Earwood JS, et al.

Re-purposing of old drugs that are not used in human medicine is one approach that addresses the emergence of multidrug resistance in canine skin and ear infections, and can reduce the use of critically important human antibiotic classes.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the antimicrobial activity of narasin, a polyether ionophore conventionally used as a rumen modifier and anticoccidial agent in production animals, against common clinical isolates of canine otitis externa (OE).
ANIMALS/ISOLATES: Clinical isolates (n = 110) from canine OE were tested, including 17 meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MSSP), 13 multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MDRSP), and 20 each of β-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Malassezia pachydermatis.
METHODS: Bacterial and yeast isolates were subcultured, suspended in broth and inoculated into 96-well plates. Organisms were tested against concentrations of narasin ranging from 0.03 to 128 μg/mL. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined after overnight incubation.
RESULTS: Narasin MICs for staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.25 μg/mL; MIC
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Narasin was effective against Gram-positive bacteria and had antifungal activity at higher concentrations against M. pachydermatis. However, the lack of Gram-negative activity would prevent its use as a sole antimicrobial agent in cases of canine OE.","['Chan WY', 'Hickey EE', 'Khazandi M', 'Page SW', 'Trott DJ', 'Hill PB']",2018,29,2,Vet Dermatol,"Chan WY, et al.

29360092,Management of Necrotizing Otitis Externa: Our Experience with Forty-Three Patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the introduction of a dedicated management protocol of necrotizing otitis externa patients with joint care between otorhinolaryngology and infectious diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of case notes and the otorhinolaryngology department database of all adults admitted with necrotizing otitis externa at our teaching hospital over a 5-year period. The patients were split into two groups (first group of 10 patients prior to the introduction of the dedicated management protocol, and a second group of 33 patients managed after the introduction of this protocol).
RESULTS: Of the 43 patients included in the study, diabetes mellitus was present in 83.7%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown in 67.4% of patients. All 43 patients underwent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (with contrast) scans. Surgical intervention was undertaken in 25.6% of patients. Mean follow-up was 10 months (SD, ±7 months). Of the 43 patients, 79.1% made a full recovery and were discharged. Relapse occurred in 9.3% of patients. One patient died because of a myocardial infarction 4 months after treatment. The mean length of stay was significantly lower after the protocol was introduced (25.6±5.3 vs. 14.2±3.8 days, p=0.001), and the duration of treatment was also significantly lower after the protocol (21.2±6.8 vs. 14.3±4.3 weeks, p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: The introduction of a dedicated management protocol and joint care with otorhinolaryngology and infectious diseases resulted in improved care and decreased length of stay in patients. Early diagnosis and involvement with the relevant teams as well as prompt intervention are the key factors that reduce morbidity and mortality.","['Sharma S', 'Corrah T', 'Singh A']",2017,13,3,J Int Adv Otol,"Sharma S, et al.

29322531,A study to evaluate the primary causes associated with Pseudomonas otitis in 60 dogs.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the primary causes, age of onset and time from diagnosis of otitis to development of Pseudomonas otitis in each case.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from clinical records of 60 dogs were extracted to address the study objectives. Pseudomonas otitis was diagnosed by clinical signs and positive culture.
RESULTS: In total, 57 purebred dogs and three crossbreed dogs were included: 32 dogs had unilateral and 28 bilateral disease. Underlying primary causes of otitis were allergy (42), masses (8), endocrine disease (7) and autoimmune disease (3). The mean age of onset of otitis (and subsequent time to development of Pseudomonas otitis) in dogs with allergic otitis was 40 months (28 months), with endocrine disease was 56 months (19 months) and masses 99 months (10 months).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The most common primary causes of otitis in dogs with Pseudomonas infections are, in decreasing frequency: allergies, masses, endocrine disease and autoimmune disease. Secondary infections with Pseudomonas developed more quickly if there was a mass or autoimmune disease, as compared with allergies and endocrinopathies.","['Paterson S', 'Matyskiewicz W']",2018,59,4,J Small Anim Pract,Paterson S and Matyskiewicz W.

The external auditory canal exostoses are multiple, benign bony growths. They can cause external auditory canal stenosis, leading to repeated otitis externa and potentially conductive hearing loss. It is vital to consider this entity in susceptible patients who report hearing loss, as timely intervention such as proper ear protection equipment can lower the risk of developing severe external auditory canal exostoses. We present a case of a 42-year-old male, cold water surfer with conductive hearing loss and bilateral external auditory canal (EAC) stenosis demonstrated on the computed tomography.","['Barbon DA', 'Hegde R', 'Li S', 'Abdelbaki A', 'Bajaj D']",2017,9,10,Cureus,"Barbon DA, et al.

29292129,Smelling Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections using a whole-cell biosensor - An alternative for the gold-standard culturing assay.,"Improved easy-to-use diagnostic tools for infections are in strong demand worldwide. Yet, despite dramatic advances in diagnostic technologies, the gold-standard remains culturing. Here we offer an alternative tool demonstrating that a bacterial biosensor can efficiently detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients suffering from otitis externa. Detection was based on specific binding between the biosensor and 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA), a volatile produced by P. aeruginosa in high amounts. We collected pus samples from ears of 26 subjects exhibiting symptoms of otitis externa. Detection of P. aeruginosa using the biosensor was compared to detection using gold-standard culturing assay and to gas-chromatograph-mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of 2-AA. The biosensor strain test matched the culture assay in 24 samples (92%) and the GC-MS analyses in 25 samples (96%). With this result in hand, we designed a device containing a whole-cell luminescent biosensor combined with a photo-multiplier tube. This device allowed detection of 2-AA at levels as low as 2 nmol, on par with detection level of GC-MS. The results of the described study demonstrate that the volatile 2-AA serves as an effective biomarker for P. aeruginosa in ear infections, and that activation of the biosensor strain by 2-AA provides a unique opportunity to design an easy-to-use device that can specifically detect P. aeruginosa infections.","['Kviatkovski I', 'Shushan S', 'Oron Y', 'Frumin I', 'Amir D', 'Secundo L', 'Livne E', 'Weissbrod A', 'Sobel N', 'Helman Y']",2018,267,,J Biotechnol,"Kviatkovski I, et al.

29283096,The Role of Topical Thymoquinone in the Treatment of Acute Otitis Externa; an Experimental Study in Rats.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this experimental study was to compare the dose-related effect of topical thymoquinone (TQ) with other topical agents used in the management of acute otitis externa (AOE) in a rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into six groups each with eight rats per group. Group I was the control group with no external otitis, whereas external otitis were created in the other five groups (study groups). Dexamethasone, 0.1% TQ, 0.4% TQ, ciprofloxacin, and 0.9% saline (NaCl) drops was applied once daily in Groups II-VI, respectively. The treatment was administered regularly for 10 days. Pathologic and microbiologic evaluation were performed. Pathologically, the thicknesses of the stroma and the epithelium in the external auditory canal (EAC) were measured using an occulometer. Edema in the stroma, density of inflammatory cells and blood vessels, presence of fibroblasts, and changes in collagen fibers in the EAC were evaluated in five different areas to obtain the area of highest concentration and classified into four grades (0=no change, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).
RESULTS: The higher concentration of TQ (0.4%) was more effective than dexamethasone and 0.1% TQ with respect to antibacterial and the anti-inflammatory properties.
CONCLUSION: TQ, particularly at a concentration of 0.4%, may be considered for topical application alone in the treatment of AOE, without any requirement for a combined treatment.","['Demirel H', 'Arlı C', 'Özgür T', 'İnci M', 'Dokuyucu R']",2018,14,2,J Int Adv Otol,"Demirel H, et al.

29235932,"Retrospective study of the presentation, diagnosis and management of 16 cats with otitis media not due to nasopharyngeal polyp.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse retrospectively cats diagnosed with otitis media (OM) not due to nasopharyngeal polyp, and to review the clinical outcome with surgical and medical management.
METHODS: Patient records were searched for cats diagnosed with OM. The diagnosis of OM was based on the presence of clinical signs, including neurological signs, respiratory signs and signs of otitis externa, and on the basis of evidence of thickened or irregular bullae walls, or the presence of fluid within the tympanic cavity in those that had diagnostic imaging. In those that did not have imaging, the diagnosis was made on the basis of the presence of fluid in the bulla or organisms cultured using myringotomy. These records were analysed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Of 16 cats, one had a total ear canal ablation, five had ventral bulla osteotomy surgery and 11 were medically managed. Of the cats that were medically managed, using either topical products, systemic antimicrobials or a combination of both, eight had complete resolution of clinical signs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This small cohort shows that some cats with OM can be successfully managed medically. Surgery is invasive and may not necessarily be required if appropriate medical management is undertaken. This is the first study of OM treatment in cats and provides the basis for further studies, which should aim to establish specific infectious causes of OM and how they can potentially be managed with medical therapies.","['Swales N', 'Foster A', 'Barnard N']",2018,20,12,J Feline Med Surg,"Swales N, et al.

This study aimed to characterise the demography and common disorders of Border Terriers receiving veterinary care in England using de-identified electronic patient record data within the VetCompass™ Programme.
RESULTS: Annual birth proportion for Border Terriers showed a decreasing trend from 1.46% in 2005 to 0.78% in 2014. The median adult bodyweight for males (10.9 kg, IQR: 9.6-12.3, range: 6.3-25.0) was higher than for females (9.1 kg, IQR: 8.2-10.3, range: 5.2-21.6) (
CONCLUSIONS: This study documented a trend towards reducing ownership and relatively long-livedness in the Border Terrier. The most common disorders were periodontal disease, overweight/obesity and otitis externa. Predisposition to dental and neurological disease was suggested.

29207743,Comparison of Microbiological Flora in the External Auditory Canal of Normal Ear and an Ear with Acute Otitis Externa.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute Otitis Externa (AOE) is also known as swimmer's ear. Investigations initiated during World War II firmly established the role of bacteria in the aetiology of Acute Otitis Externa.
AIM: To culture the microbiological flora of the normal ear and compare it with the flora causing AOE and to know the role of normal ear canal flora and anaerobes in the aetiology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on 64 patients clinically diagnosed with unilateral AOE. Ear swabs were taken from both the ears. Microbiological flora was studied considering diseased ear as test ear and the normal ear as the control. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were done. Severity of the disease was assessed by subjective and objective scores. Effect of topical treatment with ichthammol glycerine pack was assessed after 48 hours and scores were calculated again. Patients with scores < 4 after pack removal were started on systemic antibiotics and were assessed after seven days of antibiotics course. Data was analysed using Paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Chi-square test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%) was the most common bacteria cultured from the ear followed by Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (18%). Patients with anaerobic organism in the test ear had severe symptoms and needed systemic antibiotic therapy.
CONCLUSION: Most of the cases may respond to empirical antibiotic therapy. In cases with severe symptoms and the ones refractory to empirical treatment, a culture from the ear canal will not be a tax on the patient. This helps in giving a better understanding about the disease, causative organisms and helps in avoiding the use of inappropriate antibiotics that usually result in developing resistant strains of bacteria.","['Ghanpur AD', 'Nayak DR', 'Chawla K', 'Shashidhar V', 'Singh R']",2017,11,9,J Clin Diagn Res,"Ghanpur AD, et al.

It typically tends to affect patients who are immunocompromised or diabetic. To date, there is very little in the literature about necrotising otitis externa in the immunocompetent patient population.
CASE REPORTS: The present paper discusses both the clinical and radiological findings in three cases of necrotising otitis externa in an immunocompetent patient cohort. The common factor among all three patients was their advanced age.
CONCLUSION: Diagnosing necrotising otitis externa can be challenging because of the potentially non-specific symptoms and the absence of early radiological signs, particularly if patients are neither immunocompromised nor diabetic. Elderly patients should be considered in the same light as immunocompromised and diabetic patients in the context of necrotising otitis externa.","['Unadkat S', 'Kanzara T', 'Watters G']",2018,132,1,J Laryngol Otol,"Unadkat S, et al.

29152746,Referral patterns from emergency department to otolaryngology clinic.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with various otolaryngologic disorders are frequently referred to an otolaryngologist for follow-up care. Our aim was to further characterize this group as it has not been well described in the literature.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective study.
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of patients seen during an 18-month period in an urban public hospital trauma center adult ED and referred to an otolaryngology clinic for follow-up care.
RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-eight patients were seen and referred; the most common diagnoses made by ED providers were peripheral vertigo (12%), otitis externa (8%), and nasal fractures (8%). Nine percent of patients were evaluated during their ED visit by an otolaryngology provider. Three hundred seventy-two (50%) patients returned for their otolaryngology clinic visit; facial trauma patients were least likely to return. The most common diagnoses made by otolaryngology providers were otitis externa (12%), peripheral vertigo (12%), and nasal fractures (7%). There was 50% concordance between patients' diagnoses made by ED and otolaryngology providers. The most common differences were otitis media versus otitis externa (10%) and acute pharyngitis versus laryngopharyngeal reflux (8%). During 37% of follow-up visits, an in-office procedure was performed, most commonly flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, cerumen removal, and nasal endoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis reports comprehensive characteristics of this referral group, identifying potential areas for improvement in patient management, resident education and efficiency. Otolaryngologists covering EDs should be familiar with this population in terms of types of cases that may affect their practices.

29103693,Clonal distribution of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from skin infection of dogs in Korea.,"Bacterial infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) is challenging in a small animal practice. Zoonotic transmission may occur. The aim of this study was to investigate the genotypic profiles of MRSP isolated from bacterial infections of canine skin in Korea and to compare their molecular lineages with dominant strains from other countries. Sixty MRSP isolates were obtained from the lesions of canine pyoderma and otitis externa. Their genetic diversity was assessed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing and direct-repeat unit (dru) typing. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements were characterized by multiplex PCR. Thirty-nine different sequence types (STs) were detected. Among them, 21 STs were identified as internationally new sequence types. Fourteen dru types (dts) were detected, and the major types were dt11a and dt11y. spa typing characterised 21 isolates (35%, 21/60), including spa types t02 (n=8), t05 (n=5), t06 (n=6), and t15 (n=2). Two clonal complexes, CC568 and CC677, were revealed by MLST; this result differed from the dominant STs detected in MRSP isolates from Europe, North America, and other Asian countries. SCCmec type V was the major type (27/60. 45%), and 30 (50%) isolates were non-typeable by conventional classifying method. This is the first report about the clonal lineage of MRSP isolated from Korea. MRSP isolated from dogs in Korea displays independent lineage from other countries. Surveillance is needed to confirm cross-national disseminating patterns.","['Kang JH', 'Chung TH', 'Hwang CY']",2017,210,,Vet Microbiol,"Kang JH, et al.

29098132,Mycotic Pseudoaneurysm Associated with Skull Base Osteomyelitis Treated with Endovascular Embolization.,"Pseudoaneurysms occur due to malformations in arterial wall uniformity, leading to blood collection between the outer arterial layers and resultant outpouching of the vessel. Unlike true aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms do not involve all layers of the blood vessel. Mycotic pseudoaneurysms can occur after associated vessel adventitia infection, leading to transmural dissection. Here we present a case of a 78-year-old man with a history of chronic otitis externa and osteomyelitis who presented with increasing right ear pain with bloody discharge and associated headache. Catheter angiography demonstrated a large pseudoaneurysm in the right middle meningeal artery (MMA) at the base of the skull. Based on the clinical findings and the patient's history, the patient was ultimately diagnosed with mycotic pseudoaneurysms of the MMA. The patient was subsequently treated with antibiotics as well as endovascular embolization and recovered without any complications.","['Haider AS', 'Esianor BI', 'Shail MS', 'Engelhardt MI', 'Kafai Golahmadi A', 'Khan R', 'Khan U', 'Vayalumkal S', 'Thakur R', 'Layton KF']",2017,9,8,Cureus,"Haider AS, et al.

Any ""otitis externa"", which does not progress favorably under local treatment, must lead to eliminate a tumoral pathology of the external acoustic meatus or of the middle ear. Any suspicion of cholesteatoma should lead to an ENT consultation to confirm the diagnosis and consider its treatment to limit the auditory dysfunction.

Occlusion of the EAC can be challenging to treat as the area is prone to circumferential scarring.
METHODS: We describe the novel use of serial bipolar radiofrequency ablation (coblation) to treat 3 children with complete EAC occlusion from congenital and acquired conditions including lymphedema (1), microcystic lymphatic malformation (1), and venolymphatic malformation (1).
RESULTS: Patients underwent a mean of 3 procedures with postoperative EAC stenting (7 days) and antibiotic and steroid aural preparations (10 days). Otologic symptoms resolved in all patients, and their EACs remained patent 14 months after last procedure (range, 4-32 months). One patient experienced a pinpoint tympanic membrane perforation that healed spontaneously 2 weeks later.
CONCLUSIONS: Coblation of soft tissue stenosis of the EAC can be an effective treatment for this problematic condition.","['Gu A', 'Bauman NM']",2017,126,12,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,Gu A and Bauman NM.

DESIGN: A retrospective case series at a tertiary care institution.
SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient tertiary care hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: 12 cases of recent MEO were reviewed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was progression of disease. Secondary outcomes were drug resistance and complications of MEO.
RESULTS: Only 4 patients were cured of MEO. Four patients expired during the study period and at least one of these deaths was a direct result of the MEO. 7 patients developed Cranial nerve palsies, and 3 patients developed abscesses.

28994886,Is there a real benefit of hyperbaric oxygenotherapy in the treatment of necrotizing otitis externa?,"INTRODUCTION: Necrotizing otitis externa remains a severe and sometimes life-threatening disease in diabetic patient. Many therapeutic approaches have been described but what about the real benefit of hyperbaric oxygenotherapy in the management of this disease?
METHODS: The authors reported a retrospective study about 42 patients treated for necrotizing external otitis over a period of 9 years (2006 to 2014). The patients were treated either by only antibiotherapy (23 cases) or with both antibiotherapy and hyperbaric oxygenotherapy (19 cases). The evolution under treatment was appreciated in the two groups through clinical, biological and radiological parameters.
RESULTS: The study included 42 diabetic patients with a mean age of 67 years (50 to 84 years). The sex-ratio M/F was 0.82. The diagnosis of necrotizing otitis externa was assessed through clinical and bacteriologic criteria in diabetic patients. A temporal bone CT-scan and a technetium scintigraphy were performed in order to precise the topography of the disease and the level of bone lysis. Antibiotherapy was prescribed intravenously and then orally for a mean period of 8 weeks (5 to 15 weeks). Hyperbaric oxygenotherapy was given for 19 patients (average: 20 sessions). The recovery was affirmed on clinical, biological and radiological features. Otalgia disappeared at the 11th day of treatment without HOT and at the 5th day with HOT. Otorrhea disappeared at the 6th day of treatment by HOT and at the 13th day without HOT. The recovery or the regression of facial palsy occurred in 75% of the cases when HOT was given. The total recovery from the disease was diagnosed in 36 patients (86%). The rate of recovery was 100% in the group treated by HOT and 74% in the group treated by only antibiotics. The recurrence of the disease was noted in 6 patients that haven't benefited from HOT. The end of the oral therapy was guided by the results of the Gallium bone scintigraphy.
CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygenotherapy must be associated in the treatment of necrotizing otitis externa. The results of our study suggest a real benefit of this therapy regarding clinical, biological and radiological parameters of this severe affection.","['Mardassi A', 'Turki S', 'Lahiani R', 'Mbarek H', 'Benzarti S', 'Gharsallah H']",2016,94,12,Tunis Med,"Mardassi A, et al.

28994490,Computed tomographic findings in 205 dogs with clinical signs compatible with middle ear disease: a retrospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is considered to be the reference method to evaluate middle ear structures.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence and severity of CT changes in the middle ear and establish if any specific clinical presentations are associated with otitis media.
ANIMALS: Medical records of animals referred for CT with history and clinical signs consistent with middle ear disease.
METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of CT examinations of tympanic bullae performed over a six year period. Medical records were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs and cytological evaluation of the external ear canal. Dogs were divided into three clinical groups: chronic otitis externa (Group 1), peripheral vestibular disorder (Group 2) and other clinical presentations (Group 3).
RESULTS: Group 1 - Of 214 ears, 87 (40.7%) had CT abnormalities: 38 of 87 (17.7%) had material-filled bullae, 42 of 87 (19.6%) had thickened bullae walls and seven of 87 (3.2%) had lysis of the bulla. Abnormalities were significantly more frequent in dogs with suppurative otitis than in erythemato-ceruminous otitis (57% and 23%, respectively; P = 0.003). Proliferative otitis, particularly in French bulldogs, was associated with severe otitis media. Group 2 - Of the 106 ears, 91 (85.8%) had normal tympanic bullae. Group 3 - Of the 26 ears from deaf dogs, 17 had filled bullae; all nine affected dogs were Cavalier King Charles spaniels. All dogs with Claude Bernard Horner syndrome or head tilt had normal tympanic bullae.

28992722,The treatment of pseudoaneurysms with flow diverters after malignant otitis externa.,"Background We report a case of bilateral malignant otitis externa complicated with bilateral petrous internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms and their successful treatment with a flow diverter. Case report A 68-year-old woman with serious complications of type II diabetes mellitus had malignant otitis externa on the right side. She was treated with combined antibiotic therapy and underwent mastoidectomy for mastoiditis. She presented at our hospital with acute hemorrhage from the right external auditory canal. The emergency computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a multiobulated pseudoaneurysm at the petrous segment of the right internal carotid artery. The pseudoaneurysm was treated with a 5 × 40-mm Surpass flow diverter. Three months later, she developed a malignant external otitis on the left side. As the infection progressed, a left-sided mastoiditis, a brain abscess, and a pseudoaneurysm at the petrous segment of the left internal carotid artery developed. The pseudoaneurysm caused bleeding from the left ear, and was treated with a 5 × 50-mm Surpass flow diverter. No recurrent bleeding was observed. Four months later, a follow-up angiography showed complete occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm on the left side, but a residual aneurysm could be detected on the right side. One year after the first intervention, the follow-up CT and magnetic resonance angiography revealed the complete occlusion of the aneurysms bilaterally. Conclusion The use of a flow diverter appears to be an efficient and safe method to occlude carotid pseudoaneurysms even in an inflammatory milieu.","['Németh T', 'Szakács L', 'Bella Z', 'Majoros V', 'Barzó P', 'Vörös E']",2017,23,6,Interv Neuroradiol,"Németh T, et al.

28969167,Advancing Cholesteatoma Secondary to Acquired Atresia of the External Auditory Canal: Clinical Perspectives.,"Acquired atresia of External Auditory Canal (EAC) is seldom encountered in routine otolaryngology practice. Apart from resulting in moderate-to-severe conductive hearing impairment, it is a potentially dreaded condition which might lead to canal cholesteatoma. Suspected to develop as a consequence of a pre-existing chronic otitis externa/media, the EAC atresia leads to proximal (medial) accumulation of desquamated epithelium and denatured keratin (the canal cholesteatoma) that further leads to aggravation of the chronic otitis, thereby initiating a vicious cycle. The canal cholesteatoma might progress unhindered into the middle ear and mastoid cavity, with its characteristic bone-eroding property, producing complications. A high index of clinical suspicion along with proper imaging are therefore essential to apprehend the disease progression in a patient presenting with an apparently innocuous EAC stenosis/atresia. In this report, we illustrate the clinical details of a young girl with unilateral acquired EAC atresia where canal cholesteatoma had turned extensive, invaded the middle ear cleft, and produced a post-aural fistula, thereby establishing one of the extreme outcomes of chronic otitis.","['Jotdar A', 'Dutta M', 'Kundu S', 'Mukhopadhyay S']",2017,11,8,J Clin Diagn Res,"Jotdar A, et al.

Its exact etiology is not known. The granulations on tympanic membrane also occur in association with other lesions of external auditory canal (EAC) and middle ear. The aims of this study were to know the etiological factors of GM and classify the disease according to its etiological factors and associated disorders of EAC and middle ear. Data were retrieved from the search of four electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google scholar. Relevant articles were also sought by a hand search review of reference books. The databases were searched using the key words otitis externa, external otitis, granular myringitis, granular otitis externa and myringitis. Data were extracted using a pre-defined data-extraction form. The following data were recorded (1) etiological and predisposing conditions; (2) pathological features; (3) associated disorders of external and middle ear. The study proposes the etiological classification of GM. It suggests two major groups: primary and secondary. The primary GM is basically idiopathic and these patients do no have evidences of any other types of otitis media and otitis externa. In the secondary GM the cause is obvious and the patients usually have associated otitis media and/or lesions of external ear canal.

METHODS: Review of literature and cross-sectional weighted analysis of patients under 19 with a diagnosis of LCH from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) and Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) from 2000 to 2013. ICD-9 codes and demographics were analyzed; pairwise comparisons and multivariate analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Only seven cases of cholesteatoma after the treatment for LCH of the temporal bone have been documented in the literature. No significant association between cholesteatoma and LCH was seen (OR 0.747 [0.149-3.751]). Patients with LCH did have a higher incidence of chronic otitis media, chronic otitis externa, chronic sinusitis, hearing loss, and otitis media with effusion.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that patients with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis do not appear to have a higher risk of developing cholesteatoma.

28770095,Demography and disorders of German Shepherd Dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) has been widely used for a variety of working roles. However, concerns for the health and welfare of the GSD have been widely aired and there is evidence that breed numbers are now in decline in the UK. Accurate demographic and disorder data could assist with breeding and clinical prioritisation. The VetCompass
RESULTS: GSDs dropped from 3.5% of the annual birth cohort in 2005 to 2.2% in 2013. The median longevity of GSDs was 10.3 years (IQR 8.0-12.1, range 0.2-17.0). The most common causes of death were musculoskeletal disorder (16.3%) and inability to stand (14.9%). The most prevalent disorders recorded were otitis externa (
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that GSDs have been reducing in numbers in the UK in recent years. The most frequent disorders in GSDs were otitis externa, osteoarthritis, diarrhoea, overweight/obesity and aggression, whilst the most common causes of death were musculoskeletal disorders and inability to stand. Aggression was more prevalent in males than in females. These results may assist veterinarians to offer evidence-based advice at a breed level and help to identify priorities for GSD health that can improve the breed's health and welfare.","[""O'Neill DG"", 'Coulson NR', 'Church DB', 'Brodbelt DC']",2017,4,,Canine Genet Epidemiol,"O'Neill DG, et al.

28764159,Otomycosis in a Rural Community Attending a Tertiary Care Hospital: Assessment of Risk Factors and Identification of Fungal and Bacterial Agents.,"INTRODUCTION: Otomycosis is one of the frequently encountered fungal infections of external auditory canal, commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Various host (local, systemic) and environmental factors can predispose a person to otomycosis. Although clinical presentations along with otoscopic findings of the patients are well suggestive of fungal infection, proper identification of causative agents is mandatory in order to prevent recurrences and complications.
AIM: To define the aetiology of clinically diagnosed otomycosis in rural population, to derive association of risk factors with otomycosis, to isolate and identify fungal and bacterial agents and to analyze the association between them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology and Department of Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT), SGT hospital over eight months period. A total of 350 consecutive patients of more than five years of age with clinical diagnosis of otomycosis were included in the study. Demographic profile, predisposing factors, presenting complaints and clinical findings of clinically diagnosed patients were evaluated and analyzed. Samples were collected, transported and evaluated by both direct examination and culture method for bacteriological and mycological examination.
RESULTS: Male to female ratio in study participants was 1.3:1. Mycological examination yielded 346 fungal isolates in 310 samples from a total of 350 clinically diagnosed cases of otomycosis. Self cleaning, instillation of mustard oil and use of ear drops appeared to be common predisposing factors in otomycosis. Significant association was observed between these practices and otomycosis. Aspergillus species was the predominant fungi followed by 
CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the highest isolation of Aspergillus complex in cases of clinically diagnosed otomycosis in a rural community with higher practice of self cleaning and using home remedies and eardrops to get relief from sensation of blocked ear and itching.","['Agarwal P', 'Devi LS']",2017,11,6,J Clin Diagn Res,Agarwal P and Devi LS.

28740928,Magnetic resonance imaging guided reirradiation of recurrent and second primary head and neck cancer.,"PURPOSE: To report a single-institutional experience using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy for the reirradiation of recurrent and second cancers of the head and neck.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 2014 and August 2016, 13 consecutive patients with recurrent or new primary cancers of the head and neck that occurred in a previously irradiated field were prospectively enrolled in an institutional registry trial to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of MRI guided radiation therapy using a 0.35-T MRI scanner with a cobalt-60 radiation therapy source called the ViewRay system (ViewRay Inc., Cleveland, OH). Eligibility criteria included biopsy-proven evidence of recurrent or new primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, measurable disease, and previous radiation to >60 Gy. MRI guided reirradiation was delivered either using intensity modulated radiation therapy with conventional fractionation to a median dose of 66 Gy or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) using 7 to 8 Gy fractions on nonconsecutive days to a median dose of 40 Gy. Two patients (17%) received concurrent chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The 1- and 2-year estimates of in-field control were 72% and 72%, respectively. A total of 227 daily MRI scans were obtained to guide reirradiation. The 2-year estimates of overall survival and progression-free survival were 53% and 59%, respectively. There were no treatment-related fatalities or hospitalizations. Complications included skin desquamation, odynophagia, otitis externa, keratitis and/or conjunctivitis, and 1 case of aspiration pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings show that reirradiation with MRI guided radiation therapy results in effective disease control with relatively low morbidity for patients with recurrent and second primary cancers of the head and neck. The superior soft tissue resolution of the MRI scans that were used for planning and delivery has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio.","['Chen AM', 'Cao M', 'Hsu S', 'Lamb J', 'Mikaeilian A', 'Yang Y', 'Agazaryan N', 'Low DA', 'Steinberg ML']",2017,2,2,Adv Radiat Oncol,"Chen AM, et al.

Our objective was to investigate the clinical effect and in vitro antibacterial potential of medical honey eardrops as treatment of eczematous external otitis. In a prospective study, 15 patients diagnosed with recurrent eczematous external otitis were treated with medical honey eardrops for 2 weeks. The following clinical outcomes were evaluated: visual analog scale of ear complaints, score of eczema, and eradication of bacterial infection. Furthermore, the antibacterial effect of honey eardrops against different bacterial strains was tested in vitro. Treatment resulted in less discomfort and itching and decreased signs of eczema, with high patient satisfaction and without adverse reactions. Honey eardrops showed a strong in vitro inhibitory activity against all tested strains but did not eradicate Staphylococcus aureus infection in vivo. The results of this preliminary study indicate a possible role of honey eardrops in eczematous ear disease.","['Henatsch D', 'Nabuurs CH', 'van de Goor RM', 'Wolffs PF', 'Stokroos RJ']",2017,157,4,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Henatsch D, et al.

28693628,Optimising the use of otowicks in otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: Otowicks are used to treat otitis externa with significant ear canal oedema. This study investigates how well drops penetrate through to reach the deep canal and whether it is safe to leave otowicks in the canal for more than 2 days.
METHODS: Sterile otowicks were inserted into mock ear canals and vertically over pseudomonas-seeded agar plates whilst gentamicin or ciprofloxacin drops were administered. The time taken for drops to penetrate through the otowick was recorded. Separately, pseudomonas-seeded otowicks were treated with saline or antibacterial drops. The penetrating drops were observed for bacterial growth on sterile agar.
RESULTS: It took six drops before penetration occurred for both antibiotics. When sterile saline drops were applied to bacterially contaminated otowicks, the penetrating drops displayed bacterial growth on agar, indicating that pseudomonas penetrated through the otowick. However, when antibiotic drops were applied, penetrating drops showed no bacterial growth on the corresponding agar plate.
CONCLUSION: Bacteria can penetrate otowicks but this is prevented by continuous application of antibacterial ear drops. Ear wicks need priming with six drops before starting a regimen, so that the initial dose is fully absorbed.","['Bola S', 'Rashid M', 'Hickey S']",2017,131,9,J Laryngol Otol,"Bola S, et al.

We documented annual numbers of deaths in the United States associated with these infections using a combination of death certificate data, nationally representative hospital discharge data, and disease-specific surveillance systems (2003-2009). We documented 6,939 annual total deaths associated with the 13 infections; of these, 493 (7%) were caused by seven pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route. A total of 6,301 deaths (91%) were associated with infections from Pseudomonas, NTM, and Legionella, environmental pathogens that grow in water system biofilms. Biofilm-associated pathogens can cause illness following inhalation of aerosols or contact with contaminated water.

28597128,The MO-meatocanalplasty: a modification of the M-meatoplasty to address the superior quadrants and the bony canal.,"The meatoplasty of the external auditory canal is a frequently performed otologic procedure in recurrent otitis externa, eczema or frequent accumulation of cerumen due to a narrow meatus of the external ear canal. Numerous surgical techniques have been described. The M-meatoplasty described by Mirck for addressing the external meatus is widely used. However, this technique does not sufficiently enlarge the external ear canal in all cases. Specifically in patients where the ear canal narrowing is most prominent in the postero- and/or anterosuperior quadrants of the lateral meatus the technique needs some modifications. In these cases, an oblique conversion of the M-meatoplasty, the MO-meatocanalplasty, is useful. In cases where the bony canal is also narrow this modification allows for a bony canalplasty while avoiding a retro-auricular approach. The MO-meatocanalplasty can be used in combination with myringoplasty and tympanoplasty.","['van Dinther J', 'Zarowski A', 'Somers T', 'Offeciers E']",2017,274,9,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"van Dinther J, et al.

28594048,[In vivo-efficacy of an ear medication using gelatin powder as a vehicle for the therapy of canine otitis externa].,"OBJECTIVE: Otitis externa is normally treated with daily topical medication. Longer application intervals may be useful to facilitate therapy. In this study, the in vivo efficacy of a gel preparation containing marbofloxacin, dexamethasone and enilconazole was compared to that of a commercial otologic agent containing marbofloxacin, dexamethasone and clotrimazole based on clinical signs, ear cytology and bacterial/fungal cultures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A gel preparation (group A) or a registered otologic agent (group B), respectively, was applied to 41 dogs. A total of 50 ears (25 per group) were analysed. The gel preparation was administered on days 0 and 5; the combination preparation was administered daily according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Dogs were reevaluated clinically and cytologically after 5 and 10 days. Initially and after 10 days, ear swabs were taken for bacterial and fungal cultures.
RESULTS: No significant clinical or cytological differences were found between the groups. Significantly more isolates resistant to marbofloxacin were identified in group A after 10 days, although >98% of marbofloxacin was still detectable in vitro after 15 days.
CONCLUSION: The clinical and cytological efficacy of a gel containing defined active agents applied twice 5 days apart was comparable to that of an authorised otologic agent applied once daily. There appears to be an increased risk with the gel in that a resistance to fluoroquinolones develops. Local adverse effects are also possible.

With the growing recognition of the need for improved antimicrobial stewardship, there is urgent need for more detailed understanding of the patterns of antimicrobial use in this sector.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate antimicrobial use for medical and surgical conditions in dogs and cats by Australian veterinarians.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed over 4 months in 2011. Respondents were asked about their choices of antimicrobials for empirical therapy of diseases in dogs and cats, duration of therapy, and selection based on culture and susceptibility testing, for common conditions framed as case scenarios: 11 medical, 2 surgical, and 8 dermatological.
RESULTS: A total of 892 of the 1,029 members of the Australian veterinary profession that completed the survey satisfied the selection criteria. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was more common for acute conditions (76%) than chronic conditions (24%). Overall, the most common antimicrobial classes were potentiated aminopenicillins (36%), fluoroquinolones (15%), first- and second-generation cephalosporins (14%), and tetracyclines (11%). Third-generation cephalosporins were more frequently used in cats (16%) compared to dogs (2%). Agreement with Australasian Infectious Disease Advisory Panel (AIDAP) guidelines (generated subsequently) was variable ranging from 0 to 69% between conditions.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Choice of antimicrobials by Australian veterinary practitioners was generally appropriate, with relatively low use of drugs of high importance, except for the empirical use of fluoroquinolones in dogs, particularly for otitis externa and 3rd-generation cephalosporins in cats. Future surveys will determine whether introduction of the 2013 AIDAP therapeutic guidelines has influenced prescribing habits.","['Hardefeldt LY', 'Holloway S', 'Trott DJ', 'Shipstone M', 'Barrs VR', 'Malik R', 'Burrows M', 'Armstrong S', 'Browning GF', 'Stevenson M']",2017,31,4,J Vet Intern Med,"Hardefeldt LY, et al.

Bilateral otomycosis is, however, rarely reported. In a case of bilateral otitis externa in a 56-year-old male patient in Taiwan, direct microscopic examination of the cerumen as well as isolation of strains indicated the presence of two Aspergillus species being different in each of both ears. The species were identified by DNA sequence comparisons and additional morphological confirmation of diagnostic characteristics as Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus terreus.

28491450,Contribution of oral triamcinolone to treating proliferative and necrotising otitis externa in a 14-year-old Persian cat.,"CASE SUMMARY: A 14-year-old female spayed cat was referred for recurrent otitis externa and unusual proliferative lesions in both ear canals. The affected pinnae and external ear canals were covered with large reddish-to-dark-brown verrucous and necrotic tissue. Friable material and exudates occluded both ear canals. Proliferative lesions developed in both ears 2-3 weeks before referral. The histopathological diagnosis from two biopsies obtained from the friable materials with endoscopic biopsy forceps was proliferative and necrotising otitis externa (PNOE). Treatment was initiated with once-daily application of a potent topical glucocorticoid (mometasone furoate) to both ears. Although the auricle and vertical ear canals responded well, no improvement was seen in the horizontal part of the ear canal after 9 weeks. Therefore, oral triamcinolone (0.9 mg/kg q24h) was added for 1 week, and was then tapered (q48h) for 3 weeks. Most lesions resolved, and after a further 2 weeks of prednisolone (2 mg/kg q48h) there was complete resolution. No recurrence was observed during a 2 year follow-up period.
RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: PNOE commonly occurs in kittens, but it can develop in older cats. To our knowledge, the PNOE in this case is the oldest age of onset reported. This condition is rare and was only described recently, and therapeutic options appear limited. According to previously published reports, steroid therapy is ineffective, and tacrolimus is the only treatment known to achieve resolution. However, oral and topical glucocorticoids were beneficial in this case.","['Momota Y', 'Yasuda J', 'Arai N', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yoshimura H', 'Ikezawa M', 'Suzuki S', 'Takahashi K', 'Sako T']",2017,3,1,JFMS Open Rep,"Momota Y, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MR examinations of 26 patients diagnosed with SBOM between January 1996 and January 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Comparison was also made with the MR images of 22 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed advanced T3 and T4 NPC between July 2011 and August 2012. Imaging features in both conditions were compared, including the presence of a nasopharyngeal bulge, nasopharyngeal mucosal irregularity, lateral extension, architectural distortion (or lack thereof), increased T2 signal and enhancement patterns.
RESULTS: The most prevalent findings in SBOM were lateral extension, increased T2 signal in adjacent soft tissues, lack of architectural distortion and enhancement greater than or equal to mucosa. The combination of these 4 findings was found to best differentiate SBOM from advanced NPC, and found to be statistically significant (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: We suggest that the combination of lateral extension, increased T2 signal, lack of architectural distortion and enhancement greater than or equal to mucosa is helpful in differentiating SBOM from advanced NPC.","['Goh JPN', 'Karandikar A', 'Loke SC', 'Tan TY']",2017,38,4,Am J Otolaryngol,"Goh JPN, et al.

This study aimed to identify what is thought about ENT knowledge amongst non-ENT doctors, and the key topics that the curriculum should focus on.
METHODS: Doctors were interviewed about their views of ENT knowledge amongst non-ENT doctors, and asked to identify key topics. These topics were then used to devise a questionnaire, which was distributed to multiple stakeholders in order to identify the key topics.
RESULTS: ENT knowledge was generally thought to be poor amongst doctors, and it was recommended that undergraduate ENT topics be kept simple. The highest rated topics were: clinical examination; when to refer; acute otitis media; common emergencies; tonsillitis and quinsy; management of ENT problems by non-ENT doctors; stridor and stertor; otitis externa; and otitis media with effusion.
CONCLUSION: This study identified a number of key ENT topics, and will help to inform future development of ENT curricula.","['Constable JD', 'Moghul GA', 'Leighton P', 'Schofield SJ', 'Daniel M']",2017,131,7,J Laryngol Otol,"Constable JD, et al.

28375041,Prevalence of external ear disorders in Belgian stray cats.,"Objectives Feline otitis externa is a multifactorial dermatological disorder about which very little is known. The objective of this study was to map the prevalence of external ear canal disorders and the pathogens causing otitis externa in stray cats roaming around the region of Ghent, Belgium. Methods One hundred and thirty stray cats were randomly selected during a local trap-neuter-return programme. All cats were European Shorthairs. This study included clinical, otoscopic and cytological evaluation of both external ears of each cat. Prospective data used as parameters in this study included the sex, age and body condition score of each cat, as well as the presence of nasal and/or ocular discharge, and the results of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) Snap tests. Results Remarkably, very few (sub)clinical problems of the external ear canal were found in the stray cat population. Malassezia species was by far the most common organism found in the external ear canals of the 130 stray cats. A total of 96/130 (74%) cats were found to have Malassezia species organisms present in one or both ears based on the cytological examination. No correlation was found between the parameters of sex, age, body condition score, the presence of nasal and/or ocular discharge and FIV and FeLV status, and the presence of parasites, bacteria or yeasts. Conclusions and relevance This study provides more information about the normal state of the external ear canal of stray cats. The ears of most stray cats are relatively healthy. The presence of Malassezia species organisms in the external ear canal is not rare among stray cats.","['Bollez A', 'de Rooster H', 'Furcas A', 'Vandenabeele S']",2018,20,2,J Feline Med Surg,"Bollez A, et al.

28357818,Otitis externa in military divers: more frequent and less harmful than reported.,"INTRODUCTION: Although otitis externa (OE) is a common disease, data related to (military) divers are limited. This study aimed to determine the incidence of OE in military divers during their initial training. We also wished to consider seasonal influences on incidence and whether early detection increases completion of the diving course.
METHODS: From January 2011 to October 2016 the Royal Netherlands Navy Diving School trained 189 divers. Up to December 2015 we used the training records for the analyses. From January 2016 onward all divers were prospectively screened. Pearson's chi-squared 2 and Fisher's exact tests were used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: In the 162 included divers, 30 cases of OE were identified. The incidence in 2016 was significantly higher than in 2011-2015 (17/35 (49%) versus 13/127 (10%), P < 0.001). Almost all cases developed after three weeks of diving. No influence of season was found (P = 0.354). Early diagnosis and treatment of OE does not seem to affect completion of diving courses (P = 0.28). Only in three cases did a diver have to discontinue the course due to OE.
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that OE is more frequent among military divers than earlier reported, most likely caused by prolonged water exposure. Diving activities can often be continued with standard topical treatment.","['Wingelaar TT', 'van Ooij PA', 'van Hulst RA']",2017,47,1,Diving Hyperb Med,"Wingelaar TT, et al.

28301961,Current management of necrotising otitis externa in the UK: survey of 221 UK otolaryngologists.,"INTRODUCTION: Necrotising otitis externa (NOE) is a rare infection causing skull base osteomyelitis. The evidence regarding NOE consists mostly of case series. Hence, there is a limited evidence base to guide decision-making. This survey aims to report the experience of 221 otolaryngologists in this condition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Internet survey administered to the membership of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (ENT UK).
RESULTS: Respondents' detailed replies on diagnosis, treatment and follow up are presented. One third of respondents reported increasing incidence of NOE. Over 80% diagnosed NOE based on pre-existing risk factors, severe pain, non-resolution of infection and CT scan. Most respondents managed NOE with intravenous antibiotics (90%) and blood sugar control (82%). There was less agreement in certain aspects of management including the role of surgery and the nature and duration of follow up.
CONCLUSIONS: Our survey provides a picture of NOE management in the UK. While there is consensus in some aspects of NOE management, other aspects attract widely differing answers. This may reflect the lack of strong evidence in the literature. Future work should aim to address this.","['Chawdhary G', 'Pankhania M', 'Douglas S', 'Bottrill I']",2017,137,8,Acta Otolaryngol,"Chawdhary G, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate otic treatment administered by a veterinarian on quality of life (QoL) of dogs with otitis externa and their owners, and on clinical and cytology parameters of otitis; compared to an owner-administered treatment.
ANIMALS: Fifty client-owned dogs randomly randomized into two groups and treated for 2 weeks.
METHODS: Veterinarians treated Group A dogs with a veterinary licensed otic gel on two occasions at a 1 week interval; owners treated Group B dogs once daily with a veterinary licensed otic drop based product along with twice weekly cleaning. Veterinarians evaluated otitis with the OTI-3 scale and semi-quantitative cytological examination on days 0, 7, 14 and 28. At each visit, owners assessed QoL with a validated questionnaire and pruritus with a Visual Analog Scale. Scores before and after treatment of each group, and differences between groups were analysed statistically.
RESULTS: In both groups, all parameters improved significantly. There was a significantly higher improvement of QoL scores, for dogs and owners, in Group A, compared to Group B at all time points (P < 0.05), except for owner QoL on Day 28. There was no difference in improvement of OTI-3 between groups at any time point, whereas Group A cytology scores and pruritus improved significantly more by Day 7 (P = 0.0026 and P = 0.0294, respectively).

Constant irritation of the auditory canal by the presence of this mite can lead to otitis externa or otoacariasis.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of fluralaner on rabbits naturally infested with P. cuniculi and exhibiting clinical signs.
ANIMALS: Fifteen female New Zealand domestic rabbits with otitis due to naturally occurring infestation with P. cuniculi.
METHODS: The external ears and ear canals of each individual were examined; samples of otic exudate were extracted with cotton swabs and examined microscopically for identification of the ectoparasite. Each animal was treated with a single 25 mg/kg oral dose of fluralaner. The amount of otic exudate/cerumen was assessed and samples were obtained from the ears to evaluate for presence or absence of mites at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 40 and 90 days after receiving treatment.
RESULTS: Post-treatment, the amount of otic exudate decreased rapidly in all animals; by Day 12 and until the end of the study all rabbits were judged to have low amount of exudate with normally visible canals. The percentage of ears positive for P. cuniculi decreased to 13.3% of ears sampled by Day 4, and by Day 12 all rabbits were negative for the parasite.
CONCLUSION: Administration of a single oral dose of fluralaner was effective for the treatment of naturally occurring P. cuniculi infestation in rabbits during a 90 day period.","['Sheinberg G', 'Romero C', 'Heredia R', 'Capulin M', 'Yarto E', 'Carpio J']",2017,28,4,Vet Dermatol,"Sheinberg G, et al.

28241842,Survey of otitis externa in American Cocker Spaniels in Finland.,"BACKGROUND: American Cocker Spaniels are overrepresented among breeds that require surgery as a treatment of end-stage otitis externa. However, the prevalence of otitis externa (OE) in this breed remains unknown. We reviewed the year 2010 medical records of 55 private veterinary clinics in Finland to determine the prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels compared with English Cocker and English and Welsh Springer Spaniels. An American Cocker Spaniel owner questionnaire was designed to identify potential risk factors for end-stage OE.
RESULTS: From the medical records of 98,736 dogs, the prevalence of OE was highest in Welsh Springer Spaniels (149 out of 468, 31.8%, [95% confidence interval 27.6-36.0]), followed by American Cocker (89/329, 27.0%, [22.2-31.7]), English Springer (96/491, 19.6%, [16.1-23.1]) and English Cocker Spaniels (231/1467, 15.7%, [13.8-17.6]). The mean number of OE episodes in ear-diseased dogs and the number of ear surgeries were highest in American Cocker Spaniels. Owner questionnaires were received for 151 American Cocker Spaniels, 85 (56%) of which had suffered from OE. In 47% (40/85) of these dogs, OE occurred without concurrent skin lesions, 46% (33/72) displayed the first signs of OE before 1 year of age. In 24% (20/85) of the dogs, the signs of OE recurred within 1 month or continued despite treatment, 16% (14/85) required surgery (n = 11) or were euthanized (n = 5; 2 of the operated dogs and 3 others) due to severe OE. The onset of OE before the age of 1 year significantly increased the risk (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.6) of end-stage OE.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of OE in American Cocker Spaniels in Finland was higher than previously reported in Cocker Spaniels, but the highest prevalence of OE was found in Welsh Springer Spaniels. Compared to the other Spaniels, OE was more often recurrent and more frequently surgically managed in American Cocker Spaniels. Based on the questionnaire, early onset (<1 year) of OE increased the risk of end-stage OE. In American Cocker Spaniels, OE requires an intensive approach from the first treatment, and prevention of recurrence should be emphasised. The causes and treatment of OE in this breed warrant further study.","['Kaimio M', 'Saijonmaa-Koulumies L', 'Laitinen-Vapaavuori O']",2017,59,1,Acta Vet Scand,"Kaimio M, et al.

28045591,Clinical Practice Guideline (Update): Earwax (Cerumen Impaction).,"Objective This update of the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation cerumen impaction clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the development group; new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials); enhanced information on patient education and counseling; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion; an enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review; and 3 new key action statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management. Another purpose of the guideline is to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction, and it applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic diseases of the ear canal; recurrent otitis externa; keratosis obturans; prior radiation therapy affecting the ear; previous tympanoplasty/myringoplasty, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or other surgery affecting the ear canal. Key Action Statements The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, cerumen impaction, defined as an accumulation of cerumen that is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should explain proper ear hygiene to prevent cerumen impaction when patients have an accumulation of cerumen. (2) Clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen, as seen on otoscopy, is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. (3) Clinicians should assess the patient with cerumen impaction by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as ≥1 of the following: anticoagulant therapy, immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, prior radiation therapy to the head and neck, ear canal stenosis, exostoses, and nonintact tympanic membrane. (4) Clinicians should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined. (5) Clinicians should identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and they should promptly evaluate the need for intervention. (6) Clinicians should perform otoscopy to detect the presence of cerumen in patients with hearing aids during a health care encounter. (7) Clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, the patient with cerumen impaction with an appropriate intervention, which may include ≥1 of the following: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal requiring instrumentation. (8) Clinicians should recommend against ear candling for treating or preventing cerumen impaction. (9) Clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction. If the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment. If full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. (10) Finally, if initial management is unsuccessful, clinicians should refer patients with persistent cerumen impaction to clinicians who have specialized equipment and training to clean and evaluate ear canals and tympanic membranes. The panel offered the following as options: (1) Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. (2) Clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction. (3) Clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction. (4) Last, clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures.","['Schwartz SR', 'Magit AE', 'Rosenfeld RM', 'Ballachanda BB', 'Hackell JM', 'Krouse HJ', 'Lawlor CM', 'Lin K', 'Parham K', 'Stutz DR', 'Walsh S', 'Woodson EA', 'Yanagisawa K', 'Cunningham ER']",2017,156,1_suppl,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Schwartz SR, et al.

Malassezia pachydermatis is a lipophylic yeast responsible for otitis externa and dermatitis in dogs and for cutaneous and systemic disease in humans. Five mixtures of essential oils obtained from Mediterranean plants (Citrus paradisi, Salvia sclarea, Ocimum basilicum, Rosmarinus officinalis, Citrus limon, Anthemis nobilis, Lavandula hybrida and Thymus vulgaris) provided with antifungal and/or anti-inflammatory action assayed in vitro, were tested in vivo versus M. pachydermatis to treat once daily for 2 weeks 25 atopic dogs with Malassezia otitis externa. Mixture composed by C. limon 1%, S. sclarea 0,5%, R. officinalis 1%, A. nobilis 0,5% yielded excellent results in all treated dogs.

27882553,Malignant otitis externa hospitalizations: Analysis of patient characteristics.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a rare disorder that is not well studied in the inpatient setting. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was utilized to analyze characteristics and predischarge outcomes of hospitalized MOE patients.
METHODS: MOE hospitalizations were identified in the 2002 to 2013 NIS. Patient demographics, length of hospital stay, hospital charges, concomitant diagnoses, treatment-related procedures, complications, and in-hospital mortality rates were examined, with comparisons made among age cohorts and between diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-DM groups.
RESULTS: A total of 8,300 cases of inpatient MOE were identified, with elderly DM patients compromising 22.7% of cases. Compared to adults, elderly patients had more inpatient procedures, longer hospitalizations (6.0 vs. 4.3 days), higher hospital charges ($26,712 vs. $19,047) (all P < 0.001), greater odds of in-hospital complications, and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 14.435, 95% confidence interval 5.313-39.220). Adult/elderly patients with DM had more comorbidities, longer hospital stays (5.5 vs. 4.0 days), and higher hospital charges ($25,118 vs. $17,039) (all P < 0.001) than non-DM patients. However, DM was not associated with greater in-hospital mortality rates (0.6% vs. 0.5%; P = 0.640). Compared to the adult/elderly cohort, pediatric patients had higher rates of nonelective admissions (19.8% vs. 14.5%), shorter hospital stays (2.9 vs. 4.9 days), and lower hospital charges ($8,876 vs. $21,672) (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Elderly diabetic patients made up a smaller fraction of hospitalized MOE cases than anticipated. Elderly patients had greater in-hospital complications and mortality. Diabetes mellitus in adult/elderly patients was not associated with increased mortality. Pediatric patients fared well with low complications rates and no instances of in-hospital mortality.

27870236,Prior antimicrobial use as a risk factor for resistance in selected Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from the skin and ears of dogs.,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance within bacteria continues to present therapeutic challenges. One presumed risk factor for increased rates of resistance is prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of time since most recent exposure, the number of prior antimicrobial exposures and duration of use on antimicrobial resistance rates in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates.
METHODS: Inclusion of a case in the study required laboratory isolation of S. pseudintermedius from a clinical specimen. Antibiograms and information regarding prior antimicrobial exposures were extracted from the medical records of dogs diagnosed with pyoderma or otitis externa.
RESULTS: Meticillin resistance (MR) was identified in 48.1% of isolates. Recent use of beta-lactam antimicrobials was associated with increased odds of resistance to meticillin (P < 0.001) and fluoroquinolones (P < 0.001). Antimicrobial therapy within 1 month prior to sampling was also associated with MR (60.7%; P = 0.009) and multidrug resistance (61.9%; P = 0.029). The number of prior exposures to beta-lactams or fluoroquinolones were associated with resistance to these same classes (P = 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) and to other antimicrobial classes (P = 0.016 for resistance to fluoroquinolones following treatment with beta-lactams and P = 0.015 for MR following treatment with fluoroquinolones). Longer treatment duration with beta-lactam drugs was associated with higher proportion of MR (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Treatment based upon culture and susceptibility testing is highly recommended for dogs that have received multiple antimicrobial drug exposures or that were treated within the preceding month. This may be especially important when the prior therapeutic regimen included a drug from the beta-lactam or fluoroquinolone classes.","['Zur G', 'Gurevich B', 'Elad D']",2016,27,6,Vet Dermatol,"Zur G, et al.

27810214,Comparison of ultrasound imaging and video otoscopy with cross-sectional imaging for the diagnosis of canine otitis media.,"Ultrasound imaging (US) of the tympanic bulla (TB) for diagnosis of canine otitis media (OM) is less expensive and less invasive than cross-sectional imaging techniques including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Video otoscopy (VO) is used to clean inflamed ears. The objective of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of US and VO in OM using cross-sectional imaging as the reference standard. Client owned dogs with clinical signs of OE and/or OM were recruited for the study. Physical, neurological, otoscopic and otic cytological examinations were performed on each dog and both TB were evaluated using US with an 8 MHz micro convex probe, cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) and VO. Of 32 dogs enrolled, 24 had chronic otitis externa (OE; five also had clinical signs of OM), four had acute OE without clinical signs of OM, and four had OM without OE. Ultrasound imaging was positive in three of 14 ears, with OM identified on cross-sectional imaging. One US was false positive. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of US were 21%, 98%, 75%, 81% and 81%, respectively. The corresponding values of VO were 91%, 98%, 91%, 98% and 97%, respectively. Video otoscopy could not identify OM in one case, while in another case, although the tympanum was ruptured, the CT was negative. Ultrasound imaging should not replace cross-sectional imaging for the diagnosis of canine OM, but can be helpful, and VO was much more reliable than US.","['Classen J', 'Bruehschwein A', 'Meyer-Lindenberg A', 'Mueller RS']",2016,217,,Vet J,"Classen J, et al.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective review of otoscopy results obtained during a school health screening campaign conducted between March and June 2015. Descriptive statistics through percentages and frequency tables were used to analyse the data. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between age, gender and pathologies observed.
STUDY SAMPLE: Medical folders of 1089 pupils.
RESULTS: Forty-nine percent had normal otoscopy results. A significant 36% (n = 392) had impacted cerumen. Furthermore, 45% of those with impacted cerumen were bilaterally impacted. Additionally, 4% presented with foreign bodies and a further 8% had otitis externa and otitis media. The remaining 3% had tympanic membrane perforations. The odds of developing outer and middle ear pathologies were higher in pupils below 6 years of age (p = 0.046).
CONCLUSION: This study highlights a high prevalence of outer and middle ear pathologies in paediatrics in Limpopo and therefore recommends comprehensive baseline and periodic screenings; to identify children with outer and middle ear pathologies and need further management, and consequently prevent the complications of these pathologies.

27756390,Determination of N-acylhomoserine lactones of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinical samples from dogs with otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial intercellular communication, called quorum sensing, takes place via the production and collective response to signal molecules. In Gram-negative bacteria, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, these signaling molecules are N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). P. aeruginosa is a common cause of inflammation of the ear canal (otitis externa) in dogs. It employs quorum sensing to coordinate the expression of host tissue-damaging factors, which are largely responsible for its virulence. The treatment of P. aeruginosa-associated otitis is challenging due to a high intrinsic resistance of P. aeruginosa to several antibiotics. Attenuation of quorum sensing signals to inhibit bacterial virulence is a novel strategy for the treatment of resistant bacterial pathogens, including P. aeruginosa. Therefore, it is important to recognize and define quorum sensing signal molecules in clinical samples. To date, there are no reports on determination of AHLs in the veterinary clinical samples. The purpose of this study was to validate an analytical procedure for determination of the concentration of AHLs in the ear rinses from dogs with P. aeruginosa-associated otitis externa. Samples were obtained with rinsing the ear canals with physiological saline solution. For validation, samples from healthy dogs were spiked with none or different known amounts of the selected AHLs. With the validated procedure, AHLs were analyzed in the samples taken in weekly intervals from two dogs, receiving a standard treatment for P. aeruginosa-associated otitis externa.
RESULTS: Validation proved that the procedure enables quantification of AHLs in non-clinical and clinical samples. In addition, a time dependent reduction of AHL concentration was detected for the treated dogs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is superior in detecting AHLs compared to other chromatographic techniques. This is the first report on determination of AHLs in the clinical samples of veterinary importance. The analytical procedure described in this paper is capable of supporting novel antimicrobial strategies, which target quorum sensing.","['Kušar D', 'Šrimpf K', 'Isaković P', 'Kalšek L', 'Hosseini J', 'Zdovc I', 'Kotnik T', 'Vengušt M', 'Tavčar-Kalcher G']",2016,12,1,BMC Vet Res,"Kušar D, et al.

27671716,Analysis of Prognostic Factors in Malignant External Otitis.,"OBJECTIVES: Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a potentially fatal infection of the external auditory canal, temporal bone, and skull base. Despite treatment with modern antibiotics, MEO can lead to skull base osteomyelitis. Until now, there have been few studies on the prognostic factors of MEO.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to identify prognostic factors of MEO, and a meta-analysis of other articles investigating MEO. On the basis of disease progression the 28 patients in our study were divided into 'controlled' and 'uncontrolled' groups, consisting of 12 and 16 patients, respectively. We identified three categories of prognostic factors: those related to patient, disease, and treatment. We compared these prognostic factors between the controlled and uncontrolled groups.
RESULTS: In our study, the duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), presence of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging findings influenced the prognosis of MEO. In contrast, prognosis was unrelated to age, gender, mean glucose level, hemoglobin A1c level, pathogen, comorbidity, or cranial nerve involvement. No factor related to treatment modality was correlated with prognosis, such as surgery, steroid therapy, or interval to the first appropriate treatment. Cranial nerve involvement has been proven to be associated with disease progression, but the relationship between cranial nerve involvement and the prognosis of MEO remains controversial. As a part of this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of cranial nerve involvement as a prognostic factor of MEO. We found that cranial nerve involvement has a statistically significant influence on the prognosis of MEO.
CONCLUSION: We found that glycemic control in diabetes mellitus, cranial nerve involvement, and the extent of disease determined from various imaging modalities influence the prognosis of MEO. We suggest that significant prognostic factors should be monitored to determine the prognosis of patients with MEO.","['Lee SK', 'Lee SA', 'Seon SW', 'Jung JH', 'Lee JD', 'Choi JY', 'Kim BG']",2017,10,3,Clin Exp Otorhinolaryngol,"Lee SK, et al.

27630871,"Comparison of Boric Acid and Combination Drug of Polymyxin, Neomycin and Hydrocortisone (polymyxin NH) in the Treatment of Acute Otitis Externa.","INTRODUCTION: Acute otitis externa is an inflammation of the external auditory canal known as ""swimmer's ear"". Direct costs including medical treatment, painkillers, antibiotics, steroids or both and indirect costs are also remarkable.
AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of boric acid and polymyxin, neomycin and hydrocortisone composition in the treatment of acute otitis externa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was carried out on 80 patients aged more than 17-year-old who were referred to Kashani hospital clinic with a diagnosis of acute otitis externa by otolaryngologist. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups (A: Boric acid and B: polymyxin NH ear drops) and Painkiller was prescribed and administered orally for all patients and in the presence of fever, cellulitis around the ears and neck adenopathy, broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics were used besides topical treatment. Symptoms of patients who were evaluated by a physician includes pain, discharge from the ear, swelling of the ear canal, auricle swelling, tenderness, and ear itching. In addition, pain was evaluated in patients and was recorded by Macgill Pain Questionnaire, in the first, third, seventh and tenth days.
RESULTS: Results showed that itching on third day (p=0.007) and swelling of the ear canal in the examination of the third day (p=0.006) and the seventh day (p=0.001) in the polymyxin NH group was more than those of boric acid group. Overall mean pain based on McGill questionnaire was 11.10±1.49 in boric acid group in the examination on the first day and was 4.05±0.22 in the examination on the tenth day and in the polymyxin NH group, it was 10.9±0.99 on the first day and 4.20±0.40 on the tenth day. In both groups, pain relief was the same and there was no significant difference between two groups (p=0.075).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed slight differences in the effectiveness of the boric acid drug and combination of polymyxin, neomycin and hydrocortisone in the treatment of patients with acute otitis externa that is of clinical significance.","['Amani S', 'Moeini M']",2016,10,7,J Clin Diagn Res,"Amani S and Moeini M.

With an initial diagnosis of simple otitis externa, he was discharged on topical drops. He represented 2 months later with worsening otalgia and discharge. A diagnosis of malignant otitis externa was made based on clinical and radiological findings. Intravenous Tazocin and Gentamicin were given based on previous bacterial culture from ear swabs. The patient failed to improve and developed left-sided facial nerve palsy. His condition stabilised following a change in antimicrobial therapy and his management continued in the community on intravenous Meropenem with twice weekly aural toilet. Repeated nuclear medicine imaging failed to demonstrate resolution. A bony sequestration was removed from the external auditory canal in the outpatient clinic, which following extended culture grew Scedosporium apiospermum; his management was subsequently changed to oral Voriconazole. This led to rapid clinical improvement and disease resolution over a 6 -week period.","['McLaren O', 'Potter C']",2016,2016,,BMJ Case Rep,McLaren O and Potter C.

They are associated with significant morbidity and frequent hospital visits. Limited data exists regarding the burden of ear disease among Nigerian children.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of ear-related problems among children presenting at the Paediatric and Otorhinolaryngology clinics of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Paediatric and Otorhinolaryngology Clinics of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu. All children aged 0 and 17 years presenting between 1(st) June and 31(st) August 2006 with ear-related problems were enrolled consecutively into the study. Data analysis was by SPSS version 11.
RESULTS: Three thousand and twenty-one children were seen during the study period. Out of these, 248 children (8.2%) presented with ear-related problems. Chronic otitis media (30.5%), acute otitis media (29.9%), cerumen auris (11.3%), otitis externa (10.1%), hearing impairment (7.3%) and foreign body in the ear (5.7%) were the most commonly diagnosed ear-related problems.
CONCLUSION: Ear-related problems among children presenting at the UNTH Enugu were not uncommon. However, otitis media was the most commonly diagnosed ailment affecting the ears in children.","['Ilechukwu GC', 'Ilechukwu C', 'Ezeanolue BC', 'Okoroafor IJ', 'Ojinnaka NC', 'Ubesie AC', 'Emechebe GO', 'Eze J']",2016,16,2,Afr Health Sci,"Ilechukwu GC, et al.

27597916,A Case of Skull Base Osteomyelitis with Multiple Cerebral Infarction.,"Skull base osteomyelitis is classically documented as an extension of malignant otitis externa. Initial presentation commonly includes aural symptoms and cranial nerve dysfunctions. Here we present a case that emerged with multiple infarctions in the right cerebrum. A male in his 70s with diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure presented with left hemiparesis. Imaging studies showed that blood flow in the carotid artery remained at the day of onset but was totally occluded 7 days later. However, collateral blood supply prevented severe infarction. These findings suggest that artery-to-artery embolization from the petrous and/or cavernous portion of the carotid artery caused the multiple infarctions observed on initial presentation. Osteomyelitis of the central skull base was diagnosed on the basis of the following findings taken together: laboratory results showing high levels of inflammation, presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the otorrhea and blood culture, multiple cranial nerve palsies that appeared later, the bony erosion observed on CT, and the mass lesion on MRI. Osteomyelitis was treated successfully by long-term antibiotic therapy; however, the patient experienced cefepime-induced neurotoxicity during therapy. The potential involvement of the internal carotid artery in this rare and life-threatening disease is of particular interest in this case.","['Miyabe H', 'Uno A', 'Nakajima T', 'Morizane N', 'Enomoto K', 'Hirose M', 'Hazama T', 'Takenaka Y']",2016,2016,,Case Rep Otolaryngol,"Miyabe H, et al.

27576514,Postinflammatory medial canal fibrosis: An institutional review and meta-analysis of short- and long-term outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE: Few studies report outcomes of surgical management of postinflammatory medial canal fibrosis (PIMCF). The objectives were to compare short- and long-term outcomes after surgical repair of PIMCF at our institution and systematically aggregate published data for meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: Medical records for the case series; PubMed, Scopus, and OVID/Medline for the systematic review/meta-analysis.
METHODS: Patients undergoing surgical treatment of PIMCF were identified. Short-term (<2 years) and long-term (>2 years) postoperative outcomes were evaluated for the case series and aggregated for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: At our institution, 16 patients (21 ears) were identified. Compared to the preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) (27.7 ± 7.5 dB), mean postoperative short-term ABG (8.2 ± 7.5 dB) and long-term ABG (15.3 ± 11.3 dB) were significantly improved (P < 0.001 for both). Although short-term restenosis rate was low (0%) among long-term follow-up patients, 64% (9 of 14) experienced some degree of recurrent canal narrowing, including one case of complete restenosis (7%). Similarly, meta-analysis pooled preoperative ABG (29.3 ± 9.7 dB, 95% confidence interval [CI] 27.0-31.6) improved significantly during short-term (11.4 ± 8.0 dB, 95% CI 8.3-4.5, P < 0.0001) and long-term (14.3 ± 9.6 dB, 95% CI 11.6-16.9, P = 0.0004) follow-ups, with partial deterioration in hearing over time. Long-term complete restenosis rate (13.8%) was worse than short-term (8.0%), with no significant difference over time (P = 0.85).
CONCLUSION: Postinflammatory medial canal fibrosis is a rare condition that can successfully be treated with surgery to restore patency of the external auditory canal. Patients who experience improved hearing early on, however, are at significant risk of restenosis and recurrence of their conductive hearing loss with time.

Multidrug resistance is commonly reported for this organism, creating a difficult therapeutic challenge.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of a gel containing 0.5 μg/mL of antimicrobial peptide AMP2041, 0.07% chlorhexidine digluconate (CLX), 0.4% Tris and 0.1% EDTA on 30 clinical isolates of PA from canine otitis externa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity was evaluated through minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Standardized bacterial suspensions were incubated with different concentrations of the gel at 37°C for 30 min and plated for colony forming unit (CFU) counts. Time-to-kill kinetics were evaluated with the undiluted product and at MBC for each PA strain at 30 s, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 min, 24 and 48 h.
RESULTS: The MBC was 1:64 for two of 30 strains, 1:128 for 15 of 30 strains and 1:256 for 13 of 30 strains. The geometric mean was 1:165, equivalent to a concentration of 0.003 μg/mL AMP2041 + 0.0004% CLX + 0.0024%Tris + 0.0006% EDTA. Time-to-kill assays with the undiluted product showed complete bactericidal effect within 30 s for all isolates, whereas at the MBC this effect was reached within 5 min for 20 of 30 isolates and within 30 min for all isolates.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
ANIMALS: Fifity-seven dogs (79 ears) undergoing TECA-LBO at a single institution over 14 years.
METHODS: Medical records of dogs undergoing TECA-LBO for end-stage inflammatory non-neoplastic ear disease from March 1999 to September 2013 at the Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital were evaluated for intraoperative and early postoperative complications associated with the procedure. Inclusion criteria were clinical and/or histopathologic diagnosis of chronic otitis externa, surgical treatment by TECA-LBO, and a minimum of 2 week follow-up data.
RESULTS: Twenty dogs (40 ears) underwent BLSS and 37 dogs (39 ears) had ULS. Complications were recorded for 29 of 40 ears (72.5%) in the BLSS group (40.0% facial nerve, 15.0% ocular, and 32.5% minor incisional complications) and 25 of 39 ears (64.1%) in the ULS group (33.3% facial nerve, 12.8% ocular, and 23.1% minor incisional complications). Dogs undergoing BLSS did not have a significantly higher total complication rate, or higher neurologic, ocular, or incisional complication rates, than the ULS procedure. No major anesthetic complications affecting outcome were recorded for either group.
CONCLUSION: Anesthetic and early surgical complication rates after ULS and BLSS were not significantly different in our study.

STUDY DESIGN: National United States Medicaid prescription and GT user search database analysis.
METHODS: Quarterly national Medicaid summary drug utilization data and weekly GT search engine data for ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone (CD), ofloxacin (OF), and Cortisporin (CS) ototopicals were obtained from January 2008 to July 2014. Time series analysis was used to assess prescription seasonality, Holt-Winter's method for forecasting quarterly prescription volumes, and Pearson correlations to compare GT and Medicaid data.
RESULTS: Medicaid prescription volumes demonstrated sinusoidal seasonality for OF (r = 0.91), CS (r = 0.71), and CD (r = 0.62) with annual peaks in July, August, and September. In 2017, OF was forecasted to be the most widely prescribed ototopical, followed by CD. CS was the least prescribed, and volumes were forecasted to decrease 9.0% by 2017 from 2014. GT user search interest demonstrated analogous sinusoidal seasonality and significant correlations with Medicaid data prescriptions for CD (r = 0.38, p = 0.046), OF (r = 0.74, p < 0.001), CS (r = 0.49, p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: We found that OF, CD, and CS ototopicals have sinusoidal seasonal variation with Medicaid prescription volume peaks occurring in the summer. After 2012, OF was the most commonly prescribed ototopical, and this trend was forecasted to continue. CS use was forecasted to decrease.

27340628,Central Skull Base Osteomyelitis: Diagnostic Dilemmas and Management Issues.,"The aim of this study is to describe the clinical presentation of central skull base osteomyelitis and to discuss the classical imaging findings and various diagnostic and therapeutic challenges faced in the management of this condition. This is a retrospective analysis of inpatient case records, carried out in a multidisciplinary tertiary care hospital. The study subjects included five elderly diabetic patients presenting to the ENT surgeon or neurologist with headache followed by multiple cranial nerve paralysis with no temporal bone involvement in four patients and a past history of otitis externa in one patient. These patients were diagnosed to have an infective pathology of the central skull base detected by imaging and confirmed by biopsy in three. All were treated successfully with antibiotics administered for an average period of 6 weeks. Three patients followed up over 4 years and showed no relapses. One succumbed to other medical co morbidities after 8 months and one diagnosed a month prior is still under follow up. A symptom complex of headache and cranial neuropathies usually raises the suspicion of malignancy. Central skull base osteomyelitis, a relatively uncommon pathology, must also be considered as a possible differential diagnosis despite absence of a definite septic focus. Imaging studies showing bony destruction and adjacent soft tissue involvement should raise the suspicion of this clinical entity. Malignancy needs to be ruled out by biopsy. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotics administered for an adequate duration is of paramount importance in successfully treating these patients. A multidisciplinary approach is needed for a successful outcome.","['Muranjan SN', 'Khadilkar SV', 'Wagle SC', 'Jaggi ST']",2016,68,2,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Muranjan SN, et al.

27324289,Evidence-based veterinary dermatology: a review of published studies of treatments for Otodectes cynotis (ear mite) infestation in cats.,"BACKGROUND: Otodectes cynotis (ear mite) accounts for 50-80% of cases of otitis externa in cats. Various treatment options exist but evidence-based reviews on treatments for this parasite have not been conducted.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to systematically review the efficacy of treatments for Otodectes cynotis infestation in cats, to provide recommendations for their use and to suggest methodologies for future clinical trials and research.
METHODS: Electronic searches were carried out using the PubMed, CAB Direct and Thomson Reuters Web of Science; relevant topics were hand searched. The review was restricted to peer reviewed articles without limitation of language and publication date; only in vivo studies were included. The data were extracted and tabulated, then compared with regard to study design. With only a few randomized and controlled trials (RCTs) available, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the pooled data.
RESULTS: A total of 27 trials published between 1978 and 2015 fulfilled the selection criteria; 17 different pharmacological interventions were identified. There were two blinded RCTs and 25 open uncontrolled trials.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: There is fair evidence for recommending spot-on 10% imidacloprid +1% moxidectin or selamectin, once or twice 30 days apart, while there is insufficient evidence for or against recommending all other medications due to the quality of study designs in spite of their high efficacies. Future blinded RCTs, using placebo or appropriate active drugs, are required; outcome measurements on both clinical and microbiological and parasitological improvement, and proper follow-up periods are recommended.","['Yang C', 'Huang HP']",2016,27,4,Vet Dermatol,Yang C and Huang HP.

27311346,Malignant external otitis: Factors predicting patient outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant external otitis (MEO) is an aggressive infection, primarily affecting elderly diabetic patients. It begins in the external ear canal and spreads to adjacent structures. This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed and treated for MEO and analyzed factors affecting patient outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort.
SETTING: Tertiary medical center.
METHODS: Medical records of all patients diagnosed and treated for MEO from 1990 to 2013, were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features, laboratory, imaging and outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: 88 patients were included, mean age was 73±11.5years, 61 (69%) were male. Of these, 75% had diabetes. Mean follow-up was 60months. The most common presenting symptoms were otalgia (89%), external ear canal edema (86%) and otorrhea (84%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 61% of ear cultures. All patients were treated with antibiotics, 22% had surgery and 8% hyperbaric oxygen. Overall survival rate was 38% in 5years, with disease specific mortality 14%. DM, facial nerve palsy, positive CT scan and age above 70 were found to correlate and predict disease-specific mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: MEO carries a grave prognosis. The presence of two or more of the following features, DM, facial nerve palsy, positive CT scan and age above 70, predicts poor outcome, and highlights the need for prolonged, vigorous treatment.","['Stern Shavit S', 'Soudry E', 'Hamzany Y', 'Nageris B']",2016,37,5,Am J Otolaryngol,"Stern Shavit S, et al.

27293771,Demography and health of Pugs under primary veterinary care in England.,"BACKGROUND: The Pug is an ancient dog breed and was the fifth most commonly registered UK pedigree breed in 2014. However, the breed has been reported to be predisposed to several disorders including ocular, respiratory and dermatological problems. The VetCompass Programme collates de-identified clinical data from primary-care veterinary practices in the UK for epidemiological research. Using VetCompass clinical data, this study aimed to characterise the demography and common disorders of the general population of Pugs under veterinary care in England.
RESULTS: Pugs comprised 2709 (1.03 %) of 264,260 study dogs under veterinary care from September 1(st), 2009 to 30(th) April, 2015. Annual proportional birth rates showed that Pugs rose from less than 1 % of annual birth cohorts before 2008 to comprise 2.8 % of the 2013 annual birth cohort. The most common colours of Pugs were fawn (63.1 %), black (27.7 %), apricot (7.6 %) and silver (2.1 %). Of the 1009 pugs under veterinary care in the study during 2013, 688 (68.19 %) had at least one disorder recorded. The most prevalent disorders recorded overall were overweight/obesity (number of events: 133, prevalence: 13.18 %, 95 % CI: 11.12-15.43), corneal disorder (88, 8.72 %, 95 % CI: 7.05-10.63) and otitis externa (76, 7.53 %, 95 % CI: 5.98-9.34). The most prevalent disorder groups were ophthalmological (n = 164, prevalence: 16.25 %, 95 % CI: 14.03-18.68), dermatological (157, 15.60 %, 95 % CI: 13.38-17.95) and aural (152, 15.06 %, 95 % CI: 12.91-17.42). The most prevalent body locations affected were the head-and-neck (n = 439, prevalence = 43.51 %, 95 % CI: 40.42-46.63) and abdomen (195, 19.33 %, 95 % CI: 16.93-21.90). The most prevalent organ systems affected were the integument (321, 31.81 %, 95 % CI: 28.15-35.72) and digestive (257, 25.47 %, 95 % CI: 22.54-28.65). The most prevalent pathophysiologic processes recorded were inflammation (386, 38.26 %, 95 % CI: 34.39-42.27) and congenital/developmental (153, 15.16 %, 95 % CI: 12.61-18.13).
CONCLUSIONS: Ownership of Pugs in England is rising steeply. Overweight/obesity, corneal disorder and otitis externa are the most common disorders in Pugs. Identification of health priorities based on VetComapss data can support evidence-based reforms to improve health and welfare within the breed.","[""O'Neill DG"", 'Darwent EC', 'Church DB', 'Brodbelt DC']",2016,3,,Canine Genet Epidemiol,"O'Neill DG, et al.

27288851,Serum Malassezia-specific IgE in dogs with recurrent Malassezia otitis externa without concurrent skin disease.,"Immediate-type hypersensitivity (ITH), mediated by IgE, to Malassezia pachydermatis is recognized in atopic dogs with recurrent yeast dermatitis and otitis externa (OE). Malassezia-associated OE commonly occurs in dogs without other signs of atopic dermatitis (AD). The aim of this study was to detect Malassezia-specific IgE in the sera of dogs with recurrent Malassezia OE without concurrent skin disease. Sera from healthy dogs were used for comparison. An FcεRIα-based ELISA was used to measure Malassezia-specific IgE. There was no significant difference between number of positive affected dogs (6/21, 29%) and number of positive unaffected dogs (15/86, 17%) (P=0.36). There was also no significant difference in the concentrations of Malassezia-specific IgE between the two groups (P=0.97). Malassezia-specific IgE did not distinguish between patient groups so, as with other canine allergens, serum IgE reactivity for Malassezia could not be used to differentiate between diseased and healthy patients. The presence of Malassezia-specific IgE in some of the affected dogs might indicate ITH to Malassezia in those dogs. Evaluation of ITH via intradermal test reactivity and response to allergen-specific immunotherapy might clarify the role of Malassezia-associated ITH in similarly affected dogs.","['Layne EA', 'DeBoer DJ']",2016,176,,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Layne EA and DeBoer DJ.

27241559,Malignant external otitis in Spain.,"INTRODUCTION: Malignant external otitis is a necrotizing infection, which extends from the squamous epithelium of the ear canal to the adjacent tissue. The objective of the study was to investigate its incidence and other epidemiological data in Spain, reporting the largest case series to date.
METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study of the Spanish population was carried out using the minimum basic data set (MBDS) based on data of patients admitted to hospitals in the 2008-2013 period. Patients whose diagnosis (principal or secondary) at discharge was encoded as 380.14 (malignant external otitis), according to ICD-9-CM, were included as cases. The Spanish incidence rate was calculated for all its communities and provinces, as well as by season and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 355 patients (302 as principal diagnosis and 53 as secondary) were diagnosed. The incidence rate was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.44) per 106 inhabitants and year, although there were variations among geographical areas. The median age of cases with main diagnosis was 74 years (range 10-95 years). The predominant age group was in patients over 84 years old (19.3 cases per 10

29648753,Recurrent malignant otitis externa with multiple cranial nerve involvement: A case report.,"INTRODUCTION: Necrotizing otitis externa is a rare but conditionally fatal infection of external auditory canal with extension to deep soft tissue and bones, resulting in necrosis and osteomyelitis of the temporal bone and scull base. This condition is also known as malignant otitis due to an aggressive behavior and poor treatment response. Early diagnosis of malignant otitis is a difficult challenge. We present an illustrative case of necrotizing otitis externa and suggest some strategies to avoid diagnostic and treatment pitfalls.
CASE OUTLINE: A 70-year-old patient presented with signs of malignant otitis externa, complicated by peripheral facial palsy. Adequate diagnostic and treatment procedures were performed with clinical signs of resolution. The recurrence of malignant infection had presented three months after previous infection with multiple cranial nerve neuropathies and signs of jugular vein and lateral sinus thrombosis. An aggressive antibiotic treatment and surgery were carried out, followed by substantial recovery of the patient and complete restoration of cranial nerves’ functions.
CONCLUSION: Necrotizing otitis externa is a serious condition with uncertain prognosis. The suspicion of malignant external otitis should be raised in cases of resistance to topical treatment, especially in patient with predisposing factors. Evidence-based guideline for necrotizing otitis externa still doesn’t exist and treatment protocol should be adjusted to individual presentation of each patient.","['Djerić D', 'Folić M', 'Janićijević M', 'Blažić S', 'Popadić D']",2016,144,5-6,Srp Arh Celok Lek,"Djerić D, et al.

27127584,"Bacterial Otitis Externa in Patients Attending an ENT Clinic in Babol, North of Iran.","BACKGROUND: Acute otitis externa, an inflammatory condition of the external auditory canal, is a common clinical problem in general medicine.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the etiology of otitis externa in patients from the Mazandaran province, north of Iran, which has a humid climate, as humidity can affect the prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 116 patients with otitis externa. Two sets of samples were collected from their ears; one set was used for slide preparations, and the other for microbial culturing. After culturing, the microorganisms were identified by conventional methods.
RESULTS: Patients between 35 and 44 years of age were most frequently affected (25.00%) by otitis externa (average age, 43.87 ± 18.08 years). Moreover, women (54.31%) were more frequently affected than men (45.69%). Upon direct investigation, Gram-positive bacilli were the most commonly identified microorganisms (22.41%). Furthermore, Bacillus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (22.41% and 19.83%, respectively), were the organisms most frequently identified from cultures of otitis externa samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct examination and culture showed that a mixed infection of fungi and bacteria is the most common cause of otitis externa. The present study revealed that Bacilli spp. were the most abundant bacteria isolated from patients with otitis externa. Thus, it is recommended that both organisms should be considered as etiologic agents in protocols for treatment of otitis externa.","['Kiakojuri K', 'Mahdavi Omran S', 'Jalili B', 'Hajiahmadi M', 'Bagheri M', 'Ferdousi Shahandashti E', 'Rajabnia R']",2016,9,2,Jundishapur J Microbiol,"Kiakojuri K, et al.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the antibacterial activity of NAC against common bacterial isolates associated with canine otitis externa.
ANIMALS: Twenty two isolates from canine clinical cases of otitis externa were identified and tested, including five Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, six Pseudomonas aeruginosa, five Corynebacterium spp. and six β-haemolytic Streptococcus spp. isolates.
METHODS: Each isolate was grown on blood agar for 24 h and transferred to Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) to achieve a final concentration of 5 × 10(5)  CFU/mL. NAC was diluted in MHB to a starting concentration of 160 mg/mL and serial two-fold microdilution assays were performed in triplicate with negative controls for all isolates tested. Concentrations of NAC tested ranged from 0.125 to 80 mg/mL. A 50 μL volume of bacterial suspension was used to inoculate each well.
RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of NAC for all isolates tested ranged from 5 to 20 mg/mL.

27093301,Indications for Salivary Gland Radiotherapy.,"There is an established role for post-operative radiotherapy in the treatment of benign and malignant salivary gland tumours. For benign disease, the addition of radiotherapy improves local tumour control in cases with incomplete excision, involved surgical margins or multi-focal disease recurrence. After capsule rupture or spillage alone, surveillance should usually be advised. For malignant disease, post-operative radiotherapy is recommended for an advanced tumour stage, high-grade tumour, perineural or lympho-vascular invasion, close or positive resection margins, extra-parotid extension or lymph node involvement. The main benefit is increased loco-regional tumour control, although this may translate into a modest improvement in survival. The possible late side effects of parotid bed irradiation include skin changes, chronic otitis externa, sensorineural hearing loss, osteoradionecrosis and secondary malignancy. Severe complications are rare, but patients should be counselled carefully about the risks. Primary radiotherapy is unlikely to be curative and is reserved to cases in which resection would cause unacceptable functional or cosmetic morbidity or would likely result in subtotal resection (R2) or to patients with distant metastases to gain local tumour control. There are provisional data on the use of charged particle radiotherapy in this setting. Some patients may benefit from synchronous chemotherapy with radiotherapy, but this group is not defined, and data from comparative prospective studies are required before routine clinical use of this treatment.","['Thomson DJ', 'Slevin NJ', 'Mendenhall WM']",2016,78,,Adv Otorhinolaryngol,"Thomson DJ, et al.

PATIENTS: Seven adults with a diagnosis of NOE on both clinical and computed tomography (CT) criteria who were subsequently monitored with at least two echoplanar DW-MRI investigations were included in this retrospective longitudinal observational study.
INTERVENTION: Patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including echoplanar diffusion-weighted sequences, within 2 weeks of diagnosis of NOE to determine the extent of infection and to provide a baseline scan for monitoring response to treatment. Repeated imaging was undertaken after the agreed initial course of antimicrobial therapy was completed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure for complete treatment response was complete resolution of high inflammatory signal on the DW-MRI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. This was correlated to clinical, biochemical, and other MRI measures of disease resolution.
RESULTS: Baseline DW-MRI was carried out in all but one patient within 2 weeks of the initial diagnostic CT scan. Patients had between one and three further DW-MRI scans, at a mean interval of 4.4 months from the initial scan (range, 2-8 months). The decision to terminate or continue therapy correlated with ADC signal findings on DW-MRI in all cases. In comparison, conventional MRI sequences performed less well, as there was some degree of persistent residual soft tissue changes in all cases.","['Cherko M', 'Nash R', 'Singh A', 'Lingam RK']",2016,37,6,Otol Neurotol,"Cherko M, et al.

This study investigated whether temporomandibular joint involvement had any prognostic effect on the course of necrotising otitis externa in patients who had undergone hyperbaric oxygen therapy after failed medical and sometimes surgical therapy.
METHODS: A retrospective case series was conducted of patients in whom antibiotic treatment and surgery had failed, who had been hospitalised for further treatment and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with necrotising otitis externa were identified. The temporomandibular joint was involved in four patients (17 per cent); these patients showed a constant gradual improvement in C-reactive protein and were eventually discharged free of disease, except one patient who was lost to follow up. Four patients (16 per cent) without temporomandibular joint involvement died within 90 days of discharge, while all patients with temporomandibular joint involvement were alive. Three patients (13 per cent) without temporomandibular joint involvement needed recurrent hospitalisation including further hyperbaric oxygen therapy; no patients with temporomandibular joint involvement required such treatment.
CONCLUSION: Patients with temporomandibular joint involvement had lower rates of recurrent disease and no mortality.

Evidence suggests that medical grade honey (MGH) may be effective against drug-resistant pathogens.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of a commercial MGH compound was assessed in an open clinical trial. We hypothesized that it would be an effective alternative to conventional treatments.
ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs (n = 15) with a confirmed diagnosis of infectious OE were enrolled in this pilot study.
METHODS: Dogs were prescribed MGH (1 mL daily per ear) until cure was achieved or for a maximum of 21 d. Evaluation was based on weekly clinical scores, cytological progression and owner assessments of pruritus. Swab samples were submitted for culture and susceptibility testing. MGH was tested for biocidal activity against the bacterial isolates.
RESULTS: Medical grade honey promoted rapid clinical progress, with 70% of dogs achieving clinical cure between days 7 and 14 and over 90% having resolved by Day 21. There was a decrease in clinical scores throughout the duration of the trial (P < 0.001) and owner-assessed pruritus also decreased significantly (P < 0.05). In vitro assays of the biocidal activity of MGH showed activity against all bacterial isolates, including meticillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and other species of drug-resistant bacteria.

26914952,Epidemiological investigation of grass seed foreign body-related disease in dogs of the Riverina District of rural Australia.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterise disease presentations caused by grass seed foreign body-related disease (GSFBD) in dogs, identify predisposing risk factors and suggest effective prevention strategies.
METHODS: A retrospective, case-control, telephone survey was conducted to obtain information on GSFBD in dogs from the Riverina district of New South Wales (NSW). Additionally, retrospective case records were obtained from Wagga Wagga Veterinary Hospital and Charles Sturt University Veterinary Teaching Hospital over the period July 2006 to October 2011. Signalment, history, investigative strategies, location and severity of lesion(s), cost of therapy, length of hospitalisation, recurrence rate and microbiology data were recorded.
RESULTS: Cases (473 dogs) meeting stringent inclusion criteria were identified. GSFBD comprised 2.0% of hospital presentations. Breeds with high-density coats were overrepresented. Otitis externa was the most common manifestation of GSFBD in the general practice (47%). In the referral practice pyothorax was the most common entity (34%). In both practices the range of clinical manifestations was broad, including a small number of dogs with catastrophic intracranial disease. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses demonstrated dogs with GSFBD had 3-fold greater odds of having medium coats than short coats and 5-fold less odds of being groomed.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Grass seeds are a major cause of disease in the dogs of south-west rural NSW, with presentations ranging from mild lameness to severe neurological disease. Some protection from GSFBD was achieved with frequent grooming. Clipping or coat searching without grooming was ineffective as a prevention strategy.","['Hicks A', 'Golland D', 'Heller J', 'Malik R', 'Combs M']",2016,94,3,Aust Vet J,"Hicks A, et al.

Resistance genes can be carried by integrons with quinolone resistance mainly due to mutations in DNA topoisomerases II and IV.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility, integron carriage, and gyrA and gyrB mutations in P. aeruginosa isolates from canine otitis and pyoderma.
ANIMALS: One hundred and four P. aeruginosa strains isolated from dogs with otitis externa (n = 93) and pyoderma (n = 11).
METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility against 16 antibacterial agents was evaluated through agar diffusion tests. Integron carriage, class and gyrA and gyrB mutations were analysed by PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-PCR and genetic sequencing assays.
RESULTS: Isolates were mostly resistant to enrofloxacin (72.2%) and ticarcillin (59.7%). Lower resistance to ciprofloxacin (7.7%), tobramycin (3.8%) and polymixin B (0.0%) was detected. Ten (9.6%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were detected. Eight (7.7%) strains carried class 1 integrons and this was associated with MDR (three isolates, P ≤ 0.05). Five of the integron-carrying strains exhibited aminoglycoside resistance genes. Mutations of gyrA and gyrB were observed in 10 isolates, seven of them resistant to all fluoroquinolones tested.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Enrofloxacin and ticarcilin resistance was widespread in P. aeruginosa isolated from dogs in Brazil.

26824911,Outcome predictors of treatment effectiveness for fungal malignant external otitis: a systematic review.,"The aim of this review is to summarise literature data on clinical aspects and traditional management of fungal malignant external otitis (FMEO), and to identify potential predictive factors of positive treatment outcome. Articles were initially selected based on their titles or abstracts. Full articles were then retrieved and further scrutinised according to predetermined criteria. Reference lists of selected articles were searched for any missed publications. The selected articles were methodologically evaluated. Of an initial 143 references, 14 were selected that focalised on the management of FMEO. The majority of studies demonstrated a correlation between treatment effectiveness, assessed as symptom resolution, and clinical and management variables: abstention from surgical debridement, absence of facial palsy, Aspergillus spp. as causative pathogen and absence of imaging findings at diagnosis and follow-up. The effectiveness of FMEO treatment depends on the assessment of cranial nerve state, the causative pathogen and imaging findings. Above all, absence of facial nerve palsy, Aspergillus spp. and absence of radiological signs at diagnosis and during follow-up correlate with symptom resolution. The fact that conservative treatment may be associated with a better outcome than surgical debridement could purely reflect that patients with more aggressive and advanced illness required debridement, whereas milder disease was treated conservatively. Thus, caution should be advised in the interpretation of data due to the need for further trials on the topic.","['Mion M', 'Bovo R', 'Marchese-Ragona R', 'Martini A']",2015,35,5,Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,"Mion M, et al.

Recently, this has been under threat of closure.
AIMS: We analyse and determine the role of this ED in the current context and compare results to a previous study from June 1990.
METHODS: A prospective study over a 1-month period (March 2014) was conducted. A questionnaire was used, adapted from the study in 1990.
RESULTS: Comparative figures from June 1990 are in parentheses. During the study period, there were 945 (1167) consultations from 887 (779) patients. 57 % (45 %) were new patients and 43 % (55 %) were return patients. Repeat attendances were necessary in 54 (325) patients during this month. 56 % (35 %) were referred by their General Practitioner (GP), 38 % (52 %) self-referred, 2 % (8 %) by other hospitals and 4 % (5 %) from other sources. Diagnoses included otitis externa in 24 % (21 %), cerumen in 20 % (15 %), epistaxis in 6 % (9 %), Eustachian tube dysfunction in 12 %, foreign body removal in 4 % (5 %) and four new cases of head and neck cancer. Attendance numbers vary during the year but demand has risen over time.

A total of 24 Wistar-Albino strain rats were included in the study. Standard myringotomies were performed on each rat. In the first group, isotonic serum physiologic was dropped on external ear canal (control group). Topical enoxaparin was dropped on external ear canal and daily topical doses of enoxaparin were dropped on external ear canal of the rats for 14 days (topical treatment group). Third group received subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin for 14 days (systemic treatment group). Five micrometer thick sections of the bullae of the rats were stained with H&E. Inflammation, edema and sclerotic lesions and neovascularization observed in the lamina propria layer of the tympanic membrane, and total thickness of the tympanic membrane were evaluated. In intergroup comparisons, significant difference in the distribution pattern of severity of inflammation in all three groups was not observed (p = 0.784, p > 0.05). Total TM thickness differed among all three groups (p = 0.028, p < 0.05).

Although there have been case reports of Aspergillus otitis externa in dogs, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first retrospective case series describing Aspergillus otitis in dogs and cats.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize signalment, putative risk factors, treatments and outcomes of a case series of dogs and cats with Aspergillus otitis.
ANIMALS: Eight dogs and nine cats diagnosed with Aspergillus otitis.
METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records from 1989 to 2014 identified animals diagnosed with Aspergillus otitis based on culture.
RESULTS: All dogs weighed greater than 23 kg. The most common putative risk factors identified in this study were concurrent diseases, therapy causing immunosuppression or a history of an otic foreign body. Aspergillus otitis was unilateral in all study dogs and most cats. Concurrent otitis media was confirmed in three dogs and one cat, and suspected in two additional cats. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common isolate overall and was the dominant isolate in cats. Aspergillus niger and A. terreus were more commonly isolated from dogs. Animals received various topical and systemic antifungal medications; however, otic lavage under anaesthesia and/or surgical intervention increased the likelihood of resolution of the fungal infection.
CONCLUSION: Aspergillus otitis is uncommon, typically seen as unilateral otitis externa in cats and larger breed dogs with possible risk factors that include immunosuppression and otic foreign bodies; previous antibiotic usage was common.","['Goodale EC', 'Outerbridge CA', 'White SD']",2016,27,1,Vet Dermatol,"Goodale EC, et al.

Thirty dogs of different breeds (mean age ± SEM; 6.03 ± 0.15 years and mean weight ± SEM; 32.01 ± 1.17 Kg; 53.3% males, 46.6% females) with evident chronic clinical otitis symptoms were equally divided and randomly assigned to receive either the nutraceutical diet (ND group) or a standard diet (SD group) over a period of 90 days. In all cases a topical pharmacological treatment was given. The nutraceutical diet, also endowed with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, significantly decreased the mean score intensity of all symptoms after 90 days of intervention (P < 0.0001) with the exception of Malassezia pachydermatis infection which was only slightly reduced. Our investigation is one of the few evidence-based results where a commercial nutraceutical diet has been proven effective, in combination with drugs, in relieving otitis externa-related symptoms.

29461736,ENT indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.,"ENT indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is a treatment where patients breathe 100% oxygen while exposed to high environmental pressure in a hyperbaric chamber. This hyperoxygenation has several beneficial effects as an adjunctive treatment in a number of ENT-related conditions and diseases. These can be summarized as anti-ischaemic effects (delivery of oxygen to otherwise ischaemic tissues, reduction of ischaemia-reperfusion damage), anti-infectious effects (bacteriostasis, improved leucocyte phagocytosis bactericidal activity and optimization of antibiotic therapy) and wound-healing effects (stimulation of granulation tissue formation and stabilization). Since HBO therapy has a clear physiologic rationale, a demonstrated effect (although difficult to ""prove"" with placebo controlled randomized trials) in certain indications and certain side-effects, it is proposed that it should be considered an integral part of the (combined surgical and pharmacological) treatment of patients, and not simply as a supplementation of oxygen. Furthermore, the importance of a well-trained medical and technical staff to ensure proper selection and the correct follow-up of patients should not be underestimated.","['Germonpre P', 'Levie P', 'Dehalleux C', 'Caers D']",2016,Suppl 26,1,B-ENT,"Germonpre P, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To identify antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and methicillin-resistant strains among coagulase-positive staphylococci isolated from otitis externa in dogs.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed over 2 years on 114 client-owned dogs presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a primary complaint of ear infections. Swabs were obtained from both ears and cultured for staphylococci which were subsequently confirmed as coagulase-positive using rabbit plasma. Antimicrobial susceptibility assays were assessed on all isolates followed by subsequent genetic analysis for species identification and detection of the mecA gene.
RESULTS: Sixty-five coagulase-positive staphylococci were isolated from 114 client-owned dogs. The isolates exhibited resistance against neomycin (58.5%), streptomycin (49.2%), penicillin (49.2%), polymyxin B (44.6%), tetracycline (36.9%), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (33.8%), kanamycin (33.8%), doxycycline (32.3%), norfloxacin (23.1%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (20%), ciprofloxacin (20%), enrofloxacin (18.5%), gentamicin (16.9%), and cephalothin (9.2%). Forty (61.5%) of the isolates were resistant to at least three or more antimicrobials and 10 were sensitive to all. Using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay based on species-specific regions of the thermonuclease (nuc) gene, 38/65 (58.5%) isolates were classified as Staphylococcus aureus, 23/65 (35.4%) as S. pseudintermedius, 2/65 (3.1%) as S. intermedius, and 2/65 (3.1%) as S. schleiferi. Analysis for the mecA gene revealed two positive isolates of S. pseudintermedius which were oxacillin-resistant, representing a first report of such organisms in the Caribbean.
CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively high prevalence of multidrug-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci in Trinidad, these are largely susceptible to gentamicin consistent with use in clinical practice. The first detection of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) in dogs is likely to have implications on the treatment options for otitis externa in dogs and potential public health significance.","['Dziva F', 'Wint C', 'Auguste T', 'Heeraman C', 'Dacon C', 'Yu P', 'Koma LM']",2015,5,,Infect Ecol Epidemiol,"Dziva F, et al.

26692028,Proton Minibeam Radiation Therapy Reduces Side Effects in an In Vivo Mouse Ear Model.,"PURPOSE: Proton minibeam radiation therapy is a novel approach to minimize normal tissue damage in the entrance channel by spatial fractionation while keeping tumor control through a homogeneous tumor dose using beam widening with an increasing track length. In the present study, the dose distributions for homogeneous broad beam and minibeam irradiation sessions were simulated. Also, in an animal study, acute normal tissue side effects of proton minibeam irradiation were compared with homogeneous irradiation in a tumor-free mouse ear model to account for the complex effects on the immune system and vasculature in an in vivo normal tissue model.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: At the ion microprobe SNAKE, 20-MeV protons were administered to the central part (7.2 × 7.2 mm(2)) of the ear of BALB/c mice, using either a homogeneous field with a dose of 60 Gy or 16 minibeams with a nominal 6000 Gy (4 × 4 minibeams, size 0.18 × 0.18 mm(2), with a distance of 1.8 mm). The same average dose was used over the irradiated area.
RESULTS: No ear swelling or other skin reactions were observed at any point after minibeam irradiation. In contrast, significant ear swelling (up to fourfold), erythema, and desquamation developed in homogeneously irradiated ears 3 to 4 weeks after irradiation. Hair loss and the disappearance of sebaceous glands were only detected in the homogeneously irradiated fields.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that proton minibeam radiation therapy results in reduced adverse effects compared with conventional homogeneous broad-beam irradiation and, therefore, might have the potential to decrease the incidence of side effects resulting from clinical proton and/or heavy ion therapy.","['Girst S', 'Greubel C', 'Reindl J', 'Siebenwirth C', 'Zlobinskaya O', 'Walsh DWM', 'Ilicic K', 'Aichler M', 'Walch A', 'Wilkens JJ', 'Multhoff G', 'Dollinger G', 'Schmid TE']",2016,95,1,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"Girst S, et al.

26641820,Ear Mite Removal in the Santa Catalina Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis catalinae): Controlling Risk Factors for Cancer Development.,"Ear mites (Otodectes cynotis) and ear canal tumors are highly prevalent among federally endangered Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) living on Santa Catalina Island off the coast of Southern California. Since studies began in the 1990s, nearly all foxes examined were found to be infected with ear mites, and ceruminous gland tumors (carcinomas and adenomas) were detected in approximately half of all foxes ≥ 4 years of age. We hypothesized that reduction of ear mite infection would reduce otitis externa and ceruminous gland hyperplasia, a risk factor for tumor development. In this study, we conducted a randomized field trial to assess the impact of acaricide treatment on ear mite prevalence and intensity of infection, otitis externa, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, and mite-specific IgG and IgE antibody levels. Treatment was highly effective at eliminating mites and reducing otitis externa and ceruminous gland hyperplasia, and mite-specific IgG antibody levels were significantly lower among uninfected foxes. Ceruminous gland hyperplasia increased in the chronically infected, untreated foxes during the six month study. Our results provide compelling evidence that acaricide treatment is an effective means of reducing ear mites, and that mite removal in turn reduces ear lesions and mite-specific IgG antibody levels in Santa Catalina Island foxes. This study has advanced our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis which results in ceruminous gland tumors, and has helped inform management decisions that impact species conservation.","['Moriarty ME', 'Vickers TW', 'Clifford DL', 'Garcelon DK', 'Gaffney PM', 'Lee KW', 'King JL', 'Duncan CL', 'Boyce WM']",2015,10,12,PLoS One,"Moriarty ME, et al.

We found a remarkably high prevalence of ceruminous gland tumors in endangered foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) occurring on Santa Catalina Island (SCA)--48.9% of the dead foxes examined from 2001-2008 had tumors in their ears, and tumors were found in 52.2% of randomly-selected mature (≥ 4 years) foxes captured in 2007-2008, representing one of the highest prevalences of tumors ever documented in a wildlife population. In contrast, no tumors were detected in foxes from San Nicolas Island or San Clemente Island, although ear mites (Otodectes cynotis), a predisposing factor for ceruminous gland tumors in dogs and cats, were highly prevalent on all three islands. On SCA, otitis externa secondary to ear mite infection was highly correlated with ceruminous gland hyperplasia (CGH), and tumors were significantly associated with the severity of CGH, ceruminous gland dysplasia, and age group (older foxes). We propose a conceptual model for the formation of ceruminous gland tumors in foxes on SCA that is based on persistent, ubiquitous infection with ear mites, and an innate, over exuberant inflammatory and hyperplastic response of SCA foxes to these mites. Foxes on SCA are now opportunistically treated with acaricides in an attempt to reduce mite infections and the morbidity and mortality associated with this highly prevalent tumor.","['Vickers TW', 'Clifford DL', 'Garcelon DK', 'King JL', 'Duncan CL', 'Gaffney PM', 'Boyce WM']",2015,10,11,PLoS One,"Vickers TW, et al.

26611929,Surgical Management of Ear Diseases in Rabbits.,Otitis externa and media are frequently diagnosed disorders in rabbits and are particularly common in lop-eared breeds because of the specific anatomy of the ear canal. Medical management for otitis externa and media often provides only a temporary improvement in clinical signs. Surgery by means of partial or total ear canal ablation (PECA or TECA) combined with lateral bulla osteotomy (LBO) represents a feasible approach that is well tolerated and provides a good clinical outcome.

CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old diabetic male with persistent left temporomandibular joint ache and ear fullness was admitted with the diagnosis of MOE. He received intravenous ciprofloxacin for 14 days and then continued with oral administration (per os). After two months, he returned with otalgia, swallowing difficulty, and ipsilateral XII paresis. He was re-admitted, received intravenous ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks, and continued with per os ciprofloxacin for 6 months. A Ga67-scan 6 months after the first admission revealed no active infection. Two years after his last admission, the patient still has XII paresis. There is no other cranial nerve involvement and inflammatory markers continue to be normal.
CONCLUSION: Doctors should consider MOE in the differential diagnosis when there is XII paresis, especially in diabetic and immunocompromised patients.","['Exarchos ST', 'Lachanas VA', 'Tsiouvaka S', 'Kapsalaki E', 'Bizakis JG']",2015,11,3,B-ENT,"Exarchos ST, et al.

26586230,Diverse Cutaneous Presentations of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in Children: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease, frequently affecting young children.
PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective study in patients younger than 16 years old manifesting with skin symptoms, and documented their different cutaneous lesions and systemic symptoms. We compared subgroups of children with single-system, skin-only, and multisystem disease and sought signs predictive for multisystem disease. In a small sample of patients, BRAF mutations were analyzed in archived biopsies.
RESULTS: A wide spectrum of cutaneous presentations varying from crusted nodules and papules, blisters, vascular tumor-like lesions, scaling orange to red macules (frequently in seborrheic regions) to purpuric macules, and papules was documented in our cohort of 32 children. Otitis externa was a common manifestation and mucosal lesions were seen in three patients. A novel manifestation was a red-blue nodule that appeared in a patient after a vaccination. None of the cutaneous lesions was predictive for the classification or final outcome as a single-system or multisystem disease. However, later onset and a more protracted course of skin lesions were more frequent findings in multisystem LCH. Mucosal lesions and otitis externa were almost exclusively seen in patients with multisystem disease, a finding that warrants further investigation. Both wild-type (WT) and mutated BRAF were found not only in multisystem LCH, but also in skin-only LCH. Two cases with rapidly resolving congenital lesions had WT BRAF.
CONCLUSIONS: Late onset and a protracted course of skin lesions are associated with MS-LCH, whereas WT BRAF is found in rapidly resolving skin lesions.","['Morren MA', 'Vanden Broecke K', 'Vangeebergen L', 'Sillevis-Smitt JH', 'Van Den Berghe P', 'Hauben E', 'Jacobs S', 'Van Gool SW']",2016,63,3,Pediatr Blood Cancer,"Morren MA, et al.

26582835,Changes in the Population of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Dissemination of Antimicrobial-Resistant Phenotypes in the Netherlands.,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP), which is often multidrug resistant (MDR), has recently emerged as a threat to canine health worldwide. Knowledge of the temporal distribution of specific MRSP lineages, their antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, and their association with clinical conditions may help us to understand the emergence and spread of MRSP in dogs. The aim of this study was to determine the yearly proportions of MRSP lineages and their antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes in the Netherlands and to examine possible associations with clinical conditions. MRSP was first isolated from a canine specimen submitted for diagnostics to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Utrecht University in 2004. The annual cumulative incidence of MRSP among S. pseudintermedius increased from 0.9% in 2004 to 7% in 2013. MRSP was significantly associated with pyoderma and, to a lesser extent, with wound infections and otitis externa. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 478 MRSP isolates yielded 39 sequence types (ST) belonging to 4 clonal complexes (CC) and 15 singletons. CC71 was the dominant lineage that emerged since 2004, and CC258, CC45, and several unlinked isolates became more frequent during the following years. All but two strains conferred an MDR phenotype, but strains belonging to CC258 or singletons were less resistant. In conclusion, our study showed that MDR CC71 emerged as the dominant lineage from 2004 and onward and that less-resistant lineages were partly replacing CC71.","['Duim B', 'Verstappen KM', 'Broens EM', 'Laarhoven LM', 'van Duijkeren E', 'Hordijk J', 'de Heus P', 'Spaninks M', 'Timmerman AJ', 'Wagenaar JA']",2016,54,2,J Clin Microbiol,"Duim B, et al.

26559663,Comparison of lipid profiles of Malassezia pachydermatis strains isolated from dogs with otitis externa and without clinical symptoms of disease.,"Malassezia pachydermatis can cause infections of the skin and mucous membranes, especially in animals. It becomes a problem also in medicine. It is considered that metabolic disorders as well as hormonal and immunological status of the host promote diseases caused by M. pachydermatis. Here we consider whether specific features of fungi could also favour infections. We checked whether there are differences in lipid profiles between strains obtained from dogs with otitis externa and strains obtained from healthy dogs. Lipid profiles were determined using thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. All analyses were carried out on 32 strains derived from dogs with otitis externa and 31 strains isolated from dogs without symptoms of disease. The results show that strains isolated from dogs without symptoms of otitis externa are characterised by a higher content of fatty acids. They contain significantly more behenic and lignoceric acids on medium without addition of lipids, and more oleic acid and total monounsaturated fatty acids on medium with lipids supplementation. These strains have also a higher content of esters of ergosterol and triglycerides. Data obtained show differences which may be specific features of M. pachydermatis-specific strains related to the ability of infection, which could be not directly related of the host condition.","['Czyzewska U', 'Siemieniuk M', 'Pyrkowska A', 'Nowakiewicz A', 'Bieganska M', 'Dabrowska I', 'Bartoszewicz M', 'Dobrzyn P', 'Tylicki A']",2016,59,1,Mycoses,"Czyzewska U, et al.

26548100,[Complications Resulting from Taking Ear Impressions].,"In 2012, we carried out a study in a large sample to understand the secondary injuries caused during the taking ear impressions for hearing aids. This study is a follow-up of previous research conducted in 1986 (285 medical institutions) and 1999 (98 medical institutions). We posted a questionnaire survey to the otolaryngology departments of 3,257 medical institutions. The response rate to the questionnaire was 62.9% (2,050 of the 3,257 institutions), and the results indicated that 301 of the 2050 institutions (14.7%) had experience with secondary injuries, with a total of 460 cases reported. In 342 of the 460 cases (74.3%), the secondary injuries occurred at hearing-aid dealerships, followed by 67 cases (14.6%) at affiliated medical institutions, and 51 cases (11.1%) in other locations, including other medical institutions, rehabilitation counseling centers, and educational institutions. The most common type of secondary injury (298 cases, 64.8%) was caused by the presence of foreign bodies in the ear, which in turn was a result of complications occurring during the removal of residual ear impression material. Of these 298 cases, 32 required excision of the foreign bodies and surgical intervention under general anesthesia. The remaining 10 cases exhibited isolated tympanic membrane perforation without foreign body-related complications. Furthermore, 146 cases (31.7%) developed bleeding and otitis externa following removal of the ear impression, and there were reports of cases with bleeding that required long-term outpatient care and treatment. Therefore, since retention of a foreign body in the ear and tympanic membrane perforation can occur even in patients without a history of surgery or prior otologic history, adjustment of hearing aids requires prior otorhinolaryngological examination. Furthermore, because of the risk of secondary injury when taking ear impressions, this procedure must be performed with caution under the guidance of an otolaryngologist.","['Sugiuchi T', 'Kodera K', 'Zusho H', 'Asano Y', 'Kanesada K', 'Hayashida M', 'Kanaya K', 'Tokumaru T']",2015,118,8,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho,"Sugiuchi T, et al.

26545478,Provider and patient drivers of ototopical antibiotic prescription variability.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if providers prescribe more affordable topical antibacterial therapy for patients who are economically disadvantaged or come from economically disadvantaged communities.
STUDY DESIGN: Prescription drug database review.
SETTING: Large academic hospital network.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ototopical prescription records of 2416 adults and children presenting with acute and chronic otologic infections from 2009 to 2013 were reviewed. Prescription, patient, provider, and institution variables including diagnosis, prescription type, demographics, health insurance status, healthcare provider type and setting were analyzed.
RESULTS: Otitis externa and acute otitis media were the most common diagnoses. Non-OHNS (Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery) providers served 82% of all patients. OHNS providers prescribed proportionally less fluoroquinolone, and more brand-name antibiotics compared to non-OHNS providers. Adults were more likely to receive a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a generic prescription versus pediatric patients. Patients who self-identified as 'white' ethnicity received proportionally more fluoroquinolone prescriptions than patients who identified as 'non-white,' but there was no difference in provider type. The proportion of fluoroquinolone prescriptions was significantly higher in patients from low-poverty counties, however poverty level was not associated with patients seeing a particular provider type. The majority of our patients had commercial insurance, followed by Medicaid. Medicare patients had the lowest proportion of fluoroquinolone antibiotic prescriptions, and were less likely to receive fluoroquinolone prescriptions versus commercial insurance. Non-insured patients received proportionally more generic versus brand prescriptions than insured patients.

26535455,Retrospective Evaluation of Canine Dermatitis Secondary to Corynebacterium spp.,"Corynebacterium species are considered nonpathogenic in canine dermatitis; however, potential clinical significance has been demonstrated in canine otitis externa and from a dog bite wound in a human. Objectives of this study were to identify the predominant Corynebacterium species present in lesions of canine dermatitis, assess pathogenic role, determine antimicrobial susceptibility, and evaluate clinical response. Of 37 isolates identified as Corynebacterium, 31 were Corynebacterium auriscanis . Most Corynebacterium isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol (97%), tetracyclines (92%), and amikacin (89%); isolate susceptibilities to β-lactams, trimethoprim-sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones were <50%. Most cultures grew mixed populations of bacteria; C. auriscanis was the only organism isolated in three patients. At recheck, 2-8 wk after initial presentation, pleomorphic rods were absent or significantly decreased in all patients. Two of three C. auriscanis isolates were obtained in pure culture and were evaluable, meaning patient had an initial exam and recheck examination. Both patients were already on antimicrobials to which C. auriscanis was resistant in vitro. Both improved after doxycycline administration. C. auriscanis may act as an opportunistic pathogen in canine dermatitis and may not respond to antimicrobial therapy based on susceptibilities for other organisms in mixed infections. Occasionally, Corynebacterium isolated alone may be pathogenic.","['Boynosky NA', 'Stokking LB']",2015,51,6,J Am Anim Hosp Assoc,Boynosky NA and Stokking LB.

26527257,"Is transmission electron microscopy (TEM) a promising approach for qualitative and quantitative investigations of polymyxin B and miconazole interactions with cellular and subcellular structures of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Malassezia pachydermatis?","Antimicrobial therapy using a combination of polymyxin B and miconazole is effective against the main bacterial pathogens associated with otitis externa in dogs, and a synergistic effect of both drugs has been shown previously. The objective of the present investigation was to visualize ultrastructural changes after exposure of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Malassezia pachydermatis to polymyxin B and miconazole by transmission electron microscopic (TEM). For this, cultures of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. pseudintermedius and M. pachydermatis were exposed to polymyxin B and miconazole, alone or in combination for 24 h. Ultrastructural changes were observed most frequently in the cell envelope of the four microorganisms. Exposure to polymyxin B seemed to cause more damage than miconazole within the range of concentrations applied. Treatment resulted in changes of the cell size: in E. coli, cell size increased significantly after treatment with either compound alone; in P. aeruginosa, cell size decreased significantly after treatment with polymyxin B and with miconazole; exposure of S. pseudintermedius to miconazole caused a decrease in cell size; in M. pachydermatis, cell size increased significantly after treatment with polymyxin B.; in E.coli, S. pseudintermedius and M. pachydermatis, cell size changed highly significant, in P. aeruginosa significantly after exposure to the combination of both compounds. In conclusion, by using a different approach than previous investigations, this study confirmed a clear combinatory effect of polymyxin B and miconazole against the tested microorganisms involved in canine otitis externa. It is the first time that visualization technologies were applied to compare the effect of single drugs to their combinatory effects on cellular and subcellular entities of selected bacterial and yeast species.","['Voget M', 'Lorenz D', 'Lieber-Tenorio E', 'Hauck R', 'Meyer M', 'Cieslicki M']",2015,181,3-4,Vet Microbiol,"Voget M, et al.

26492256,Assessment of the Antimicrobial Activity of Algae Extracts on Bacteria Responsible of External Otitis.,"External otitis is a diffuse inflammation around the external auditory canal and auricle, which is often occurred by microbial infection. This disease is generally treated using antibiotics, but the frequent occurrence of antibiotic resistance requires the development of new antibiotic agents. In this context, unexplored bioactive natural candidates could be a chance for the production of targeted drugs provided with antimicrobial activity. In this paper, microbial pathogens were isolated from patients with external otitis using ear swabs for over one year, and the antimicrobial activity of the two methanol extracts from selected marine (Dunaliella salina) and freshwater (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) microalgae was tested on the isolated pathogens. Totally, 114 bacterial and 11 fungal strains were isolated, of which Staphylococcus spp. (28.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (24.8%) were the major pathogens. Only three Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) strains and 11 coagulase-negative Staphylococci showed resistance to methicillin. The two algal extracts showed interesting antimicrobial properties, which mostly inhibited the growth of isolated S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp. with MICs range of 1.4 × 10⁸ to 2.2 × 10(10) cells/mL. These results suggest that the two algae have potential as resources for the development of antimicrobial agents.","['Pane G', 'Cacciola G', 'Giacco E', 'Mariottini GL', 'Coppo E']",2015,13,10,Mar Drugs,"Pane G, et al.

26490820,A probable case of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion associated with linezolid.,"PURPOSE: A probable case of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) due to linezolid use is reported.
SUMMARY: An 81-year-old Korean woman hospitalized for progressive malignant otitis externa due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection was started on linezolid therapy (600 mg i.v. twice daily). On day 22 of linezolid use, the patient had severe hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration, 118 meq/L), with stable vital signs and no specific physical findings except for somnolence. The patient's urine sodium concentration was 1183 meq/L, and her serum and urine osmolarity values were 250 and 357 mOsm/kg, respectively; these findings were consistent with SIADH. Hypertonic saline infusion and fluid restriction (<1 L/day) were continued for four days with the aim of achieving a desired serum sodium concentration of 130 meq/L. On day 26 of linezolid therapy, the drug was discontinued due to development of progressive anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 6.7 g/dL). The next day, the patient's serum sodium concentration increased abruptly to 135 meq/L and remained stable until hospital discharge. After multiple alternative etiologies were excluded, drug-induced SIADH due to linezolid use was determined to be the most likely diagnosis. Using the adverse drug reaction probability scale of Naranjo et al., the case was assigned a score of 6, indicating a probable association between linezolid use and SIADH.
CONCLUSION: SIADH was observed in a woman who was administered linezolid for more than three weeks, with concurrent development of progressive severe anemia associated with linezolid toxicity. The patient's hyponatremia resolved after cessation of linezolid use.","['Baik SH', 'Choi YK', 'Kim HS', 'Yoon YK', 'Sohn JW', 'Kim MJ']",2015,72,21,Am J Health Syst Pharm,"Baik SH, et al.

26464604,Pontine Infarct Presenting with Atypical Dental Pain: A Case Report.,"Orofacial pain' most commonly occurs due to dental causes like caries, gingivitis or periodontitis. Other common causes of 'orofacial pain' are sinusitis, temporomandibular joint(TMJ) dysfunction, otitis externa, tension headache and migraine. In some patients, the etiology of 'orofacial pain' remains undetected despite optimal evaluation. A few patients in the practice of clinical dentistry presents with dental pain without any identifiable dental etiology. Such patients are classified under the category of 'atypical odontalgia'. 'Atypical odontalgia' is reported to be prevalent in 2.1% of the individuals. 'Atypical orofacial pain' and 'atypical odontalgia' can result from the neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis, trigeminal neuralgia and herpes infection. Trigeminal neuralgia has been frequently documented as a cause of 'atypical orofacial pain' and 'atypical odontalgia'. There are a few isolated case reports of acute pontine stroke resulting in 'atypical orofacial pain' and 'atypical odontalgia'. However, pontine stroke as a cause of atypical odontalgia is limited to only a few cases, hence prevalence is not established. This case is one, where a patient presented with acute onset atypical dental pain with no identifiable dental etiology, further diagnosed as an acute pontine infarct on neuroimaging. A 40 years old male presented with acute onset, diffuse teeth pain on right side. Dental examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) of the brain had an acute infarct in right pons near the trigeminal root entry zone(REZ). Pontine infarct presenting with dental pain as a manifestation of trigeminal neuropathy, has rarely been reported previously.

26429555,Heterotopic ossification in chronic fibrosing otitis externa.,"Acquired external auditory canal atresia is a rare complication of chronic inflammatory otitis, and is generally fibrous or soft tissue in nature. Here, we present the first reported case of heterotopic ossification within chronic fibrosing otitis externa in a 25-year-old male patient with a childhood history of granular myringitis and failed tympanoplasty. A calcified mass was demonstrated adjacent to the tympanic membrane on CT imaging, and surgical exploration revealed a cohesive bar of bone traversing the medial external auditory canal. Drill canaloplasty and split-thickness skin graft coverage of the lateral tympanic membrane resulted in an improvement in the pure tone average from 79 to 55 dB. As the treatment for chronic fibrosing otitis externa involves the surgical widening of the external auditory canal, we alert surgeons to the possibility of cohesive bone formation as a potential cause of navigational confusion and inadvertent over- or under-drilling of the canal stenosis.","['Maughan EF', 'Bhutta MF', 'Lavy J']",2015,2015,10,J Surg Case Rep,"Maughan EF, et al.

26424913,Use of ImageJ software for histomorphometric evaluation of normal and severely affected canine ear canals.,"Morphological studies comparing normal and diseased ear canals use primarily subjective scoring. The aim of this study was to compare normal and severely affected ears in dogs with objective measurements using ImageJ software. Ear canals were harvested from cadavers with normal ears and from dogs that underwent total ear canal ablation for unresolved otitis. Histopathology samples from ear canals were evaluated by semi-quantitative scoring and also by using ImageJ-software for histomorphometric measurements. The normal ears were compared to the severely affected ears using the 2 methods. The 2 methods were significantly (P < 0.0001) correlated for epidermal hyperplasia, ceruminous gland dilation, and hyperplasia and tissue inflammation, which were significantly greater in the severely affected ears (P < 0.0001). This study demonstrated that there is a very high correlation between the 2 methods for the most markedly affected components of otitis externa and that ImageJ software can be efficiently used to measure and evaluate ear canal histomorphometry.","['Zur G', 'Klement E']",2015,79,4,Can J Vet Res,Zur G and Klement E.

This study assessed a mycological analysis of fungal debris from externalauditory canals of patients at Tanta University Hospital, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples were collected over a year from the 110 patients that were clinically diagnosed to have otomycosis. The samples were then inoculated and culture plates were examined for the presence of fungal growth.
RESULTS: The results showed that Aspergillus niger was the most common fungus causing otomycosis. It was more common among males aged 21-40 years. The incidence was higher in the summer and spring seasons. Manual workers and students had the highest frequency based on occupational incidence. The most common presenting complaint was itching. Trauma to the external auditory canal was the most common predisposing factor.

26404519,Emergence of biofilm-producing Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from healthy dogs in South Korea.,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a common bacterial pathogen in dogs with pyoderma, otitis externa, and wound infection.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biofilm-producing ability for methicillin-resistant (MRSP) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSP) S. pseudintermedius isolates from healthy dogs.
ANIMALS AND METHODS: Ninety-two isolates, consisting of 40 MRSPs and 52 MSSPs, were included in the study. Biofilm production was determined using a quantitative adherence assay in 96-well tissue culture plates and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting icaA and icaD genes. The prevalence of methicillin-resistance in the isolated S. pseudintermedius was calculated using standard equations. The presence of methicillin resistance (MR) and biofilm-producing ability between nasal- and ocular-origin S. pseudintermedius was compared using the chi-square (χ(2)) test. The associations between the degree of biofilm production and the presence of methicillin-resistance or sample origin were determined using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: All of the MRSP and MSSP isolates were able to produce biofilms, and 93.5% of the isolates were strong or moderate biofilm producers, regardless of the presence of methicillin-resistance or source. Methicillin-resistance was more prevalent in nasal isolates. There was no association between the presence of icaA/icaD and biofilm production.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate a high prevalence of biofilm-producing S. pseudintermedius in healthy dogs in South Korea, which may have a significant influence to animal health.","['Han JI', 'Yang CH', 'Park HM']",2015,35,4,Vet Q,"Han JI, et al.

26401332,Prevalence of disorders recorded in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels attending primary-care veterinary practices in England.,"BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised over breed-related health issues in purebred dogs, but reliable prevalence estimates for disorders within specific breeds are sparse. Electronically stored patient health records from primary-care practice are emerging as a useful source of epidemiological data in companion animals. This study used large volumes of health data from UK primary-care practices participating in the VetCompass animal health surveillance project to evaluate in detail the disorders diagnosed in a random selection of over 50% of dogs recorded as Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs). Confirmation of breed using available microchip and Kennel Club (KC) registration data was attempted.
RESULTS: In total, 3624 dogs were recorded as CKCSs within the VetCompass database of which 143 (3.9%) were confirmed as KC-registered via microchip identification linkage of VetCompass to the KC database. 1875 dogs (75 KC registered and 1800 of unknown KC status, 52% of both groups) were randomly sampled for detailed clinical review. Clinical data associated with veterinary care were recorded in 1749 (93.3%) of these dogs. The most common specific disorders recorded during the study period were heart murmur (541 dogs, representing 30.9% of study group), diarrhoea of unspecified cause (193 dogs, 11.0%), dental disease (166 dogs, 9.5%), otitis externa (161, 9.2%), conjunctivitis (131, 7.4%) and anal sac infection (129, 7.4%). The five most common disorder categories were cardiac (affecting 31.7% of dogs), dermatological (22.2%), ocular (20.6%), gastrointestinal (19.3%) and dental/periodontal disorders (15.2%).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that many of the disorders commonly affecting CKCSs are largely similar to those affecting the general dog population presented for primary veterinary care in the UK. However, cardiac disease (and MVD in particular) continues to be of particular concern in this breed.
FURTHER WORK: This work highlights the value of veterinary practice based breed-specific epidemiological studies to provide targeted and evidence-based health policies. Further studies using electronic patient records in other breeds could highlight their potential disease predispositions.","['Summers JF', ""O'Neill DG"", 'Church DB', 'Thomson PC', 'McGreevy PD', 'Brodbelt DC']",2015,2,,Canine Genet Epidemiol,"Summers JF, et al.

26392911,Genotyping and characterisation of the secretory lipolytic enzymes of Malassezia pachydermatis isolates collected from dogs.,"INTRODUCTION: Malassezia species are commensals of normal skin microbial flora of humans and animals. These may become pathogenic under certain conditions such as those associated with atopic dermatitis or otitis externa in dogs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Isolates of Malassezia pachydermatis were obtained from 27 dogs with healthy external ears and 32 dogs with otitis externa. Isolates were characterised on the basis of their first internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and internal spacer 1 (IGS1) sequences. Their extracellular lipase and phospholipase activity were also analysed. Three types of phospholipase inhibitor were used to identify the subclasses of phospholipase associated with otitis externa.
RESULTS: The clinical isolates were classified into three ITS and three IGS1 sequence types. No significant differences in pathogenicity were detected among the ITS or IGS1 genotypes, and all of the isolates exhibited similar levels of lipase activity. The isolates derived from the dogs with otitis externa showed significantly higher phospholipase activity than those obtained from the dogs with healthy external ears. A phospholipase D inhibitor reduced the phospholipase activity of the isolates obtained from the dogs with otitis externa.
CONCLUSIONS: This study did not show any significant differences in pathogenicity among the ITS or IGS1 genotypes but does suggest that phospholipase D might be one of the virulence factors involved in the inflammation of the external ear caused by M. pachydermatis.","['Teramoto H', 'Kumeda Y', 'Yokoigawa K', 'Hosomi K', 'Kozaki S', 'Mukamoto M', 'Kohda T']",2015,2,2,Vet Rec Open,"Teramoto H, et al.

26375971,Malignant Otitis Externa: A Novel Stratification Protocol for Predicting Treatment Outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: 1) Stratify malignant otitis externa into severe and nonsevere disease categories. 2) Predict treatment courses and outcomes based on this stratification.
SETTING: Tertiary center.
PATIENTS: Retrospective review 2004 to 2014; 28 patients. Inclusion criteria are a diagnosis by senior authors, radiographic evidence of disease, admission for intravenous antibiotics/debridement, minimum 1 year of follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS: Severe group stratification if two or more of the following: cranial nerve VII palsy, fungal positive culture, relapse, surgery performed, major radiographic findings. All other patients stratified to nonsevere group.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cure, alive/refractory disease, death by disease, death by other cause. Secondary measures are antibiotic duration and number of disease-related admissions.
RESULTS: Forty-three percent (12 of 28) and 57% (16 of 28) of patients stratified into the severe and nonsevere groups. The severe group had significantly more adverse disease-specific outcomes than the nonsevere group (7 of 12 versus 0 of 16; p = 0.002). Disease-specific mortality was 42% and 0% in the severe and nonsevere groups, respectively. The severe group had longer antibiotic courses (12.8 versus 6.9 wk; p = 0.01) and more disease-related admissions/relapses (1.6 versus 1, p < 0.001). Only four of 12 severe group patients achieved cure. All but two nonsevere patients achieved cure, with those two dying of other causes.
CONCLUSION: A subgroup of malignant otitis externa may exist that is not as susceptible to parenteral antibiotics and local debridement. A combination of clinical and radiographic findings may be useful for stratifying patients into severe/nonsevere categories. Patients with severe disease may be more likely to die of their disease and have worse treatment courses such that additional surgical intervention may be indicated.","['Stevens SM', 'Lambert PR', 'Baker AB', 'Meyer TA']",2015,36,9,Otol Neurotol,"Stevens SM, et al.

26364889,"Objective Evaluation of Otoscopy Skills Among Family and Community Medicine, Pediatric, and Otolaryngology Residents.","INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the perceived need for otolaryngology training and otoscopy diagnostic skills in primary care (Family and Community Medicine, Pediatric Medicine), and Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery (OTO-HNS) postgraduate trainees. Participant otoscopy skills were evaluated using the OtoSim simulator.
METHODS: Family and Community Medicine, Pediatric, and OTO-HNS residents were recruited. Each resident participated in 3 separate otoscopy training and assessment sessions. The ability to correctly identify middle ear pathology was objectively evaluated using OtoSim™. Pretest, posttest, and 3-month retention test results were compared among residents in a paired comparison paradigm. Survey data assessing exposure to OTO-HNS during undergraduate and postgraduate training were also collected.
RESULTS: A total of 57 residents participated in the study. All residents reported limited exposure to OTO-HNS during undergraduate medical training. Primary care trainees performed poorly on pretest assessments (30% ± 7.8%; 95% CI). Significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy was demonstrated following a single 1-hour teaching session (30%-62%; p < 0.001). Primary care residents demonstrated a significant decrease in diagnostic accuracy at a 3-month follow-up assessment (62%-52%, p < 0.001). Self-perceived comfort with otology was poorly correlated to pretest performance among primary care trainees (r = 0.26) and showed a stronger positive correlation among OTO-HNS trainees (r = 0.56).
CONCLUSIONS: A single teaching session with an otoscopy simulator significantly improved diagnostic accuracy in primary care and OTO-HNS trainees. Improved performance is susceptible to deterioration at 3 months if acquired skills are not frequently used. Self-perceived comfort with otology may not be an accurate predictor of otoscopic diagnostic skill.","['Oyewumi M', 'Brandt MG', 'Carrillo B', 'Atkinson A', 'Iglar K', 'Forte V', 'Campisi P']",2016,73,1,J Surg Educ,"Oyewumi M, et al.

26328002,Pattern of otitis externa in Kaduna Nigeria.,"INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa (OE) is an inflammation or infection of the external auditory canal (EAC), the auricle, or both this condition has been reported to be found in all age groups. The aims and objectives were, study/determine the prevalence of Otitis externa in the specialist otolaryngology clinic in National Ear Care Center Kaduna, study the pattern of presentation among patients with otitis externa in the specialist otolaryngology clinic in National Ear Care Center Kaduna, and evaluate the choice of drug treatment for otitis externa in the specialist otolaryngology clinic in National Ear Care Center Kaduna.
METHODS: Data of patients diagnosed with otitis externa between January 2009 and March 2013 were extracted from the recorded cases of ear disease seen within the same period. The ages, sex/ gender, complains(symptoms), duration of symptoms, clinical examination findings, diagnosis, mode of drug treatment, number of visits and complication records were extracted from the case notes of the patients and analyzed descriptively using SPSS (Statistical package for Social Sciences) version.
RESULTS: Out of 13,328 cases of ear diseases seen within the period under review, 133 cases were diagnosed with otitis externa across all age groups. Hospital prevalence stands at 1.0%. There were 81(60.9%) males and 52(39.1%) females in ratio 1.5:1. Children age 0-15 constitute 55(41.3%) while young adults and adults were 78(58.6%). The minimum age at presentation was one year, while maximum age was 64 years. Mean age was 24 years with a standard deviation of ± 1.12 Years. Ear pain as only presenting symptom was the major complain found in this study accounting for 68(51.1%). Acute diffuse otitis externa was the commonest diagnosis accounting for 101(75.9%) and associated clinical findings ranging from tragal tenderness, hyperaemia and oedema of ear canal in 57 (54.9%). Ear swab was not routinely done and only 6(15.8%) of the discharging ears had microscopy done and the organisms were Pseudomonas spp and klebsiella. Empirical treatment was the commonest treatment modality and about 91% of the patients had complete symptom resolution by second visit. Complication was observed in only one case of necrotizing otitis externa who was retro-viral positive.
CONCLUSION: Otitis externa accounted for small fraction of cases seen in our clinic (1%). Acute diffuse otitis externa is the commonest diagnosis made with symptoms ranging from ear pain, ear discharge, hearing loss and itchiness. Most patients were treated empirically with significant success within first two visits. No major complication was recorded within the period under study.","['Musa TS', 'Bemu AN', 'Grema US', 'Kirfi AM']",2015,21,,Pan Afr Med J,"Musa TS, et al.

A severe otitis externa (OE) and mastoiditis were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical drainage. No bacteria was isolated from surgical samples. Because the otalgia persisted, a magnetic resonance (MR) was performed and showed an infiltrating process at the skull base. Biopsies failed to prove malignancy or granulomatosis. The patient's neurological state deteriorated. The suspicion of a skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) was raised and proven by CT-guided biopsies that grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Meropenem and ciprofloxacin, given for 8 weeks, lead to a fast clinical improvement and a full recovery. SBO is uncommon, often complicating severe OE. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main pathogen. Prompt diagnosis and adequate antibiotherapy are required to lower mortality and morbidity. The diagnosis may be delayed because of unawareness and large differential diagnosis including solid neoplasic tumours, malignant hemopathies and granulomatosis.","['Orioli L', 'Boute C', 'Eloy P', 'De Wispelaere JF', 'De Coene B', 'Huang TD', 'Ausselet N', 'Delaere B']",2015,70,4,Acta Clin Belg,"Orioli L, et al.

26223723,Malignant Otitis Externa - A Retrospective Study of 15 Patients Treated in a Tertiary Healthcare Center.,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is an uncommon but potentially fatal disease of the external auditory canal. The study aimed at evaluating the demographic profile, coexisting disabilities, clinical presentations, and management of MOE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with MOE who were treated at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of our institution. The case records of patients treated between 2006 and 2013 for MOE were reviewed from the Medical Records Department of the hospital. The details were tabulated in a master chart, and the data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients with MOE were treated as inpatients at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of our hospital during the study period. Of these, 12 were males and three were females. Among the 15 patients, 14 were diabetic and one was non-diabetic. Earache was the most common symptom observed in all patients; edema and granulations in the ear canal was the most common sign observed in 12 patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 11 patients. All patients were managed medically with intravenous antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: MOE is a rare but aggressive condition affecting the external ear, which is commonly observed in elderly diabetic individuals. Immune senescence may be the cause of MOE in elderly people. Pseudomonas is the most common causative organism isolated in this condition. Most of these patients can be managed with medical treatment; reserving surgery only for the removal of granulation tissue and for histopathological examination.","['Bhat V', 'Aziz A', 'Bhandary SK', 'Aroor R', 'Kamath P SD', 'Saldanha M']",2015,11,1,J Int Adv Otol,"Bhat V, et al.

METHODS: To assess the role of the shape of the OEAC in troublesome modified radical cavities using computed tomographic scans of three groups of patients (without pathology and with or without draining cavities), we determined the depth of the pretympanic recess (DPTR) and its anterior curvature (ACPTR). In addition to looking at the shape of the OEAC, we also studied the role of any remaining mastoid air cells in relation to troublesome radical cavities, as well as the consultation frequency.
RESULTS: The DPTR was significantly deeper in draining cavities than in ears without pathology and dry cavities. No difference in the ACPTR was observed. The presence of remaining mastoid air cells is significantly associated with the presence of a troublesome radical cavity.
CONCLUSIONS: The shape of the OEAC (i.e., the DPTR) is a contributory factor to the drainage of modified radical cavities.

Ear infections are infrequent. We report an exceptional case of S. apiospermum external otitis complicated by temporomandibular joint arthritis. After 6 months of antibiotherapy, diagnosis was established by mycological analysis of external auditory canal and infratemporal fossae needle sampling. A satisfactory outcome was obtained after 2 months of voriconazole alone. We have reviewed 15 cases of S. apiospermum otitis. Seven of these patients were immunocompromised. Most common clinical presentation included a chronic external otitis lasting months or years before complication stage. Most common clinical features included recurrent unilateral otalgia (11/15) and purulent otorrhea (13/15). Diagnosis was often made at later stage (12/15) with local extension to bones and/or soft tissues (9/15) or cerebral lethal dissemination (3/15).The extremely low incidence of S. apiospermum otomycosis and its non-specific presentation results in a frequent diagnosis delay. A mycological investigation should be performed in case of persistent external otitis and/or osteolysis despite prolonged antibiotic treatment to prevent further extension of the disease.","['Huguenin A', 'Noel V', 'Rogez A', 'Chemla C', 'Villena I', 'Toubas D']",2015,180,3-4,Mycopathologia,"Huguenin A, et al.

26074134,Otitis externa.,"INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, in humid environments, in people with narrow ear canals, in hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.
METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of empirical treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).
RESULTS: Nine studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid, topical aluminium acetate, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical corticosteroids, and combinations of these agents.","['Hajioff D', 'MacKeith S']",2015,2015,,BMJ Clin Evid,Hajioff D and MacKeith S.

25990028,Necrotising (malignant) otitis externa in the UK: a growing problem. Review of five cases and analysis of national Hospital Episode Statistics trends.,"BACKGROUND: Necrotising (malignant) otitis externa is a severe infection causing temporal bone osteomyelitis. Although rare, our experience (reported herein) shows local doubling of cases in 2013. Hospital Episodes Statistics data for England over 14 years also indicate increased incidence nationally. Specific learning points in management are also discussed.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients admitted in 2013 to Wexham Park Hospital, Slough, UK (catchment population, 450 000). In addition, the UK Government Hospital Episodes Statistics data were interrogated.
RESULTS: There were five cases of necrotising (malignant) otitis externa in 2013, representing a local doubling on previous years. The mean age of patients was 82 years. All cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa; no isolates were antibiotic resistant. All patients responded to systemic anti-pseudomonals on clinical, biochemical and radiological parameters. Hospital Episodes Statistics data showed a six-fold increase in the number of cases from 1999 (n = 67) to 2013 (n = 421).
CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests increasing necrotising (malignant) otitis externa incidence, and retrospective analysis of Hospital Episodes Statistics data supports this observation. Necrotising (malignant) otitis externa poses challenges in management, as exemplified in our cases, requiring a high index of suspicion and early aggressive treatment to achieve cure.","['Chawdhary G', 'Liow N', 'Democratis J', 'Whiteside O']",2015,129,6,J Laryngol Otol,"Chawdhary G, et al.

25888308,Th17 cytokine deficiency in patients with Aspergillus skull base osteomyelitis.,"BACKGROUND: Fungal skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is a severe complication of otitis externa or sinonasal infection, and is mainly caused by Aspergillus species. Here we investigate innate and adaptive immune responses in patients with Aspergillus SBO to identify defects in the immune response that could explain the susceptibility to this devastating disease.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from six patients with Aspergillus SBO and healthy volunteers were stimulated with various microbial stimuli, among which also the fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNFα and IL-1β, and the T-helper cell-derived cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-22 were measured in cell culture supernatants by ELISA.
RESULTS: Proinflammatory cytokine responses did not differ between SBO patients and healthy volunteers. The Candida- and Aspergillus-specific Th17 response (production of IL-17 and IL-22) was significantly decreased in the SBO patients compared to healthy individuals, while Th1 cytokine response (IFNγ production) did not differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that patients with Aspergillus skull base osteomyelitis infection have specific defects in Th17 responses. Since IL-17 and IL-22 are important for stimulating antifungal host defense, we hypothesize that strategies that have the ability to improve IL-17 and IL-22 production may be useful as adjuvant immunotherapy in patients with Aspergillus SBO.","['Delsing CE', 'Becker KL', 'Simon A', 'Kullberg BJ', 'Bleeker-Rovers CP', 'van de Veerdonk FL', 'Netea MG']",2015,15,,BMC Infect Dis,"Delsing CE, et al.

METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional door-to-door survey was carried out in two districts of Delhi, and involved children of all demographic sections of the region. A total of 4626 children aged between 18 days and 15 years underwent examinations including otoscopy, impedance audiometry and hearing screening.
RESULTS: In all, 14.8 per cent of the study sample was diagnosed with one or more ear morbidities, the most common being cerumen impaction (7.5 per cent) and chronic suppurative otitis media (3.6 per cent). There was clinical evidence of otitis media with effusion in 2 per cent of children, and 0.96 per cent had otitis externa (bacterial and fungal). The point prevalence of acute suppurative otitis media was 0.39 per cent. In all, 0.45 per cent of children were found to have an undiagnosed foreign body within the ear canal.

25836375,Protective effect of small molecule analogues of the Acanthocheilonema viteae secreted product ES-62 on oxazolone-induced ear inflammation.,"ES-62 is the major secreted protein of the rodent filarial nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae. The molecule contains covalently attached phosphorylcholine (PC) residues, which confer anti-inflammatory properties on ES-62, underpinning the idea that drugs based on this active moiety may have therapeutic potential in human diseases associated with aberrant inflammation. Here we demonstrate that two synthetic small molecule analogues (SMAs) of ES-62 termed SMA 11a and SMA 12b are protective in the oxazolone-induced acute allergic contact dermatitis mouse model of skin inflammation, as measured by a significant reduction in ear inflammation following their administration before oxazolone sensitisation and before oxazolone challenge. Furthermore, it was found that when tested, 12b was effective at reducing ear swelling even when first administered before challenge. Histological analysis of the ears showed elevated cellular infiltration and collagen deposition in oxazolone-treated mice both of which were reduced by treatment with the two SMAs. Likewise, the oxazolone-induced increase in IFNγ mRNA in the ears was reduced but no effect on other cytokines investigated was observed. Finally, no influence on the mast cell populations in the ear was observed.","['Al-Riyami L', 'Rodgers DT', 'Rzepecka J', 'Pineda MA', 'Suckling CJ', 'Harnett MM', 'Harnett W']",2015,158,,Exp Parasitol,"Al-Riyami L, et al.

25823453,Evaluating synergy between marbofloxacin and gentamicin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from dogs with otitis externa.,"The aim of this study was to determine antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to marbofloxacin and gentamicin, and investigate the possible synergistic, additive, indifferent or antagonistic effects between the two agents. P. aeruginosa strains can develop resistance quickly against certain antibiotics if used alone, thus the need emerges to find synergistic combinations. A total of 68 P. aeruginosa strains isolated from dogs were examined. In order to describe interactions between marbofloxacin and gentamicin the checkerboard microdilution method was utilized. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) for marbofloxacin and gentamicin were in the range 0.25-64 mg/L and 0.25-32 mg/L, respectively. The combination of marbofloxacin and gentamicin was more effective with a MIC range of 0.031-8 mg/L and a MIC90 of 1 mg/L, compared to 16 mg/L for marbofloxacin alone and 8 mg/L for gentamicin alone. The FIC (fractional inhibitory concentration) indices ranged from 0.0945 (pronounced synergy) to 1.0625 (indifference). Synergy between marbofloxacin and gentamicin was found in 33 isolates. The mean FIC index is 0.546, which represents a partial synergistic/additive effect close to the full synergy threshold. In vitro results indicate that marbofloxacin and gentamicin as partially synergistic agents may prove clinically useful in combination therapy against P. aeruginosa infections. Although marbofloxacin is not used in the human practice, the interactions between fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides may have importance outside the veterinary field.","['Jerzsele Á', 'Pásztiné-Gere E']",2015,62,1,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung,Jerzsele Á and Pásztiné-Gere E.

25821823,Topical anti-inflammatory effects of isorhamnetin glycosides isolated from Opuntia ficus-indica.,"Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) has been widely used in Mexico as a food and for the treatment of different health disorders such as inflammation and skin aging. Its biological properties have been attributed to different phytochemicals such as the isorhamnetin glycosides which are the most abundant flavonoids. Moreover, these compounds are considered a chemotaxonomic characteristic of OFI species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of OFI extract and its isorhamnetin glycosides on different inflammatory markers in vitro and in vivo. OFI extract was obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of OFI cladodes powder and pure compounds were obtained by preparative chromatography. Nitric oxide (NO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α, and interleukin- (IL-) 6 production were measured. NO production was tested in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells while in vivo studies were carried on croton oil-induced ear edema model. OFI extract and diglycoside isorhamnetin-glucosyl-rhamnoside (IGR) at 125 ng/mL suppressed the NO production in vitro (73.5 ± 4.8% and 68.7 ± 5.0%, resp.) without affecting cell viability. Likewise, IGR inhibited the ear edema (77.4 ± 5.7%) equating the indomethacin effects (69.5 ± 5.3%). Both IGR and OFI extract significantly inhibited the COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6 production. IGR seems to be a suitable natural compound for development of new anti-inflammatory ingredient.","['Antunes-Ricardo M', 'Gutiérrez-Uribe JA', 'Martínez-Vitela C', 'Serna-Saldívar SO']",2015,2015,,Biomed Res Int,"Antunes-Ricardo M, et al.

25784510,Echinacea reduces the risk of recurrent respiratory tract infections and complications: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory tract infections are common, and these infections occur frequently in children, susceptible adults, and older persons. The risk for recurrences and complications relates not only to the presence of viruses but also to immune function. Therefore, modulation of the immune system and antiviral interventions such as echinacea might reduce the risk of recurrences and possibly the development of complications.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CAplus, BIOSIS, CABA, AGRICOLA, TOXCENTER, SCISEARCH, NAHL, and NAPRALERT were searched for clinical trials that studied recurrent respiratory infections and complications on treatment with echinacea extracts in a generally healthy population. Two independent reviewers selected randomized, placebo-controlled studies of high methodological quality and a Jadad score of ≥4. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated according to a fixed effect model.
RESULTS: Six clinical studies with a total of 2458 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Use of echinacea extracts was associated with reduced risk of recurrent respiratory infections (RR 0.649, 95% CI 0.545-0.774; P < 0.0001). Ethanolic extracts from echinacea appeared to provide superior effects over pressed juices, and increased dosing during acute episodes further enhanced these effects. Three independent studies found that in individuals with higher susceptibility, stress or a state of immunological weakness, echinacea halved the risk of recurrent respiratory infections (RR 0.501, 95% CI 0.380-0.661; P < 0.0001). Similar preventive effects were observed with virologically confirmed recurrent infections (RR 0.420, 95% CI 0.222-0.796; P = 0.005). Complications including pneumonia, otitis media/externa, and tonsillitis/pharyngitis were also less frequent with echinacea treatment (RR 0.503, 95% CI 0.384-0.658; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Evidence indicates that echinacea potently lowers the risk of recurrent respiratory infections and complications thereof. Immune modulatory, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory effects might contribute to the observed clinical benefits, which appear strongest in susceptible individuals.","['Schapowal A', 'Klein P', 'Johnston SL']",2015,32,3,Adv Ther,"Schapowal A, et al.

25702897,Epidemiology of otologic diagnoses in United States emergency departments.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Otologic complaints may place a significant burden on emergency departments (EDs) in the United States; however, few studies have comprehensively examined this discrete patient population. We aimed to identify utilization of EDs by patients with primary otologic complaints.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) from 2009 through 2011.
METHODS: The NEDS database was queried for patient encounters with a primary otologic diagnosis based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes (380-389). Weighted estimates for demographics, diagnostic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and trends over time were extracted. Predictors of mortality and admission were determined by multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A weighted total of 8,611,282 visits between 2009 and 2011 were attributed to otologic diagnoses, representing 2.21% of all ED visits. Stratified by patient age, otologic diagnoses encompassed 1.01% and 6.79% of all adult and pediatric ED visits, respectively. The majority of patients were treated and released (98.17%). The average age of patients presenting with an otologic complaint was 17.9 years (standard error = 0.23). Overall, 62.7% of patients who presented with an otologic complaint were 0 to 17 years old. The most common diagnoses among all age groups included otitis media not otherwise specified (NOS) (60.6%), infected otitis externa NOS (11.8%), and otalgia NOS (6.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive overview of otologic complaints that are an overlooked diagnostic category in public health research. NEDS data demonstrate a significant number of visits related to otologic complaints, especially in the pediatric population, that are nonemergent.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective was to develop techniques for tympanometry testing in conscious dogs and to present normative data for clinical use of this equipment to enable assessment of the tympanum, middle ear and auditory tube.
ANIMALS: Sixteen hounds (14 female) from a school teaching colony.
METHODS: Dogs were gently restrained in a standing position. After cleaning of the ear canal, a tympanometer probe tip extension was placed in the vertical canal and automated testing performed using a handheld device. Both ears were tested in all dogs.
RESULTS: Acceptable recordings were obtained from both ears of 13 dogs, from one ear in each of two dogs and from neither ear of one dog, resulting in data from 28 of 32 (88%) ears. Otoscopic examination confirmed the absence of inflammation or any other obvious explanation for the noncompliant dogs. No significant differences were seen between ears for any measure.

A history of cranio-mandibular osteopathy was also reported. Bilateral total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy was performed with the aid of a pneumatic burr. Extensive bone proliferation was present bilaterally originating from the caudal mandibular ramus and tympanic bulla which incorporated the horizontal canal on each side. The right facial nerve was identified leaving the stylomastoid foramen and running in a cranial direction through a 1.5 cm diameter cuff of bone surrounding the horizontal canal and external acoustic meatus. Despite careful dissection, a facial nerve neurotmesis ensued which required microsurgical epineurial repair. Neurologic examination performed 12 h post-operatively revealed abnormalities consistent with right facial nerve paralysis. At 3 months, the facial nerve function was found to have improved significantly and was assessed to be normal four months after surgery. To the authors' knowledge, this clinical communication described the first reported clinical case where unilateral facial nerve paralysis resulting from iatrogenic facial nerve neurotmesis was successfully treated by microsurgical epineurial repair.","['Calvo I', 'Espadas I', 'Hammond G', 'Pratschke K']",2014,85,1,J S Afr Vet Assoc,"Calvo I, et al.

25680287,A novel BTK gene mutation creates a de-novo splice site in an X-linked agammaglobulinemia patient.,"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), encoded by the BTK gene, is a cytoplasmic protein critical in B cell development. Mutations in the BTK gene cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a primary immunodeficiency with characteristically low or absent B cells and antibodies. This report describes a five year-old boy who presented with otitis externa, arthritis, reduced immunoglobulins and no B cells. Flow cytometry showed undetectable monocyte BTK expression. Sequencing revealed a novel mutation at exon 13 of the BTK gene which created a de novo splice site with a proximal 5 nucleotide loss resulting in a truncated BTK protein. The patient still suffered from ear infection despite intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In this study, mosaicism was seen only in the mother's genomic DNA. These results suggest that a combination of flow cytometry and BTK gene analysis is important for XLA diagnosis and carrier screening.","['Chear CT', 'Ripen AM', 'Mohamed SA', 'Dhaliwal JS']",2015,560,2,Gene,"Chear CT, et al.

25658865,[Acute external otitis and its differential diagnosis].,"Acute external otitis is an inflammation of the ear canal, which can involve the pinna and the tympanic membrane. The history typically differentiates the presence of predisposing factors or contact with potentially contaminated water (swimmer's ear). A sudden onset with occurrence of ear pain, itching, otorrhea, and a physical examination revealing an inflammation of the ear canal and pain caused by manipulation on the tragus or pulling the pinna are crucial to the diagnosis. In uncomplicated acute external otitis, without the presence of risk factors, the therapy consists of cleaning the ear canal, application of topical medication and sufficient analgesic therapy. In the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane or the presence of a tympanostomy tube no ototoxic drugs may be prescribed. In general, the inflammation is responsive to the treatment, within 48-72 hours and is generally resolved after 6-7 days.","['Fischer M', 'Dietz A']",2015,94,2,Laryngorhinootologie,Fischer M and Dietz A.

25633436,Otomycosis in iran: a review.,"Fungal infection of the external auditory canal (otitis externa and otomycosis) is a chronic, acute, or subacute superficial mycotic infection that rarely involves middle ear. Otomycosis (swimmer's ear) is usually unilateral infection and affects more females than males. The infection is usually symptomatic and main symptoms are pruritus, otalgia, aural fullness, hearing impairment, otorrhea, and tinnitus. Fungal species such as yeasts, molds, dermatophytes, and Malassezia species are agents for otitis externa. Among molds, Aspergillus niger was described as the most common agent in the literature. Candida albicans was more prevalent than other yeast species. Otomycosis has a worldwide distribution, but the prevalence of infection is related to the geographical location, areas with tropical and subtropical climate showing higher prevalence rates. Otomycosis is a secondary infection and is more prevalent among swimmers. As a result, a higher incidence is reported in summer season, when more people interested in swimming. Incidence of otomycosis in our review ranged from 5.7 to 81 %, with a mean value of 51.3 %. Our results showed that 78.59 % of otomycosis agents were Aspergillus, 16.76 % were Candida species, and the rest (4.65 %) were other saprophytic fungi. Among Iranian patients, incidence of infection was highest in summer, followed by autumn, winter, and spring. In Iran, otomycosis was most prevalent at the age of 20-40 years and the lowest prevalence was associated with being <10 years old. The sex ratio of otomycosis in our study was (M/F) 1:1.53.","['Gharaghani M', 'Seifi Z', 'Zarei Mahmoudabadi A']",2015,179,5-6,Mycopathologia,"Gharaghani M, et al. Otomycosis in iran: a review.

METHODS: A nationally representative cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2013. A total of 4260 subjects (1774 males and 2486 females), with a mean age of 32 years, participated. Hearing impairment was determined by pure tone audiometry and otoacoustic emissions testing.
RESULTS: Disabling hearing loss (greater than 40 dB loss in adults, and greater than 30 dB loss in children younger than 15 years, in their better hearing ears) was present in 9.6 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, 8.5-10.8 per cent) of the respondents. Hearing loss was more prevalent in socio-economically deprived people and in those older than 60 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified age, socio-economic deprivation, family history, impacted ear wax, chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and otitis externa as the significant predictors of disabling hearing loss.
CONCLUSION: Deafness prevention should focus mainly on chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and impacted ear wax prevention, integrated within the primary healthcare system and addressing the equity issue.","['Tarafder KH', 'Akhtar N', 'Zaman MM', 'Rasel MA', 'Bhuiyan MR', 'Datta PG']",2015,129,2,J Laryngol Otol,"Tarafder KH, et al.

In this study, we evaluated the growth capacity of nine M. pachydermatis strains on Sabouraud medium in the presence of a high concentration of gentamicin. Strains of M. pachydermatis cultured on Sabouraud medium in the presence of 50 and 100 µg gentamicin ml(-1) displayed different growth patterns such as growth or lack of growth. We hypothesized that this difference in growth of M. pachydermatis strains was correlated with the different genotypes of the strains. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was applied for genetic typing of M. pachydermatis isolates, derived from the external ears of house pet cats suffering from otitis externa. The M. pachydermatis strains were cultured on commercial or home-made Sabouraud medium supplemented or not with gentamicin. RAPD analysis demonstrated a genetic heterogeneity between each strain. In particular, five out of nine strains tested were able to form colonies in the presence of gentamicin. However, a correlation between M. pachydermatis genotype and growth capacity in the presence of gentamicin was not widely demonstrated.","['Buommino E', 'Baroni A', 'Parisi A', 'Borriello FE', 'Caputo P', 'Donnarumma G', 'Nizza S', 'Nocera FP', 'Fiorito F', 'De Martino L']",2015,64,Pt 2,J Med Microbiol,"Buommino E, et al.

25621247,Changing Trends of HIV/AIDS in Otorhinolaryngology with CD4 (+) Count Correlation.,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects the vital cells of the immune system eventually leading to a fall in the cell mediated immunity. As the disease progresses CD4 (+) (cluster of differentiation4) cells reduce, therefore is a good indicator of the ongoing disease process [1]. HIV infection has myriads of disease presentation; the aim of our study was to correlate the otorhinolaryngological manifestations with the CD4 (+) counts. A clinical study, of 100 HIV positive patients was done from 2008 to 2011. A clinical evaluation revealed 76 % incidence of otorhinolaryngological findings. Oropharyngeal manifestations were the commonest, seen in 48 %, predominantly oropharyngeal candidiasis. Neck nodes were found in 20 % of the patients. 31 % had otological manifestations of which retracted tympanic membrane (eustachian tube dysfunction) was the commonest. 18 % had nasal symptoms of which rhinosinusitis was the commonest being 14 %. The mean CD4 (+) count was below 200 in patients who presented with oropharyngeal candidiasis, otitis externa and epistaxis. With the use and availability of HAART (Highly active antiretroviral therapy) more and more patients with higher CD4 (+) count are presenting with a different spectrum of more subtle disease manifestations, with lower incidence of the classical diseases like candidiasis. A routine otorhinolaryngological evaluation at every visit with high index of suspicion can help in better disease control and give a better quality of life.","['Kirti YK', 'Yashveer JK', 'Poorey VK']",2015,67,Suppl 1,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Kirti YK, et al.

25587734,Computed tomographic features of clinical and subclinical middle ear disease in domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus): 88 cases (2007-2014).,"OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare CT abnormalities of the middle ear in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that had clinical or subclinical middle ear disease and to determine the prevalence of otitis media and evaluate the role of predisposing factors for otitis media in that species.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
ANIMALS: 88 domestic rabbits.
PROCEDURES: Medical records for rabbits that underwent CT of the head in June 2007 through February 2014 were searched and classified on the basis of reason for head CT (i.e., ear-related disease vs non-ear-related disease). The ears, upper respiratory tract, teeth, and other important structures of each rabbit's head were evaluated. Follow-up information was obtained for rabbits with CT abnormalities of the middle ear without clinical signs (i.e., subclinical disease).
RESULTS: 12 of 21 (57%) rabbits with clinical signs of ear disease and 18 of 67 (27%) rabbits without clinical signs of ear disease had CT abnormalities of the middle ear. In CT images, all affected ears had soft tissue-attenuating material within the tympanic bulla. Tympanic bulla lysis was associated with clinical middle ear disease. Most (12/18) rabbits with subclinical middle ear disease remained subclinical after CT examination. Middle ear CT-detected changes and lop-ear conformation or otitis externa were strongly correlated; middle ear disease and upper respiratory tract disease were not correlated.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Data suggested that subclinical otitis media frequently affects rabbits, and those with bulla lysis should be closely monitored. Lop-eared rabbits and rabbits with otitis externa had a higher risk of developing otitis media.","['de Matos R', 'Ruby J', 'Van Hatten RA', 'Thompson M']",2015,246,3,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"de Matos R, et al.

P. aeruginosa forms biofilms on surfaces in the swimming pool environment. The presence of P. aeruginosa on inflatables and foam teaching aids in 24 public swimming pools in the Netherlands was studied. Samples (n = 230) were taken from 175 objects and analysed for P. aeruginosa by culture. Isolated P. aeruginosa were tested for antibiotic resistance by disk diffusion. P. aeruginosa was detected in 63 samples (27%), from 47 objects (27%) in 19 (79%) swimming pools. More vinyl-canvas objects (44%) than foam objects (20%) were contaminated, as were wet objects (43%) compared to dry objects (13%). Concentrations were variable, and on average higher on vinyl-canvas than on foam objects. Forty of 193 (21%) P. aeruginosa isolates from 11 different objects were (intermediate) resistant to one or more of 12 clinically relevant antibiotics, mostly to imipenem and aztreonam. The immediate risk of a P. aeruginosa infection from exposure to swimming pool objects seems limited, but the presence of P. aeruginosa on pool objects is unwanted and requires attention of pool managers and responsible authorities. Strict drying and cleaning policies are needed for infrequently used vinyl-canvas objects.","['Schets FM', 'van den Berg HH', 'Baan R', 'Lynch G', 'de Roda Husman AM']",2014,12,4,J Water Health,"Schets FM, et al.

25410222,Neurologic infections in diabetes mellitus.,"Even at a time when HIV/AIDS and immunosuppressive therapy have increased the number of individuals living with significant immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus (DM) remains a major comorbid disorder for several rare but potentially lethal infections, including rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis and malignant external otitis. DM is also a commonly associated condition in patients with nontropical pyomyositis, pyogenic spinal infections, Listeria meningitis, and blastomycosis. As West Nile virus spread to and across North America over a decade ago, DM appeared in many series as a risk factor for death or neuroinvasive disease. More recently, in several large international population-based studies, DM was identified as a risk factor for herpes zoster. The relationships among infection, DM, and the nervous system are multidirectional. Viral infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 DM, while parasitic infections have been hypothesized to protect against autoimmune disorders, including type 1 DM. DM-related neurologic disease can predispose to systemic infection - polyneuropathy is the predominant risk factor for diabetic foot infection. Because prognosis for many neurologic infections depends on timely institution of antimicrobial and sometimes surgical therapy, neurologists caring for diabetic patients should be familiar with the clinical features of the neuroinfectious syndromes associated with DM.","['Jay CA', 'Solbrig MV']",2014,126,,Handb Clin Neurol,Jay CA and Solbrig MV.

25385218,Cholesteatoma and meningoencephalitis in a dog with chronic otitis externa.,"A 10-year-old female spayed German Shepherd dog, with a year-long history of recurrent left ear infections, was presented for progressive ataxia, head tilt, and pain on opening of the mouth. On physical examination, a large amount of ceruminous debris was present in the left ear and multiple neurologic defects localizing to the cerebellum and vestibular system were identified. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a minimally contrast-enhancing mass within the left bulla, an intracranial space-occupying, heterogeneously contrast-enhancing lesion at the level of the left cerebello-medullary junction, and contrast enhancement of the ipsilateral meninges. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a marked mixed cell pleocytosis (nucleated cell count 655 cells/μL). The mass was visualized within the horizontal ear canal by otoscopic examination and a biopsy was taken. Impression smears of the biopsy contained many anucleate keratinized squamous epithelial cells, mild mixed inflammation, and few presumptive fibroblasts. With the provided clinical history and MRI findings, a cytologic diagnosis of cholesteatoma was made. A ventral bulla osteotomy was performed, and histopathologic examination of resected tissue confirmed the cytologic diagnosis of cholesteatoma. The dog's clinical symptoms improved postoperatively, but the dog died of unrelated causes, 3.5 months later.

25381580,Central skull base osteomyelitis: new insights and implications for diagnosis and treatment.,"Central skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) is a life-threatening disease originating from ear and from sinonasal infections. The intention of this study was to evaluate contemporary trends in etiology, diagnosis, management, and outcome of SBO and to draw the clinician's attention on this probably underestimated disease. Over a 6-year period we performed this systematic study in an academic quaternary medical care and skull base center including 20 patients (mean age 63.7 years) with central SBO, which is one of the largest series from a single center. In contrast to previous studies we explicitly excluded infections limited to malignant external otitis only but did not restrict central SBO to conditions unrelated to aural pathology. Fifteen patients had otogenic and five sinugenic SBO; four patients had fungal or mixed fungal infections. Pre-existing illnesses altering bone vascularization were detected in 70 % of the patients and had a negative effect on the improvement of cranial nerve palsies that were found in 14 patients. In relation, patients with otogenic SBO more often had local and systemic predisposing factors. Contrary to previous studies 16 patients (80 %) underwent surgical therapy and none of our patients died. A meta-analysis of five recent studies was done and compared with our own data and two previous meta-analyses. The present study highlights several important aspects with major implications for diagnosis and treatment of SBO that have not been adequately addressed as yet. In contrast to the restrictive attitude towards surgery in literature we recommend early and radical operative treatment to reduce its mortality.","['Ridder GJ', 'Breunig C', 'Kaminsky J', 'Pfeiffer J']",2015,272,5,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Ridder GJ, et al.

AIMS: To identify the microorganisms responsible for cases of otitis externa presenting to Wellington Hospital, New Zealand, over a five-year period between 2007 and 2011. We also aim to evaluate current management of this condition and to recommend future treatment options.
METHOD: A five-year retrospective study, with data obtained from case notes and electronic records for all patients presenting with otitis externa to Wellington Hospital between 2007 and 2011.
RESULTS: Of three hundred and forty-seven cases identified, 144 were included in the study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was the most common organism (46.5 per cent), while Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was the second most common (31.9 per cent). Most patients received appropriate topical treatment. However, a significant number were treated with systemic antibiotics alone without adverse outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common microbe causing acute otitis externa in patients that require hospital level management in Wellington, New Zealand. In most cases, patients received appropriate topical therapy; however, it appears a large number received systemic antibiotic therapy without topical treatment.

DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study.
SAMPLE: 1,350 patient encounters with military working dogs evaluated for noncombat-related reasons.
PROCEDURES: Data regarding noncombat-related veterinary visits were collected on a weekly basis from 13 forward operating bases throughout Iraq from January 2009 through August 2010.

METHOD: This paper reports a case of a young, healthy female with malignant otitis externa, which resulted in the development of Lemierre's syndrome. A review of the relevant literature was also carried out. This involved a search of the Medline database using multiple search terms including 'Lemierre', 'septic thrombophlebitis', 'otitis externa', 'internal jugular vein thrombosis' and 'management'.
RESULTS: The patient presented with fever, left-sided otalgia, otorrhoea, neck swelling and pain. She was subsequently diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome and managed accordingly.
CONCLUSION: Lemierre's syndrome is a potentially fatal complication associated with significant morbidity. A high index of suspicion is required for prompt recognition and the early institution of treatment.","['Davidoss N', 'Ha JF', 'Anderson JR', 'Rodrigues S']",2015,129 Suppl 1,,J Laryngol Otol,"Davidoss N, et al.

It is understood that an intact acoustic organ and hearing function are of vital importance for the well-being of flight animals like horses. The knowledge of the acoustic organ is usually transferred analogously from other mammals to horses. The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed and complete histological description of the healthy equine auditory organ, and to determine its congruity to other mammalians. Anatomical dissections and histological preparations were carried out on ten cadaver heads. Specimens of various parts of the equine acoustic organ were taken and evaluated histologically. The histological composition of external, middle and inner ear structures are predominantly congruent to those of other mammals, especially to human beings. Unique inwardly directed rete pegs within the osseous ear canal and the prominent tensor tympani muscle are described for the first time.

25227520,The influence of mometasone furoate ear solution on intradermal test immediate reactions in dogs with atopic dermatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Topical ear medications, often containing a glucocorticoid, are used to treat the clinical signs of atopic otitis in dogs. Studies have looked at the inhibitory effect of topical glucocorticoids on intradermal testing (IDT), but only one previously published study evaluated the influence of an otic glucocorticoid on the results of IDT in dogs.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To assess what influence the absorption of the diester glucocorticoid mometasone furoate (MF) had on intradermal test immediate reactions, to determine an appropriate withdrawal time prior to IDT.
METHODS: Twenty atopic dogs were enrolled. On day 0, histamine, rabbit anticanine IgE antiserum and saline were injected intradermally. After 20 min, a global wheal score (GWS) was determined. The otic medication, MF, was applied once daily for 14 days. Intradermal injections were then repeated and, if the GWS was within 25% of pretreatment values, the study was completed for this dog. If the GWS had decreased by ≥25% from the baseline value, the otic medication was withdrawn, and the GWS was repeated every 7 days until its value was within 25% of the original GWS.
RESULTS: Three of the 20 dogs completed the study on day 14, while 17 of 20 dogs ended it on day 21, 7 days after withdrawal of the drug, MF.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Results from this study show that a withdrawal period of ≤7 days is possible before performing IDT in atopic dogs with active otitis externa treated with ≤14 days of MF.","['Marcia Murphy K', 'Olivry T']",2015,26,1,Vet Dermatol,"Marcia Murphy K and Olivry T.

These patients had been referred to us for evaluation of chronic, mostly treatment-refractory otitis externa, which had manifested as otorrhea, otalgia, and/or pruritus. Seven of the 11 patients had no history of ear problems prior to their current condition. Five patients had been referred to us by a primary care physician and 4 by an otolaryngologist; the other 2 patients were self-referred. All patients were treated with a thorough debridement of the ear and one of two antifungal medication regimens. Eight of the 11 patients experienced a complete resolution of signs and symptoms, including closure of the tympanic membrane perforation. The other 3 patients underwent either a tympanoplasty (n = 2) or a fat-graft myringotomy (n = 1) because the perforation did not close within a reasonable amount of time. This series demonstrates that the nonspecific signs and symptoms of fungal otitis externa can make diagnosis difficult for both primary care physicians and general otolaryngologists. This study also demonstrates that most cases of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to fungal otitis externa will resolve with cleaning of the ear and proper medical treatment. Therefore, most patients with this condition will not require surgery.","['Song JE', 'Haberkamp TJ', 'Patel R', 'Redleaf MI']",2014,93,8,Ear Nose Throat J,"Song JE, et al.

25158617,Clinical utility of a polymerase chain reaction assay in culture-negative necrotizing otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: This study describes a subset of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) patients with a refractory disease and negative cultures. In these cases, we decided to use a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay from surgically obtained tissue under sterile conditions to improve pathogen detection sensitivity.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.
SETTING: Academic medical center.
PATIENTS: Nineteen consecutive patients diagnosed with NOE between January 2008 and January 2014 inclusive. Three patients of this cohort presented a culture-negative disease.
INTERVENTIONS: Diagnostic.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Positive detection of pathogens using a PCR assay in cases with a complicated course of NOE and clinical resolution of the disease after targeted therapy according to PCR results.
RESULTS: Surgical samples were obtained under sterile conditions from three patients with negative cultures and a refractory disease course of NOE. PCR assays were performed using pan-bacteria and pan-fungi protocols. In all three samples, a positive result for a fungal pathogen was recorded and followed by successful empirical targeted therapy.
CONCLUSION: Patients who present with a refractory culture-negative NOE should be suspected as suffering from a fungal disease. The PCR assay may be an important laboratory adjunct in detecting pathogens responsible for NOE and can aid to promote therapy and disease resolution.","['Gruber M', 'Roitman A', 'Doweck I', 'Uri N', 'Shaked-Mishan P', 'Kolop-Feldman A', 'Cohen-Kerem R']",2015,36,4,Otol Neurotol,"Gruber M, et al.

25141187,Report of endoscopic cochlear implantation.,"OBJECTIVES: To report patient outcomes after transcanal endoscopic cochlear implantation for sensorineural hearing loss.
PATIENTS: Males and female subjects more than 7 years old with sensorineural hearing loss (confirmed with audiologic studies) were selected. CT imaging was used to rule out any anatomic anomalies of the temporal bone. Smaller pediatric patients whose canal might still be growing and who might have a higher incidence of otitis media and otitis externa were excluded. Obese adults whose canal skin was too thick to allow good access down the ear canal were also excluded.
INTERVENTION(S): Surgical (therapeutic). Endoscopic cochlear implantation using a transcanal approach.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Implant position and function. Postoperative complications specifically related to transcanal approach and use of the endoscope.
RESULTS: Twenty-five endoscopic cochlear implantations were performed in 24 ears on 11 female and 10 male subjects aged 7-65 years. Eight patients were implanted in Brazil, and 13 patients (17 yr) were implanted in the United States. All implants were fully inserted into the scala tympani, and 24 functioned normally with appropriate thresholds. Mean time of follow-up was 16 months (SD, ±7.2). The chorda tympani was sacrificed in 2 of 25 procedures, 12 EAC/TM tears occurred which healed by the second follow-up visit. No injury to the facial nerve was observed. One postoperative wound infection and 1 otitis externa each resolved with 1 week of antibiotics. Implant array was visible through the EACs skin but not exposed in 6 of 24 ears.

25130194,A pilot study to develop an objective clinical score for canine otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: The lack of an accepted clinical scoring system in canine otitis externa makes it difficult to compare clinical trials.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To develop a score that is clinically relevant, reliable and sensitive to change.
ANIMALS: Client-owned healthy dogs (n = 55) and dogs with otitis externa (n = 60).
METHODS: We compared 0-3 and 0-5 assessments of erythema, oedema/swelling, erosion/ulceration, exudate and pain of the ear canals with a reference 0-2 scale. Additional data included odour, pruritus scores, tympanic membrane condition, treatment outcome and neutrophil, bacterial and Malassezia counts.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the vertical and horizontal canal scores (correlation coefficients >0.93). Correlation coefficients for the 0-3 and 0-5 scales were also >0.9 for all parameters, but the 0-2 scale was more variable. Pain and pruritus did not correlate well with the lesion scores and were associated with suppurative and erythroceruminous otitis, respectively. Neutrophil and microbial counts were variable and could not be used to generate cut-off values to differentiate healthy and affected ears or determine the response to therapy. Total scores ≥4 differentiated affected from healthy ears with 91.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity; scores ≤3 were 100% sensitive and 91.9% specific for clinical success. The intra- and interobserver reliability was high (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.95 and Cohen's kappa coefficients >0.65).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This pilot study showed that the 0-3 Otitis Index Score (OTIS3) for erythema, oedema/swelling, erosion/ulceration and exudate is suitable for further validation by a larger group of clinicians.","['Nuttall T', 'Bensignor E']",2014,25,6,Vet Dermatol,"Nuttall T and Bensignor E.

25031085,In vitro antifungal susceptibility of Malassezia pachydermatis strains isolated from dogs with chronic and acute otitis externa.,"Malassezia pachydermatis is a yeast that is frequently involved as a secondary/perpetuating factor in canine otitis externa. Topical therapies with different antifungal agents, mainly azole compounds, are generally successful in controlling the yeast overgrowth, but treatment failure and rapid recurrences are common. This study compared the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of M. pachydermatis isolates obtained from chronic and acute cases of otitis externa. The aim was to assess the possible onset of resistance mechanisms in isolates involved in long-lasting episodes with poor response to treatment. We evaluated the in vitro susceptibility to miconazole (MCZ) and clotrimazole (CTZ) of 42 isolates of M. pachydermatis obtained from dogs with chronic (group A, n = 25) and acute otitis (group B, n = 17), using a modified CLSI M27-A3 microdilution method. All isolates were inhibited by the antifungal agents employed, but Malassezia isolates from group A were significantly associated with higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for both agents (Median MIC values: MCZ group A 2 µg/ml, group B 1 µg/ml; CTZ group A 8 µg/ml, group B 4 µg/ml). These findings prove that these isolates had a reduced in vitro susceptibility to the antifungal agents tested. However, it is unlikely that this could have any influence on the outcome of a topical treatment. Indeed, marketed products include concentrations of the tested agents that largely exceed even the highest MICs found in this study (in most cases at least 1,000 × the MIC, or greater). In conclusion, this study suggests that isolates of M. pachydermatis involved in chronic cases of canine external otitis and exposed to repeated antifungal treatments are unlikely to develop mechanisms of resistance of clinical relevance.","['Chiavassa E', 'Tizzani P', 'Peano A']",2014,178,3-4,Mycopathologia,"Chiavassa E, et al.

25000552,Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide versus ciprofloxacin alone in the treatment of diffuse otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide (antibiotic plus corticosteroid) ear drops compared to ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) ear drops in diffuse otitis externa.
METHODS: This was a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind study involving 590 patients of both sexes aged 7 years or older.
RESULTS: The rate of clinical cure was higher (p = 0.01) with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide than with ciprofloxacin alone. The mean total symptom score was lower with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide (p = 0.005). No differences were found in the percentage of patients reporting resolution of otalgia between patients receiving ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide and patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. Resolution of oedema and otorrhoea (p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively) was higher with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide, as was eradication or presumed eradication (p = 0.003). There were eight mild adverse events, three with the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide combination (not related to the treatment) and five when ciprofloxacin was administered alone (directly related to the treatment).
CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide is a more effective treatment for diffuse otitis externa than ciprofloxacin alone. The ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide combination also has an excellent safety profile.","['Lorente J', 'Sabater F', 'Rivas MP', 'Fuste J', 'Risco J', 'Gómez M']",2014,128,7,J Laryngol Otol,"Lorente J, et al.

24984135,Diagnosis and surgical treatment of a malignant trichoepithelioma of the ear canal in a pet rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus).,"CASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-year-old spayed female Holland Lop-mix pet rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was evaluated because of purulent-hemorrhagic discharge from the right ear canal and a suspected mass within that ear canal.
CLINICAL FINDINGS: Results of contrast-enhanced CT, video otoscopy, and histologic examination of endoscopic tissue biopsy samples indicated severe otitis media and externa and a benign trichoepithelioma of the right ear canal.
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy were performed. Histologic examination of a surgical biopsy sample of the mass indicated malignant trichoepithelioma. Tumor recurrence was detected 22 weeks after surgery. The rabbit was euthanized 33 weeks after surgery because of the large size of the recurrent tumor and declining quality of life. Necropsy findings indicated a malignant trichoepithelioma with local and lymphatic invasion into the right mandibular lymph node.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This was the first report of the clinical diagnosis, surgical treatment, and outcome for a domestic rabbit with a diagnosis of a malignant trichoepithelioma of the ear canal and associated otitis media and externa. Neoplasia should be included as a differential diagnosis for pet rabbits with otitis externa and media. Although such tumors are typically benign, trichoepitheliomas in rabbits can be malignant. Computed tomography and histologic examination of tissue samples were useful diagnostic techniques, but histologic examination of an endoscopic biopsy sample did not allow identification of malignant characteristics of the trichoepithelioma.","['Budgeon C', 'Mans C', 'Chamberlin T', 'Stein J', 'Drees R', 'Robat C', 'Pinkerton M', 'Imai DM', 'McAnulty J']",2014,245,2,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Budgeon C, et al.

Clinical diagnostic criteria and epidemiologic data were analyzed to illustrate the altering features of osteomyelitis of the temporal bone. Group 1 patients were characterized by high prevalence of diabetes and more commonly suffered from otalgia, otitis externa and granulation tissue in the external auditory canal and higher positive culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Noticeable changing trends were found between both groups, including declining prevalence of diabetes, fewer patients complaining of pain or presenting with otitis externa, and canal granulation, and increased variety of pathogens in group 2. We should highlight the index of clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis of the temporal bone, even in nondiabetic or immunocompetent patients. Painless otorrhea patients were also at risk of osteomyelitis of the temporal bone, especially patients with previous otologic operation.

24951723,Aspergillus pragensis sp. nov. discovered during molecular reidentification of clinical isolates belonging to Aspergillus section Candidi.,"The identity of nine clinical isolates recovered from Czech patients and presumptively identified as Aspergillus sp. section Candidi based on colony morphology was revised using sequences of β-tubulin, calmodulin gene sequence, and internal transcribed spacer rDNA. Six isolates were from suspected and proven onychomycosis, one from otitis externa, and two associated with probable invasive aspergillosis. The results showed that one Aspergillus candidus isolate was the cause of otitis externa, and both isolates obtained from sputa of patients with probable invasive aspergillosis were reidentified as A. carneus (sect. Terrei) and A. flavus (sect. Flavi). Three isolates from nail scrapings were identified as A. tritici, a verified agent of nondermatophyte onychomycosis. One isolate from toenail was determined to be A. candidus and the two isolates belonged to a hitherto undescribed species, Aspergillus pragensis sp. nov. This species is well supported by phylogenetic analysis based on β-tubulin and calmodulin gene and is distinguishable from other members of sect. Candidi by red-brown reverse on malt extract agar, slow growth on Czapek-Dox agar and inability to grow at 37°C. A secondary metabolite analysis was also provided with comparison of metabolite spectrum to other species. Section Candidi now encompasses five species for which a dichotomous key based on colony characteristics is provided. All clinical isolates were tested for susceptibilities to selected antifungal agents using the Etest and disc diffusion method. Overall sect. Candidi members are highly susceptible to common antifungals.","['Hubka V', 'Lyskova P', 'Frisvad JC', 'Peterson SW', 'Skorepova M', 'Kolarik M']",2014,52,6,Med Mycol,"Hubka V, et al.

24948963,The clinical implications of ear canal debris in hearing aid users.,"Objective : The ear irritations suffered by hearing aid (HA) users are yet to be related to the clinical state of canal. We undertook this study to examine the nature of debris and the microbial flora of ears of hearing aid users, as well as evaluate the determinant factors of ear irritation in this population. Methods : An observational clinical study was carried out involving 32 unilateral hearing aid users recruited from ENT clinic of a tertiary referral center. Each subject underwent otoscopic assessment of canal debris and microbial analysis of swab cultures taken from the hearing aid-wearing ear and contralateral normal ear without hearing aid. Results : Canal debris [wax (28%), fungal deposits (19%), bacteria exudates (13%)]. as well as microorganisms were identified in significant number of ears with hearing aids than ears without hearing aid (P = 0.003 and P = 0.006 respectively). Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the commonest identified bacteria. Others were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus species. Intolerable irritations of hearing aid wearing ears were significantly associated with bacterial and fungal otitis externa, and ear discharge (P = 0.005, 0.02, 0.03 respectively). Conclusions : This study demonstrates that using hearing aid alters the ear canal flora; increases risk of both fungal and bacterial otitis externa, as well as encourage wax debris formation, with resultant ear irritations. To ensure compliance their ears should periodically be attended to, by de-waxing or given topical antimicrobial agents where indicated.","['Orji FT', 'O Onyero E', 'Agbo CE']",2014,30,3,Pak J Med Sci,"Orji FT, et al.

However, the evidence for voriconazole efficacy against refractory Aspergillus otomycosis is weak.
METHOD: We reviewed the medical records of patients with Aspergillus otomycosis treated with voriconazole from January 2008 to June 2012 in a Taiwanese regional hospital. Demographic data and information regarding underlying diseases, clinical features, treatment and outcome were assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 14 cases of Aspergillus otomycosis were treated with voriconazole, including 5 patients with Aspergillus invasive otitis externa. All patients had failed to respond to local treatment, antibiotics or topical agents. One case was lost to follow up. The symptoms of two patients recurred after voriconazole treatment: one patient received a second 12-week course of voriconazole and was cured; and symptoms of the other patient recurred after a second 12-week course of voriconazole, leading to surgical debridement. The remaining 11 patients were cured by voriconazole treatment without extensive surgical debridement.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that voriconazole can be a very effective and convenient therapeutic option for the management of refractory Aspergillus otomycosis.","['Ho HC', 'Hsiao SH', 'Lee CY', 'Tsai CC']",2014,128,6,J Laryngol Otol,"Ho HC, et al.

24853245,The shape of the osseous external auditory canal and its relationship to chronic external otitis.,"BACKGROUND: In literature and based on clinical observations, the shape of the osseous external auditory canal (OEAC) has often been suggested to be an etiologic factor in chronic otitis externa (COE). However, to date, no evidence has been presented to confirm this correlation. The aim of this study was to see whether evidence of such a correlation exists, and if so, what shape of the OEAC is related to COE.
METHODS: Using CT scans of 2 groups of patients (with and without COE), a novel and easy to use method was introduced to measure 2 dimensions of the OEAC: the pretympanic recess (the depth (DPTR) and anterior curvature (ACPTR)). In addition, a descriptive classification of the entire OAEC was introduced.
RESULTS: The proposed method was demonstrated to be useful as excellent interobserver agreements were found (r = 0.89). No significant differences in the descriptive classifications of the OEAC were observed between COE and the non-COE patients. The DPTR was significantly deeper in COE patients. For the ACPTR, no significant differences were observed.
CONCLUSION: Based on a new method of determining the DPTR, we demonstrate that the DPTR is significantly deeper in COE patients and that the shape of the OEAC is thus of importance in the pathogenesis of COE.","['van Spronsen E', 'Geerse S', 'Mirck PG', 'van der Baan S', 'Fokkens WJ', 'Ebbens FA']",2014,35,10,Otol Neurotol,"van Spronsen E, et al.

24775276,Canine aural cholesteatoma: a histological and immunohistochemical study.,"Canine aural cholesteatoma is an epidermoid cyst that forms in the middle ear cavity as a rare complication of otitis media but the aetiopathogenesis remains controversial. In the present study, 13 cases of canine aural cholesteatoma were investigated histologically and immunohistochemically and compared with cases of chronic otitis. The immunohistochemical investigation was performed using the following monoclonal antibodies: anti-cytokeratins (CK) 14, 16, 8/18, and 19, and anti-Ki67. The proliferative indexes (PIs) of cholesteatomata and otitis epithelium were calculated as the percentage of Ki67 positive nuclei/total nuclei. Histologically, the cholesteatomata were composed of a hyperplastic, hyperkeratotic epithelium (matrix) resting on a fibrous perimatrix, infiltrated by inflammatory cells and devoid of cutaneous adnexa. Immunohistochemically, the cholesteatoma epithelium was CK14- and CK16-positive, and CK8/18- and CK19-negative. A similar pattern of CK expression was found in otitis externa. In otitis media, ciliated epithelium stained CK8/18- and CK19-positive in all layers, CK14-positive in the basal layers, and CK16-negative. The mean PIs in cholesteatomata and otitides were 18.8 and 17.8, respectively. The immunohistochemical pattern of CK expression in cholesteatomata, when compared with chronic otitis, was suggestive of hyperproliferative epithelium, but its origin could not be demonstrated. Comparable PI values were obtained in cholesteatoma and in chronic otitis, which confirmed that Ki67 is a valuable indicator of a hyperproliferative state, but not a predictor of aggressiveness.","['Banco B', 'Grieco V', 'Di Giancamillo M', 'Greci V', 'Travetti O', 'Martino P', 'Mortellaro CM', 'Giudice C']",2014,200,3,Vet J,"Banco B, et al.

We sought to evaluate the morbidity of foreign travelers in Zakynthos, a popular Greek island attracting large number of foreign tourists every summer.
METHODS: Data from foreign travelers that accommodated in Zakynthos and sought medical services from the private offices of Zante Medical Care from May 1 to October 30 2012 were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred and eighty-eight patients were included in the study. The mean age (± SD) of the patients whom the age was recorded was 29.6 (± 18.3) and 51.5% of them were from 18 to 40 years old.

24693653,Endoscopic findings of the external ear canal in a group of clinically normal horses and horses with head shaking or vestibular disease.,"Since there is a lack of information about the normal appearance or pathological findings of the equine external ear canal (EEEC) and tympanic membrane (TM), we aimed to find a practical way to perform the otoscopic examination in standing, sedated horses. Therefore, we worked with common veterinary video endoscopes, which are normally used for gastroscopy or bronchoscopy. Both ears each of 38 randomly selected, chemically restrained horses were otoscopically examined. 33 of those horses had no history or signs of potentially ear-associated diseases. However, two horses with vestibular disease and three horses with head shaking were included in the otoscopic examinations. We created references of the normal appearance of the EEEC and TM on the basis of the characteristic anatomical landmarks, degree of debris, amount of keratin scales, shape of the intersection between the cartilaginous (CEEC) and osseous (OEEC) portion of the external ear canal, shape of the OEEC, formation of the keratin layer and its integrity, epithelium colour of the OEEC, and complexion of the TM. With this information, we were able to visualise tympanosclerosis in two equine eardrums, as well as low-grade to severe external otitis in three horses. Severe bilateral external otitis combined with temporohyoid osteoarthropathy (THO) was found in one of those horses. A foreign body was found in one OEEC. This study shows that otoscopic examination is a basic, easy to perform and beneficial diagnostic procedure for a complete work-up of ear-related diseases, such as THO, facial nerve paralysis, vestibular disease, head-shaking or head trauma. Plus, regarding animal welfare, well being of horses is highly influenced by noise exposure. Therefore research on equine audiological aspects needs to be promoted.

24690982,Risk of otitis externa following manual cerumen removal.,"OBJECTIVES: Based on an interpretation of a recent Joint Commission protocol to sterilize instruments coming into contact with mucous membranes, there has been institutional interest in sterile packaging of cerumen curettes used for manual cerumen removal. To date, there are no studies that have assessed the risk of otitis externa (OE) following cerumen removal and the utility of sterile packaging is questionable. The objective of this study is to assess the incidence of OE following cerumen disimpaction prior to the implementation of sterile packaging at our institution.
METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review. Over a I-year period, 1457 episodes of manual cerumen removal took place in the otolaryngology clinic. Charts were assessed for signs or symptoms of OE within 2 weeks of the procedure through follow-up phone calls and clinic visits in the otolaryngology division.
RESULTS: There were no patients who followed up with symptoms or signs suggestive of OE in the 2-week postprocedure period.
CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that OE is a complication of manual cerumen removal when performed by otolaryngologists using clean technique. Unnecessary sterilization of tools leads to increased cost and time for this common outpatient procedure performed by the otolaryngologist.","['Guidi JL', 'Wetmore RF', 'Sobol SE']",2014,123,7,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"Guidi JL, et al.

24689165,Improving the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis.,"Seborrhoeic dermatitis usually starts at puberty with a peak incidence at 40 years of age and is more common in males. Patients develop symmetrical, well demarcated, dull or yellowish red patches and plaques with overlying adherent, yellowish greasy scales. Seborrhoeic dermatitis has a distinctive distribution in areas rich in sebaceous glands - the scalp, eyebrows, glabella, nasolabial and nasofacial folds, cheeks, peri-auricular skin, pre-sternal and interscapular areas. It may occur in flexures, especially the axillae, groin, anogenital skin, infra-mammary skin and the umbilicus. Some patients may develop blepharitis with erythematous eyelids and destruction of eyelash follicles. Patients with HIV infection, neurological diseases, including parkinsonism and cranial nerve palsies, have a higher incidence of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Patients presenting with sudden onset severe seborrhoeic dermatitis should be screened for risk factors for HIV. Patients should be referred in the following situations: diagnostic uncertainty - consider other differential diagnoses; failure to respond to first-line treatment after four weeks - consider secondary changes e.g. bacterial infection, flexural intertrigo, lichenification, otitis externa; and severe/widespread disease. Patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis have a good prognosis, particularly infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis, which usually remits within a few weeks or months and does not recur.","['Ooi ET', 'Tidman MJ']",2014,258,1768,Practitioner,"Ooi ET and Tidman MJ.

Ciclosporin is known to interact with a wide range of pharmacological agents. Numerous studies have demonstrated good efficacy for the management of canine atopic dermatitis and this has been a licensed indication since 2003. In addition to the treatment of atopic dermatitis, it has been used as an aid in the management of numerous other dermatological conditions in animals including perianal fistulation, sebaceous adenitis, pododermatitis, chronic otitis externa and pemphigus foliaceus. This article reviews the mode of action, pharmacokinetics, indications for use and efficacy of ciclosporin in veterinary dermatology.","['Forsythe P', 'Paterson S']",2014,174 Suppl 2,Suppl 2,Vet Rec,Forsythe P and Paterson S.

24675790,Malignant Otitis Externa: Evolving Pathogens and Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is an invasive infection of the temporal bone that is classically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasingly, however, nonpseudomonal cases are being reported. The goal of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical presentation and outcomes of cases of MOE caused by Pseudomonas versus non-Pseudomonas organisms.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series with chart review.
SETTING: Tertiary care institution.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with diagnoses of MOE between 1995 and 2012 were identified. Charts were reviewed for history, clinical presentation, laboratory data, treatment, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Twenty patients diagnosed with and treated for MOE at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between 1995 and 2012 were identified. Nine patients (45%) had cultures that grew P aeruginosa. Three patients (15%) had cultures that grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Signs and symptoms at presentation were similar across groups. However, all of the patients with Pseudomonas had diabetes, compared with 33% of MRSA-infected patients (P = .046) and 55% of all non-Pseudomonas-infected patients (P = .04). Patients infected with MRSA were treated for an average total of 4.7 more weeks of antibiotic therapy than Pseudomonas-infected patients (P = .10). Overall, patients with non-Pseudomonas infections were treated for a total of 2.4 more weeks than Pseudomonas-infected patients (P = .25).
CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion for nonpseudomonal organisms should be maintained in patients with signs and symptoms of MOE, especially in those without diabetes. MRSA is an increasingly implicated organism in MOE.","['Hobson CE', 'Moy JD', 'Byers KE', 'Raz Y', 'Hirsch BE', 'McCall AA']",2014,151,1,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Hobson CE, et al.

24646513,"Management of upper respiratory tract infections by different medical practices, including homeopathy, and consumption of antibiotics in primary care: the EPI3 cohort study in France 2007-2008.","BACKGROUND: Prescribing of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) varies substantially in primary care.
OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare antibiotic and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs use, URTI symptoms' resolution and occurrence of potentially-associated infections in patients seeking care from general practitioners (GPs) who exclusively prescribe conventional medications (GP-CM), regularly prescribe homeopathy within a mixed practice (GP-Mx), or are certified homeopathic GPs (GP-Ho).
METHOD: The EPI3 survey was a nationwide population-based study of a representative sample of 825 GPs and their patients in France (2007-2008). GP recruitment was stratified by self-declared homeopathic prescribing preferences. Adults and children with confirmed URTI were asked to participate in a standardized telephone interview at inclusion, one-, three- and twelve-month follow up. Study outcomes included medication consumption, URTI symptoms' resolution and potentially-associated infections (sinusitis or otitis media/externa) as reported by patients. Analyses included calibration to account for non-respondents and groups were compared using multivate analyses adjusting for baseline differences with a propensity score.
RESULTS: 518 adults and children with URTI (79.3% rhinopharyngitis) were included (36.9% response rate comparable between groups). As opposed to GP-CM patients, patients in the GP-Ho group showed significantly lower consumption of antibiotics (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27-0.68) and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.38-0.76) with similar evolution in related symptoms (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.64-2.10). An excess of potentially-associated infections (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 0.90-3.20) was observed in the GP-Ho group (not statistically significant). No difference was found between GP-CM and GP-Mx patients.
CONCLUSION: Patients who chose to consult GPs certified in homeopathy used less antibiotics and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs for URTI than those seen by GPs prescribing conventional medications. No difference was observed in patients consulting GPs within mixed-practice. A non-statistically significant excess was estimated through modelling for associated infections in the GP-Ho group and needs to be further studied.","['Grimaldi-Bensouda L', 'Bégaud B', 'Rossignol M', 'Avouac B', 'Lert F', 'Rouillon F', 'Bénichou J', 'Massol J', 'Duru G', 'Magnier AM', 'Abenhaim L', 'Guillemot D']",2014,9,3,PLoS One,"Grimaldi-Bensouda L, et al.

24625672,In vitro and in vivo activity of a killer peptide against Malassezia pachydermatis causing otitis in dogs.,"In order to overcome the limitations inherent in current pharmacological treatments for Malassezia pachydermatis, the cause of otitis externa in dogs, the efficacy of a killer decapeptide (KP) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Sixteen dogs with naturally occurring M. pachydermatis otitis externa were enrolled, and the in vitro fungicidal activity of KP was evaluated using yeasts recovered from these animals. The therapeutic activity was evaluated in four groups of four animals each. The dogs were topically treated with KP (150 μl, 2 mg/ml) three times per week (group A) or every day (group B), treated with a scramble peptide every day (group C), or left untreated (group D). Assessment of clinical signs (pruritus, erythema, and lichenification and/or hyperpigmentation), expressed as mean of the total clinical index score (mTCIS), the population size of M. pachydermatis at the cytological examination (mean number of yeast cells at 40× magnification [mYC]), and culture testing (mean number of log10 CFU/swab [mCFU]), were conducted daily from the first day of treatment (T0) until two consecutive negative cultures (mCFU ≤ 2). KP showed an in vitro fungicidal effect against M. pachydermatis isolates, with an MFC90 value of 1 μg/ml. The mTCIS, mYC and mCFU were negative only in animals in group B after T8. Daily administration of KP for 8 days was safe and effective in controlling both clinical signs and the population size of M. pachydermatis causing otitis externa, thus offering an alternative to the currently available therapeutic or prophylactic protocols for recurrent cases of Malassezia otitis in dogs.","['Cafarchia C', 'Immediato D', 'Paola GD', 'Magliani W', 'Ciociola T', 'Conti S', 'Otranto D', 'Polonelli L']",2014,52,4,Med Mycol,"Cafarchia C, et al.

We studied the pH of external auditory canal (EAC) in normal individuals and patients with acute otitis externa (AOE), its variation with change of temperature and humidity, different symptoms and number of symptoms at presentation (Day 0) and various stages of treatment in 100 normal ears and forearms and 50 ears having AOE. The mean pH of normal EAC was 3.950 ± 1.199 while that of forearm was 4.775 ± 0.910. There was increase in the number of patients with increase in relative humidity, however, the change in the pH of EAC was statistically not significant (p > 0.05). Significant fall in pH was observed at 1 and 2 weeks of treatment. The normal EAC pH is relatively more acidic as compared to that of forearm skin and it became more alkaline in cases of AOE with reversion back to acidic pH after treatment. Acidification of the EAC is the only treatment required in most cases. No significant change in pH of ears was observed with changes of temperatures and humidity.","['Mittal A', 'Kumar S']",2014,66,1,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Mittal A and Kumar S.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate cases of confirmed feline AD.
ANIMALS: Fourty-five cats from a dermatology referral practice (2001-2012).
METHODS: A retrospective case record review was carried out using strict diagnostic criteria, including exclusion of flea-bite hypersensitivity and adverse food reaction.
RESULTS: Disease prevalence was 12.5%, with domestic mixed (n = 24), Abyssinian (n = 6) and Devon rex (n = 3) cat breeds predisposed. Median age of onset was 2 years (62% <3 years; 22% >7 years; range 3 months to 12 years). Common presentations were severe (82%), nonseasonal (82%), waxing/waning (36%) pruritus, with alopecia/crusting/excoriations and/or erosions/ulceration (73%). Miliary dermatitis (20%) and eosinophilic granuloma complex lesions (27%) occurred. The face/head (71%), ventral abdomen (51%), neck (51%), limbs (38%), pinnae (31%), dorsum/rump (31%) and feet (16%) were frequently affected sites; lesions were restricted to the head/neck in only five cats (11%). Concurrent otitis externa (16%), superficial bacterial pyoderma (49%), Malassezia dermatitis (7%), flea-bite hypersensitivity (24%) and adverse food reaction (13%) occurred. Strong reactions on intradermal allergen testing were common (68%; 19 of 30), most frequently to pollens (61%) and/or insects (46%). Good response to ciclosporin (100%; 10 of 10), systemic glucocorticoids (55%; 22 of 40) and allergen-specific immunotherapy (57%; 13 of 23) and good/partial response to antihistamines (67%; 22 of 33) were reported.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of feline AD was higher than previously suggested, and breed predispositions were confirmed. Severe nonseasonal pruritus was most common, with a varied spectrum of lesions affecting a range of body areas.","['Ravens PA', 'Xu BJ', 'Vogelnest LJ']",2014,25,2,Vet Dermatol,"Ravens PA, et al.

24594665,Prevalence of disorders recorded in dogs attending primary-care veterinary practices in England.,"Purebred dog health is thought to be compromised by an increasing occurence of inherited diseases but inadequate prevalence data on common disorders have hampered efforts to prioritise health reforms. Analysis of primary veterinary practice clinical data has been proposed for reliable estimation of disorder prevalence in dogs. Electronic patient record (EPR) data were collected on 148,741 dogs attending 93 clinics across central and south-eastern England. Analysis in detail of a random sample of EPRs relating to 3,884 dogs from 89 clinics identified the most frequently recorded disorders as otitis externa (prevalence 10.2%, 95% CI: 9.1-11.3), periodontal disease (9.3%, 95% CI: 8.3-10.3) and anal sac impaction (7.1%, 95% CI: 6.1-8.1). Using syndromic classification, the most prevalent body location affected was the head-and-neck (32.8%, 95% CI: 30.7-34.9), the most prevalent organ system affected was the integument (36.3%, 95% CI: 33.9-38.6) and the most prevalent pathophysiologic process diagnosed was inflammation (32.1%, 95% CI: 29.8-34.3). Among the twenty most-frequently recorded disorders, purebred dogs had a significantly higher prevalence compared with crossbreds for three: otitis externa (P = 0.001), obesity (P = 0.006) and skin mass lesion (P = 0.033), and popular breeds differed significantly from each other in their prevalence for five: periodontal disease (P = 0.002), overgrown nails (P = 0.004), degenerative joint disease (P = 0.005), obesity (P = 0.001) and lipoma (P = 0.003). These results fill a crucial data gap in disorder prevalence information and assist with disorder prioritisation. The results suggest that, for maximal impact, breeding reforms should target commonly-diagnosed complex disorders that are amenable to genetic improvement and should place special focus on at-risk breeds. Future studies evaluating disorder severity and duration will augment the usefulness of the disorder prevalence information reported herein.","['O Neill DG', 'Church DB', 'McGreevy PD', 'Thomson PC', 'Brodbelt DC']",2014,9,3,PLoS One,"O Neill DG, et al.

Other alphaviruses can also present with febrile arthalgias. Dengue virus transmitted by the same species of mosquitoes may cocirculate, leading to dual infections and concurrent epidemics. Although these diseases share similar clinical features, their prognoses considerably differ. Prominent and prolonged articular disorders are more consistent with chikungunya virus, whereas haemorrhages make the gravity of dengue infection. Specific symptoms are required, especially when diagnostic tests are not available or performable at a large scale. Indeed, early clinical suspicion of a vector-borne disease is crucial to isolate the first cases in the course of an outbreak, and discrimination between arboviruses help to optimal management of patients. No specific chikungunya clinical sign has been yet reported. We highlight here the high prevalence (about 25%) of acute ear redness in infected people during the 2008 chikungunya outbreak in Jahor Bahru in Malaysia.

24491310,Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.
PURPOSE: The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.
ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours [corrected] to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.","['Rosenfeld RM', 'Schwartz SR', 'Cannon CR', 'Roland PS', 'Simon GR', 'Kumar KA', 'Huang WW', 'Haskell HW', 'Robertson PJ']",2014,150,1 Suppl,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Rosenfeld RM, et al.

To improve detection and time to treatment, it is imperative to have LCH in the differential diagnosis for unusual presentations of the aforementioned infectious head and neck etiologies.

24448298,Clinical outcome parameters for necrotizing otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the duration of time elapsed between the onset of symptoms for necrotizing external otitis (NEO) and admission to hospital that may play a role in patient outcome.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Fourteen consecutive male patients with NEO with no improvement from the previous course of antibiotherapy and with findings of osteomyelitis on temporal bone CT, MRI, and positive detection of Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate on temporal bone, admitted as inpatients between 2008 and 2012.
INTERVENTION(S): Medical treatment of NEO and surgical debridement.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Patients were divided into 2 groups according to median time elapsed between onset of symptoms and hospitalization (<30 d or >30 d). HbA1c, fasting blood sugar, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, pain intensity, radiologic grade, improvement since diagnosis, and total time to cure were compared according to the groups. The relationships between the laboratory data were analyzed to determine the parameters associated with time to recovery.
RESULTS: Otalgia was significantly worse in patients who were admitted to hospital greater than 30 days after symptom onset (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.002). Blood glucose increased related to delayed admission time (p < 0.001). CRP results were independently elevated from the admission time (p < 0.112). There was a statistically significant difference between groups according to ESR levels and recovery time (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.004 and p < 0.01). There was a positive correlation between HbA1c levels and recovery time in Group 1 and between ESR levels and recovery time in Group 2 (r = 0.872, p = 0.044; r = 0.630, p = 0.039).

Common conditions affecting the ear in the athlete include otitis externa, an infection of the external ear; external auditory canal exostoses, or abnormal bony growths in the canal; and otitis media, an infection of the middle ear. Given its position on the head, the ear is subject to trauma, often resulting in an auricular hematoma. Divers, due to pressure changes on descent and ascent, are subject to both ear barotrauma and ear decompression sickness.

Acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing dissolved ofloxacin was added to molten GMO as an aqueous phase, this resulted in the formation of a cubic and a reverse hexagonal phases. The release behavior of ofloxacin from the drug delivery system was studied using three different methods. The mechanism of drug release using paddles/dissolution apparatus and Franz diffusion cells followed Higuchi and Fickian diffusion models; whereas intrinsic release rate method showed zero-order kinetics. The intrinsic release rate was estimated and found to be 187.2 µg/cm(2)/h. The release mechanisms were similar irrespective of the loaded ofloxacin amount, however, the higher drug load displayed higher release rate. The drug delivery system was proven to be microbiologically effective by using agar diffusion method, against Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The GMO/ofloxacin formulation was stable for 6 months after preparation at room temperature as measured with respect to phase stability and antibacterial activity.","['Adwan S', 'Abu-Dahab R', 'Al-Bakri AG', 'Sallam A']",2015,20,3,Pharm Dev Technol,"Adwan S, et al.

In both, a devastating infection and neural paralysis deteriorated after conventional therapy, including long-term intravenous administration of culture-directed antibiotics with strict control of blood sugar levels and surgical debridement of infectious granulation tissue. Since poor perfusion of antibiotics in the lesion may be associated with serious nature of MEO/SBO, we administered antibiotics intra-arterially via a retrograde catheter with the tip set at the proximal point of the external carotid artery to increase the tissue drug concentration in the maxillary artery (MA) and ascending pharyngeal artery (APA) supply areas, in which intense inflammation was observed. This intra-arterial administration of antibiotics (IA therapy) followed by long-term intravenous and oral antibiotic treatments eliminated their infection and no recurrence was observed in 2 years follow-up period. Interestingly, CT images of angiography via the catheter demonstrated stronger enhancement in the MA supply area compared to the APA supply area and IA therapy was more effective in the former. These results suggest that IA therapy, which might achieve high antibiotic concentration at the site of infection, is effective in patients with MEO/SBO refractory to conventional treatments.","['Yamazaki H', 'Kikuchi M', 'Shinohara S', 'Naito Y', 'Fujiwara K', 'Kanazawa Y', 'Tona R']",2014,41,4,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Yamazaki H, et al.

26521366,Herniation of the temporomandibular joint into the external auditory canal: Our review of 13 cases.,"UNLABELLED: Symptomatic dehiscence of the anterior wall of the external auditory canal is only occasionally encountered during otologic surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To propose a technical answer for the reconstruction of anterior wall defects based on the size of the dehiscence.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 13 cases of dehiscence of the anterior wall (9 male and 4 female patients between 30 and 66 years) operated between 1998 and 2010. The pathologies at the cause of the dehiscence were cholesteatoma (2 cases), chronic otitis externa (3 cases), congenital dehiscence (1 case), 5 cases which appeared after a surgery mainly for exostosis (3 of them previously operated in another center) and 2 cases of accidental breach during canal calibration. The size of the defect measured during surgery was ""small"" (< 4 mm diameter) in 2 cases, ""medium"" (between 4 and 8 mm) in 8 cases and ""large"" in 3 (> 8 mm). The reconstruction was performed in 7 cases through the EAC and in 6 cases an anterior approach of the anterior wall of the EAC was used. In all cases, we could insert a graft anteriorly and this was held in place by the pressure exerted by the temporomandibular joint. Bone paté and temporalis fascia with in most cases a piece of cortical bone graft was used in all cases.
RESULTS: The follow up period ranged from 6 to 24 months. In 10 cases the anatomical result was perfect (in 3 cases we encountered some minor complications but with no clinical consequences). In the other three cases there was one with persistent inflammation of the external auditory canal, one case of recurrence of the lateralization of the tympanic membrane and one case which required a revision surgery.
CONCLUSION: The reconstruction and the approach are done according to the size of the defect, whether small, medium or large. Complications and revision surgeries have been minimal.","['Portmann D', 'Guindi S', 'Sribniak I', 'Arcaute Aizpuru F']",2014,135,4-5,Rev Laryngol Otol Rhinol (Bord),"Portmann D, et al.

24366845,Per-endoscopic trans-tympanic traction for the management of feline aural inflammatory polyps: a case review of 37 cats.,"Feline aural inflammatory polyps are benign growths originating from the tympanic cavity or the Eustachian tube. They usually occur in young cats, which present either signs of otitis externa and otitis media, or respiratory signs, depending on the direction of polyp growth. Neurological signs are also reported. Simple traction and ventral bulla osteotomy (VBO) are the most common techniques used for treating this condition in cats; corticosteroids are recommended to reduce risk of recurrence given the inflammatory nature of the disease. The most common complications after treatment are Horner's syndrome, polyp recurrence and facial nerve paralysis. The aim of this report is to describe the per-endoscopic trans-tympanic traction (PTT) technique for treating feline aural inflammatory polyps and to report the short- and long-term follow-up of this procedure. PTT allowed resolution of the aural inflammatory polyps in 94% of cats during a mean long-term outcome of 19 months. Three cats (8%) developed Horner's syndrome immediately after the PTT procedure, which resolved within a few weeks, and five cats had polyp recurrence (13.5%). Only two cats had a poor outcome and were diagnosed with chronic otitis media at 22 months, and chronic otitis media and polyp recurrence at 46 months after the PTT procedure, respectively. PTT was shown to be an effective technique for treating aural inflammatory polyps and registered fewer neurological complications (8%) than VBO (57-81%) or simple traction (43%), and a recurrence percentage (13.5%) similar to VBO (0-33%) and much lower than traction alone (57%).","['Greci V', 'Vernia E', 'Mortellaro CM']",2014,16,8,J Feline Med Surg,"Greci V, et al.

24252581,Postinflammatory medial meatal fibrosis: early and late surgical outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the primary and long-term surgical outcomes of patients with postinflammatory medial meatal fibrosis.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 14 ears (in 12 patients) with postinflammatory medial meatal fibrosis managed surgically. Outcome measures were primary (i.e. less than six months) and long-term (i.e. greater than five years) closure of the air-bone gap, and the incidence of otorrhoea and restenosis.
RESULTS: At primary review, the mean air-bone gap ± standard deviation had decreased from 29.9 ± 11.6 dB to 12 ± 8.4 dB (p < 0.0006). Seven (50 per cent) ears had closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB. However, for the 9 ears receiving long-term review, the mean air-bone gap ± standard deviation increased to 19.3 ± 15.2 dB; there was no significant difference between this result and pre-operative values (p = 0.06). Of the 9 long-term review ears, 3 (33 per cent) showed closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB. Recurrent otorrhoea was the most common complication, occurring in 5 of the 9 long-term review ears (56 per cent); in addition, 3 (33 per cent) of these 9 ears developed restenosis.
CONCLUSION: Over time, the success of surgery for postinflammatory medial meatal fibrosis diminishes. This was demonstrated in the present study by progressive post-operative hearing decline and a high prevalence of otorrhoea and restenosis.","['Ghani A', 'Smith MC']",2013,127,12,J Laryngol Otol,Ghani A and Smith MC.

24245100,[The swimmer's otitis. An up to date and prevention options].,"The swimmer's otitis or acute otitis externa, is a pathology that often occurs in those who practice swimming at a competitive level. The same problem often occurs in the summer with the attendance of swimming pools and bathing areas. A survey made in the United States in 2007 confirms the dynamics of the onset of this pathology, because the contamination of fungi and bacteria in the waters of the swimming pools and the sea cause the inflammation of the epithelium of the auditory canal. To face this issue, in addition to a correct diagnosis, and the necessary and appropriate therapies, it may follow the use of these medicinal preparations. The first one (A) is protective-acting, the second one (B) is characterized as a preventive, hygroscopic, moistening, antiseptic and antimycotic-acting solution. Swimmers who have been using the two (pre-and post) preparations daily for about a year have reported sporadic episodes of otitis.

24226755,Prevalence of otitis externa in stray cats in northern Italy.,"Feline otitis externa is a dermatological disorder that has not been evaluated much in stray cats. One hundred and eighty-seven stray cats were randomly selected during a trap-neuter-release programme to investigate the prevalence of otitis externa in stray cat colonies in northern Italy. Swabs for cytological examination were obtained from the external ear canal of each cat. A direct otoscopic assessment of the external ear canal was made in 86/187 cats. Cytological evidence of otitis externa was present in 55.1% of cats. The influence on otitis of age, gender, habitat and season of sampling was tested, but no risk factors were found. Otodectes cynotis (as a sole agent or in combination) was the primary cause of otitis in 53.3% of cats. Cocci and rods, either alone or in combination with other agents, were perpetuating factors in 71.8% and 29.1% of cats, respectively. Pregnancy status was a risk factor for otitis caused by coccal infections. Malassezia species, alone or in combination, was the perpetuating factor in 50.5% of cats with otitis. Urban habitat and winter season were risk factors for otitis associated with Malassezia species. Demodex cati was identified as an incidental finding in two cats. There was good agreement between otoscopy and cytology with regard to the diagnosis of otitis externa. The results of this study show a high prevalence of otitis externa in stray colony cats and provide information on causal factors for feline otitis externa.","['Perego R', 'Proverbio D', 'Bagnagatti De Giorgi G', 'Della Pepa A', 'Spada E']",2014,16,6,J Feline Med Surg,"Perego R, et al.

24216440,Update on new medicinal applications of gentamicin: evidence-based review.,"Gentamicin (GM) was discovered in 1963 and was introduced into parenteral usage in 1971. Since then, GM has been widely used in medicinal applications. The Food and Drug Administration of the United States approved the routine prescription of GM to treat the following infectious disorders: infection due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacteriaceae spp., Pseudomonas spp.; Staphylococcus infectious disease; bacterial meningitis; bacterial sepsis of newborns; bacterial septicemia; infection of the eye, bone, skin and/or subcutaneous tissue; infective endocarditis; peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis due to Pseudomonas and other gram-negative organisms; peritonitis due to gastrointestinal tract infections; respiratory tract infections; and urinary tract infectious disease. GM is an old antibiotic and is used widely beyond its FDA-labeled indications as follows: actinomycotic infection; Staphylococcus saprophyticus bacteremia with pyelonephritis; appendicitis; cystic fibrosis; diverticulitis; adjunct regimen for febrile neutropenia; female genital infection; uterine infection; postnatal infection; necrotizing enterocolitis in fetus or newborn; osteomyelitis; pelvic inflammatory disease; plague; gonorrhea; tularemia; prophylaxis of post-cholecystectomy infection, transrectal prostate biopsy, and post-tympanostomy-related infection; malignant otitis externa; and intratympanically or transtympanically for Ménière's disease. GM is also used in combination regimens, such as with beta-lactam antibiotics to treat mixed infection and with bacteriophage to treat Staphylococcus aureus infections. It is also added to medical materials, such as GM-loaded cement spacers for osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint-associated infections. Overall, there are many medicinal applications for GM. To reduce the development of GM-resistant bacteria and to maintain its effectiveness, GM should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected as being caused by susceptible bacteria. In the future, we believe that GM will be used more widely in combination therapy and applied to medical materials for clinical applications. A definitive, appropriately powered study of this antibiotic and its clinical applications is now required, especially in terms of its effectiveness, safety, and cost.","['Chen C', 'Chen Y', 'Wu P', 'Chen B']",2014,113,2,J Formos Med Assoc,"Chen C, et al.

24169084,Necrotising otitis externa: clinical profile and management protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Necrotising otitis externa, which is typically seen in elderly diabetics, is a severe infective disorder caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There is lack of standard management policy for necrotising otitis externa, hence this study attempted to frame a protocol for management based on clinical parameters.
METHOD: A retrospective study of 27 patients with necrotising otitis externa was conducted over 6 years in a tertiary care hospital. Data were analysed with regards to demographic characteristics, clinical features, investigations, staging and treatment modalities.
RESULTS: Out of 27 patients, 26 were diabetics. The commonest organism isolated was P aeruginosa, which was sensitive to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Nine patients had cranial nerve involvement. Twelve of 15 patients treated with medical therapy recovered, as did 11 of 12 patients that underwent surgery.
CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion, early diagnosis and prompt intervention are key factors to decrease morbidity and mortality. Fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins and surgical debridement are the mainstay of treatment.","['Lambor DV', 'Das CP', 'Goel HC', 'Tiwari M', 'Lambor SD', 'Fegade MV']",2013,127,11,J Laryngol Otol,"Lambor DV, et al.

24164511,"Skin diseases in pet rabbits: a retrospective study of 334 cases seen at the University of California at Davis, USA (1984-2004).","BACKGROUND: Rabbits are growing in popularity as companion animals, and dermatology problems are often the presenting complaint when seeing a veterinarian.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To document skin diseases and their prevalence in pet domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in northern California, USA; to investigate predilections for breed, age or sex for the most common conditions over a 20 year period.
ANIMALS: Three hundred and thirty-four pet rabbits from the overall hospital population met inclusion criteria.
METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out by searching the computerized medical records of rabbits seen at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH) from 1 January 1984 to 31 December 2004 using key words relevant to dermatology.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine per cent of pet rabbits seen at the VMTH had skin disease. Lop-eared rabbits were over-represented, whereas mixed-breed rabbits and castrated males were under-represented in the dermatology caseload compared with the hospital population. Pododermatitis was the most common skin disease; abscesses, alopecia, otitis externa and ectoparasites also were common. Several species of bacteria other than Pasteurella spp. were isolated from abscesses. Despite the frequent mention of myxomatosis and venereal spirochetosis in the rabbit literature, few cases (three and two, respectively) were diagnosed. Castrated males were 3.7 times more likely to present with alopecia than intact males; rabbits <1 year of age were 3.6 times more likely to present with Psoroptes infestation/otitis than adult rabbits.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Cutaneous conditions in pet rabbits in the USA are common. Bacterial culture should be performed and antibiotic susceptibility determined in all rabbits with abscesses, particularly those not responding to typical anti-Pasteurella antibiotics.","['Snook TS', 'White SD', 'Hawkins MG', 'Tell LA', 'Wilson LS', 'Outerbridge CA', 'Ihrke PJ']",2013,24,6,Vet Dermatol,"Snook TS, et al.

24163508,Skull base osteomyelitis in otitis externa: The utility of triphasic and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography bone scintigraphy.,"BACKGROUND: Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) refers to infection that has spread beyond the external auditory canal to the base of the skull in advanced stages of otitis externa. Clinically, it may be difficult to differentiate SBO from severe otitis externa without bony involvement. This study was performed to determine the role of three phase bone scintigraphy (TPBS) and single photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in detecting SBO.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed records of 20 patients (14 M, 6 F) with otitis externa and suspected SBO. TPBS and SPECT/CT of the skull were performed. Findings were correlated with clinical, laboratory and diagnostic CT scan findings.
RESULTS: All patients were diabetic with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A total of 18 patients had bilateral and two unilateral symptoms. Cranial nerves were involved in eight patients and microbiological culture of ear discharge fluid positive in seven. Early images showed increased temporal vascularity in nine patients and increased soft-tissue uptake in 10, while delayed images showed increased bone uptake in 19/20 patients. Localized abnormal tracer uptake was shown by SPECT/CT in the mastoid temporal (15), petrous (11), sphenoid (3) and zygomatic (1) and showed destructive changes in five. Thus, TPBS was found positive for SBO in 10/20 patients and changed the management in four.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that TPBS with SPECT/CT is a useful non-invasive investigation for detection of SBO in otitis externa.","['Chakraborty D', 'Bhattacharya A', 'Gupta AK', 'Panda NK', 'Das A', 'Mittal BR']",2013,28,2,Indian J Nucl Med,"Chakraborty D, et al.

24155434,An investigation of ear necrosis in pigs.,"Porcine ear necrosis was investigated in 23 conveniently chosen farms, consisting of 14 case farms and 9 control farms. Biopsies of lesions and oral swabs from pigs on 11 case farms were examined by histology and bacterial culture. All farms were visited for observations and a survey on management, housing, and the presence of other clinical signs or behavioral vices. Histological examination revealed that the lesions began on the surface and progressed to deeper layers, and that vascular damage did not appear to be the initiating cause. Spirochetes were only rarely observed in histological examination and were not cultured from biopsies and oral swabs. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus hyicus were cultured from 91% and 66% of samples, respectively. Ear biting and a humid environment were associated with ear necrosis. On some farms large numbers of pigs were affected and lesions were sometimes extensive. The condition appears to be an infectious disease beginning on the surface of the skin; contributing environmental and management factors are likely.","['Park J', 'Friendship RM', 'Poljak Z', 'DeLay J', 'Slavic D', 'Dewey CE']",2013,54,5,Can Vet J,"Park J, et al.

24115113,Central skull base osteomyelitis: an emerging clinical entity.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) most commonly results as a complication of otitis externa in diabetic patients. Central or atypical presentations, unrelated to aural pathology, have been documented, though restricted to small patient series or case reports. The current study systematically analyzed the literature to construct the clinical profile of this rare entity.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of case series.
METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched for all published cases of central SBO. Four additional cases were included from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Statistical analysis was performed to identify trends affecting overall outcomes or differences in treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 42 cases were included with mean age of 52 years and male:female ratio of 2.2:1. The most common presenting symptoms were headaches and cranial nerve palsies, including VI (31%), IX (29%), and X (29%). Staphylococcus aureus (21%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%) were the two most common causative pathogens. The mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 21 weeks, with 55% requiring intravenous antibiotics for a mean duration of 6.9 weeks. Twenty of 42 patients (48%) received surgical biopsy for diagnosis, whereas 18 patients (43%) required adjunct surgical debridement. Women were more likely than men to require multiple courses of therapy (46% vs. 7%, P = .01). The overall mortality was 9.5%, with an additional 31% experiencing residual neurological dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Osteomyelitis of the central skull base poses significant challenges for timely and accurate diagnosis. Aggressive management with antimicrobials, coupled with surgical debridement in select cases, may avoid serious neurologic morbidity and mortality.","['Johnson AK', 'Batra PS']",2014,124,5,Laryngoscope,Johnson AK and Batra PS.

24093464,Ciprofloxacin 0.3% + dexamethasone 0.1% for the treatment for otitis media.,"INTRODUCTION: Ciprofloxacin 0.3% with dexamethasone 0.1% (ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone) is an ototopical preparation for acute otitis externa, otorrhea with tympanostomy tubes, and is frequently used to treat chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The advantage of topical therapy is the ability to deliver higher concentration of antibiotics to the treatment site when compared with oral or parenteral antibiotics. The delivery of a high concentration of antibiotics significantly decreases treatment failure and makes the development of resistant organisms unlikely. Previous ototopical preparations contained antibiotics such as aminoglycosides that are known to be ototoxic making treatment of otic infections without an intact tympanic membrane difficulty.
AREAS COVERED: A literature search of PubMed was performed as the basis for a literature-based discussion on the clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone compared to oral antibiotics and ototopical therapy without a steroid component. The potential ototoxicity of ototopical therapies is discussed, including evidence demonstrating the lack of ototoxicity of fluoroquinolone and dexamethasone containing drops.
EXPERT OPINION: Because multiple studies have demonstrated that fluoroquinolones are not ototoxic, fluoroquinolone ototopical drops should be a first-line treatment for otorrhea without an intact membrane. The addition of dexamethasone 0.1% to ciprofloxacin 0.3% has been shown to decrease granulation tissue, improve clinical cure and achieve greater rates of bacterial eradication when compared to ciprofloxacin 0.3% alone.","['Kutz JW', 'Roland PS', 'Lee KH']",2013,14,17,Expert Opin Pharmacother,"Kutz JW, et al.

23988991,Incus necrosis after irradiation.,"OBJECTIVES: Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the temporal bone is a rare, late complication of radiotherapy to the temporal bone region for head and neck or skull base tumours. ORN can occur as a localized or a diffuse type, according to the extension of the affected temporal bone. It can lead to otitis externa, otitis media, aseptic labyrinthitis and may lead to serious intracranial complications. Hearing loss may be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. A few case studies report of previously irradiated patients presenting with conductive hearing loss presumably caused by ORN of the ossicular chain. In only one case report of diffuse ORN, ORN of the ossicles was histologically proven, leading to the conclusion that ossicular chain involvement as the sole entity of ORN would not exist. However, the presented case report disputes this.
PATIENTS: A 13-year-old boy presenting with a unilateral mixed hearing loss as the sole otological complaint, 10 years after radiotherapy for an anaplastic ependymoma.
RESULTS: Middle ear inspection revealed ORN of the incus which was confirmed by histological investigation.
CONCLUSION: ORN of the ossicular chain as a late complication can occur as an isolated entity and may present as conductive hearing loss predominantly in the low frequencies. Middle ear inspection and ossicular chain reconstruction should be attempted, bearing in mind the risk of iatrogenic lacerations of a thin tympanic membrane and possibly a delayed wound healing.","['Rotteveel LJ', 'Siekman U', 'Linder TE']",2013,34,9,Otol Neurotol,"Rotteveel LJ, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, prospective, controlled study was conducted in the chinchilla animal model.
METHODS: Fourteen female chinchillas were used. After an incision was made in each tympanic membrane, baseline auditory brainstem response measurements were performed at 16, 20, and 25 kHz. One ear was randomized to receive aluminum acetate (0.5%)/benzethonium chloride (0.03%), whereas the other ear served as the control and received 0.9% NaCl. Solutions were applied transtympanically once a day for 3 consecutive days. Postapplication auditory brainstem response measurements were done at day 7 and day 30. In half of the animals, scanning electron microscopy was done following the last auditory brainstem response measurement.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found between the mean threshold shifts in the experimental and control ears at all frequencies on both 7 and 30 days postapplication (P < .02). Increased ossification of the cochleae was seen in experimental ears (n = 12). Scanning electron microscopy study demonstrated outer hair cell damage and/or loss in the experimental ears. No significant morphological changes were detected on scanning electron microscopy obtained from the control ears.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of aluminum acetate (0.5%)/benzethonium chloride (0.03%) otic solution causes hearing loss in chinchillas when a tympanic membrane perforation exists. Further studies are needed to test the effect of this otic solution on hearing.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To assess an owner-completed questionnaire as an indicator of hearing loss and a canine hearing loss scoring system in chronic canine otitis.
ANIMALS: One hundred hospital population dogs referred for chronic otitis investigation.
METHODS: Owners completed a questionnaire to assess their dog's response to common household noises. The presence of otitis externa or media was determined and brainstem auditory-evoked response measurements were performed on each dog. The minimal hearing threshold (MHT) in decibels normal hearing level (dB NHL) was recorded and categorized according to the human World Health Organization grading system into five grades from 0 to 4 with cut-off values of ≤25 dB NHL, 26-40 dB NHL, 41-60 dB NHL, 60-80 dB NHL and ≥81 dB NHL.
RESULTS: The questionnaire correctly determined normal hearing in grade 0 cases, but did not reliably detect unilateral or grade 1 bilateral hearing loss. For dogs with bilateral hearing loss ≥ grade 2, questionnaire sensitivity was 83% [24 of 29, 95% confidence interval, (CI) 64-94%] and specificity was 94% (67 of 71, 95% CI 86-98%). Higher grades of hearing loss were significantly associated with the presence of otitis media (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The questionnaire may be a useful in-practice screening tool in chronic canine otitis for moderate to severe bilateral hearing deficits (MHT ≥41 dB NHL). The hearing loss grading system may help clinicians make therapeutic decisions.

23815797,The current practice trends in pediatric bone-anchored hearing aids in Canada: a national clinical and surgical practice survey.,"BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) in the 1980s, the practices of surgeons who implant these hearing aids have become varied; different indications and surgical techniques are utilized depending on the surgeon and institution. The objective of the current study is to describe the clinical and surgical practices of otolaryngologists in Canada who perform pediatric BAHA operations.
METHODS: A detailed practice questionnaire was devised and sent to all members of the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Those who performed pediatric BAHA surgeries were asked to participate.
RESULTS: Twelve responses were received (response rate of 80%). All of the respondents identified congenital aural atresia to be an indication for pediatric BAHAs. Other indications were chronic otitis externa or media with hearing loss (92%), allergic reactions to conventional hearing aids (75%), congenital fixation or anomaly of ossicular chain (67%), and unilateral deafness (25%). Minor complications, such as skin reactions, were reported in 25% of cases, while major complications were very rare. There was great variability with regards to surgical techinque and post-operative management. The extent of financial support for the BAHA hardware and device also varied between provinces, and even within the same province.
CONCLUSION: There is a lack of general consensus regarding pediatric BAHA surgeries in Canada. With such a small community of otolaryngologists performing this procedure, we are hopeful that this survey can serve as an impetus for a national collaboration to establish a set of general management principles and inspire multi-site research ventures.","['Liu CC', 'Chadha NK', 'Bance M', 'Hong P']",2013,42,1,J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Liu CC, et al.

Pus swabs were taken, from which microorganisms were cultured and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility.
RESULTS: Of 79 patients with otorrhoea, 50 had otitis media, 21 had otitis externa and the condition was not determined in 8 patients. The most common organism isolated with otitis media was Proteus mirabilis (18/50; 36%) and with otitis externa, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7/21; 33%). Otorrhoea had a different microbial spectrum compared with international reports, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in a single patient. The organisms isolated were susceptible mainly to fluoroquinolones (96%) and aminoglycosides (81%).
CONCLUSION: Amoxicillin is a poor choice of antibiotic due to its low sensitivity, which calls into question the current DoH guideline for otorrhoea. Antimicrobial treatment protocols should be based on local data and be revisited from time to time. This study suggests that, should first-line treatment fail, an antibiotic with Gram-negative cover, e.g. a topical fluoroquinolone, should be considered.","['Meyer E', 'Whitelaw A', 'Edkins O', 'Fagan JJ']",2013,103,7,S Afr Med J,"Meyer E, et al.

23764317,Otitis externa following aural irrigation linked to instruments contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute otitis externa, an infection of the external auditory canal, in general practitioners' (GP) practices in The Netherlands is about 14 per 1000 patients per year. In early 2010, one of the authors noted that some of the otitis externa patients in his GP practice had undergone cerumen removal by ear syringing a few weeks earlier. Bacterial cultures of samples taken from the instruments used showed contamination of an ear syringe by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. From then on, P. aeruginosa isolates from patients' ears were stored in the laboratory.
AIM: It was assessed whether cross-contamination with P. aeruginosa between patients in the same GP practice could occur through the use of contaminated ear lavage instruments.
METHODS: From 17 GP practices, the otolaryngology Outpatient Department and the Out-of-Hours GP Service, instruments used for examining and cleaning the outer ear were swabbed. Strains of P. aeruginosa cultured from the instruments were genotyped together with isolates of patients registered in the same practice.
FINDINGS: In four practices where contaminated instruments were found, genotyping showed similarity between P. aeruginosa strains isolated from a patient and the ear syringe, and/or between strains of different patients in the same practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of P. aeruginosa from ear lavage instruments to patients appears to occur with otitis externa as a result. Together with the Infection Control Unit of our hospital we have formulated recommendations for the appropriate cleaning, disinfection and storage of re-usable ear lavage instruments for the GP practices to implement.","['Bruins MJ', 'Wijshake D', 'de Vries-van Rossum SV', 'Klein Overmeen RG', 'Ruijs GJ']",2013,84,3,J Hosp Infect,"Bruins MJ, et al.

23740414,A minimally invasive technique for the implantation of bone-anchored hearing devices.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe and evaluate a novel technique for the implantation of bone conduction hearing devices as compared with a common, conventional technique.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.
SETTING: Tertiary referral otology and neurotology practice.
METHODS: Individuals who underwent the implantation of bone-anchored hearing devices between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011, were identified. Demographic data, surgical indications, surgical technique used, surgical time, and complications were recorded. Soft tissue complications were graded on the Holgers classification scheme. Group 1 was defined as those undergoing a traditional technique using a dermatome with subcutaneous tissue reduction. Group 2 was defined as those undergoing the described technique for implantation of the coupling hardware with minimal subcutaneous soft tissue reduction.
RESULTS: Forty patients underwent the procedure, with 11 patients comprising group 1 and 29 patients comprising group 2. Group 2 required a shorter operative time (32.3 vs 56.1 minutes, P < .0001). Of patients in group 1, 2 of 11 developed soft tissue complications, whereas 5 of 29 in group 2 developed soft tissue complications (P = 1.000). Most soft tissue complications were reversed with conservative wound care.
CONCLUSION: Surgery was performed faster with similar postoperative outcomes in individuals undergoing implantation of bone-anchored hearing devices using the described technique that necessitated minimal soft tissue reduction.","['Wilson DF', 'Kim HH']",2013,149,3,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Wilson DF and Kim HH.

23739560,Active middle ear implantation for patients with sensorineural hearing loss and external otitis: long-term outcome in patient satisfaction.,"OBJECTIVE: To study long-term subjective benefit of patients with sensorineural hearing loss and chronic external otitis who use active middle ear implants.
DESIGN: Single-subject repeated measures in a preintervention and postintervention design with multiple postintervention measurements (questionnaires).
SETTING: Tertiary academic center.
PATIENTS: Moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss (n = 56) with severe chronic external otitis who use the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) or Otologics MET middle ear implant systems.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Changes in hearing disability and handicap as evaluated using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire (NCIQ), and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI).
RESULTS: Data of 33 patients (mean postoperative duration of 7.5 yr) were available. No difference in subjective results was found between the VSB and Otologics MET patient groups. Total percentage of nonuse was 13%. Long-term APHAB results show a significant decrease in disability for 43% of the patients compared with 54% at 1-year postoperative. NCIQ results show a significant benefit for all subdomains with a negative trend over time. The GBI results show a significant long-term increase in quality of life with positive scores for 82% of the assessed patients.
CONCLUSION: Long-term postoperative patient satisfaction and quality of life results show a significant difference compared with preoperative measurements, with conventional hearing aids. A negative trend over time is found on all questionnaires, which might reflect patient aging (increase of hearing loss) or habituation to a situation with fewer concerns regarding a patient's external otitis.","['Zwartenkot JW', 'Hashemi J', 'Cremers CW', 'Mulder JJ', 'Snik AF']",2013,34,5,Otol Neurotol,"Zwartenkot JW, et al.

23731504,Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus responsible for human colonization and infection in an area of Italy with high density of pig farming.,"BACKGROUND: Livestock-Associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) belonging to ST398 lineage, common among pigs and other animals, emerged in Central and Northern Europe, becoming a new risk factor for MRSA among farm workers. Strains belonging to ST398 can be responsible for human colonization and infection, mainly in areas with high livestock-farming. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) human colonization and infections in an area of the Lombardy Region (Italy), the Italian region with the highest density of pig farming.
METHODS: In the period March-April 2010, 879 nasal swabs were taken from subjects at admission to a local hospital serving an area of the Lombardy Region devoted to agriculture and farming. In the period March 2010-February 2011, all MRSA strains from community-acquired infection (CAI) observed in the same hospital, were collected. Molecular characterization of the isolates included SCCmec typing, spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST).
RESULTS: Out of 879 nasal swabs examined, 9 (1%) yielded MRSA. Five strains were assigned to sequence type (ST)398 (spa t899, 3 isolates; t108 and t2922, 1 isolate each) and were therefore categorized as LA-MRSA. The other 4 isolates were likely of hospital origin. No strains were positive for Panton-Valentine Leukocidin genes. Twenty MRSA isolates were detected from CAI, 17 were from skin and soft-tissue infections and 3 from other infections. An MRSA isolate from otitis externa was t899/ST398 and PVL-negative, hence categorized as LA-MRSA. Four isolates were assigned to t127/ST1. Eight strains were PVL-positive community acquired (CA)-MRSA and belonged to different clones, the most frequent being ST8.
CONCLUSIONS: In an area of Italy with high density of pig farming, LA-MRSA is able to colonize the population and rarely to produce infections. Typical CA-MRSA is more common than LA-MRSA among CAI.","['Monaco M', 'Pedroni P', 'Sanchini A', 'Bonomini A', 'Indelicato A', 'Pantosti A']",2013,13,,BMC Infect Dis,"Monaco M, et al.

23728650,Hyperbaric oxygen as an adjuvant treatment for malignant otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Malignant, or necrotising, otitis externa is a potentially fatal infection of the external ear canal and surrounding soft tissue and bone. It may be complicated by involvement of cranial nerves, principally the facial nerves and the contents of the jugular foramen. It is an uncommon condition mainly found in the elderly or in diabetics.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment for malignant otitis externa.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 4 April 2013.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, involving adults, undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy in malignant otitis externa.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No identified articles described randomised controlled trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of malignant otitis externa.
MAIN RESULTS: Due to the lack of data we could present no results.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No clear evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy when compared to treatment with antibiotics and/or surgery. We found no data to compare rates of complication between the different treatment modalities. Further research is required.","['Phillips JS', 'Jones SE']",2013,2013,5,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Phillips JS and Jones SE. Hyperbaric oxygen as an adjuvant treatment for malignant otitis externa.

Despite resolution of the infection and prednisolone therapy, his kidney disease worsened. However, the addition of cyclosporine A finally resulted in complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome. A review of similar cases with post-Staphylococcal infection HSPN revealed strong similarities between this entity and immunoglobulin A-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis (IgA-PIGN), an increasingly recognized form of PIGN typically associated with Staphylococcal infection, in both clinical and morphological features.

23721182,The joint in vitro action of polymyxin B and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three European countries.,"BACKGROUND: Canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. For topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to elucidate the in vitro activity of polymyxin B and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates from three European countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions.
ANIMALS: Seventeen strains of Escherichia coli, 24 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in Germany, France and Italy.
METHODS: Drug activities were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration. The potentiation of polymyxin B plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). An FICI ≤0.5 defined synergy. Furthermore, geographical variations in the FICI and MIC were assessed by statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different European countries, because there were no significant MIC and FICI variations (P > 0.05). As a single agent, polymyxin B had bactericidal activity against most E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against S. pseudintermedius strains. Miconazole was bactericidal against all Staphylococcus strains. Synergy was demonstrated against strains of E. coli and P. aeruginosa (FICI = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against S. pseudintermedius strains (FICI = 1.25). Proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In vitro synergy of polymyxin B and miconazole against E. coli and P. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.","['Pietschmann S', 'Meyer M', 'Voget M', 'Cieslicki M']",2013,24,4,Vet Dermatol,"Pietschmann S, et al.

23673152,Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal.,"BACKGROUND: Osteonecrosis is a benign condition characterised by necrotic exposed bone, and is associated with bisphosphonate use. Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal is rare, with only a few reported cases.
METHOD: Two case reports of temporal bone osteonecrosis are presented.
RESULTS: A 64-year-old man with a history of immunoglobulin G kappa multiple myeloma developed a right external auditory canal ulcer 6 years after commencement on clodronate. A 72-year-old woman taking alendronate for osteoporosis, initially diagnosed and treated for right-sided otitis externa, was found to have underlying exposed bone in the right external auditory canal, with a computed tomography scan confirming destruction of the temporal bone.
CONCLUSION: With increasing use of both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates in the community for benign conditions such as osteoporosis and for malignant conditions such as breast cancer and multiple myeloma, the diagnosis of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis should always be considered in patients with a temporal bone lesion, and a relevant drug history taken.","['Wickham N', 'Crawford A', 'Carney AS', 'Goss AN']",2013,127 Suppl 2,,J Laryngol Otol,"Wickham N, et al.

23669376,Is laterality of malignant otitis externa related to handedness?,"Malignant otitis externa (MOE) usually affect patients with systemic diseases, especially diabetes mellitus. MOE is a mainly unilateral disease. Given that around 90% of human adults are right-handed we hypothesized that hand preference might be one of the factors involved in the development of MOE. All 38 of the patients whom we treated for MOE between August 2009 and November 2012 (28 males and 10 females, age range 43-91 years) had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and all of them reported itching in the involved ear. The difference in the laterality of MOE among our right- and left-handed subjects was significant: right hand dominance was associated mostly with right-sided MOE (24/34) and left hand dominance was associated with occurrence of MOE only in the left ears (4/4, p=0.006). These findings point to an unexpectedly strong relationship between the patient's handedness and laterality of his/her MOE, leading us to hypothesize that the development of MOE might be attributable to self-inflicted local trauma to the ear canal on the same side as the dominant hand.","['Migirov L', 'Lipshitz N', 'Dagan E', 'Wolf M']",2013,81,1,Med Hypotheses,"Migirov L, et al.

23641593,Necrotizing external otitis: a case series.,"OBJECTIVES: Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis (NEO) is a life-threatening progressive infection of the external auditory canal, mastoid, and skull base. Here, we review the clinical findings for a series of NEO patients.
METHODOLOGY: This case review study includes 18 patients with NEO (males: 11 (61.11%), females: 7 (38.88%), with a mean age of 65.11 years (range: 40-79)), hospitalized at Al-Zahra hospital in Isfahan province, Iran, during 2007-2011.
RESULTS: The most common presentations were otalgia 18 (100%), otorrhea 15 (83.33%), edema and erythema of the external ear canal 14 (77.77%), and hearing loss 11 (61.11%). We found osteomyelitis of the skull base that involved cranial nerves (most commonly the facial nerve) in 8 patients (44.44%), which seemed to be a higher incidence than reported in previous studies. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in ear specimen cultures in only 7 cases (38.88%), which could be attributed to inappropriate topical and oral use of antipseudomonal agents before proper diagnosis. Nine patients underwent surgical debridement. All cases responded to systemic antipseudomonal antibiotics with no mortality. However, recurrence occurred during the follow-up period in two cases; yet, the patients responded to retreatment.
CONCLUSION: The life expectancy is increasing for diabetic and immunocompromised patients; thus, it is necessary to identify those who have a high risk for NEO, especially older diabetic patients who complain of otalgia and otorrhea that are resistant to routine treatment. Immediate diagnosis and proper treatment is crucial to prevent complications and mortality.","['Soheilipour S', 'Meidani M', 'Derakhshandi H', 'Etemadifar M']",2013,9,1,B-ENT,"Soheilipour S, et al.

It can result in conductive hearing loss, low self-esteem, and social embarrassment. This report highlights a case of otophyma treated successfully using a full-thickness skin graft.
METHODS: We present a case of a 41-year-old lady referred to our department with a 23-year history of bilateral otophyma. During this time, her hearing progressively diminished as the swelling occluded her external auditory meatus. She had been unsuccessfully managed for years with topical emollients, steroids, and regular ear toileting.
RESULT: She was treated by excision of the phymatous tissue and full-thickness grafting, which resulted in a patent external auditory meatus and an improvement in her hearing.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a full-thickness skin graft is one of the many treatment options available for the treatment of otophyma.

It constitutes about 1.5% of all extra-pulmonary cases worldwide. A slight raise in TB incidence rates among children was recently registered in Germany, which can be explained by the increased immigration.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present 2 cases of immigrated children who were diagnosed with Lupus vulagris, both clinically and histopathologically. Although the symptoms and the duration of the skin lesions were very different, both patients had a non-healing skin ulceration.In our cases cultures of the skin biopsy were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the lesions showed marked improvement in response to antituberculous treatment. In the first patient, it took 6 years between occurrence of skin lesions and final diagnosis. The second patient had an extracutaneous focus, namely abdominal TB.
CONCLUSION: We report our experience and emphasize on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric skin TB.","['Striegel AK', 'Nazzal R', 'Fabri M', 'Rietschel E', 'Dötsch J', 'Mauch C', 'Tantcheva-Poor I']",2014,226,1,Klin Padiatr,"Striegel AK, et al.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for publications in English and French languages, between 1968 and October 1, 2011.
STUDY SELECTION: We included publications of all types including at least 6 cases. We excluded publications focused on cranial base osteomyelitis not originating from the external ear and publications limited to a specific population.
DATA EXTRACTION: We assessed publication quality according to international guidelines.
DATA SYNTHESIS: For each publication, data were entered in a spreadsheet software for analysis. We excluded individual data already published in other studies or reviews.
CONCLUSION: Our review revealed the absence of strong scientific evidence regarding diagnosis criteria, treatment protocols and follow-up criteria. This implies the use of highly empirical indexes of suspicion in clinical practice. Our review confirmed the existence of a typical but not exclusive population at risk (aged, male, and diabetic patient) and also revealed major issues: lack of primary prevention in population at risk, delays before referral and management, bacteriologic issues caused by antibiotic misuse (agent identification problems, rise of resistant strains), persistence of recurrent cases. A better diffusion of medical information should help improve the management of this severe disease.","['Mahdyoun P', 'Pulcini C', 'Gahide I', 'Raffaelli C', 'Savoldelli C', 'Castillo L', 'Guevara N']",2013,34,4,Otol Neurotol,"Mahdyoun P, et al.

23574753,Ceruminal diffusion activities and ceruminolytic characteristics of otic preparations - an in-vitro study.,"BACKGROUND: An in-vitro setup was established in order to determine a) the diffusion activities of eight otic preparations (Aurizon®, Eas Otic®, Epi Otic®, Otifree®, Otomax®, Panolog®, Posatex®, Surolan®) through synthetic cerumen, and b) the ceruminolytic capacity and impregnation effects of these products. The main lipid classes of canine cerumen produced with moderate, non-purulent otitis externa were determined by thin layer chromatography and were subsequently used to produce a standardised synthetic cerumen (SCC). SCC was filled into capillary tubes, all of which were loaded with six commercially available multipurpose otic medications and two ear cleaners, each mixed with two markers in two experimental setups. These two marker compounds (Oil red O and marbofloxacin) were chosen, since they exhibit different physicochemical drug characteristics by which it is possible to determine and verify the diffusion activity of different types of liquids (i.e. the otic preparations). A synthetic cerumen described in the literature (JSL) was also used for comparison as its lipid composition was different to SCC. The diffusion activities of the otic preparations through both types of synthetic cerumen were studied over 24 hours. A second in-vitro experiment determined both the ceruminolytic activity and impregnation effect of the otic preparations by comparing the weight loss or weight gain after repeated incubation of JSL.
RESULTS: Canine cerumen is mainly composed of triglycerides, sterol esters, fatty acid esters and squalene. The diffusion experiments showed a high diffusion efficacy along with a high impregnation effect for one test product. All the other products exhibited a lower diffusion activity with a mild to moderate impregnation effect. A mild ceruminolytic activity was observed for the two ear cleaners but not for any of the otic medications.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that there are significant differences in the diffusion characteristics and ceruminolytic properties of the eight tested otic preparations.","['Stahl J', 'Mielke S', 'Pankow WR', 'Kietzmann M']",2013,9,,BMC Vet Res,"Stahl J, et al.

23558287,Malignant otitis externa: an Asian perspective on treatment outcomes and prognostic factors.,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is a severe disease with varying outcomes. Despite advances in antibiotic treatment, a significant proportion still succumbs to this disease. We aimed to analyze the effect of clinical factors on prognosis and to review treatment outcomes in our institution.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series with retrospective chart review of MOE cases from 2006 to 2011.
SETTING: Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, National University Hospital, Singapore, a tertiary referral center.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients with MOE admitted for treatment were studied and divided into 2 outcome groups depending on response to a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics. Demographic and disease factors were analyzed with regard to outcome.
RESULTS: Nineteen cases were analyzed. Disease resolved in 63.2% after 6 weeks of antibiotics. Mortality was 21.1%. Age, diabetic control, duration of diagnostic delay, cranial nerve involvement, and inflammatory markers were not found to predict prognosis. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels correlated with disease activity and can be used to monitor progress. Clival involvement was associated with persistent disease (P = .002). Only 63.2% of cases had positive cultures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the main organism, and 33.3% of isolates were multidrug resistant. Outcome was not different in cases where culture-directed therapy was employed vs those where empirical ceftazidime and fluoroquinolone were used (P = .650).
CONCLUSION: Malignant otitis externa remains an insidious disease with significant mortality. Involvement of the clivus portends a poorer prognosis. Combination therapy with intravenous ceftazidime and oral fluoroquinolone remains relevant despite concerns of culture-negative cases and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas.","['Loh S', 'Loh WS']",2013,148,6,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Loh S and Loh WS.

23551137,Study to assess in vitro antimicrobial activity of nine ear cleaners against 50 Malassezia pachydermatis isolates.,"BACKGROUND: Ear cleaning is an important part of the successful therapy of otitis externa.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vitro activity of nine commercially available ear cleaners (Cerumaural(®), CleanAural Dog(®), Epi-Otic(®), MalAcetic Aural(®), Otoclean(®), Otodine(®), Sancerum(®), Surosolve(®) and TrizUltra™ + Keto) against 50 Malassezia pachydermatis isolates from clinical cases of canine otitis externa. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the in vitro susceptibility of a large number of M. pachydermatis isolates to a variety of ear cleaner products.
ANIMALS: Forty-nine hospital population dogs diagnosed with otitis externa with Malassezia spp. present on cytological examination of ear swabs and culture.
METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of nine ear cleaners was tested against 50 M. pachydermatis isolates from 49 clinical cases of canine otitis externa using an in vitro agar diffusion test.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in activity between ear cleaners, with five showing excellent in vitro anti-Malassezia activity (CleanAural Dog(®), Epi-Otic(®), MalAcetic Aural(®), Sancerum(®) and TrizUltra™ + Keto), two moderate activity (Otodine(®) and Surosolve(®)), one variable activity (Otoclean(®)) and one no activity (Cerumaural(®)). There was a significant overall difference in susceptibility between M. pachydermatis isolates tested (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Ear cleaners with activity against Malassezia may help to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotic-containing polypharmaceutical ear medications. This study shows that the use of a large number of isolates may provide a more accurate account of the in vitro activity of a product.","['Mason CL', 'Steen SI', 'Paterson S', 'Cripps PJ']",2013,24,3,Vet Dermatol,"Mason CL, et al.

It reinforces the statement that patients who do not fulfill the standard criteria for CI should be carefully considered on an individual basis.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The patient on this report presented with a ski-slope high-frequency hearing loss and chronic external ear canal infections. The latter precluded the consistent use of hearing aids with moulds. His speech discrimination in quiet and in noise was poor and his hearing loss was interfering with his ability to work.
INTERVENTION: After years of frustration, this patient decided to risk losing his low-frequency residual hearing and was implanted with the new Nucleus CI422 (Cochlear Ltd).
CONCLUSION: Hearing preservation was achieved and he gained a remarkable improvement in his hearing performance. It is thought that his outcomes are the result of the combination of hearing presentation surgery, electrode design, and intensive auditory training.","['Távora-Vieira D', 'Rodrigues S']",2013,14,5,Cochlear Implants Int,Távora-Vieira D and Rodrigues S.

23470180,PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of Demodex injai from otic secretions of a dog.,"BACKGROUND: The identification of Demodex mites from dogs is usually based on morphology and location. Mites with uncharacteristic features or from unusual locations, hosts or disease manifestations could represent new species not previously described; however, this is difficult to determine based on morphology alone.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to identify and confirm Demodex injai in association with otitis externa in a dog using PCR amplification and DNA sequencing.
METHODS: Otic samples were obtained from a beagle in which a long-bodied Demodex mite was identified. For comparison, Demodex mite samples were collected from a swab and scraping of the dorsal skin of a wire-haired fox terrier and an otic sample from a dog with generalized and otic demodicosis. To identify the Demodex mite, DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA was amplified by PCR, sequenced and compared with Demodex sequences available in public databases and from separate samples morphologically diagnosed as D. injai and Demodex canis.
RESULTS: PCR amplification of the long-bodied mite rRNA DNA obtained from otic samples was approximately 330 bp and was identical to that from the mite morphologically identified as D. injai obtained from the dorsal skin of a dog. Furthermore, the examined mite did not have any significant homology to any of the reported genes from Demodex spp.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed that the demodex mites in this case were D. injai.","['Milosevic MA', 'Frank LA', 'Brahmbhatt RA', 'Kania SA']",2013,24,2,Vet Dermatol,"Milosevic MA, et al.

The presence of disease was confirmed by computerized tomography examination, with two rabbits suffering from bilateral disease. The rabbits were anaesthetized and underwent surgery of the affected bulla. Rabbits with bilateral disease had a minimum of 2 weeks between procedures. A single vertical incision was made over the base of the vertical canal, which was bluntly dissected free from surrounding tissue. The ventral portion of the vertical canal was removed and a lateral bulla osteotomy was performed. The mucosa at the base of the dorsal vertical canal was apposed and the aural cartilage sutured to form a blind-ending pouch open at the pretragic incisure. Histopathological samples taken from the dorsal margin of the vertical canal yielded subtle and non-specific changes in the six samples submitted. All rabbits were discharged within 48 hours of surgery. The cosmetic outcome was excellent with animals retaining visually normal aural anatomy. The partial ear canal ablation/lateral bulla osteotomy procedure is quick and has a good cosmetic result when performed in rabbits.","['Eatwell K', 'Mancinelli E', 'Hedley J', 'Keeble E', 'Kovalik M', 'Yool DA']",2013,54,6,J Small Anim Pract,"Eatwell K, et al.

23444468,Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal associated with oral bisphosphonate therapy: case report and literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: To present the first case of a patient with oral bisphosphonates-associated ear canal osteonecrosis (BPECO), review previously published cases, and suggest a definition of BPECO.
PATIENT: A 79-year-old woman with left otorrhea and earache was treated for otitis externa for 2 months. The examination revealed a deep floor of the left ear canal defect. The bisphosphonates were discontinued. By the end of the 6-week-course of intravenous antibiotics, the bone defect progression ceased. Already a month later, the defect was lined from approximately 50%. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up at this stage. She was on oral bisphosphonates for 10 years for severe osteoporosis. She had never been exposed to radiotherapy or had any surgery in the left ear. She admitted to be a habitual cotton bud user for aural toilet.
RESULTS: A CT scan showed an aggressive lobulated mass consistent with carcinoma. A biopsy suggested osteomyelitis with no evidence of malignancy. The final diagnosis was agreed to be the first case of oral BPECO.
INTERVENTION: Debridement, intravenous antibiotics, and cessation of bisphosphonates
CONCLUSION: The BPECO is not very well-known clinical diagnosis among ENT surgeons and, therefore, often misdiagnosed for ear canal cholesteatoma, malignant otitis externa, or temporal bone malignancies. It seems reasonable to re-review patient's medical history with focus on BP medication in cases with negative biopsy. Although the BP osteonecrosis is a rare phenomenon, the large volume of BP prescription makes the number of patients at risk significant.","['Salzman R', 'Hoza J', 'Perina V', 'Stárek I']",2013,34,2,Otol Neurotol,"Salzman R, et al.

23428748,[Phospholipase and proteinase production by Malassezia pachydermatis isolated in dogs with and without otitis].,"BACKGROUND: Malassezia pachydermatis is part of the skin microbiota of dogs and cats. M. pachydermatis has been associated with external otitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis, reported more often in dogs than in cats. When the physical, chemical or immunological mechanisms of the skin are altered, M. pachydermatis could act as a pathogen. Thus, several virulence factors, such as the ability to produce esterase, lipase, lipoxygenase, protease, chondroitin sulphatase, and hyaluronidase, have been studied.
AIMS: In the present study, we aim to identify the phospholipase activity measured at pH 6.3, and the proteinase activity measured at pH 6.3 and pH 6.8 (pH from ears of dogs with external otitis) of M. pachydermatis strains isolated from dogs with and without external otitis.
METHODS: The phospholipase activity was measured using a semi-quantitative method with egg yolk, and the proteinase activity with a semi-quantitative method using bovine serum albumin agar. The study was performed on 96 isolates of M. pachydermatis, 43 isolated from dogs without clinical symptoms of otitis, and 52 isolated from dogs with otitis.
RESULTS: In our study, 75.8% of the isolates showed phospholipase activity at pH 6.3, and 81 and 97.9% of them showed proteinase activity measured at pH 6.3 and 6.8, respectively. A higher phospholipase activity was detected in strains isolated from dogs with otitis. The proteinase activity was increased at a pH of 6.8 (97.9%) in comparison to a pH of 6.3 (81%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the phospholipase activity may play an important role in the invasion of host tissues in chronic canine otitis cases. The proteinase activity results obtained in this study suggest that a reduction in the pH of the treatment may improve its efficacy in the resolution of M. pachydermatis otitis.","['Ortiz G', 'Martín MC', 'Carrillo-Muñoz AJ', 'Payá MJ']",2013,30,4,Rev Iberoam Micol,"Ortiz G, et al.

23403782,[Comparison of four different staining methods for ear cytology of dogs with otitis externa].,"AIM: Cytological examination is crucial for the diagnosis and classification of canine otitis externa. Staining should reveal micro-organisms as perpetuating factors of otitis externa. The aim of the study was to compare four different staining methods (Diff-Quik®, Diff-Quik® after dipping in acetone, Gram Quick stain® and a commercial rapid stain for otitis externa) for ear cytology of dogs with otitis externa and to investigate the agreement of cytology and culture.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a study evaluating dogs with otitis externa, five ear swabs (one for culture and four for cytology) were taken from the horizontal part of the external auditory canal of 224 affected ears and compared semi-quantitatively.
RESULTS: Diff-Quik® with and without prior dipping in acetone as well as the Gram Quick stain® displayed a high degree of agreement in the detection of micro-organisms (cocci p = 0.2366; rods p = 0.4832; yeasts p = 0.1574), while the commercial otitis rapid stain revealed significantly less micro-organisms (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). The results of the first three stains corresponded to the culture results by >  70%; the agreement was lower with the commercial otitis rapid stain. The quickest and easiest method was staining with Diff-Quik®.
CONCLUSION: Diff-Quik® with or without prior dipping in acetone and the Gram Quick stain® had a high agreement in the detection of microorganisms and can thus be considered nearly equivalent for the diagnosis of otitis externa infectiosa. The commercial otitis rapid stain is less reliable.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on this study Diff-Quik® can be recommended for the routine cytology of ear swabs. Additionally, a culture may be indicated and must be interpreted in the context of the cytology.","['Bouassiba C', 'Osthold W', 'Mueller RS']",2013,41,1,Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere,"Bouassiba C, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
SETTING: All otolaryngology departments in one federal state in Germany.
PATIENTS: All 1,037 middle ear surgeries performed in Thuringia in 2005.
INTERVENTIONS: Middle ear surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Analysis of preoperative and postoperative audiometric results, preoperative diagnostics, and postoperative complications. Univariate statistical tests were used to analyze predictors for air-bone gap (ABG) improvement, complications, and need for resurgery. Population data were used to calculate incidences of middle ear diseases admitted for surgery and annual rates of middle ear surgeries.
RESULTS: ABG improved after surgery for chronic otitis media without and with cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, trauma cases, or complication after acute otitis media/externa (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p = 0.005; p = 0.004; respectively). Middle ear surgery significantly improved bone conduction in cases of otosclerosis (p = 0.008), sudden deafness (p = 0.006), and acute otitis media/externa with complication (p = 0.004). There was a trend of more complication in patients older than 60 years (p = 0.055). Surgery was indicated for chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma in 17.4/100,000 persons, for cholesteatoma in 15.0/100,000, for otosclerosis in 5.7/100,000, for sudden deafness with suspicion of perilymph fistula in 1.5/100,000, and for trauma with affection of the lateral cranial base and hearing loss or otitis media with complication in 1.3/100,000 habitants, respectively.

Almost 95% of MEO cases reported in the literature are attributed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and this pathogen is isolated from aural drainage in > 90% of cases. However, in recent years fungal and polymicrobial temporal bone infections have been reported with increasing frequency. The aim of this paper is to discuss a possible pitfall in MEO treatment using an unusual clinical case.

Otitis was assessed with cytological counts of mean number of bacteria and yeast on Days 0 and 10, and scored clinically every other day. All auricular secretions were removed for mite count on Day 10. On Day 0, cytological examination confirmed the presence of secondary bacterial (24/24) and fungal (21/24) infections. No live mites were observed otoscopically after Day 4 and in auricular secretions at Day 10 in both groups. On Day 10, secondary infections were resolved for all cats treated with Oridermyl(®) but were present in all cats treated with Revolution(®).

23276814,Initial management of necrotizing external otitis: errors to avoid.,"OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic and therapeutic practice guidelines have been established for classical forms of benign otitis externa. However, these guidelines do not include unusual forms of the disease, especially ""invasive"" otitis externa. No consensual diagnostic flow diagram has been published in the literature, which frequently results in delayed diagnosis and inappropriate primary care management. The objective of this study was to analyse the primary care management practices of malignant otitis externa (MOE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 22 cases of MOE managed in our tertiary care centre over a 6-year period (2004-2010).
RESULTS: All but one of the patients presented a systemic or local predisposing factor. The mean interval between onset of the first symptoms and referral to our tertiary care centre was 13weeks (range: 1 to 12months); 77% of patients were referred by a private ENT specialist, 14% were referred by a an emergency department and 9% were referred by a hospital department. Seventeen patients (81%) had received one or more courses of inappropriate systemic antibiotics during this interval (oral in 15 cases, parenteral in two cases, multiple treatments in 13 cases). The mean duration of each course of antibiotics was 12days (range: 7 to 21days). All patients also received local antibiotic ear drops (aminoglycosides or fluoroquinolones).
CONCLUSIONS: The practice audit constantly revealed delayed management of MOE, often resulting in inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. Publication of practice guidelines for primary and secondary care practitioners therefore appears to be essential.","['Guevara N', 'Mahdyoun P', 'Pulcini C', 'Raffaelli C', 'Gahide I', 'Castillo L']",2013,130,3,Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,"Guevara N, et al.

The present study investigated the effectiveness of a combination herbal drop (Lamigex) composed of essential oils from Syzygium aromaticum, Lavandula angustifolia, and Geranium robertianum in the alleviation of AEO symptoms and compared its effects to those of ciprofloxacin 0.3% drop.
METHODS: Seventy patients were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin 0.3% (n = 35) or Lamigex (n = 35) drop. Each group was administered with three drops every 12 hours for a week. Patients were examined for AEO symptoms and ear discharge cultures at baseline as well as at the end of trial. Pain severity was also recorded using a visual analogue scale at baseline, the 3(rd) day, and the 7(th) day of the trial.
RESULTS: All assessed symptoms (tenderness, itching, erythema, edema and discharge) were equally improved in the ciprofloxacin and Lamigex groups by the end of trial (p > 0.05). There were remarkable reductions in the visual analogue scale score by the end of trial in both groups (p < 0.001). However, the rate of pain improvement was not found to be significantly different between the groups, either at the 3(rd) or 7(th) day of trial (p > 0.05). The numbers of positive cultures for all tested microorganisms were clearly reduced by the end of the trial in both groups but were not significantly different between the groups (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The herbal combination drop that was investigated in the present study exhibited good efficacy in reducing the burden of infection as well as AEO symptoms.","['Panahi Y', 'Akhavan A', 'Sahebkar A', 'Hosseini SM', 'Taghizadeh M', 'Akbari H', 'Sharif MR', 'Imani S']",2014,47,3,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Panahi Y, et al.

VO images of the tympanic cavity and ossicles were generated with commercially available software using raw computed tomography (CT) data. Eight out of 10 ears inoculated with pathogen exhibited obvious clinical signs associated with otitis externa. CT images revealed soft tissue density material occupying the tympanic bulla compatible with otitis media in three dogs with experimentally induced otitis media and two patients. No remarkable features were observed on the radiographs. Four different VO views (ear canal, tympanic bulla, eustachian tube, and ossicular chain) were created. Promontory, cochlea window, tympanic, and septum bulla as well as ossicles were easily and clearly distinguished except for the incus and stapes of the clinical patients. VO images were not more suitable than images created with conventional CT for accurately diagnosing otitis media in this study. However, it appears that VO could be more feasible for assessing the complex structure of the inner ear in dogs with fluid-filled tympanic cavities since fluid accumulation within the tympanic bulla did not affect the evaluation of bony tissue in the middle ear on VO images.","['Cho Y', 'Jeong J', 'Lee H', 'Kim M', 'Kim N', 'Lee K']",2012,13,4,J Vet Sci,"Cho Y, et al.

23227759,Antibiotic plasma levels in dogs with otitis externa treated routinely with various topical preparations.,"We aimed to determine whether, and at what levels, topical antibiotics applied to treat Otitis externa in dogs are absorbed systemically, leading to an increased risk of antibiotic resistance. 75 dogs brought to a veterinarian for Otitis externa were recruited for a non-interventional study. Selection criteria included diagnosis of Otitis externa and owner consent.The animals were divided into five groups of 15 dogs each. Each group received one of five commonly prescribed topical medications for up to 14 days according to the labeled instructions. Development and validation of low residue detection methods (HPLC-MS/MS) for all active substances studied was performed. Plasma concentrations were evaluated for gentamicin (Otomax, Easotic), marbofloxacin (Aurizon), orbifloxacin (Posatex) and polymyxin B (Surolan). Low-level plasma concentrations of the topically applied antibiotics were detected after multiple administrations. In several samples, the concentrations detected were less than the limit of detection (LOD) of the corresponding analytical method. However, at the end of the treatment period, mean plasma concentrations were in the low pmol/ml range and exceeded the LOD for gentamicin, marbofloxacin and orbifloxacin. None of the plasma samples examined for polymyxin showed levels above the LOD. After routine topical antibiotic use in the treatment of Otitis externa in dogs, low systemic plasma concentrations are likely to develop.This low-level exposure may facilitate cellular changes that lead to an increased possibility for antibiotic resistance. These findings should provoke veterinary clinicians to optimise therapy for Otitis externa in light of minimising the development of antibiotic resistance.","['Voget M', 'Armbruster M', 'Meyer M']",2012,125,11-12,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,"Voget M, et al.

Contributory factors are length of exposure to water, type of water and water pollution. The aim of the study was to compare risks for contracting the disease between patients with different exposure to swimming pool water. A retrospective case-control analysis of patients at the ENT-clinic was performed. Swimmers and water polo players swam in a swimming pool chlorinated by an automatic swimming pool cleaning system. Water sport players had a higher risk for ear skin inflammation than football players. Senior football players compared with players younger than 13 were not at increased risk. Swimmers and water polo players older than 13 were at higher risk. Swimmers were at higher risk than football players as well as water polo players. There was no difference for the risk of otitis externa between swimmers and water polo players. Swimmers and water polo players compared with other patients of the ENT-clinic were at higher risk than football players. Frequent and longer exposure to water has been proved to increase the risk of external auditory canal inflammation.","['Kujundzić M', 'Braut T', 'Manestar D', 'Cattunar A', 'Malvić G', 'Vukelić J', 'Puselja Z', 'Linsak DT']",2012,36,3,Coll Antropol,"Kujundzić M, et al.

23202157,Ototopic applications of povidone iodine/dexamethasone in the rat.,"HYPOTHESIS: Repeated applications of low-concentration povidone iodine (PI) combined with dexamethasone (Dex) through a tympanic membrane ventilation tube will not cause ototoxic changes in the rat.
BACKGROUND: Otitis externa (OE) and acute otitis media (AOM) are 2 of the most common otologic disorders requiring outpatient antibiotic treatment. The development of topical treatments that are easy to administer would help to limit systemic exposure to antibiotics in these patients. Topical formulations containing Dex and low-dose PI were designed to provide both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects for the treatment of OE and AOM. Treatment with PI alone has shown mixed results in studies designed to determine PI. Low concentrations of PI combined with Dex should yield less ototoxicity while maintaining effectiveness.
METHODS: We performed tympanostomies on rats, inserting a ventilation tube to administer 1% or 2% PI, plus 0.1% Dex over a period of 7 days. Hearing was accessed via auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing over the duration of the study and histologic analysis was performed 15 days after the initial application to determine the effect of administration of PI/Dex on middle and inner ear structures.
CONCLUSION: The preparations used in the present investigation were formulated to allow repeated applications to both the external and middle ear, without risk to hearing or equilibrium. Neither of the PI/Dex formulations tested caused pathologic changes in the ear that significantly affected equilibrium, hearing function or morphology.","['Pawlowski K', 'Koulich E', 'Wright CG', 'Roland P']",2013,34,1,Otol Neurotol,"Pawlowski K, et al.

23198673,Acute otitis externa: an update.,"Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea, and often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding. Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on a number of factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions, and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.","['Schaefer P', 'Baugh RF']",2012,86,11,Am Fam Physician,Schaefer P and Baugh RF.

ANSWER: There are no specific Canadian guidelines for the management of AOE. However, current American guidelines promote initial ototopical therapy without systemic antibiotics for uncomplicated AOE; suggest there is little difference between the various ototopical preparations; and recommend the choice of treatment be based on the specific clinical situation. In practice, this often results in prescribing an antibiotic-steroid formulation for 7 to 10 days. This ototopical treatment option is supported by a recent Cochrane review that has documented the superiority of an antibiotic-steroid combination when compared with placebo or acetic acid in providing clinical resolution of AOE.","['McWilliams CJ', 'Smith CH', 'Goldman RD']",2012,58,11,Can Fam Physician,"McWilliams CJ, et al.

23147298,Malignant otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant external otitis is a severe infection of the external auditory canal and skull base, which most often affects elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. This disease is still a serious disease associated with cranial nerve complications and high morbidity-mortality rate. Malignant otitis externa requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. The most effective treatment is to control the diabetes and to fight infection with the proper antibiotic and debridement necrotic tissue; sometimes, aggressive surgical management is done. We present our 5-year institutional experience in the management of this disease. The aim of this study was to present our experience with the management of malignant otitis externa.
METHODS: All patients' records with malignant otitis externa during the last 5 years (2007-2012) were retrieved and reviewed. Diabetes mellitus profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ear swab for culture and sensitivity, computed tomography, and scintigraphy using technetium 99 and gallium 67 were investigated for all patients.
RESULTS: During the last 5 years (2007-2012), 10 patients with the diagnosis of malignant otitis externa were admitted to our clinic for investigation and treatment. There were 7 men and 3 women, all between 64 and 83 years of age, with severe persistent otalgia, purulent otorrhea, granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, and diffuse external otitis, and there were 4 patients with facial nerve palsy. Nine patients were confirmed to have a diabetes, and 4 of these 9 cases just had chronic renal failure and underwent dialysis; the remainder 1 case had no diabetes mellitus, but with chronic renal failure on dialysis. Ear swabs for culture and sensitivity usually revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Local debridement and local and systemic antibiotic treatment were sufficient to control the disease. Facial nerve decompression was done in facial paralysis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was performed in facial nervy palsy cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Malignant otitis externa is still a serious disease associated with cranial nerve complications and high morbidity-mortality rate. The most effective treatment is to control the diabetes and to fight infection with the proper antibiotic, debridement necrotic tissue, and sometimes aggressive surgical management. Monitoring of therapy response is done through normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, control of diabetes mellitus, and improvement of computed tomography and radioisotope scanning.","['Karaman E', 'Yilmaz M', 'Ibrahimov M', 'Haciyev Y', 'Enver O']",2012,23,6,J Craniofac Surg,"Karaman E, et al.

23131826,"Antimicrobial and analgesic prescribing patterns for acute otitis externa, 2004-2010.","OBJECTIVE: Acute otitis externa (AOE) is a common but preventable ear condition. Clinical guidelines issued in 2006 recommended topical treatments for uncomplicated AOE, but systemic antimicrobials appear to be commonly prescribed. The objective of this analysis was to describe pre- and postguideline prescribing patterns by clinician specialty and antimicrobial type and assess trends over time.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal analysis of a large insurance database.
SETTING: Outpatient departments in the United States.
METHODS: Initial outpatient visits in 2004 to 2010 for AOE (excluding visits with complicating conditions) were extracted from an insurance database. Prescription drug claims were linked and categorized by clinician specialty and antimicrobial type.
RESULTS: The analysis included 907,261 initial outpatient visits. Use of systemic antimicrobials declined by 4.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1%, 5.7%) from 36.5% of initial visits in 2004 to 32.1% in 2010. Use of systemic antimicrobials varied by specialty. Systemic antimicrobials were prescribed in 47.1% of 2010 emergency department (ED) visits (-6.9% from 2004, 95% CI -12.3, -1.5), 25.9% of otolaryngologist visits (-1.6%, 95% CI -5.6, 2.4), and 20.4% of pediatrician visits (-6.6%, 95% CI -8.8, -4.4). Penicillins were prescribed most frequently (42.3% of systemic prescriptions in 2010), followed by cephalosporins (19.8%), erythromycin/macrolides (17.4%), and quinolones (11.1%). Opioids were prescribed in 26.4% of ED visits and 9% of outpatient visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of systemic antimicrobials declined over time, but one-third of 2010 visits resulted in systemic antimicrobials, despite exclusion of visits with complicating factors. Use of systemic antimicrobials varied by specialty. Further educational efforts and outreach to other specialties might be warranted.","['Collier SA', 'Hlavsa MC', 'Piercefield EW', 'Beach MJ']",2013,148,1,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Collier SA, et al.

Microbial penetration into tissues of the head and neck can initiate a focal reaction causing superficial self-resolving infections. However, some of these have the potential to develop into life-threatening disease. We provide an overview of the most common ENT infections with focus on the presentation, diagnosis and management. Foreign bodies of the ear, nose and throat are a common presentation to primary and emergency care. Most commonly these are seen in children and include plastic toys, beads and foodstuffs inserted into the ears and nose. Diagnosis is often delayed as insertion is usually not witnessed. In exceptional cases airway foreign bodies can present as a life-threatening emergency. Removal of foreign bodies can usually be achieved by a skilled practitioner with minimal complications. Methods of removal include suction catheters, syringing, and use of instrumentation.

In addition, physicians place wicks in the ear canal as part of the treatment of otitis externa. Usually, these foreign bodies are easily removed, but occasionally, removal must be deferred or is delayed by parents. Therefore, the dangers of retained foreign bodies are important for the emergency physician to be aware of. We report the highly unusual case of a 12-year-old girl who presented with ear pain for 3 weeks. She was found to have an ear wick in place as part of the treatment of otalgia. She was subsequently diagnosed with mastoiditis and meningitis. This is first time mastoiditis and meningitis has been reported as a complication of ear wick placement, although not the only case of an intracranial complication of an aural foreign body.","['Burke RT', 'Gatton B', 'Melville LD']",2012,28,10,Pediatr Emerg Care,"Burke RT, et al.

Atypical histopathology made the diagnosis difficult. We discuss the potential pitfalls of clinical diagnosis and treatment of such a case.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old woman presented with left-sided otalgia, hearing loss and tinnitus. Physical examination revealed a firm swelling arising from the superior portion of the left external auditory canal. A clinical diagnosis of otitis externa was made.
INTERVENTION: There was minimal response to medical treatment. The swelling was aspirated, leading to brisk bleeding. A tumour was suspected from the computed tomography scan, and confirmed by a biopsy. The patient underwent excision of the paraganglioma. The histopathology was atypical, making diagnosis difficult.
CONCLUSION: Such unusual masses of the external ear should always be borne in mind, especially when dealing with atypical presentations of commonly encountered diseases. Clinicians should have a low threshold for early intervention with imaging and biopsy.","['Grover N', 'Amen F', 'Gallimore A', 'Brookes G']",2012,126,12,J Laryngol Otol,"Grover N, et al.

23002686,[Pseudomonas folliculitis outbreaks associated with swimming pools or whirlpools in two guest-room sites in the northern region of Israel].,"In summer 2010-2011 two outbreaks of Pseudomonas foliculitis occurred among bathers who used the swimming pools or whirlpools in two guest-room sites. The source of the infection was traced to the swimming pools or whirlpools, which had not been chlorinated and monitored routinely. Of 40 bathers, 25 (62.5%) developed Pseudomonas folliculitis 2-4 days after exposure. Typically the rash began as a pruritic erythematous papule on the buttocks, axilla, and extremities, with fever, adenopathy and otitis externa. In the culture of the pustules and bacterial examination grew Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Pseudomonas folliculitis was first described by McCausland and Cox in 1975. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of outbreaks in swimming pools or whirlpools in guest-room sites in Israel. This article describes the epidemiological and environmental health investigation of the two outbreaks. With the rising popularity of swimming pools and whirlpools in guest-room sites, physicians in the community and the emergency rooms may encounter this disease. We urge their real time report to the public health offices, in charge of the epidemiological inquires, aiming to prevent the occurrence of new cases or improper treatment of similar cases.","['Cohen-Dar M', 'DiCastro N', 'Grotto I']",2012,151,7,Harefuah,"Cohen-Dar M, et al.

22926989,The misdiagnosis of external auditory canal carcinoma.,"External auditory canal (EAC) carcinomas are frequently misdiagnosed. The aim of this study was to conduct a review of misdiagnosed cases and analyze the factors involved. This study was a retrospective assessment. Eighteen of 44 EAC carcinoma cases seen at the Eye and ENT Hospital were misdiagnosed. All medical records were retrospectively analyzed for the age, sex, presenting symptoms, type of misdiagnosis, computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, stage of the cancer, surgical approach, histopathological examination, adjunctive therapy (postoperative radiotherapy) and outcomes of treatment. Six cases were misdiagnosed as otitis media, five cases were misdiagnosed as otitis externa, and two cases were misdiagnosed as external auditory canal cholesteatomas. Other misdiagnoses were stenosis of the EAC, ear neuralgia, furuncle of the EAC, benign neoplasm of the EAC and pre-auricular fistula. Our analyses suggest that a biopsy should be conducted to obtain a histopathological diagnosis if an EAC carcinoma is suspected, in case otitis media or otitis externa does not respond to routine anti-bacterials. Head and neck MRI should be used to explore the involvement of soft tissues. Patients with bloody ear discharge and otalgia, particularly with temporal bone erosion seen in a CT scan, are highly likely to have a malignant carcinoma of the temporal bone.","['Zhang T', 'Dai C', 'Wang Z']",2013,270,5,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Zhang T, et al.

22892176,Outcomes of canalplasty for chronic obliterative otitis externa.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic obliterative otitis externa is a rare cause of conductive hearing loss, characterised by stenosis of the deep ear canal secondary to chronic inflammation. A multitude of canalplasty techniques have been described, with variable success.
METHOD: Fourteen patients undergoing canalplasty performed by the senior author for refractory obliterative otitis externa, over an 8-year period, were included in the study. All underwent split-skin grafting of the denuded canal and meticulous post-operative aural care. Outcome measures included the Glasgow Benefit Inventory and pure tone audiology.
RESULTS: At 3 months post-operatively, the four-tone average threshold had improved by a mean of 13.9 dB (95 per cent confidence interval -9.9 to 37.8 dB; t < 0.001) in the operated ear. The mean Glasgow Benefit Inventory score was 20 (95 per cent confidence interval -2.3 to 42.1).
CONCLUSION: Significant improvements in both hearing and quality of life are achievable in patients with end-stage obliterative otitis externa treated surgically. Highly trained and competent aural care practitioners are a prerequisite for the success of the procedure, and a substantial number of patients must be prepared to submit to long-term follow-up care.","['Potter CP', 'Bottrill ID']",2012,126,10,J Laryngol Otol,Potter CP and Bottrill ID.

22889046,The susceptibility of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from dogs with otitis to topical ear cleaners.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vitro efficacy of commercially available topical otic preparations (""ear cleaners"") against Pseudomonas spp. isolated from canine ear infections.
METHODS: Between January and May 2011, 50 isolates that were morphologically and phenotypically confirmed as Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 48 dogs that had been identified with clinical signs of otitis externa and media at a referral dermatology clinic in the north west of the UK. The in vitro efficacy of eight different topical preparations against these isolates was investigated using an in-agar inhibition test.
RESULTS: Of the eight preparations tested, three showed consistently good in vitro activity against Pseudomonas spp., while a further three were consistently ineffective. For the remaining two -preparations, in vitro efficacy was variable and inconsistent.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Topical treatment with ear cleaners is considered to be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of canine otitis that involves multi-antimicrobial-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas spp. Where treatment with antimicrobials is not an option, the use of these preparations, as a sole form of therapy, may be effective in some cases. As a comparison with other similar studies looking at the activity of ear cleaners against bacterial isolates from otitis, this study uses isolates from 50 ears from 48 dogs providing a significant number of isolates for analysis.","['Steen SI', 'Paterson S']",2012,53,10,J Small Anim Pract,Steen SI and Paterson S.

22843832,Corynebacterium spp. in dogs and cats with otitis externa and/or media: a retrospective study.,"The role of Corynebacterium spp. in the pathogenesis of canine and feline otitis externa/media and their appropriate antimicrobial therapy are unclear. The objectives of this study were to (1) better establish the pathogenicity of Corynebacterium spp. in otitis utilizing reported criteria and by assessing clinical response to antibiotic therapy and (2) to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Corynebacterium spp. associated with otitis. The study was retrospective, targeting cultures positive for Corynebacterium spp. Corynebacterium spp. were part of mixed microbial populations in 79/81 cultures. Corynebacterium spp. pathogenicity was highly questionable because of their almost invariable presence with other microbes and the observation that Corynebacterium spp. usually disappear from the ear with resolution of other infections, even when the Corynebacterium spp. are resistant to the prescribed antibiotic(s). However, 2/81 cultures came from two canine ears wherein Corynebacterium spp. may have been pathogenic. Antimicrobial sensitivities for Corynebacterium spp. were available for 54 isolates. Most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol (53/54), amikacin (50/54), tetracycline (50/54), gentamicin (46/54), and enrofloxacin (32/54). Among those antibiotics available in otic products, gentamicin and enrofloxacin would be rational choices for the empirical, topical therapy of Corynebacterium spp.","['Henneveld K', 'Rosychuk RA', 'Olea-Popelka FJ', 'Hyatt DR', 'Zabel S']",2012,48,5,J Am Anim Hosp Assoc,"Henneveld K, et al.

Physical examination revealed pain on opening the jaw, and otoscopic examination showed tympanic membrane rupture associated with hyperplastic tissue at the entrance of the middle ear. Standard MRI sequences allowed for the identification of a severely expanded bulla containing material that was isointense to brain tissue on T1-weighted images and of mixed intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. No postcontrast enhancement of the content was present, but the lining of the bulla was partially enhanced. The images allowed evaluation of the surgical margins and the secondary changes due to the expansion of the mass. Surgery was performed and histopathology confirmed the presumptive diagnosis of cholesteatoma. In the present case, MRI appeared to serve as a good alternative to computed tomography for the diagnosis of cholesteatoma.","['Harran NX', 'Bradley KJ', 'Hetzel N', 'Bowlt KL', 'Day MJ', 'Barr F']",2012,48,5,J Am Anim Hosp Assoc,"Harran NX, et al.

A 50-year-old woman with malignant otitis externa and bilateral temporal bone osteomyelitis presented with brisk bleeding from her left ear. She had bony dehiscence of the left carotid canal at CT and extravasation from a pseudoaneurysm of the carotid petrous segment at angiography. Carotid tortuosity proximally precluded placing a covered stent. After the lesion stopped bleeding spontaneously and given the presence of bilateral osteomyelitis putting the contralateral carotid at risk, the decision was made to attempt preservation of the parent vessel with flow diversion. However, bleeding recurred after 12 days, necessitating carotid sacrifice. This first reported experience in treating a carotid pseudoaneurysm at the skull base with the Pipeline device shows that transient cessation of bleeding is insufficient for flow diversion to be effective.","['Kadkhodayan Y', 'Shetty VS', 'Blackburn SL', 'Reynolds MR', 'Cross DT', 'Moran CJ']",2013,5,5,J Neurointerv Surg,"Kadkhodayan Y, et al.

Systemic antibiotic therapy is usually prescribed for at least 6 weeks, but no review has been published on this topic. We report our experience and have reviewed the literature regarding antibiotic therapy in NEO. Here we describe a case-series of consecutive NEO cases seen over an 8-year period (2004-2011) in a French tertiary-care teaching hospital. Since 2009 we have shortened the duration of antibiotic therapy to 6 weeks. We also present a review of the literature regarding antibiotic therapy in NEO. We include 32 NEO cases, with positive microbiological cultures in 30 cases. Among the 30 patients with suspected or proven P. aeruginosa infections, 27 received an initial combination therapy of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. The duration of antibiotic therapy and length of hospital stay were significantly reduced after 2009 (9.4 ± 3.2 weeks versus 5.8 ± 0.7, P < .0.001; and 18.2 ± 8.7 days versus 11.6 ± 6.9, P = .0.03, respectively). Patient outcomes were favorable in all cases, with a 14-month median duration of follow-up. Our literature review (30 case series) shows that initial combination therapy is associated with better outcomes as compared with single therapy (97 % versus 83 %, P < .0.001). We suggest 3 weeks of initial combination therapy (ceftazidime + ciprofloxacin, high doses) followed by 3 weeks single therapy with ciprofloxacin in susceptible P. aeruginosa NEO.

We hypothesize that in patients with OE there is often otitis media (occult middle ear and mastoid fluid) and secondary fluid in the mastoid air cell system, which is not seen during a clinical examination because of edema in the external canal skin.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 209 patients who presented to our ear, nose, and throat (ENT) clinic with acute OE that was resolved with oral and/or topical antibiotics.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 209 patients presented with unilateral or bilateral acute OE (29 ears) and received a computed tomography (CT) scan of their temporal bones, which was ordered by the Emergency Department or ENT services. Twenty-three of 29 ears (79%) showed fluid in the ME, mastoid, or both. Nine of the 10 patients (82%), who obtained their CT scan within 1 week of symptom onset, were found to have fluid.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support our hypothesis and serve to inform the medical community (both ENT and primary care) that fluid is often present in the ME or mastoid in patients with acute OE whose symptoms will resolve with oral and/or topical antibiotics.","['Brennan TE', 'Saadia-Redleaf MI']",2012,122,9,Laryngoscope,Brennan TE and Saadia-Redleaf MI.

We demonstrated that Burow's solution had antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, inducing ultrastructural changes in these bacteria in vitro. S. aureus strain 209P and P. aeruginosa strain IID1130 were treated with 13% Burow's solution. Viable cell counts were determined to measure bactericidal effects. Ultrastructural changes in cells of both strains were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Viable cell counting revealed that S. aureus cells treated with Burow's solution were killed within 30 min. The viable cell count of P. aeruginosa was reduced by 1 × 10(7) colony-forming units/ml (CFU/ml) after a 60-min treatment. SEM examination of S. aureus revealed blebbing on the surface of bacterial cells, whereas TEM revealed undulating deformation of the bacterial cell wall, diluted cytoplasm, and cell membrane detachment. SEM observations of P. aeruginosa revealed a more apparent undulating deformation of the bacterial cell surface. TEM observations also revealed deformations in the bacterial cell wall and diluted cytoplasm in both bacteria. These findings show that Burow's solution is active against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, resulting in damage to the cell wall.","['Hyo Y', 'Yamada S', 'Ishimatsu M', 'Fukutsuji K', 'Harada T']",2012,45,2,Med Mol Morphol,"Hyo Y, et al.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a cleaner containing chlorhexidine (1500µg/ml) and Tris-EDTA (48µg/ml) clinically, cytologically and microbiologically in a placebo-controlled double-blinded trial.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 64 dogs ear cleaner (group A) or placebo (group B) was used twice daily followed by an ear medication containing marbofloxacin/dexamethasone/clotrimazole once daily. After 2 weeks patients were re-evaluated clinically and cytologically. In addition at the beginning and after 14 days an ear swab of each ear underwent a microbiological examination and sensitivity testing.
RESULTS: On cytology, there was a significant reduction in the count of cocci (p<0.0001), rods (p=0.007) and neutrophils (p=0.0001) in the treatment compared to the placebo group. Yeasts were significantly reduced in both groups (group A p<0.0001, group B p<0.001). Clinical examination did not reveal a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.59). The number of marbofloxacin-resistant bacteria increased in group A from 0 to 44% (p=0.0025) and in group B from 8 to 31% (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Chlorhexidine and Tris-EDTA in combination with marbofloxacin/dexamethasone/clotrimazole were effective in cytological reduction of bacteria in canine infectious otitis externa. The number of marbofloxacin-resistant bacteria increased significantly.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on this study, chlorhexidine and Tris-EDTA in combination with antimicrobial ear medication can be assumed to be recommended for the treatment of otitis externa complicated by bacterial infection to reduce bacteria, however the high risk of resistance development exists. Side effects are to be expected.","['Bouassiba C', 'Osthold W', 'Mueller RS']",2012,40,3,Tierarztl Prax Ausg K Kleintiere Heimtiere,"Bouassiba C, et al.

22678642,[Drug therapy of otitis externa and otitis media].,"The objective of the present work was to analyse the available pharmaceutical products used for treatment of otitis media. The rational application of these medications makes it possible to eliminate rapidly a variety of etiological factors, reduce the severity of inflammation, and improve the quality of life of the patients. One of the approaches to the achievement of these goals for the patients with otitis externa and otitis media consists of the use of combined preparations containing antibacterial, antimycotic, anti-inflammatory and analgetic components. Candibiotic is a four-components drug composed of chloramphenicol, clotrimazol, beclomethasone and lidocaine. The advantages of Candibiotic include high therapeutic efficacy due to its ethiotropic and pathogenetic activity and safety as its components do not have ototoxicity in the case of local application).","['Okovityĭ SV', 'Ivkin DIu', 'Malygin SV']",2012,,1,Vestn Otorinolaringol,"Okovityĭ SV, et al.

Ear swelling in CD1 mice persisted for 7 days, with peak intensity at 16 h after inflammation induction. As in humans, cantharidin (12.5 μg/ear) generated macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) production, as well as neutrophil accumulation in mouse ear tissue. The tested macrolides, clarithromycin and azithromycin, administered orally (2 × 150 mg/kg) 0.5 h before and 5 h after cantharidin challenge, reduced MIP-2, MCP-1, KC, and MPO concentrations and thereby decreased ear swelling.

Common complications following syringing are pain, external auditory canal trauma and otitis externa. Hearing and vestibular loss have also been reported as complications. However, we are unaware of any report of facial nerve palsy as a complication of ear syringing. Such a case is reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of facial nerve palsy as a complication of syringing, which demonstrates the dramatic presentation of this condition and emphasises the need for great care while syringing the ears.
CONCLUSION: It is important to be aware of this unusual complication with its distinctive presentation. Surgical intervention should be undertaken at the earliest opportunity, for favourable results. A risk-minimising strategy for ear syringing is recommended.","['Thomas AM', 'Poojary B', 'Badaridatta HC']",2012,126,7,J Laryngol Otol,"Thomas AM, et al.

22643206,Helix advancement meatoplasty.,"We describe a new technique of helix advancement meatoplasty. This technique is useful in both mastoid surgery and some cases of otitis externa. The technique is designed to avoid the problems of (1) inferior positioning of the meatoplasty at the time of surgery, and (2) later inferior migration of the pinna (as can occur when the suspensory ligaments of the pinna have been cut or weakened). Such outcomes can result in a mastoid cavity which is difficult to clean as the approach to it is awkward; in such cases, it is common to have to look up into the cavity rather than directly into it. Helix advancement meatoplasty improves post-operative visualisation and aeration. It eases cleaning of the cavity by creating a more superiorly placed meatoplasty, which is supported by the tragus and is therefore less likely to drop.","['Goodyear PW', 'Reddy CE', 'Lesser TH']",2012,126,6,J Laryngol Otol,"Goodyear PW, et al.

22511046,Clinical audit of the microbiology of otorrhoea referred to a tertiary hospital in Singapore.,"INTRODUCTION: Otorrhoea is a common complaint in Ear, Nose and Throat clinics. This study aimed to establish the pathogens involved in cases of otorrhoea in Singapore, their sensitivity patterns and the effectiveness of empirical management.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 91 patients with otorrhoea who had undergone swab cultures between July 2010 and February 2011.
RESULTS: Of the 91 cases, 53% were diagnosed empirically as bacterial otitis externa and 25% as otomycosis. Aerobic bacteria accounted for 35.8% of the microorganisms cultured, while 34.7% were fungi and 29.5% were anaerobic bacteria. Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus made up 31.6% and 21.0% of the microorganisms, respectively. 20% of S. aureus grown was methicillin-resistant. Aspergillus was the most common fungus and 19% of cultures were polymicrobial. 38% of patients had their treatment changed on the basis of culture results, as no improvement was observed on follow-up. P. aeruginosa was sensitive to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin in 81.8% and 76.0% of patients, respectively, while S. aureus was sensitive to cloxacillin in 93.8% and clindamycin in 87.5% of patients.
CONCLUSION: The common microorganisms involved in otorrhoea in Singapore are P. aeruginosa, Aspergillus and S. aureus. Resistant strains of Pseudomonas spp. are now present. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus is increasingly prevalent and highly sensitive to vancomycin. Aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone-containing eardrops are suitable first-line topical antimicrobials. Cloxacillin may be started should a concomitant oral antimicrobial be warranted empirically or for S. aureus infections. Otomycosis should be considered in patients who show no improvement with antibiotics.","['Cheong CS', 'Tan LM', 'Ngo RY']",2012,53,4,Singapore Med J,"Cheong CS, et al.

An unusually wide spectrum of etiologic agents that included 36 species of Aspergillus is discussed in the context of recent taxonomic and clinical reports. Invasive aspergillosis (IA), onychomycosis, and otitis externa were the predominant clinical entities. Five cases due to species newly proven as etiologic agents of human mycoses, as well as cases with unique clinical manifestations caused by unusual agents are discussed in more detail. Three species (i.e., A. insulicola, A. westerdijkiae and A. tritici) were identified as the confirmed etiologic agents of non-dermatophytic onychomycosis. Emericella rugulosa was recovered from a premature newborn with a fatal necrotising disseminated infection and is reported for only the second time as the cause of IA. Furthermore, we document the first infection due to A. calidoustus in a patient with chronic granulomatous disease. The infection manifested as a latent brain aspergilloma with an unusual clinical-laboratory finding. In addition to the well-known agents of human mycosis, several rarely isolated or poorly documented species were identified. An undescribed cryptic species related to A. versicolor was found to be common among isolates linked to proven and probable onychomycosis. An isolate representing A. fresenii, or an unnamed sister species, were causal agents of otomycosis. Three well defined, and tentative new species belonging to section Cervini, Candidi and Aspergillus (Eurotium spp.), were associated with cases of probable onychomycosis.","['Hubka V', 'Kubatova A', 'Mallatova N', 'Sedlacek P', 'Melichar J', 'Skorepova M', 'Mencl K', 'Lyskova P', 'Sramkova B', 'Chudickova M', 'Hamal P', 'Kolarik M']",2012,50,6,Med Mycol,"Hubka V, et al.

The microscopic examination of a clear, mucoid discharge collected from the external ear canals of two wild-born African elephants housed in a New York State zoo for 25 yr revealed live mites (Loxoaneotus bassoni). The cytologic examination demonstrated no evidence of inflammation or infection. Both elephants were asymptomatic with normal hemograms and serum chemistry panels. A diagnosis of otoacariasis was made. Each elephant was treated six times with 5 ml of 1% ivermectin syrup instilled in each ear canal once every 2 wk. Microscopic examinations of clear mucus collected from each elephant's ear canals 9 days after the first instillation of ivermectin were negative for any life stages of ear mites. Microscopic examinations of mucus collected from both elephants' ear canals at 6, 11, and 16 wk, as well as annually post-treatment for 7 yr, confirmed eradication of the ear mites. The L. bassoni ear mite was first identified in the external ear canals of wild, asymptomatic, lesion-free, African elephants culled in Kruger National Park in South Africa. However, a new species in the same genus of mites (Loxoanoetus lenae) was identified at the necropsy of an 86-yr-old Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) living in a circus in Australia. The autopsy revealed a marked, ballooning distension of bone around the left external acoustic meatus, suggestive of mite-induced otitis externa, as seen in cattle infested with ear mites (Raillieta auris).

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of miconazole, polymyxin B and a combination of both against 24 canine MRSA and 50 canine MRSP isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 12 other antimicrobial agents were also determined.
METHODS: All MIC values were determined according to a broth microdilution assay.
RESULTS: Acquired resistance was found to all tested agents, except for linezolid, miconazole and polymyxin B. The MIC values for miconazole and polymyxin B against MRSA were in the range of 4-8 and 8-64 μg/mL, respectively, while the MIC values for miconazole and polymyxin B against MRSP were in the range of 1-2 and 0.25-4 μg/mL, respectively. Using a combination of miconazole and polymyxin B, there was no evidence for enhanced in vitro activity of the combination (i.e. synergy) of both products. Nevertheless, MIC(90) values of the combination of these antimicrobial agents and of a commercial product containing both agents were at least 1000 times lower than the concentration present in the commercial product.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These results indicate that the topical use of a combination of miconazole and polymyxin B in a 43.5:1 ratio may have potential for the treatment of MRSA-mediated and MRSP-associated otitis externa in dogs.","['Boyen F', 'Verstappen KM', 'De Bock M', 'Duim B', 'Weese JS', 'Schwarz S', 'Haesebrouck F', 'Wagenaar JA']",2012,23,4,Vet Dermatol,"Boyen F, et al.

However, the epidemiologic data about the etiologic agents of otomycosis in Turkey is limited. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the agents of otomycosis in patients living at Manisa region (located at western Anatolia of Turkey). A total of 2279 cases [1465 male, 813 female; age range 1-87 (mean: 41.7) years] who were clinically prediagnosed as otomycosis at Celal Bayar University Hospital, between February 1995 and July 2011, were included in the study. External ear swab samples from patients with suspicion of otomycosis have been evaluated by routine mycological methods. Identification of mold-like fungi was based on colony morphology and microscopic examination of fungal structure, whereas germ tube test, growth characteristics on cornmeal-Tween 80 agar and API 20C AUX (bio-Mérieux, France) system were used for the identification of yeast-like fungi. Of the samples, 28% (638/2279) were found positive by direct microscopy and 24% (544/2279) by culture methods. Among culture-positive cases the isolation rates of mold-like and yeast-like fungi were 66% (359/544) and 34% (185/544), respectively. The number of distribution of the molds were as follows; Aspergillus niger (180), Aspergillus fumigatus (95), Aspergillus terreus (32), Aspergillus flavus (23), Aspergillus spp. (14), Penicillium spp. (13), Trichophyton spp. (T.rubrum 1, T.mentagrophytes 1); while this distribution was as follows for the yeasts; Candida tropicalis (97), Candida albicans (39), Candida parapsilosis (21), Candida glabrata (19), Candida kefyr (4), C.guilliermondii (2), Candida krusei (1), Geotrichum candidum (1) and Trichosporon capitatum (1). It was notable that 96% (344/359) of mold-like fungi were Aspergillus spp., and 99% (183/185) of yeast-like fungi were Candida spp. The results of this study indicated that the most frequent agents of otomycosis were non-dermatophyte species such as Aspergillus, followed by Candida.

DESIGN: A retrospective analysis.
SETTING: University-affiliated medical center.
PATIENTS: Six patients with severe mixed hearing loss and a mean sensorineural hearing loss component between 40 and 70 dB.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients received a VSB with the floating mass transducer (FMT) coupled to the round window or to the oval window via a residual stapes structure.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional gain and speech recognition results. Results are compared with 2 control groups matched for mean sensorineural hearing loss: 1) patients with mixed hearing loss and a bone-anchored hearing device, and 2) patients with sensorineural hearing loss and traditional implantation of the VSB.
RESULTS: There is large variance in functional gain between the patients suggesting high variability in the effectivity of the FMT coupling. The speech recognition results for the experimental group were not systematically better than in either control group.
CONCLUSION: There is large variability in results that might be ascribed to coupling effectivity. On the average, speech recognition results were not better or worse than those found in patients with similar hearing loss fitted with bone-anchored hearing devices.","['Verhaegen VJ', 'Mulder JJ', 'Cremers CW', 'Snik AF']",2012,33,3,Otol Neurotol,"Verhaegen VJ, et al.

22359155,Molecular identification and antifungal susceptibilities of black Aspergillus isolates from otomycosis cases in Hungary.,"Otomycosis, also known as fungal otitis externa, has been used to describe a fungal infection of the external auditory canal, but sometimes involving the middle ear. Many fungal species have been identified as infectious agents in otomycosis, with Aspergillus and Candida species being the most common. Among aspergilli, Aspergillus niger is the most commonly described species in the literature. In this study, 14 black Aspergillus strains were analyzed, which were isolated from otomycosis cases in Hungary between 2010 and 2011. These strains were identified as A. niger according to conventional morphological methods. Species identification was based on sequencing of part of the calmodulin gene. Our results indicate that instead of A. niger, A. awamori and A. tubingensis are the predominant species that cause ear infections in Southern Hungary. Antifungal susceptibility tests were carried out against four antifungal drugs: amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole and terbinafine. All isolates were found to exhibit low in vitro MIC values to amphotericin B, terbinafine and itraconazole. However, the examined isolates exhibited high in vitro MIC values to ketoconazole.","['Szigeti G', 'Kocsubé S', 'Dóczi I', 'Bereczki L', 'Vágvölgyi C', 'Varga J']",2012,174,2,Mycopathologia,"Szigeti G, et al.

22263430,Consensus of microbiology reporting of ear swab results to primary care clinicians in patients with otitis externa.,"Otitis externa is a ubiquitous inflammatory disease; although it arises most commonly from an infection, there is no consensus in the UK for the reporting of ear swab culture results. This study aims to review current microbiology laboratory reporting of ear swab specimens to primary care and reach an evidence-based consensus for a reporting policy. Fifty consecutive ear swab reports were reviewed from each of 12 laboratories in the South West region to determine and discuss reporting practice. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) GP Microbiology Laboratory Use Group reviewed the underlying evidence and worked towards a consensus of expert microbiology opinion for laboratory reporting of ear swab results using a modified version of the Delphi technique. A total of 487 reports from primary care were reviewed (54% female; 46% male). Cultures most commonly yielded Pseudomonas species (36%), Staphylococcus species (21%), Streptococcus species (15%) and fungi (11%). Five reporting policies were agreed: Policy 1: Common pathogens such as group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus - Always reported by name with antibiotic susceptibilities. Policy 2: Pseudomonas species - Always reported, but antibiotic susceptibilities only reported in severe disease. Policy 3: Aspergillus, Candida, coliforms and Proteus species, as well as non-group A streptococci and anaerobes - Only reported if moderate numbers of colonies and it is the predominant organism present; if appropriate report antibiotic susceptibilities.

22234088,Bismuth iodoform paraffin paste hypersensitivity reactions in mastoid cavities following isolation of mucosal lining: a series of 587 patients.,"AIM: (1) To assess hypersensitivity to bismuth iodoform paraffin paste impregnated ribbon gauze following its use in packing canal wall down mastoidectomy cavities; (2) to determine if isolation of the skin and mucosa from the pack, using thin Silastic sheeting and Cortisporin ointment, reduces hypersensitivity reactions, compared with a previous series; and (3) to review the literature and to determine if bismuth iodoform paraffin paste hypersensitivity precludes the consumption of seafood (due to its high iodine content).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing canal wall down mastoidectomy with intra-operative bismuth iodoform paraffin paste packing between 1985 and 2009 were identified and reviewed.
RESULTS: Of 587 patients identified, the overall bismuth iodoform paraffin paste reaction rate was 1 per cent. All reactions were in patients undergoing revision mastoidectomy procedures, giving a reaction rate for revision procedures of 2.4 per cent.
CONCLUSION: Reactions are an uncommon event following post-operative mastoid cavity packing using bismuth iodoform paraffin paste. Reaction rates may be lowered by preparing the cavity with Silastic sheeting and Cortisporin ointment prior to packing, thus isolating the skin and mucosal surfaces. Development of such a reaction does not preclude the consumption of seafood.","['Coulson CJ', 'Pothier DD', 'Lai P', 'Rutka JA']",2012,126,3,J Laryngol Otol,"Coulson CJ, et al.

22233584,Direct healthcare costs of selected diseases primarily or partially transmitted by water.,"Despite US sanitation advancements, millions of waterborne disease cases occur annually, although the precise burden of disease is not well quantified. Estimating the direct healthcare cost of specific infections would be useful in prioritizing waterborne disease prevention activities. Hospitalization and outpatient visit costs per case and total US hospitalization costs for ten waterborne diseases were calculated using large healthcare claims and hospital discharge databases. The five primarily waterborne diseases in this analysis (giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, Legionnaires' disease, otitis externa, and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection) were responsible for over 40 000 hospitalizations at a cost of $970 million per year, including at least $430 million in hospitalization costs for Medicaid and Medicare patients. An additional 50 000 hospitalizations for campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, shigellosis, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and toxoplasmosis cost $860 million annually ($390 million in payments for Medicaid and Medicare patients), a portion of which can be assumed to be due to waterborne transmission.","['Collier SA', 'Stockman LJ', 'Hicks LA', 'Garrison LE', 'Zhou FJ', 'Beach MJ']",2012,140,11,Epidemiol Infect,"Collier SA, et al.

24470939,Diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated manifestations in otolaryngology.,"Almost 30 years after its first description, HIV still remains a global pandemic. The present paper aims to review the current knowledge on the ear, nose and throat (ENT) manifestations of HIV infection, and present the available diagnostic and treatment options. A literature review was conducted in Medline and other available database sources. Information from related books was also included in the data analysis. It is well acknowledged that up to 80% of HIV-infected patients eventually develop ENT manifestations; among which, oral disease appears to be the most common. Oro-pharyngeal manifestations include candidiasis, periodontal and gingival disease, HSV and HPV infection, oral hairy leucoplakia, Kaposi's sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. ENT manifestations in the neck can present as cervical lymphadenopathy or parotid gland enlargement. Respective nasal manifestations include sinusitis (often due to atypical bacteria), and allergic rhinitis. Finally, otological manifestations include otitis (externa, or media), inner ear involvement (sensorineural hearing loss, disequilibrium), and facial nerve palsy (up to 100 times more frequently compared to the general population). Although ENT symptoms are not diagnostic of the disease, they might be suggestive of HIV infection, or related to its progression and the respective treatment failure. ENT doctors should be aware of the ENT manifestations associated with HIV disease, and the respective diagnosis and treatment. A multi-disciplinary approach may be required to provide the appropriate level of care to HIV patients.","['Iacovou E', 'Vlastarakos PV', 'Papacharalampous G', 'Kampessis G', 'Nikolopoulos TP']",2012,4,1,Infect Dis Rep,"Iacovou E, et al.

22200616,Promotion of lymphatic integrity by angiopoietin-1/Tie2 signaling during inflammation.,"The cutaneous lymphatic system plays a major role in tissue fluid homeostasis and inflammation of the skin. Although several lymphangiogenic factors are known to be involved in the formation of lymphatic vessels, the molecular mechanisms that maintain lymphatic integrity and control the functional drainage of interstitial fluid and resolution of inflammation remain unknown. Here we show that angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) enhances lymphatic integrity and function during inflammation. Ang1 transgenic mice under the control of keratin-14 (K14-Ang1) showed attenuated edema formation and inflammation after UV B (UVB) exposure. After UVB irradiation, blood vascular permeability was inhibited in K14-Ang1 mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, lymphatic vessels of WT mice were markedly enlarged and leaky in inflamed skin, whereas K14-Ang1 mice showed relatively contracted lymphatic vessels together with enhanced lymphatic vascularization. Expression of endothelial-specific tight junction molecules claudin-5 and zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) was strongly down-regulated in the inflamed lymphatic vessels of UVB-exposed WT mice, whereas down-regulation of both claudin-5 and ZO-1 was blocked in UVB-exposed K14-Ang1 mice. In vitro studies revealed that the stability of lymphatic endothelial cells was enhanced in the presence of Ang1, presumably via up-regulation of claudin-5, as well as ZO-1. Claudin-5 knockdown markedly increased the permeability of lymphatic endothelial cells. Overall, our data strongly support the idea that Ang1/Tie2 signaling promotes lymphatic integrity by modulating tight junction molecule expression during inflammation.","['Kajiya K', 'Kidoya H', 'Sawane M', 'Matsumoto-Okazaki Y', 'Yamanishi H', 'Furuse M', 'Takakura N']",2012,180,3,Am J Pathol,"Kajiya K, et al.

22200615,Inflammation-induced lymph node lymphangiogenesis is reversible.,"The extent of lymph node metastasis is a prognostic indicator of disease progression in many malignancies. Current noninvasive imaging technologies for the clinical assessment of lymph node metastases are based on the detection of cancer cells and commonly suffer from a lack of sensitivity. Recent evidence has indicated that the expansion of lymphatic networks (ie, lymphangiogenesis) within tumor-draining lymph nodes might be the earliest sign of metastasis. Therefore, we recently developed a noninvasive imaging method to visualize lymph node lymphangiogenesis in mice using radiolabeled antibodies against the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1) as well as positron emission tomography (PET). This technique, termed anti-LYVE-1 immuno-PET, was found to be very sensitive in the detection of metastasis to the lymph nodes. However, lymphatic vessel expansion to the lymph nodes can also be induced by inflammation, and it is currently unclear whether such vessel expansion is reversed once inflammation has resolved. Detection of residual inflammation-induced lymph node lymphangiogenesis, thus, might hamper the identification of metastasized lymph nodes. In this study, we therefore used a well-established mouse model of inflammation in the skin to investigate whether lymphatic vessels in the lymph nodes regress on resolution of inflammation. Our data reveal that the lymphatic network indeed regresses on the resolution of inflammation and that we can image this process by anti-LYVE-1 immuno-PET.","['Mumprecht V', 'Roudnicky F', 'Detmar M']",2012,180,3,Am J Pathol,"Mumprecht V, et al.

For their accurate diagnosis and safe treatment special embryological and anatomical knowledge is necessary.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Embryology, anatomy, diagnosis and therapy are described and explained by 2 case studies in context to the current literature.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Sonography and contrast-enhanced radiological methods represent the fundamental pillar of the diagnosis. Therapeutically, the complete extirpation is the first choice. Surgeries on children, patients with extended fistulas and special cases of fistula routes require particular carefulness. In certain cases with pronounced findings and low levels of symptoms a ""wait-and-see"" strategy can be justified.

22143294,Surgery for outer ear canal exostoses and osteomata: focusing on patient benefit and health-related quality of life.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of surgery for ear canal exostoses and osteomata on patients' health-related quality of life because the literature suggests that surgery cannot achieve excellent symptom control in all cases and has a considerable complication rate.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective data collection.
SETTING: Germany's largest university clinic for otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery.
PATIENTS: Thirty-nine patients having received surgery for ear canal exostoses and osteomata.
METHODS: Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), a retrospective questionnaire well validated for measuring the effect of otorhinolaryngologic interventions on the health-related quality of life.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GBI total scores and subscores.
RESULTS: Thirty of the 39 patients returned a valid questionnaire (return rate, 76.9%). The mean total GBI score was 14.6 (p < 0.001), suggesting a benefit from the operation. In contrast to the general subscale score (mean, 21.0; p < 0.001), the mean physical health score and the mean social support score were not significantly increased. Of all patients, 83.3% had a total GBI score higher than 0, indicating a benefit from the operation. In 90% of the cases, patients were satisfied with the result of the operation, and 86.7% would again decide in favor of the operation. Most patients preoperatively experienced hearing loss, wax retention and recurrent otitis externa. Postoperatively, 70% of the patients were free of any complaints. The patients not satisfied were the only patients with negative GBI scores in the whole patient collective, and all had had complications from surgery.
CONCLUSION: Surgery for ear canal exostoses and osteomata can significantly improve patients' health-related quality of life and leads to a high rate of patient satisfaction. Postoperative complications are the most important factor for a negative impact on the patient's health-related quality of life. Therefore, in the authors' opinion, only patients with symptoms should have surgery.","['Hempel JM', 'Forell S', 'Krause E', 'Müller J', 'Braun T']",2012,33,1,Otol Neurotol,"Hempel JM, et al.

22109927,Management of foreign bodies in the ear: a retrospective review of 123 cases in Nigeria.,"Foreign bodies in the ear are relatively common in emergency medicine. However, attempts at removal made outside the healthcare setting by untrained persons can result in complications of varying degrees. We conducted a 3-year retrospective review of 123 cases of aural foreign bodies at our hospital in Nigeria. Our patient population was made up of 80 males and 43 females, aged 2 to 67 years (mean: 13.2); almost three-fourths of these patients were aged 15 years or younger. Only 40 of them (32.5%) presented to an otolaryngologist within 12 hours of foreign-body insertion. A total of 30 patients (24.4%) had initially undergone removal attempts by a non-otolaryngologist prior to receiving trained ENT care, and 23 of them experienced a total of 41 complications: 17 cases of canal abrasion, laceration, and/or bleeding, 8 cases of otitis externa, 6 cases of tympanic membrane perforation, 5 cases of impaired hearing, 3 cases of chronic suppurative otitis media, and 2 cases of middle ear involvement. Of the 93 patients who were seen by an otolaryngologist initially, only 6 (6.5%) developed a complication: 4 cases of canal abrasion, laceration, and/or bleeding and 2 cases of otitis externa. The difference in overall complication rates between patients treated by otolaryngologists and non-otolaryngologists was statistically significant (p < 0.001). We conclude that attempts at removal by non-otolaryngologists can result in a high incidence of preventable complications.","['Olajide TG', 'Ologe FE', 'Arigbede OO']",2011,90,11,Ear Nose Throat J,"Olajide TG, et al.

22109763,Is biofilm the cause of chronic otitis externa?,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: This study was undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, we considered patients affected by chronic external otitis treated either by chemical ear peeling (CEP) or by antibiotic/steroid treatment to compare the clinical and microbiological outcomes. In the second phase, we compared the microscopic findings observed in the CEP samples of patients affected by chronic otitis externa's acute exacerbation or by acute otitis externa to demonstrate the role of biofilm in the pathogenesis of chronic otitis externa.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, controlled study.
METHODS: In phase 1 we compared clinical and microbiological data collected from two groups of 25 patients with chronic otitis externa treated by CEP or by conventional antibiotic/steroid treatment. In phase 2 we compared the results of the optical and electron microscopic analysis of specimens obtained by performing CEP in two groups of patients (25 with chronic otitis externa exacerbation and 15 with acute otitis externa).
RESULTS: In phase 1 the disease control rate yielded markedly better results when treated with CEP. In phase 2 biofilms were identified in 23 of the 25 patients with chronic otitis externa exacerbation (92%) and in only three acute external otitis cases (20%).
CONCLUSIONS: CEP is a simple and effective method for the treatment of chronic external otitis. The removal of the bacterial biofilm has a high correlation with a long-term clinical remission.","['Fusconi M', 'Petrozza V', 'Taddei AR', 'Vinciguerra V', 'De Virgilio A', 'Chiarini F', 'Cirenza M', 'Gallinelli C', 'Conte M', 'de Vincentiis M']",2011,121,12,Laryngoscope,"Fusconi M, et al.

RPT and inner ear assessment were carried out before the dive (TIME 0) and 24 h (TIME 1) after resurfacing, in order to investigate diving-related RPT and inner ear alterations. Physical examination after resurfacing revealed: fungal external otitis, otoscopic findings consistent with middle ear barotraumas and rhinosinusitis. Rhino-manometry showed a remarkable increase in inspiratory nasal flow and a substantial decrease in nasal resistance. No epithelial cell disruption was retrieved comparing pre and post resurfacing samples. Post-diving tubaric dysfunction was found. Pure tone audiometry revealed a bilateral 40 dB HL hearing loss at 4 kHz in 1 diver. Relevant PTA functions did not seem to be affected by the experiment, no remarkable changes were found at the Sensory Organisation Test and at the Motor Control Test.

RESULTS: Radiological Grade was significantly associated with duration of therapy (rank correlation 0.57, p = 0.004). CRP was a useful indicator confirming disease resolution. Diabetics with MOE had elevated average blood sugar levels during their Hospital admission (p < 0.001) and had poor overall glycaemic control represented by Elevated HBA1c scores (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Malignant otitis externa is a rare disease, which is best managed in a multidisciplinary team setting. This practical grading system can be used to predict the duration of therapy at time of diagnosis, which enables the efficient utilisation of Hospital resources. Poorly controlled diabetics are more susceptible to developing. MOE than diabetics with satisfactory glycaemic control and may represent a subgroup of more brittle diabetics. CRP combined with appropriate clinical and radiological investigations is useful in assessing disease resolution.","['Chin R', 'Roche P', 'Sigston E', 'Valance N']",2012,10,5,Surgeon,"Chin R, et al.

22005120,Common childhood bacterial infections.,"Children with infectious diseases are commonly encountered in primary care settings. Identification of the subset of patients with bacterial infections is key in guiding the best possible management. Clinicians frequently care for children with infections of the upper respiratory tract, including acute otitis media, otitis externa, sinusitis, and pharyngitis. Conjunctivitis is not an uncommon reason for office visits. Bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis are regularly seen. Over the last decade, a growing number of children have had infections of the skin and soft tissue, driven by the increased prevalence of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The following review addresses the epidemiology and risk factors for specific infections and examines the clinical presentation and selection of appropriate diagnostic methods in such conditions. Methods to prevent these bacterial infections and recommendations for follow-up are suggested. Management of these infections requires that antimicrobial agents be used in a judicious manner in the outpatient setting. Such antibiotic therapy is recommended using both available clinical evidence and review of disease-specific treatment guidelines.","['Alter SJ', 'Vidwan NK', 'Sobande PO', 'Omoloja A', 'Bennett JS']",2011,41,10,Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care,"Alter SJ, et al.

21929537,Inhibition of benzalkonium chloride-induced skin inflammation in mice by an indol-1-ylpropan-2-one inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 α.,"BACKGROUND: Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is a frequent and often underrated problem for which the major efficacious therapy is still local glucocorticoids, although they have known adverse effects due to their wide spectrum of action. A more focused therapeutic strategy would be the inhibition of a key enzyme for biosynthesis of the lipid mediators, cytosolic phospholipase A(2) α (cPLA(2) α), in ICD. We are analysing the pharmacological and biological effects of a selective cPLA(2) α inhibitor.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the usefulness of the potent and selective cPLA(2) α inhibitor 3-(5-carboxypentanoyl)-1-[3-(4-octylphenoxy)-2-oxopropyl]indole-5-carboxylic acid (compound 1) for therapy of inflammatory skin disorders.
METHODS: We examined clinical and cellular effects of a selective cPLA(2) α inhibitor (compound 1) on ICD in mice.
RESULTS: Topical application of the compound significantly reduced ear swelling after induction by the irritant benzalkonium chloride. Concomitantly, compound 1 inhibited the accumulation of granulocytes as well as the expression of inflammatory proteins such as tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β in the ear tissue. In primary murine keratinocytes, the benzalkonium chloride-induced expression of these proteins was also downregulated after treatment with compound 1 in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Compound 1 is a well-aimed agent for the treatment of nonspecific skin inflammation as it selectively inhibits cPLA(2) α and as it acts on an early stage of skin inflammation after its elicitation.","['Roebrock K', 'Wolf M', 'Bovens S', 'Lehr M', 'Sunderkötter C']",2012,166,2,Br J Dermatol,"Roebrock K, et al.

21919557,A meta-analysis of the efficacy of quinolone containing otics in comparison to antibiotic-steroid combination drugs in the local treatment of otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: The term otitis externa denotes the inflammation of the external auditory canal and can be treated locally in the form of monotherapy or a combination drug.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy of an antibiotic-steroid combination drug with that of monotherapy. According to current data, a comparable investigation based on network analysis does not exist.
METHODS: After systematically searching the PubMed, Medline, Medpilot, Web of Science and Embase electronic databases, 12 relevant randomized, controlled, clinical studies were identified involving 2682 evaluable patients with regard to the cure rate and seven publications with 1251 microbiologically assessable patients. The collected data were compared directly and indirectly by means of network analysis.
RESULTS: The direct comparison showed a trend towards the superiority of the monotherapy containing quinolone. The network analysis verified this tendency and demonstrated that pure quinolone drugs can achieve a significantly higher cure rate (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.06-1.57; p = 0.01) and a significantly superior eradication rate (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.03-2.02; p = 0.03) compared to combination drugs not containing quinolone. We found substantial heterogeneity (with I(2) up to 88.7%) between studies, presumably due to treatments applied in varying frequency, thus bearing on compliance and outcome.
CONCLUSION: With a level Ia evidence, this investigation validates the clinical benefit of quinolones as compared to classic combination drugs in the local treatment of acute otitis externa.","['Mösges R', 'Nematian-Samani M', 'Hellmich M', 'Shah-Hosseini K']",2011,27,10,Curr Med Res Opin,"Mösges R, et al.

The ear canal is cleaned mechanically, by rinsing with saline, and finally dried by suction. A bacterial or fungal culture specimen should be taken, if the inflammation does not heal with the first treatment or recurs rapidly. High local drug levels without systemic adverse effects are achieved with ear drops.

21862264,Anti-microbial and therapeutic effects of modified Burow's solution on refractory otorrhea.,"OBJECTIVE: Burow's solution, which contains 13% aluminum acetate, has been shown to be effective against chronic otitis media. Since the preparation of Burow's solution is time-consuming, its rapid preparation method has been recently developed. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of the modified Burow's solution on refractory otorrhea in patients with chronic suppurative otitis and its anti-microbial activity in vitro.
METHODS: Fourteen ears of 12 patients with chronic otitis media, granular myringitis, otitis externa and postoperative mastoid cavity problems were treated topically with cotton swab/ball soaked with modified Burow's solution or its four-fold diluted ear drops once a week. We then examined the antimicrobial spectrum of modified Burow's solution against clinical bacterial isolates from otorrhea and laboratory bacterial strains in vitro.
RESULTS: In all ears, refractory otorrhea disappeared after 1-17 weeks treatment of modified Burow's solution with a mean of 5.4 weeks without apparent side-effects such as ototoxicity. Modified Burow's solution inactivated all Gram positive bacteria within 5min except Enterococcus species, all Gram negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 30s and Candida albicans within 2min. In addition, modified Burow's solution inactivated MRSA completely within 5min, while 80.6% of MRSA survived even a 20-min contact with 0.3% ofloxacin.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that modified Burow's solution, in addition to bearing a broad antimicrobial activity, is as effective as the original Burow's solution in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis.","['Jinnouchi O', 'Kuwahara T', 'Ishida S', 'Okano Y', 'Kasei Y', 'Kunitomo K', 'Takeda N']",2012,39,4,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Jinnouchi O, et al.

CASE REPORT: A case of Wegener's granulomatosis is reported in a diabetic woman presenting with facial palsy and hearing loss. The clinical course of the disease was very similar to that of skull base osteomyelitis, especially since the patient was diabetic and the ear swab was positive for pseudomonas. The definitive diagnosis was made based on clinical presentation, imaging and serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing. The patient was started on immunosuppressants, and her hearing loss and facial palsy recovered.
CONCLUSION: Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic disease with various manifestations. A high index of clinical suspicion is required to reach the correct diagnosis. The clinician should be alerted to the possibility of Wegener's granulomatosis in the presence of: systemic upset out of proportion to the apparent intensity of the local lesion; middle-ear disease failing to respond to conventional treatment; and a consistently raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate.","['Sharma A', 'Deshmukh S', 'Shaikh A', 'Dabholkar J']",2012,126,2,J Laryngol Otol,"Sharma A, et al.

21845055,Treatment of acute otitis externa with ciprofloxacin otic 0.2% antibiotic ear solution.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: An inflammation of the cutis and subcutis of the external auditory canal is a primary symptom in cases of acute otitis externa. It is usually treated locally, since this type of therapy ensures a high concentration of the drug and interacts at the site of inflammation with no systemic effects. This systematic review compares the efficacy of treatment using a ciprofloxacin 0.2% solution with other therapeutic options.
METHODS: After compiling a catalog of search terms, medical databases were searched systematically for randomized, controlled studies. This search initially yielded a total of 38 studies which were then evaluated by three independent reviewers. The number of studies was subsequently reduced to 14: six studies using a ciprofloxacin 0.2% solution, and eight studies using both 0.2% and 0.3% solutions.
RESULTS: The studies included in the review demonstrate the statistical equivalence between the ciprofloxacin solution (0.2%) and the reference products PNH (a combination of polymyxin B, neomycin sulfate and hydrocortisone), auriculum powder, and a ciprofloxacin foam with respect to the cure rate. The research groups consistently observed high in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review confirms the hypothesis of ciprofloxacin's noninferiority in the treatment of otitis externa, in terms of the cure rate and microbiological eradication.","['Mösges R', 'Nematian-Samani M', 'Eichel A']",2011,7,,Ther Clin Risk Manag,"Mösges R, et al.

Ten patients attending the ENT Department, Alexandria University were included. They had recurrence of otitis externa over a period of 6 months after-cure, as well as severe night otalgia and high ESR level. Peri-auricular soft tissue swelling, cranial nerve paralysis and trismus were the main persistent or developing presentations in recurrent cases. Extensive surgical intervention was performed in four patients with unsatisfactory outcome. On the other hand, satisfactory results were obtained with those treated with specific medical therapy after culture and sensitivity test and those who underwent minimal surgical intervention. In conclusion, NEO is an aggressive disease that necessitates conservative management and local debridement of sequestrated tissues. The ESR is a good indicator of treatment response. It is recommended to be meticulous in treatment of cases with recurrent NEO and extensive surgical interventions are discouraged.","['Omran AA', 'El Garem HF', 'Al Alem RK']",2012,269,3,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Omran AA, et al.

The end stage of disease, medial fibrosing otitis externa, is very challenging to repair. New and old therapies and promising approaches to the treatment of this often recalcitrant problem are presented in this review.
RECENT FINDINGS: Tacrolimus, a nonsteroidal immunosuppressant, and fluocinolone acetonide oil 0.01%, a medium-high potency steroid preparation, may offer additional therapeutic options in the struggle against this inflammatory ear canal/skin condition of often unknown cause. Relative potencies of many steroid preparations will be presented along with several treatment strategies for controlling COE. Underlying autoimmune problems such as Sjögren's disease, sarcoidosis, and amyloidosis must be searched and, if present, addressed and treated for resolution of symptoms. Cutting edge therapies, including use of bacteriophages and inflammatory proteases, will also be reviewed.
SUMMARY: No single therapy will be successful for every patient with COE. The search for an underlying cause, the removal of all possible irritants to the ear canal skin (e.g. Q-tips, water), debridement, and both topical and occasionally, systemic therapy will control (not cure …) the disease process in the vast majority of patients.",['Kesser BW'],2011,19,5,Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Kesser BW.

21777546,Audit of otitis externa referrals and management in a tertiary care setting.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the initial management of acute otitis externa (AOE) in primary care and the appropriateness of referrals to the otolaryngology department.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective audit.
SETTING: Tertiary referral centre.
METHODS: Data were collected from 100 consecutive patients referred by their general practitioners (GPs) during a 6-week period to our otolaryngology department. A working diagnosis of AOE was made either by the GP or in the otolaryngology urgent referral clinic.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The referring diagnosis, time lag before referral, investigations prior to initial management, and any patient advice given.
RESULTS: Of 100 patients referred, 98% had AOE, 60% were referred with a correct diagnosis, and 30% referred had no diagnosis. Of all the referrals, nearly half were prescribed oral antibiotics, with 11% being treated with oral antibiotics exclusively; 59% had topical antimicrobials prescribed; and 24% were given no treatment. Seventy-three percent of patients were referred within 2 weeks following initial presentation to primary care, and the majority received no advice regarding their condition and/or precautions.
CONCLUSIONS: AOE is one of the most common adult otologic conditions presenting to the GP. Based on our results, most patients presenting with this common problem are not receiving optimal initial management or advice prior to otolaryngology referral. Greater awareness of the correct management of AOE in the community is needed.

21768413,Prognostic value of extension patterns on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging in patients with necrotizing otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical characteristics of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) and to evaluate the prognosis according to the progression of disease in terms of extension patterns on follow-up magnetic resonance images.
DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study.
SETTING: Tertiary academic center.
PATIENTS: We reviewed medical records of 36 patients with NOE followed up by temporal bone magnetic resonance images on a regular basis from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2008.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The initial compartments affected by NOE were defined as 4 categories: anterior, medial, midline, and intracranial and extracranial. The extensions of NOE were evaluated by comparison between initial and follow-up magnetic resonance images 6 months later and defined by the direction of spread from one to another compartment and/or disease progression within the same compartment. The patients were divided into 3 groups (limited, single, and multiple extension groups) on the basis of the multiplicity of extension routes. The clinical characteristics and prognostic factors were investigated, and overall survival rates were compared according to extension patterns.
RESULTS: Retrocondylar fat infiltration (86%) was the most common finding, followed by parapharyngeal fat infiltration (81%) and ipsilateral nasopharyngeal musculature thickening (75%). Anterior and medial extension patterns were observed in 3 (8%) and 5 (14%) patients, respectively. Eighteen patients (50%) with combined extension patterns showed a significantly lower overall survival rate than those with single and limited extension patterns (P = .01).
CONCLUSION: The retrocondylar fat infiltration was the earliest change in NOE, and combined extension patterns may be a poor prognostic factor in patients with NOE.","['Lee JE', 'Song JJ', 'Oh SH', 'Chang SO', 'Kim CH', 'Lee JH']",2011,137,7,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Lee JE, et al.

We aim to determine the first-line treatment used by general practitioners in the management of otitis externa and subsequent second-line treatment in a hospital ENT clinic. In addition, this study aims to ascertain whether local and national guidelines are being followed appropriately. A prospective observational study on the management of otitis externa in consecutive patients referred to an ENT emergency clinic was undertaken. Data were collected and analysed on symptoms, initial management by general practitioners, findings and treatment in the ENT clinic. A total of 106 patients were studied. The mean duration of symptoms before presentation to clinic was 13 days; 42% of patients received no treatment by their GP prior to referral to the ENT emergency clinic. Only 14% of patients received topical antibiotics alone, whilst 44% received oral antibiotics, either alone or in conjunction with topical antibiotics by their GP. Of the 106 patients, 86% received topical antibiotics in the ENT emergency clinic and oral antibiotics were reserved for those presenting with complicated acute otitis externa. Topical antibiotics are associated with a decrease in disease persistence, whilst oral antibiotics are associated with an increase. However, general practitioners are prescribing oral antibiotics more often than required. There are few regional guidelines and no explicit national guidelines on the management of acute otitis externa for GPs to refer to. We suggest the implementation of national guidelines to aid clinical practice.","['Pabla L', 'Jindal M', 'Latif K']",2012,269,3,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Pabla L, et al.

21756179,Total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy for treatment of otitis externa and media in a rabbit.,"CASE DESCRIPTION: A 7-year-old spayed female Miniature Rex European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was evaluated because of scratching at the right ear. Physical examination revealed purulent exudate in the right ear canal.
CLINICAL FINDINGS: Microbial culture of the exudate yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to marbofloxacin; however, the infection was refractory to appropriate medical treatment. Computed tomography revealed isoattenuating material within the right tympanic bulla and external ear canal with no enhancement following IV administration of contrast medium. The left tympanic bulla appeared normal.
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: A total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy were performed on the right ear, and polymethylmethacrylate beads containing either gentamicin or cefazolin were placed within the bulla and surrounding tissues. Two weeks after surgery, the patient appeared comfortable with no signs of scratching at the right ear.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy can be successfully performed for treatment of chronic otitis externa and media in rabbits. Cartilage plates that compose the external ear canal, a bony acoustic duct, lack of a horizontal ear canal, and thickness of the lateral aspect of the tympanic bulla are features unique to rabbits and have not been described in relation to these surgical procedures in rabbits. Rabbits also produce a caseous exudate, and it is difficult to resolve infections of bone and soft tissues. Placement of antimicrobial-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads is recommended to minimize the risk of recurrent infection.","['Chow EP', 'Bennett RA', 'Whittington JK']",2011,239,2,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Chow EP, et al.

The aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activities of cefepime, ceftazidime, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid against 104 strains of P aeruginosa isolated from dogs with otitis externa. Antimicrobial susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations, in µg/ml, were evaluated by the E test (bioMérieux). The most active compound was ceftazidime, with 100 per cent efficiency. The majority of tested strains were susceptible to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (89.4 per cent), followed by ciprofloxacin (88.5 per cent) and cefepime (60.6 per cent). The highest resistance was observed to enrofloxacin (51.9 per cent) and gentamicin (43.3 per cent). Large numbers of strains were intermediately susceptible to antibiotics registered for use in veterinary medicine in Croatia--enrofloxacin (47.1 per cent) and gentamicin (41.3 per cent).","['Mekić S', 'Matanović K', 'Šeol B']",2011,169,5,Vet Rec,"Mekić S, et al.

21722540,Optimised diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing external otitis is warranted.,"INTRODUCTION: Necrotizing external otitis (NEO) is a devastating and life-threatening infection in the external auditory canal and the temporal bone. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the diagnostics and treatment of NEO and to recommend new guidelines.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eleven patients were retrospectively enrolled under the code DH609 otitis externa without specification from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2009. Records were reviewed to register: age, symptoms, clinical findings, comorbidity, imaging, microbiology and treatment.
RESULTS: The median age was 75 years and the median time of therapy at the hospital was 6.3 months. All patients belonged to a risk group. A diagnostic delay was found resulting in further progression of the disease. In contrast to current international recommendations, the treatment consisted mostly of local antibiotics in combination with surgery. All patients survived, but most patients were left with hearing loss and psychiatric problems.
CONCLUSION: A greater awareness of diagnostic criteria and a shift from local antibiotics to prolonged systemic monotherapy with ciprofloxacin in accordance with international concepts is recommended. Surgery should be left for extensive and refractory cases only. A list of diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines is presented.

21715284,Risk factors and prevalence of Demodex mites in young adults.,"Demodex mites are ectoparasites often found in follicles of facial skin. Their role in human diseases is under investigation, and a growing number of studies indicated that they contribute to chronic inflammatory conditions of the skin, such as rosacea, blepharitis, otitis externa, alopecia and folliculitis. In our study we tested 96 healthy adults for the presence of Demodex mites. Risk factors influencing presence of mites and skin types of the tested individuals were evaluated. We found Demodex folliculorum or Demodex brevis in 17.7% of the samples, more frequently in males (21.9%) and in older adults (20%). Use of make-up seems to reduce the likelihood of Demodex carriage, while pet ownership, use of shared items and living in close contact with older adults had no significant influence of presence of mites. Demodex positive individuals described their skin to be drier, more prone to erythema, but less for folliculitis compared to Demodex negative subjects.","['Horváth A', 'Neubrandt DM', 'Ghidán Á', 'Nagy K']",2011,58,2,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung,"Horváth A, et al.

21652573,Skin disease in sheep farmers.,"BACKGROUND: An unusual inflammation of the pinna has been reported to occur in some sheep farmers at the time of lambing.
AIMS: To explore the prevalence of this disorder and its possible causal associations.
METHODS: While on attachment to sheep farms during lambing, veterinary students used a standardized questionnaire to interview a sample of farmers about their work and about symptoms of skin inflammation in their hands, face and ears.
RESULTS: Interviews were completed by 76 (67%) of the farmers approached. Among 74 farmers who had carried out lambing, 3 (4%, 95% CI 1-11%) had experienced temporally related ear symptoms, all on multiple occasions. No farmers with ear symptoms had ever been involved in calving or farrowing, and no ear symptoms were reported in relation to shearing or dipping sheep. There was also an excess of hand symptoms related to lambing outdoors (24% of those who had done such work) and indoors (also 24%) compared with other farming activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that temporally related ear inflammation occurs in at least 1% of farmers who carry out lambing but not in association with the other farming activities investigated. Lambing appears to be associated also with hand inflammation, but the pathology may differ from that in the pinna.","['Heathcote K', 'Harris EC', 'Brewster V', 'Nevel MA', 'Coggon D']",2011,61,7,Occup Med (Lond),"Heathcote K, et al.

21645141,Bacterial contamination of commercial ear cleaners following routine home use.,"Ear cleaning solutions are designed for repeated use, which raises the possibility for bacterial contamination leading to recurrent or persistent infectious otitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of bacterial contamination of commercial ear cleaners following routine home use in dogs and to describe the characteristics that are associated with contamination. Used ear cleaner bottles and information regarding their use were obtained from canine owners visiting veterinary dermatologists. Both the bottle applicator tips and the solution contents were cultured for aerobic bacteria. Bacterial contamination was present on 10% of the bottle tips and in 2% of the solutions. Isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Bacillus spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp. and Burkholderia cepacia. The contamination rate was significantly higher on the applicator tips than in the solutions (P = 0.0076). The applicator tip contamination rate was significantly higher in expired samples (17%) than in-date samples (4%; P = 0.0277). The bottle sizes were significantly larger for the samples with contaminated applicator tips compared with noncontaminated tips (P = 0.0455). The contamination rate was significantly higher when Tris-EDTA was an ingredient. Cleanliness of the bottle, contact with the ear canal and infection status of the ear at time of culture had no bearing on the contamination rate. In summary, with routine home use of commercial ear cleaners, pathogenic bacterial contamination is of minor concern. This concern may increase when expired products or larger bottles of ear cleaner are used and when Tris-EDTA is an ingredient.","['Bartlett SJ', 'Rosenkrantz WS', 'Sanchez S']",2011,22,6,Vet Dermatol,"Bartlett SJ, et al.

21597452,"Estimated burden of acute otitis externa--United States, 2003-2007.","Acute otitis externa (AOE) (swimmer's ear) is inflammation of the external auditory canal most often caused by bacterial infection. AOE is characterized by pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling of the external ear canal, and occasionally, purulent exudate. AOE is associated with water exposure (e.g., recreational water activities, bathing, and excessive sweating) and warm, humid environments. Because the overall burden and epidemiology of AOE in the United States have not been well described, data from national ambulatory-care and emergency department (ED) databases were analyzed to characterize the incidence, demographics, and seasonality of AOE and associated health-care costs. The analysis showed that in 2007, an estimated 2.4 million U.S. health-care visits (8.1 visits per 1,000 population) resulted in a diagnosis of AOE. Estimated annual rates of ambulatory-care visits for AOE during 2003-2007 were highest among children aged 5-9 years (18.6) and 10-14 years (15.8); however, 53% of visits occurred among adults aged ≥20 years (5.3). Incidence peaked during summer months, and the regional rate was highest in the South (9.1). Direct health-care costs for nonhospitalized AOE visits total as much as $0.5 billion annually, and ambulatory-care clinicians spend nearly 600,000 hours annually treating AOE. Suggested AOE prevention measures include reducing exposure of the ears to water (e.g., using ear plugs or swim caps and using alcohol-based ear-drying solutions) (3-5). To reduce the national incidence of AOE, additional preventive measures should be investigated, and effective prevention messages should be developed and disseminated.",['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'],2011,60,19,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

21556203,Prevalence and antimicrobial-resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in swimming pools and hot tubs.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen in recreational waters and the primary cause of hot tub folliculitis and otitis externa. The aim of this surveillance study was to determine the background prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile of P. aeruginosa in swimming pools and hot tubs. A convenience sample of 108 samples was obtained from three hot tubs and eight indoor swimming pools. Water and swab samples were processed using membrane filtration, followed by confirmation with polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-three samples (21%) were positive for P. aeruginosa, and 23 isolates underwent susceptibility testing using the microdilution method. Resistance was noted to several antibiotic agents, including amikacin (intermediate), aztreonam, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem (intermediate), ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, tobramycin (intermediate), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of this surveillance study indicate that 96% of P. aeruginosa isolates tested from swimming pools and hot tubs were multidrug resistant. These results may have important implications for cystic fibrosis patients and other immune-suppressed individuals, for whom infection with multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa would have greater impact. Our results underlie the importance of rigorous facility maintenance, and provide prevalence data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistant strains of this important recreational water-associated and nosocomial pathogen.","['Lutz JK', 'Lee J']",2011,8,2,Int J Environ Res Public Health,Lutz JK and Lee J.

METHODS: Medical records of 149 dogs which met predetermined inclusion criteria were evaluated retrospectively. Correlations between pathogens and the presence of allergy, endocrinopathy, conformational abnormalities and signalment were evaluated statistically.
RESULTS: The shar-pei, German shepherd and cocker spaniel breeds were over-represented compared with the hospital's breed distribution (P<0·001). German shepherd dogs and cocker spaniels were statistically more prone to infection with rod-shaped organisms and Labrador retrievers less than other breeds (P=0·034). Almost all dogs that were older than five years when diagnosed with OE had cocci (P=0·01) and also had higher levels of rods (P=0·028). The incidence of rods was higher in endocrinopathies (P=0·004), while that of Malassezia spp. tended to be higher in allergies (P=0·098). There were no statistically significant differences among the groups for all the other parameters examined.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: OE infection is usually not influenced by primary causes or predisposing factors. Endocrinopathies may be followed by a more severe otitis, however. OE may be more severe when it affects older dogs.","['Zur G', 'Lifshitz B', 'Bdolah-Abram T']",2011,52,5,J Small Anim Pract,"Zur G, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.
SETTING: Tertiary, university-affiliated medical center.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients hospitalized with severe MEO were followed for disease course and survival in a tertiary center between 1990 and 2008.
RESULTS: In 20% of patients, disease was persistent and/or aggressive despite prolonged and extensive treatment. Of this subgroup, 45% died of the disease. Prognostic factors of persistent/aggressive disease were facial nerve paralysis, bilateral disease, and significant major computed tomography findings (temporomandibular joint destruction, infratemporal fossa or nasopharyngeal soft tissue involvement). Cultures grew fungi in 5 patients, and follow-up imaging revealed disease progression. The overall 5-year survival was 55% for patients with short-term disease and 40% for patients with persistent/ aggressive disease (P = .086). By age, 5-year survival was 75% in patients younger than 70 years old and 44% in older patients (P = .029).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant subset of patients with MEO has a prolonged, aggressive, and highly fatal disease that needs to be identified early. These patients more frequently have bilateral disease, cranial nerve paralysis, and positive computed tomography findings. Their follow-up should routinely include imaging studies to evaluate disease progression, and every effort should be made to identify and treat underlying fungal infection.","['Soudry E', 'Hamzany Y', 'Preis M', 'Joshua B', 'Hadar T', 'Nageris BI']",2011,144,5,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Soudry E, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Academic hospital laboratory.
SUBJECTS: Twenty CBA/J mice.
RESULTS: Mean auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds increased in all drug- and saline-treated ears immediately after 7 days of IT injections but returned to baseline for most stimulus frequencies by 30 days later. This finding appeared to be correlated with the presence and subsequent resolution of tympanic membrane (TM) perforations and granulation tissue at the injection sites. Mupirocin-treated ears showed no significant difference in ABR thresholds compared to saline-treated ears. No significant differences were noted between vancomycin- and saline-treated ears, but there was a significant interaction between testing day and stimulus frequency (P < .001). Further analysis revealed that ABR thresholds at 32 kHz remained significantly elevated in vancomycin-treated mice despite the resolution of TM perforations and granulation tissue 30 days after completion of IT injections (95% confidence interval, -13.5 to -5.5, P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Although IT application of mupirocin solution (440 µg/mL) caused no significant change in the ABR thresholds in a murine model, vancomycin solution (25 mg/mL) resulted in high-frequency threshold elevations in both the ear directly injected and the contralateral ear. Mupirocin solution may be beneficial in managing otitis externa and media caused by resistant pathogens. Further studies of ototopical vancomycin are needed to define parameters governing its safe use.","['Rutherford KD', 'Kavanagh K', 'Parham K']",2011,144,3,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Rutherford KD, et al.

21466265,"Phaeohyphomycosis and onychomycosis due to Chaetomium spp., including the first report of Chaetomium brasiliense infection.","Chaetomium species have been rarely described as aetiological agents of invasive and dermatomycotic infections in humans. The majority of cases have been reported within the last two decades. Treatment failed in most of these cases. In this paper we present two cases in which Chaetomium spp. can be clearly identified as an aetiological agent in pathological conditions. In the first report, we describe a new aetiological agent, Chaetomium brasiliense, which was implicated in a case of otitis externa in a patient with spinocellular carcinoma basis cranii. The patient had been repeatedly treated for relapsing otitis externa and had previously undergone surgery several times for otitis media. The fungal aetiology was confirmed by repeated positive culture and histologic studies. The second case involved onychomycosis with strikingly brown nail discoloration due to Chaetomium globosum in an otherwise healthy patient. The nail lesion was successfully cured by oral terbinafine. The determination of both species was supported by sequencing of rDNA regions. The morphological aspect of Chaetomium spp. identification is also discussed. In vitro antifungal susceptibility tests demonstrated that both isolates were susceptible to terbinafine and azole derivates except fluconazole. Amphotericin B was effective only against the C. brasiliense strain. We review the literature to summarize clinical presentations, histologic findings, and treatment strategies.","['Hubka V', 'Mencl K', 'Skorepova M', 'Lyskova P', 'Zalabska E']",2011,49,7,Med Mycol,"Hubka V, et al.

The study was performed at Tertiary academic referral center. We included 18 patients (16 males and 2 females; age, 49-79 years; mean, 65.3 years) with a clinical diagnosis of MEO in this study. CT and MRI were performed at presentation. Follow-up CT and MRI were performed after 6 and 12 months in 12 successfully treated patients. The main outcomes are CT scan and MRI findings. Results show that all patients were known to have diabetes mellitus. We present the patients' demographic and clinical data. All patients received local treatment as well as the intravenous 3rd generation antibiotic cephalosporin for at least 6 weeks. The detailed radiological findings were reported. In conclusion, MEO is predominantly a disease of diabetic males and MEO can be managed by the control of diabetes, local treatment, and intravenous antibiotics for a long period. CT and MRI play complementary roles in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with MEO. The extension of the disease before treatment and its disappearance from the involved areas are usually characteristic.","['Al-Noury K', 'Lotfy A']",2011,268,12,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,Al-Noury K and Lotfy A.

21353408,Differential diagnosis and treatments of necrotizing otitis externa: a report of 19 cases.,"OBJECTIVE: Necrotizing otitis externa is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening infection disease of the external auditory canal and temporal bone. Its presentation and natural course had been largely altered through the years. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical presentation, bacteriology, and treatment protocol and we compare those with the literature.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the archives of a tertiary referral center otolaryngology department (1995-2010) identified 19 cases of necrotizing otitis externa. The patient's epidemiologic, clinical, diagnostic and treatment data were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were collected. Their mean age was 67.3 (SD, 12.2 year; range, 38-83 year). Of them, fourteen patients had diabetes mellitus (82.3%). The facial nerve was involved in 26% of the patients. Culture isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 26.7% of cases, and half of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Five patients (26.3%) had temporomandibular area involvement. Eight patients received surgical intervention and all of them survived in the end of treatment course. The mean duration of hospitalization of was 25.8 ± 20.5 days (8-90). Two patients died during hospitalization, both from comorbidities (one from severe GI bleeding and another from septic shock).
CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients with facial palsy and diabetes in our series was comparable to those reported in the literature. But the incidence of P. aeruginosa was much lower and the rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin was high, which was supposed to result from the popularity and previous use of the quinolone ear drops before referral. And the leading cause of mortality is patient's comorbidities. Treating necrotizing otitis externa remains a great challenge even in nowadays with modern image modalities and advanced antibiotics. Physicians should have a high index of suspicion when facing patients at risk with refractory external ear infection so as to give them timely diagnosis and optimal treatment.","['Chen YA', 'Chan KC', 'Chen CK', 'Wu CM']",2011,38,6,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Chen YA, et al.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomised study.
SUBJECTS: Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups. Group one constituted controls. Group two underwent myringotomy. Group three underwent myringotomy and also received 100 µl/day pomegranate extract, via gavage, one day before and two days after surgery. Following sacrifice 48 hours after myringotomy, the animals' right ears were used to determine the concentration of reactive oxygen species, using the chemiluminescence method; left ears were used for histological study.
RESULTS: Reactive oxygen species levels were significantly decreased in group three compared with group two (p < 0.01). The density of inflammatory cells in group three was significantly less than that in group two (p < 0.01). Lamina propria thickness and vessel density were also significantly decreased in group three compared with group two (p < 0.01).

21332272,Acute bacterial otitis externa: efficacy and safety of topical treatment with an antibiotic ear drop formulation in comparison to glycerol treatment.,"OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an antibiotic ear drop formulation combining polymyxin B sulfate, neomycin sulfate and gramicidin (PS) in patients with acute bacterial otitis externa (AOE). The combination was compared to glycerol ear drops, a non-pharmacologic treatment of AOE.
METHODS: An active controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, multicenter clinical trial study design was performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) practices with a planned interim analysis for sample size adaptation. In total, 244 patients aged 19-84 with no previous episode of otitis externa within the last year were randomized to receive either PS or glycerol ear drops thrice daily for 10 ± 2 days.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute change in the clinical symptom score (CSS) (with subscores redness, swelling, pain, and secretion) from Day 1 to 4 was measured. As second endpoints, absolute change in CSS, individual subscores, pain perception measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) and intake of paracetamol 500 mg tablets were noted. Moreover, patient's assessment of efficacy at Day 10 and the frequency and type of adverse events were noted.
RESULTS: On Day 4, the CSS showed a clear advantage for the PS group over the glycerol group, being lower by 0.6 (p < 0.03); the clinical outcome was even more pronounced after 10 days (p = 0.006). The swelling subscore showed a statistically significant difference favoring the PS treatment group in Days 1-4 (p = 0.01) and Days 1-10 (p = 0.003). More PS- than glycerol-receiving patients rated the efficacy as good (glycerol: 32%; PS: 36%) or very good (glycerol: 38%; PS: 48%). Males, patients with AOE for >2 days and those with positive microbiologic findings profited most from PS therapy.
CONCLUSION: This study proves that PS is an effective and well-tolerated drug, showing results superior to glycerol, especially in patients with a longer pre-existing condition before therapy. The absence of a group treated with another established antibiotic is a limitation of this trial.","['Mösges R', 'Baues CM', 'Schröder T', 'Sahin K']",2011,27,4,Curr Med Res Opin,"Mösges R, et al.

AIM: To study the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of necrotizing otitis externa and to describe the outcomes of this disease.
METHODS: We report in this retrospective study, a series of 36 patients treated in our department for necrotizing otitis externa over a period of 9 years.
RESULTS: Our series consisted of 34 diabetics. The average age of our patients was 62 years. The diagnosis was based on clinical, biological and bacteriological data and on imaging findings. A medical treatment based on a systemic antibiotic therapy combining a third generation cephalosporin to a fluoroquinolone was prescribed in 24 cases and to an aminoglycoside in 12 cases. In addition, a local treatment was performed daily and included meticulous cleaning of the external auditory canal and topical application of antimicrobial agents. Surgical debridement of infected soft tissues and bone sequestra was indicated in 8 cases because of the lack of improvement with medical treatment. Only one patient underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The cure rate was estimated at 86%. Only one death was noted.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
METHODS: Long-term postoperative complications and postoperative hearing thresholds were evaluated in 13 adults with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (average of between 40 and 55 dB HL) and therapy-resistant external otitis after implantation of the VSB by a transcanal surgical method.
RESULTS: Postoperative audiometry findings were comparable with those reported after the transmastoidal posterior tympanotomy approach. In 2 patients, the chorda tympani was intentionally sacrificed to maximize the size of the facial recess. Seven postoperative complications occurred in 6 patients (46%) during a mean follow-up period of 51 months: extrusion of the conducting wire into the ear canal (n=5), collapse of the cartilaginous part of the ear canal (n=1), and tympanic membrane perforation (n=1). In the revision operations that added additional layers of fascia for the patients with wire extrusions, repeated extrusion occurred in 3 of 4 cases.
CONCLUSION: The transcanal approach for the implantation of the VSB has led to postoperative complications different from those reported after the transmastoidal posterior tympanotomy approach. External otitis should be considered as a contraindication for VSB surgery by the transcanal approach.","['Zwartenkot JW', 'Mulder JJ', 'Snik AF', 'Cremers CW']",2011,32,3,Otol Neurotol,"Zwartenkot JW, et al.

21306058,Finite element modelling of the canine and feline outer ear canal: benefits for local drug delivery?,"Current therapeutic regimes of outer ear infections in dogs and cats aim at the application of efficient local therapeutics after cleaning of the acoustic meatus. One so far insufficiently answered question is if the local application of these substances results in an individually suitable drug concentration in the external ear canal. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to develop a finite element model to calculate the values of the different areas of the external acoustic meatus in dogs and cats in order to provide a tool for the benefit of an appropriate local drug dosage determination. A 3D finite element model (FEM), based on computer tomographic (CT) data sets of four dogs and two cats, was generated to determine areas and volumes of the outer ear canal. Furthermore, various ear therapeutics and cleansers were tested concerning their optimal distribution on 5 cm2 dog and cat skin. The data shows major variations of the area values of the external auditory canal in case of the different dogs but not in the examined cats. These results suggest that manufacturer's recommendations of the pharmaceuticals might be insufficient in terms of achieving an optimal drug concentration in the outer ear canal especially in larger dogs. In conclusion, the developed finite element model has shown to be suitable to calculate areas of the outer ear canal in cats and dogs and could be of help in context with the definition of optimal drug concentrations for a local drug delivery.","['Wefstaedt P', 'Behrens BA', 'Nolte I', 'Bouguecha A']",2011,124,1-2,Berl Munch Tierarztl Wochenschr,"Wefstaedt P, et al.

21298391,Clinical characteristics of granular myringitis treated with castellani solution.,"Aim of the study is to observe clinical manifestations of granular myringitis (GM) treated with castellani solution. Twenty-four patients (18 women and 6 men; mean age, 49.7 years; range, 9-77 years) diagnosed with GM and treated with castellani solution were enrolled retrospectively. Topical treatment using castellani solution with or without curettage of a granular lesion and serial otoendoscopy-aided photographic documentation of the tympanic membrane were performed. Outpatient follow-up period ranged from 3 to 72 months and the mean follow-up period was 14.4 months. GM was classified into marginal/non-marginal type and ulcerative/polypoid subtype using a new scale. According to the scale used in this study, the marginal and ulcerative GM was the predominant type of GM lesion. Bacterial cultures of ear discharges from 19 patients revealed Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Providencia stuartii in 12, 5, and 1 patient, respectively and no growth of bacteria in one patient. Of 24 patients, 23 showed complete resolution of GM after treatment with castellani solution. However, one patient had a persistent, small, dry, deepithelialized lesion and eight others required more than 3 months for complete recovery owing to a persistent residual lesion. There was recurrence in two patients but the lesion resolved after additional castellani treatment. Topical application of castellani solution is a simple and effective treatment for GM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective quasi-randomized clinical trial was completely carried out in 65 patients at Department of ENT and Head and Neck Surgery, TU Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu. Patients of less or equal to 12 years of age and both gender presenting in our outpatient department from October 2008 to December 2009 and diagnosed to have acute otitis externa was evaluated. Six patients were excluded from the study because of not meeting the inclusion criteria. Alternately IG and steroid antibiotic packing were done. For steroid antibiotic group, we use betnovate-N, a combination of betnovate sodium phosphate 0.1% and neomycin sulphate 0.5%. Before packing was carried out, pain was assessed using Wong Baker Scale. Statistical analysis was done using ""Z"" test of mean to compare average number of pain score and visits in two different groups.
RESULTS: There were 33 patients in IG pack group and 32 patients in steroid antibiotic group. In less than 4 years, there were 30 children and in more than 4 years children, there were 35 children. There was male predominance in both the treatment groups and disease was most common in age group less than 4 years. There was statistical significant decrease in number of visits in steroid group in both children less than and more than 4 years. There was also significantly less pain in children with steroid antibiotic group.
CONCLUSION: Use of steroid antibiotic pack in children presenting with acute otitis externa causes earlier relief of pain as well as significantly lesser number of visits. Thus, steroid antibiotic pack is better than 10% ichthammol glycerine packs in relieving pain in acute otitis externa in children.","['Adhikari P', 'Bhatta R', 'Bhandari S', 'Pyakurel Bhatta M']",2011,75,4,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Adhikari P, et al.

21237200,Fungal malignant external otitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics and outcome of fungal malignant external otitis (MEO).
METHODS: The files of 60 patients treated for MEO in 1990-2008 at a tertiary medical center were reviewed for clinical characteristics and outcome, and findings were compared between patients with fungal and nonfungal infection.
RESULTS: Mean duration of follow-up was 4 years. Nine patients (15%) had fungal disease; the main pathogen was Candida spp. Compared with the nonfungal MEO group, patients with a fungal infection were younger at diagnosis (average 68 vs. 74 years, p = 0.01) and had more facial nerve palsies (55% vs. 14%, p = 0.01), fewer positive bacterial cultures at presentation (33% vs. 75%, p = 0.02), and higher rates of surgery (78% vs. 18%, p = 0.0008) and hyperbaric treatment (78% vs. 4%, p = 0.0001). Eighty-nine percent had persistent infection (>2 courses of systemic antibiotics before antifungal treatment) compared with 12% in the nonfungal group (p = 0.0001). Fungal disease was associated with more persistently positive imaging findings (87.5% vs. 25%, p = 0.0001). There was no significant between-group difference in survival.
CONCLUSION: Fungal MEO probably occurs secondary to prolonged antibiotic treatment for bacterial MEO. The fungal disease is more invasive than the bacterial disease, although survival is the same. Treatment should be aggressive and hyperbaric oxygen therapy should be considered.","['Hamzany Y', 'Soudry E', 'Preis M', 'Hadar T', 'Hilly O', 'Bishara J', 'Nageris BI']",2011,62,3,J Infect,"Hamzany Y, et al.

21225805,Errors in the diagnosis and management of necrotizing otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVES: Necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) is a life-threatening condition that may be difficult to distinguish from other clinical entities. The purpose of this study was to assess the pitfalls associated with contemporary diagnosis and management of NOE.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
METHODS: Patients given the diagnosis of NOE or one of its typical presenting complaints over the past 14 years were identified by diagnostic and radiology codes. Charts were reviewed for history, findings, treatment, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with NOE were identified. The annual number of cases rose throughout the study period. A risk factor was known in 46. The gallium SPECT study was accurate for the presence (44 of 46 patients) and resolution of disease. Prolonged systemic antimicrobial therapy (mean 15 weeks, range 4-59) was required. Microbial cultures influenced therapy in only 50%. Two diabetic men died with disease (a 44 year old with a renal transplant and an 87 year old with severe renal failure). Of the cases seen at the request of otolaryngologists, 68% were for indications other than NOE (eg, chronic otitis media). With a known risk such as diabetes, the mean time to diagnosis was 6.9 months.
CONCLUSION: NOE remains a life-threatening condition that requires prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Its incidence may be on the rise. NOE may mimic more benign conditions. NOE must be considered in all patients with temporal bone inflammation, especially those with risk factors and those that fail to improve with more conservative measures.","['Jacobsen LM', 'Antonelli PJ']",2010,120 Suppl 4,,Laryngoscope,Jacobsen LM and Antonelli PJ.

21225773,Skull base osteomyelitis and bisphosphonate use in multiple myeloma: report of two cases and literature review.,"OBJECTIVES: Although osteoradionecrosis of the mandible is a well known entity, skull base osteomyelitis involving the temporal bone unrelated to otitis externa in patients with multiple myeloma using bisphosphonates has not been reported. We described a new entity of skull base erosion resulting from osteonecrosis, presenting with malignant features in patients using bisphosphonates for multiple myeloma.
METHODS: Two patients with multiple myeloma and prior zolendronic acid use were referred to our cancer center for management of maxillary and temporal bone masses with skull base erosion. Both patients were in remission and not immunocompromised. Clinical symptoms included pain, cranial nerve deficits, and vertigo. An oroantral fistula developed in the maxillary patient. In both cases, repeat CT and MRI revealed an eroding mass consistent with malignancy. After repeated biopsies, however, no malignancy was seen, and pathology revealed chronic inflammation with bacterial colonization.
RESULTS: Imaging with technetium and gallium revealed osteomyelitis of the skull base in the temporal bone patient and actinomyces in the maxillary patient. Prolonged intravenous antibiotics resulted insignificant improvement in symptoms and imaging after eight weeks of treatment.
CONCLUSION: Bisphosphonate-associated osteomyelitis and necrosis of the mandible has been described in recent literature as a diagnostic and management dilemma. However, skull base osteomyelitis from the temporal bone has not been reported, and few cases from the maxilla have been reported. Early recognition and differentiation from similarly presenting malignant disease may prevent intracranial complications resulting from delayed treatment.","['Phillips JM', 'Thibodeaux JD', 'Nathan C']",2010,120 Suppl 4,,Laryngoscope,"Phillips JM, et al.

21193835,Antibiotic resistance profiles of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from canine patients in Korea.,"In this study, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance was examined among 74 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius strains recently isolated from clinical cases of canine pyoderma and otitis externa at the veterinary teaching hospital at Konkuk University, Korea. Bacterial resistance to the nine commonly used antibiotics was evaluated by a standard disk diffusion technique based on the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results demonstrated that most S. pseudintermedius isolates were resistant to penicillin (95.9%) or tetracycline (91.9%), but highly susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (90.5%). Among the 74 isolates, 13 mecA-positive and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains were identified, displaying a high level of resistance (84.6- 100%) to each of the individual antibiotics evaluated, with the exception of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (46.2% resistance). Notably, all of the MRSP isolates exhibited simultaneous resistance to four or more different antibiotics, indicating that they are multiple drug resistant (MDR) strains. Taken together, these results imply that more careful selection or prescription of antibiotics for canine pyoderma and otitis externa should be required for reducing the emergence and/or spread of MDR strains, especially MDR-MRSP isolates, in veterinary pet clinics in Korea.","['Yoon JW', 'Lee KJ', 'Lee SY', 'Chae MJ', 'Park JK', 'Yoo JH', 'Park HM']",2010,20,12,J Microbiol Biotechnol,"Yoon JW, et al.

23022815,Ear disorders in scuba divers.,"History of underwater diving dates back to antiquity. Breath-hold technique in diving was known to the ancient nations. However, deep diving progressed only in the early decades of the 19th century as the result of advancements in efficient underwater technologies which subsequently led to invention of sophisticated sets of scuba diving in the 20th century. Currently, diving is performed for various purposes including commercial, recreational, military, underwater construction, oil industry, underwater archeology and scientific assessment of marine life. By increasing popularity of underwater diving, dive-related medical conditions gradually became more evident and created a new challenge for the health care professionals, so that eventually, a specialty the so-called ""diving medicine"" was established. Most of the diving-associated disorders appear in the head and neck. The most common of all occupational disorders associated with diving are otologic diseases. External otitis has been reported as the most common otolaryngologic problem in underwater divers. Exostosis of the external ear canal may be formed in divers as the result of prolonged diving in cold waters. Other disorders of the ear and paranasal sinuses in underwater divers are caused by barometric pressure change (i.e., barotraumas), and to a lesser extent by decompression sickness. Barotrauma of the middle ear is the most prevalent barotrauma in divers. The inner ear barotraumas, though important, is less common. The present paper is a brief overview of diving-related ear disorders particularly in scuba divers.",['Azizi MH'],2011,2,1,Int J Occup Environ Med,Azizi MH. Ear disorders in scuba divers.

21174732,[Two cases of intractable malignant external otitis with skull base osteomyelitis alleviated by intraarterial antibiotic administration].,"Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a devastating external auditory canal infection usually occurring in the elderly with diabetes. MEO often progresses to potentially lethal skull base osteomyelitis (SBO) complications such as meningitis or multiple cranial nerve palsies. Poor vascularity in affected tissue due to diabetic microangiopathy and Pseudomonal infection is thought responsible for refractory infection. We conducted intraarterial antibiotic infusion (IA) in the external carotid artery of two subjects with intractable MEO deteriorating after long-term intravenous antibiotic administration with surgical debridement. IA raised the antibiotic concentration in infectious tissue. Clinical MEO manifestation was relieved just after starting IA, and IA therapy was followed by additional long-term intravenous and oral antibiotic administration, dramatically improving MEO while leaving only minimal infection at the skull base. These results demonstrate IA effectiveness in treating refractory MEO.","['Yamazaki H', 'Naito Y', 'Shinohara S', 'Fujiwara K', 'Kikuchi M', 'Tona Y', 'Kanazawa Y', 'Kurihara R']",2010,113,11,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho,"Yamazaki H, et al.

23111934,Malignant otitis externa: experience with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.,"INTRODUCTION: The treatment of malignant otitis externa (MOE) with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) remains controversial. The rarity of MOE, combined with poor access to hyperbaric facilities, explains the paucity of existing data.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with a diagnosis of MOE referred to the Prince of Wales Hospital hyperbaric unit over a period of six years, and report one of the largest case series to date.
RESULTS: From August 2001 to October 2007, 17 patients with MOE were referred, of whom 15 (88%) completed therapy, one did not tolerate HBOT and one was withdrawn due to pulmonary complications. Length of admission averaged 48 days (range 8-93 days) and three received outpatient care. Five patients had complications attributable to HBOT: acute pulmonary oedema (n = 2), seizure (n = 1), tympanic membrane perforation (n = 1) and claustrophobia (n = 1). Average time to follow up was 47 months (range 1-94 months). Twelve patients (70%) were considered cured of their disease, being disease-free at follow up, including four patients who had died of other causes but were symptom-free at the time of death. Three patients died directly from MOE (18%), one after a recurrence of their disease. Two further patients had recurrent disease, both successfully treated with a second cycle of HBOT and antibiotics. Nine patients (53%) had facial nerve palsy before commencement of HBOT, of whom four died, three from MOE, four had ongoing facial paralysis, and one resolved.
CONCLUSIONS: HBOT confers minimal morbidity, but its role in MOE remains uncertain. The high mortality of MOE despite maximal therapeutic intervention highlights the need for more effective treatment protocols.","['Saxby A', 'Barakate M', 'Kertesz T', 'James J', 'Bennett M']",2010,40,4,Diving Hyperb Med,"Saxby A, et al.

23111931,Malignant otitis externa: experience with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.,"With the low incidence of malignant otitis externa (MOE) and its variable manifestations, it is not possible to perform relevant prospective controlled studies in this condition. Therefore, the best evidence on which to base therapeutic decisions is likely to remain retrospective reviews of case series. Even though our knowledge in regard to MOE is not greatly increased by the retrospective case series by Saxby et al in this issue, nevertheless it has value.1 The larger number of cases here confirms that multimodal therapy, with the inclusion of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), enables a reduction in mortality compared to earlier case reports without HBOT. This case series is the largest in the literature. The real value of HBOT for MOE remains unclear, in part because in historical reports, patients were probably treated with less efficient antibiotics and surgical procedures than nowadays. It would have been interesting to know whether the fatal cases described here had predominantly intracranial propagation of the infection, because a particularly bad prognosis is expected in these patients even without facial nerve palsy. Cures in this high-risk subgroup would have also been worth mentioning. The number of surgical debridements required was noticeably low in this group of patients. One must bear in mind that necrotic tissue cannot be revitalised by HBOT and generally hinders cure. This syndrome of 'necrotizing' infection carries the suffix 'malignant' with good reason, given the high mortality rates reported in the literature. In summary, multimodal therapy is to be recommended for malignant otitis externa. There is no evidence to justify omitting any of the components of the treatment complex, including HBOT; there is currently no high level evidence-based medicine, just sound common sense, for any of the applied measures.",['Heiden C'],2010,40,4,Diving Hyperb Med,Heiden C.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series and literature review.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Primary eligibility criteria included patients who had an erosive process of their external auditory canal in the absence of diabetes or immune suppression.
INTERVENTION: Surgical debridement and split-thickness skin grafting.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uneventful wound healing and disease-free long-term follow-up after surgical debridement and skin grafting.
RESULTS: Three cases of EEO in the absence of immune suppression or diabetes were diagnosed and treated. All patients required surgical debridement and skin grafting as part of their management. All recovered uneventfully from surgery and had no evidence of recurrence on long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSION: We propose that EEO, which occurs in the absence of immune suppression or diabetes, is a clinical entity that is distinct from the more commonly diagnosed malignant external otitis and that the management of EEO is primarily surgical debridement with skin grafting.","['Nguyen LT', 'Harris JP', 'Nguyen QT']",2010,31,9,Otol Neurotol,"Nguyen LT, et al.

Special attention is paid to the sites, routes of spread, and complications of neck infections. Because the clinical signs and symptoms and the complications of these conditions are often determined by the precise anatomic site involved, anatomic considerations are stressed. Familiarity with the fascial layers, spaces of the neck, and the contents of each space is helpful for this discussion. The fascial layers of the neck are important barriers to infection, and once infection is established, the fascial layers play a part in directing its spread.","['Rana RS', 'Moonis G']",2011,49,1,Radiol Clin North Am,Rana RS and Moonis G.

This report describes a case of a rare, visually distinctive, proliferative and necrotising otitis in a three-month-old Persian kitten. The cat had proliferative, erythematous and necrotic tissue covering most of the proximal pinnae and vertical ear canals. On histopathological examination, the most striking feature was the existence of scattered apoptotic-appearing keratinocytes within severely hyperplastic epithelium. For the first time, immunohistochemistry was used to show a closed association between CD3(+) T cells and caspase-3 stained keratinocytes, consistent with a keratinocyte apoptosis by epidermal-infiltrating T cells. Treatment was initiated using topical tacrolimus twice daily and an ear cleanser once daily. A marked improvement was observed after 10 days of treatment and the lesions completely resolved over a period of three weeks. The origin of T cells directed against keratinocytes is currently unknown.","['Vidémont E', 'Pin D']",2010,51,11,J Small Anim Pract,Vidémont E and Pin D.

20970093,Homeopathic prescribing for chronic conditions in feline and canine veterinary practice.,"INTRODUCTION: The peer-review literature contains no controlled clinical research of homeopathy in cats and very little in dogs.
MAIN OBJECTIVE: To collect clinical outcomes data systematically from individualised homeopathic treatment of cats and dogs that would help to inform controlled research in feline and canine homeopathy.
METHODS: Twenty-one homeopathic veterinary surgeons recorded data systematically from consecutive feline and canine patients over a 12-month period. Records included: date; patient and owner identity (anonymised); medical problem treated; whether new or follow-up (FU) appointment; chronic or acute condition; owner-assessed clinical outcome (7-point scale, range -3 to +3) compared with first appointment.
RESULTS: Data from 400 cats comprised a total of 372 individual chronic problems, of which 270 had FU assessment. Data from 1504 dogs comprised a total of 1408 individual chronic problems, of which 1070 had FU assessment. In both species, 22% of FUs in chronic cases received conventional medicines concurrently. In cats, 117 different chronic medical conditions in total were treated with homeopathy. Five of those conditions included ≥20 cases, in which owner-reported outcomes (in decreasing rank order of frequency) were: dermatitis (69.6% patients with +2 or +3 outcome, 0% patients with -2 or -3 outcome); renal failure (57.1%, 14.3%); overgrooming (57.1%, 7.2%); arthritis (80.0%, 0%); hyperthyroidism (66.7%, 0%). In dogs, of 301 different chronic medical conditions treated in total, those most commonly recorded (≥20 cases) were: dermatitis (66.2% with +2 or +3 outcome, 5.4% with -2 or -3 outcome); arthritis (80.2%, 0.8%); pyoderma (75.8%, 0%); colitis (85.2%, 0%); fear (31.6%, 0%); epilepsy (63.6%, 4.5%); otitis externa (72.7%, 0%); diarrhoea (68.2%, 0%); urinary incontinence (73.7%, 0%); aggression (57.1%, 0%); spondylosis (81.0%, 0%); lymphoma (40.0%, 6.7%).

Some sequence variability has been observed in the large subunit (LSU) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions between strains isolated from cats and cows though these regions in M. nana isolates from cats alone have proven to be relatively conserved. In the present study, microsatellite PCR fingerprinting and β-tubulin gene sequence analysis were carried out on M. nana isolates from cats to investigate the genetic diversity of this species. Although a relatively small number of isolates were available, the similarity in the sequences of the β-tubulin and the microsatellite profiles indicate that a particular M. nana genotype colonizes cats. Moreover, all isolates obtained from animals with otitis externa had the same microsatellite fingerprinting pattern. Further studies of a wider population of M. nana isolates from other hosts and status disease are needed to establish that M. nana is a genetically homogeneous species.

Age group among studied patients ranged from 10 to 60 years, with mean of 23.5 years. Out of which 42 (51.2%) were females and 40 (48.8%) were males. Average number of visits in 10% IG pack group (n = 41) was 5.4 days (2-5 visits) while in steroid-antibiotic group (n = 41) it was 3.5 days (2-5 visits). There was statistically significant decrease in the number of visits in steroid group (P < 0.05). Similarly, decrease in pain score in second visit was statistically significant (P = 0.02) in steroid-antibiotic group as compared to 10% IG pack, while the edema score in second visit while comparing steroid-antibiotic group with 10% IG pack was statistically not significant (P = 0.07), whereas it was statistically highly significant on fourth visit (P = 0.001). Since the control of pain and edema is more and hence the number of visits is significantly less in steroid-antibiotic packing group, so it is worthwhile to use steroid-antibiotic pack for effective treatment of acute otitis externa.","['Shrestha BL', 'Shrestha I', 'Amatya RC', 'Dhakal A']",2010,62,4,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Shrestha BL, et al.

20869559,Errors in the diagnosis and management of necrotizing otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: Necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) is a life-threatening condition that may be difficult to distinguish from other clinical entities. The purpose of this study was to assess the pitfalls associated with contemporary diagnosis and management of NOE.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients given the diagnosis of NOE or one of its typical presenting complaints over the past 14 years were identified by diagnostic and radiology codes. Charts were reviewed for history, findings, treatment, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with NOE were identified. The annual case numbers rose steadily. A risk factor was known in 46 patients. Gallium single-photon emission computed tomography was accurate for the presence (44 of 46 patients) and resolution of disease. Prolonged systemic antimicrobial therapy (mean 15 weeks, range 4-59 weeks) was required. Microbial cultures influenced therapy in only 50 percent. Two diabetic men died with disease. Of the cases seen at the request of otolaryngologists, 68 percent were for indications other than NOE (e.g., chronic otitis media). With a known risk such as diabetes, the mean time to diagnosis was 6.9 months. History of and clinical appearance overlapping with benign otitis were the primary reasons for diagnostic delay.
CONCLUSION: NOE remains a life-threatening condition that requires prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Its incidence may be on the rise. NOE may develop in patients with benign otitis media and externa, and must be considered in all patients with temporal bone inflammation, especially those with risk factors and those who fail to improve with more conservative measures.","['Jacobsen LM', 'Antonelli PJ']",2010,143,4,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Jacobsen LM and Antonelli PJ.

20869557,Comparison of safety and efficacy of foam-based versus solution-based ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of a foam-based antibiotic formulation in the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE) with the more conventional solution-based formulation.
STUDY DESIGN: Phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Multicenter.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three eligible adult patients with unilateral AOE were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: an experimental 0.3 percent foam-based ciprofloxacin, (FoamOtic Cipro) or 0.3 percent solution-based ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan). All patients received the same dose regime (twice daily for 7 days). The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy (cure) in the test-of-cure visit. Secondary variables included improvement of the disease symptoms otalgia, tenderness, edema, and otorrhea.
RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study. Seven patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis due to major deviations from the protocol. Per-protocol analysis (n = 57) showed that cure was achieved in all the patients (P = 1.000). No significant differences were found between groups for symptomatic relief, resolution of otic discharge, or onset of pain reduction. Both treatments were found to be highly efficacious and safe, demonstrating the noninferiority of the experimental drug.
CONCLUSION: Foam-based ciprofloxacin is a safe and an effective new treatment for AOE.","['Marom T', 'Yelin R', 'Goldfarb A', 'Rakover Y', 'Shlizerman L', 'Eilat E', 'Roth Y']",2010,143,4,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Marom T, et al.

20868397,Evaluation of fungal flora in normal and diseased canine ears.,"This study was undertaken to characterize otic fungal flora encountered in normal dogs, atopic dogs with no clinical or cytological evidence of otitis and dogs with otitis externa. Forty-two normal dogs, 23 atopic dogs and 32 dogs with otitis were included in the study. Samples for otic fungal culture and cytology were obtained from all animals, for a total of 194 ears. Sixty-seven ear samples (34%) were culture positive for saprophytic fungal organisms, as follows: 43 (64%) Penicillium species, 13 (19%) Aspergillus species and the remaining 17% comprised of various other saprophytic fungal organisms. Cytological evidence of saprophytic fungal colonization or infection was not found in any animal. There was no relationship between positive saprophytic fungal culture and any study group. Thirty-three ear samples (17%) were positive for Malassezia pachydermatis. Cytological findings of Malassezia were significantly associated with positive culture for Malassezia (P = 0.006 left ear; P = 0.019 right ear). Furthermore, increased numbers of Malassezia led to a higher chance of positive culture (P = 0.003 left ear; P = 0.008 right ear; McNemar's test). Malassezia pachydermatis was more likely to be cultured from ears with increased cerumen. Ear type (erect or pendulous) was not significantly associated with positive culture for Malassezia or saprophytic fungal organisms. There was no relationship between positive Malassezia culture and any study group; however, Malassezia was more likely to be cultured from individual dogs in the atopic or otitis groups that also had other dermatological signs consistent with allergic dermatitis and/or pyoderma (P = 0.031 left ear; P = 0.005 right ear).","['Campbell JJ', 'Coyner KS', 'Rankin SC', 'Lewis TP', 'Schick AE', 'Shumaker AK']",2010,21,6,Vet Dermatol,"Campbell JJ, et al.

20712132,Glycerol lidocaine eardrops for the treatment of acute abacterial otitis externa.,"Inflammations of the external auditory canal number among the most frequently occurring ear-nose-throat diseases. For local treatment, substances from various groups of active ingredients are used as combinations and as single-agent drugs, e.g. antibiotics, glucocorticoids or analgesics [1]. In the case of acute otitis externa, treatment measures focus on the reduction of pain and swelling. The study described here investigates the efficacy and safety of glycerol lidocaine eardrops for the treatment of acute abacterial otitis externa (CAS No. for glycerol: 56-81-5, lidocaine-HCl: 73-78-9). In this double-blind, three-arm study, 105 patients diagnosed with acute abacterial otitis externa were included and randomized to receive either glycerol eardrops, glycerol eardrops with 0.5% lidocaine, or glycerol eardrops with 2% lidocaine for seven days. The primary outcome parameter was the change of the five typical clinical symptoms, earache, itching, otorrhea, hearing impairment, and ""clogged ear"" at Visit 2 (Day 7) based on the initial examination on Day 0. Both therapy groups treated with a combination of glycerol and lidocaine exhibited definite improvement in overall symptoms after seven days. This improvement differed from the mild reduction of symptoms under treatment with glycerol eardrops alone. Overall improvement of symptoms, expressed by the area under the curve of the baseline-adjusted symptom sum score, yielded a mean value of 10.95 (standard deviation 27.4) for the morning survey of the groups receiving eardrops containing only glycerol; in comparison, for eardrops containing glycerol and 2% lidocaine it was 15.71 (+/- 23.6) and for glycerol with 0.5% lidocaine, 23.16 (+/- 19.4). No severe adverse events occurred. Five adverse events were documented during the clinical investigation, none of which was considered by the investigators to be related to the study medication. Local therapy with glycerol lidocaine eardrops is a safe, and cost-effective treatment for the widely spread clinical picture of acute abacterial otitis externa. The advantage regarding efficacy of this combination compared with glycerol eardrops must be demonstrated in an adequately powered clinical trial.","['Mösges R', 'Kaatz V', 'Schmalz P', 'Meiser P', 'Eschmann K']",2010,60,7,Arzneimittelforschung,"Mösges R, et al.

20609208,Safety and tolerability of 0.1% tacrolimus solution applied to the external ear canals of atopic beagle dogs without otitis.,"Tacrolimus is a nonsteroidal alternative to treat noninfectious otitis externa (OE) in people. This 21-day study investigated whether twice daily application (0.2 mL/dose) of sterile olive oil based 0.1% tacrolimus suspension in ears of atopic beagle dogs without OE was associated with adverse local reactions, development of OE, change in otic cytology, vestibular dysfunction, or hearing loss detected by brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER). The study was randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. Twenty-two dogs matched for age and sex were randomized to tacrolimus or vehicle control treatment groups. Two investigators independently evaluated dogs for signs of adverse effects including OE the first 4 days of treatment, then every 3 days. A logistic regression model was fit for each investigator's clinical scores (SAS, 9.2, 2008). Time (P = 0.0032) and group (P = 0.0167) were always significant for OE. Inter-observer reliability of clinical scores was strong, measured using Kappa coefficients and proportion of agreement. All nine exclusions (7/10 control- and 2/12 tacrolimus-treated dogs) were excluded for yeast OE. Inter-observer agreement to exclude was 100%. All dogs not excluded had normal BAER assessments before treatment, weekly during treatment, and after 21 days of treatment. None showed vestibular abnormalities at these times. Tacrolimus blood concentrations (Abbott IMx Tacrolimus II) were below detection limits (3 ng/mL) at baseline and after 21 days of treatment. Results suggest otic application of olive oil based tacrolimus suspension to canine ears with intact tympanic membranes is unlikely to result in hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction but yeast OE is a possible risk.","['Kelley LS', 'Flynn-Lurie AK', 'House RA', 'Simpson AC', 'Marsella R']",2010,21,6,Vet Dermatol,"Kelley LS, et al.

20605955,Reproducibility of ear cytology in dogs with otitis externa.,"Eighty-three dogs with clinical signs of otitis externa and with ear cytology revealing microbial organisms were studied. Samples were collected from both ears of each dog by inserting two swabs successively into each ear canal, rotating each once through 360 degrees and then rolling it out in a line on to a glass slide. For each animal, four single parallel smears (SPS) were made on one slide, which was then appropriately labelled to identify the animal as well as the order of the samples. The slides, one representing each animal, were subsequently stained with modified Wright's stain. Six high-power fields of every SPS were counted. Golden retrievers and West Highland white terriers were found to be predisposed to developing otitis externa (P=0.0006 and P=0.0123, respectively). Otitis externa occurred significantly more frequently in dogs with pendulous pinnae than in dogs with erect pinnae (P=0.0009). There was no significant difference between the first and the second samples with respect to the number of microorganisms found (P>0.1 for cocci and P>0.5 for rods and yeasts), and there was a substantial agreement between the results of the two successive swabs for the presence of cocci (kappa=0.765) and rods (kappa=0.705).

20561760,Tympanoplasty in children: A review of 91 cases.,"OBJECTIVES: There is a marked diversity in the reported success rates for achieving an intact tympanic membrane following tympanoplasty. Controversy exists about the factors thought to influence surgical outcome. These facts have important implications for the selection of patients who would benefit the most. This study reviews the factors thought to determine the anatomical and functional success of tympanoplasty in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of the anatomical and functional results of 91 tympanoplasties performed in children. Age, gender, size and site of perforation, status of operated and contralateral ear, underlying cause of the perforations, surgical technique, pre-operative and post-operative hearing levels, post-operative follow-up time and post-operative complications were recorded. We divided our population into two groups according to the expected eustachian tube maturity (younger group (N=24): ≤10 years old, older group (N=67): >10 years old). All patients were evaluated in terms of anatomical and functional outcome and complications.
RESULTS: Anatomical success was achieved in 85.7% and functional success was 76.9% after a mean follow-up of 25.6 ± 17.1 months. Anatomical success (intact tympanic membrane) was achieved in 83% of younger vs 87% of older patients (p=n.s.). Functional (air bone gap closure) success was 75% in the younger group vs 78% in the older group (p=n.s.). There were no significant differences in post-operative gain at different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz) between the two groups. A previous adenoidectomy in children older than 10 years seems to be an independent predictor of functional success The incidence of minor and major complications were 29% in patients aged ≤10 and 21% in those older than 10 (p=n.s.). We report 12.9% minor post-operative complications in successful cases: injury to the chorda tympani nerve (5.7%), wound infection (2.9%), otitis externa (2.9%) and transient vertigo (1.4%). Among the 21 reperforations observed, 92.3% occurred before 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that tympanoplasty is a valid treatment modality for tympanic membrane perforation in the pediatric population. A tympanic membrane perforation can be closed at any age. There is no age limit below which perforation should not be closed. A previous adenoidectomy in children older than 10 years seems to be an independent predictor of functional success.","['Ribeiro JC', 'Rui C', 'Natercia S', 'Jose R', 'Antonio P']",2011,38,1,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Ribeiro JC, et al.

20561383,Molecular and epidemiological analysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus otorrhoea: hospital- or community-acquired?,"OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify newly diagnosed cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ear infection in our local population; (2) to determine the risk factors involved in these patients' clinical courses, and (3) to type the bacterial strains isolated and thus identify whether they were hospital- or community-acquired.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of case notes, together with laboratory-based molecular studies in the departments of otolaryngology and medical microbiology in a university teaching hospital in Scotland, UK.
SUBJECTS: Over a two-year period, 35 patients were identified with ear swabs positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. These cases came from both hospital and community settings.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Identification of primary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus otorrhoea in patients with no previously documented colonisation; and (2) molecular typing of the strains isolated, using spa technology, to identify whether they were hospital- or community-acquired.
RESULTS: Of the 35 positive patients, 27 were previously known carriers of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The eight patients with newly diagnosed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus otorrhoea presented initially in the community. All of these patients had had contact with hospital staff (as in-patients or out-patients) in the weeks preceding development of their ear infection. Using the spa technique for molecular typing, we identified hospital-acquired ('epidemic') methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus type 15 in all eight patients' isolates. All were sensitive to topical gentamicin.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus type 15 was the commonest cause of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus otorrhoea, despite the fact that these patients all first presented in the community. We believe that contact with hospital staff or health care workers is a risk factor for acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus otorrhoea in the community.","['Nassif RG', 'Soliman R', 'Edwards DH', 'Kara N', 'Hussain SS']",2010,124,12,J Laryngol Otol,"Nassif RG, et al.

20547443,Prospective trial of high-dose reirradiation using daily image guidance with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for recurrent and second primary head-and-neck cancer.,"PURPOSE: To report a single-institutional experience using intensity-modulated radiotherapy with daily image-guided radiotherapy for the reirradiation of recurrent and second cancers of the head and neck.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one consecutive patients were prospectively treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy from February 2006 to March 2009 to a median dose of 66 Gy (range, 60-70 Gy). None of these patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Daily helical megavoltage CT scans were obtained before each fraction as part of an image-guided radiotherapy registration protocol for patient alignment.
RESULTS: The 1- and 2-year estimates of in-field control were 72% and 65%, respectively. A total of 651 daily megavoltage CT scans were obtained. The mean systematic shift to account for interfraction motion was 1.38 ± 1.25 mm, 1.79 ± 1.45 mm, and 1.98 ± 1.75 mm for the medial-lateral, superior-inferior, and anterior-posterior directions, respectively. Pretreatment shifts of >3 mm occurred in 19% of setups in the medial-lateral, 27% in the superior-inferior, and 33% in the anterior-posterior directions, respectively. There were no treatment-related fatalities or hospitalizations. Complications included skin desquamation, odynophagia, otitis externa, keratitis, naso-lacrimal duct stenosis, and brachial plexopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy with daily image guidance results in effective disease control with relatively low morbidity and should be considered for selected patients with recurrent and second primary cancers of the head and neck.","['Chen AM', 'Farwell DG', 'Luu Q', 'Cheng S', 'Donald PJ', 'Purdy JA']",2011,80,3,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"Chen AM, et al.

20541337,Incidence of long-term ipsilateral and contralateral ototoxicity following radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the long-term adverse effects of radiotherapy on the ears in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we investigated ipsilateral and contralateral ototoxicities in the external, middle, and inner ear.
METHODS: The records of 48 ears in 24 radiotherapy-treated NPC patients were retrospectively analyzed. Radiotherapy doses varied between 60 and 70 Gy in 2-Gy fractions at 5 fractions/week. Ototoxicities were identified by otoscope and pure-tone audiograms conducted at 2-3 month intervals for ≥12 months. The relationship between radiation dosage and sensorineural threshold deterioration was statistically compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test.
RESULTS: Post-radiotherapy, 50% of all ears (3 of 6) that developed severe otitis externa were on the contralateral side. There was a post-radiotherapy increase in contralateral otitis media with effusion (OME) (1-7 ears), but a decrease in ipsilateral cases (16-12 ears), with 2 ears on either side subsequently developing chronic otitis media (COM). All ears that showed sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) before radiotherapy exhibited a further threshold deterioration of more than 15 dB. No statistically significant difference (p=0.086) in average radiation dose was seen between ears with sensorineural threshold deterioration (50.0 Gy) and those without (48.2 Gy).
CONCLUSION: Long-term ototoxicity following radiotherapy for NPC can occur in either the ipsilateral or contralateral ears. Pathophysiology varies between and within each side. The post-therapy increase in OME on the contralateral side was thought to be due to radiotherapy-induced Eustachian tube damage, and the sensorineural threshold deterioration in at least 4 ears was thought to be due to chronic cochlea damage secondary to COM.","['Wakisaka H', 'Yamada H', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Ugumori T', 'Takahashi H', 'Hyodo M']",2011,38,1,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Wakisaka H, et al.

CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old, diabetic man presented to the ENT department with a history of worsening right-sided otalgia, aural discharge and hearing loss, associated with a right-sided facial weakness. This was assumed to be secondary to malignant otitis externa, and treatment was commenced. Imaging showed soft tissue within the middle ear and no bony erosion. Surgical exploration and biopsy revealed an aspergilloma of the middle ear. The pre- and post-operative management, as well as treatment strategies, are discussed.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of an aspergilloma of the middle ear with associated facial palsy.

METHODS: The medical records of dogs with dermatological signs were reviewed. Prevalence of AFRs was calculated. Owner and clinician pruritus scores were compared. Breed, sex and age predisposition were statistically tested, as was the association between AFR and selected clinical features.
RESULTS: The prevalence of AFRs in dogs with dermatological signs was 12% (16 of 130). AFR was diagnosed in 26% of dogs with allergic disease and 48% of those subjected to a dietary trial. There was a significant association between AFRs and early onset of clinical signs (< 1 year) (OR=3.8; P=0.0221, 95% CI=1.27 to 11.16). There was a significant association between AFRs and both otitis externa (OR=5.9; P=0.0015, 95% CI=2 to 17.9) and perianal fistula (OR=26.1; P=0.0058, 95% CI=2.52 to 269.4), although all dogs with perianal fistulas were German shepherd dogs.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence of AFRs in the study population was higher than most reported values. Further studies are warranted to investigate the true prevalence of AFR and its possible association with perianal fistula and other potential markers.","['Proverbio D', 'Perego R', 'Spada E', 'Ferro E']",2010,51,7,J Small Anim Pract,"Proverbio D, et al.

20526674,Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria causing otitis externa in dogs.,"Bacterial agents are considered important pathogens causing external otitis in dogs. It is essential to carry out bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test in the case of otitis externa, particularly for chronic or recurring cases. Sterile swab samples were obtained from terminal part of vertical ear canals of 74 dogs with otitis externa for cytology, bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. Cytologic smears were stained using Gram and Giemsa staining methods. Aerobic bacterial culture performed on blood agar and MacConkey agar. Among total number of 92 isolated bacteria, 68 were Staphylococcus intermedius. Other isolated bacteria included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella canis, and six other species of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Antimicrobial susceptibility test were performed for all isolated bacteria using 14 antibiotics. Based on the results of this study, all isolated Staphylococcus spp. were sensitive to amikacin, enrofloxacin, and rifampin, and had low resistance to gentamicin, cephalothin and ceftriaxone. More than half of gram-positive isolates were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Generally, all isolated gram-negative bacteria, were sensitive to amikacin and enrofloxacin, and had low resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin. They were highly resistant to penicillin, eythromycin, and cephalothin. Regarding the results of this study, in cases of uncomplicated otitis externa, it is possible to select antimicrobial drugs merely based on cytology, but it is recommended to perform bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. However, in complicated or refractory cases, antimicrobials should be selected based on bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test.","['Zamankhan Malayeri H', 'Jamshidi S', 'Zahraei Salehi T']",2010,34,5,Vet Res Commun,"Zamankhan Malayeri H, et al.

Applications of electronic nose technology in otolaryngology.,"INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in electronic nose technology, and successful clinical applications, are facilitating the development of new methods for rapid, bedside diagnosis of disease. There is a real clinical need for such new diagnostic tools in otolaryngology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a critical review of recent advances in electronic nose technology and current applications in otolaryngology.
RESULTS: The literature reports evidence of accurate diagnosis of common otolaryngological conditions such as sinusitis (acute and chronic), chronic suppurative otitis media, otitis externa and nasal vestibulitis. A significant recent development is the successful identification of biofilm-producing versus non-biofilm-producing pseudomonas and staphylococcus species.

Cytology of otic exudate revealed neutrophils and septate fungal hyphae, and otic culture grew Aspergillus spp. and no bacteria. Treatments included allergen-specific immunotherapy, topical and oral antifungal therapy and anti-inflammatory steroid therapy. Final resolution occurred after treatment of the underlying hypersensitivity disorder, administration of topical ketoconazole and debridement of infectious ear exudate. Otomycosis due to filamentous fungi may, as in humans, occur in dogs with ear canals compromised by pre-existing allergic or bacterial otitis, and possibly previous antibiotic therapy.

20467256,High prevalence of Fluoroquinolone- and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from canine pyoderma and otitis externa in veterinary teaching hospital.,"Recently, a total of 74 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates were collected from clinical cases of canine pyoderma and otitis externa in Korea. In this study, we examined in vitro fluoroquinolone resistance among those isolates using a standard disk diffusion technique. The results demonstrated that approximately 18.9% to 27.0% of the isolates possessed bacterial resistance to both veterinary- and human-licensed fluoroquinolones except one isolate, including moxifloxacin (18.9% resistance), levofloxacin (20.3% resistance), ofloxacin (24.3% resistance), ciprofloxacin (25.7% resistance), and enrofloxacin (27.0% resistance). Most surprisingly, 14 out of 74 (18.9%) isolates were resistant to all the five fluoroquinolones evaluated. Moreover, a PCR detection of the methicillin resistance gene (mecA) among the 74 isolates revealed that 13 out of 25 (52.0%) mecA-positive isolates, but only 7 out of 49 (14.3%) mecA-negative isolates, were resistant to one or more fluoroquinones. Taken together, our results imply that bacterial resistance to both veterinary- and human-use fluoroquinolones becomes prevalent among the S. pseudintermedius isolates from canine pyoderma and otitis externa in Korea as well as that the high prevalence of the mecA-positive S. pseudintermedius isolates carrying multiple fluoroquinolone resistance could be a potential public health problem.","['Yoo JH', 'Yoon JW', 'Lee SY', 'Park HM']",2010,20,4,J Microbiol Biotechnol,"Yoo JH, et al.

20434850,Coryneform bacteria associated with canine otitis externa.,"This study aims to investigate the occurrence of coryneform bacteria in canine otitis externa. A combined case series and case-control study was carried out to improve the current knowledge on frequency and clinical significance of coryneform bacteria in samples from canine otitis externa. A total of 16 cases of otitis externa with involvement of coryneform bacteria were recorded at two referral veterinary hospitals in Denmark and the US, respectively. Coryneform bacteria were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Corynebacterium auriscanis was the most common coryneform species (10 cases). Small colony variants of this species were also observed. Other coryneform isolates were identified as Corynebacterium amycolatum (3 cases), Corynebacterium freneyi (2 cases) and an Arcanobacterium-like species (1 case). The coryneform bacteria were in all cases isolated together with other bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus pseudintermedius alone (n=5) or in combination with Malassezia pachydermatis (n=5). Some coryneform isolates displayed resistance to fusidic acid or enrofloxacin, two antimicrobial agents commonly used for the treatment of otitis externa in dogs. The frequency of isolation of coryneform bacteria was 16% among 55 cases of canine otitis externa examined at the Danish hospital during 2007. In contrast, detectable levels of coryneform bacteria were not demonstrated in samples from the acustic meatus of 35 dogs with apparently healthy ears, attending the hospital during the same year. On basis of the current knowledge, these coryneform bacteria should be regarded as potential secondary pathogens able to proliferate in the environment of an inflamed ear canal.","['Aalbæk B', 'Bemis DA', 'Schjærff M', 'Kania SA', 'Frank LA', 'Guardabassi L']",2010,145,3-4,Vet Microbiol,"Aalbæk B, et al.

RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (aged 65-90 years) who underwent mastoidectomy were enrolled. The etiologies included chronic otitis media (COM) with (n = 16) or without (n = 5) cholesteatoma, otogenic meningitis and malignant otitis externa (MOE; n = 3 each). Urgent mastoidectomy was indicated for 4 intracranial complications (3 meningitis and 1 brain abscess) and 14 extracranial complications of acute/COM or MOE (7 patients with labyrinthitis and 7 patients with facial nerve, FN, paralysis). There was only partial improvement in FN function in only 1 of 7 patients with FN paralysis. Two patients lost their hearing as a result of a surgical intervention for cholesteatoma. One patient was reoperated for recurrent cholesteatoma 15 months after the initial mastoid surgery. Chronic otorrhea complicated the postoperative course in 2 patients.

Distinguishing between fungal and bacterial aetiologies of SBO has significant therapeutic implications. An 18-year (1990-2007) retrospective review of patients with SBO presenting to Westmead Hospital was performed. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collated. Twenty-one patients (median age 58 years) with SBO were identified: ten (48%) had bacterial and 11 (52%) had fungal SBO. Diabetes mellitus (57%) and chronic otitis externa (33%) were the most frequent co-morbidities; immunosuppression was present in five cases (24%). Cranial nerve deficits occurred in ten (48%) patients. The commonest pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% bacterial SBO) and a zygomycete (55% fungal SBO). Compared to bacterial SBO, fungal SBO was more frequently associated with underlying chronic sinusitis, sinonasal pain, facial/periorbital swelling and nasal stuffiness or discharge and the absence of purulent ear discharge (all p <0.05). Bacterial SBO was more frequently associated with deafness, ear pain or ear discharge (all p <0.05). Median time to presentation was longer in patients with bacterial SBO (26.3 weeks vs. 8.1 weeks, p 0.08). Overall 6-month survival was 88% (14/18 patients). All four deaths occurred in patients with fungal SBO. Immunosuppression was a risk factor for death (p <0.05).

The diagnosis of otitis externa relies on the patient's history, otoscopic examination under microscopic control, and imaging studies. Direct preparation of the specimens, particularly with optical brighteners, mycologic culture, and histologic examination, is very important and strongly recommended for the correct diagnosis. Patients with noninvasive fungal otitis externa should be treated with intense débridement and cleansing, and topical antifungals. Topical antifungals, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, bifonazole, ciclopiroxolamine, and tolnaftate, are potentially safe choices for the treatment of otomycosis, especially in patients with a perforated eardrum. The oral triazole drugs, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole are effective against Candida and Aspergillus, with good penetration of bone and the central nervous system. These drugs are essential in the treatment of patients with malignant fungal otitis externa complicated by mastoiditis and meningitis.","['Vennewald I', 'Klemm E']",2010,28,2,Clin Dermatol,Vennewald I and Klemm E.

Presently, we sought to isolate S. intermedius strains from various sources at animal hospitals nationwide in Korea, examine their antibiotic susceptibilities, and determine the possibility of horizontal transmission between animals and humans. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare the mecA gene in S. intermedius strains from humans, animals and the environment in animal hospitals.

Otoscopic examination was impossible because of the severe stenosis of the ear canal. Right para-aural ultrasound examination and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of a mass-like lesion were performed. Cytology was suggestive of a follicular cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe ear canal stenosis with a heterogeneous mass in the horizontal portion of the ear canal and associated otitis media.

20193102,Atypical presentations of malignant otitis externa.,"INTRODUCTION: Malignant otitis externa is a life-threatening infection of the skull base. Its presentation is not always typical.
CASE REPORTS: We report three cases of malignant otitis externa which illustrate the diversity of its clinical manifestations and the difficulties in its diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: The perception of malignant otitis externa as an infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in diabetic patients is not always correct. The adoption of diagnostic criteria could be helpful in identifying atypical cases.","['Vourexakis Z', 'Kos MI', 'Guyot JP']",2010,124,11,J Laryngol Otol,"Vourexakis Z, et al.

Anaylsis using different phylogenetic algorithms consistently grouped strain IMMIB L-1656(T) with members of the genus Yaniella. The organism posessed a cell-wall murein based on L-lysine (variation A4α, type L-Lys-Gly-L-Glu), MK-10 as the predominant menaquinone and long-chain cellular fatty acids of straight-chain and branched-chain saturated types (with iso-C(15 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0) predominating). The polar lipids included diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol in addition to unknown glycolipids. The DNA G+C content was 59.7 mol%. Based on its distinctive genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, strain IMMIB L-1656(T) represents a novel species in a novel genus, for which the name Auritidibacter ignavus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. We also propose that members of the family Yaniellaceae be transferred to the family Micrococcaceae with amendments to the description of the suborder Micrococcineae.

20180220,Otitis: anatomy every practitioner should know.,"Chronic otitis externa is a difficult, frustrating problem. Four etiologic components must be considered: primary and secondary causes and perpetuating and predisposing factors.1 Usually, these cases are complex and involve more than one component. Perpetuating factors are changes in the anatomy and physiology of the ear that occur in response to inflammation in the ear canal and the perpetuating factors already present. They are self-perpetuating, are not disease specific, and include failure of self-cleaning mechanisms and proliferative changes that create folds and stenosis of the lumen of the ear canal. Elimination of perpetuating factors often requires aggressive cleaning of the ear and long-term therapy. It is important to avoid damaging key structures while aggressively cleaning the ear. Therefore, to adequately diagnose and manage perpetuating factors, veterinarians must recognize normal ear anatomy and physiology.",['Griffin C'],2009,31,11,Compend Contin Educ Vet,Griffin C.

20178480,In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a potentiated miconazole aural solution in chronic Malassezia otitis externa in dogs.,"This study assessed the in vitro and in vivo activity of an ear solution containing a third-generation chelating agent (Tricide) as an antimicrobial potentiator for miconazole in chronic Malassezia otitis. Thirty-one ears from 20 dogs were enrolled in the study. Fungal culture, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) testing of miconazole with and without Tricide were performed on all ears. In a randomized, controlled, and blinded treatment trial the ears were treated either with 0.9% saline solution containing 0.01% miconazole, 0.03% dexamethasone and 540 microg/mL Tricide or the same solution without Tricide. Cytologic and auroscopic examinations were conducted on day 0, 14 and 28 and evaluated for number of yeast organisms, degree of erythema, hyperplasia and amount of discharge. The in vitro data was compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The cytologic and auroscopic scores were compared between the visits and treatment groups at day 0, 14 and 28 using a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and repeated measures analysis. MIC and MFC were significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced when miconazole was combined with the chelating agent versus miconazole alone. The cytologic scores were significantly lower on days 14 (P = 0.0156) and 28 (P = 0.0280) for the group treated with Tricide. The auroscopic scores decreased significantly by the end of the trial compared to day 0, but the difference between the two groups was not significant. This study suggests that Tricide enhances in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy against Malassezia sp. in dogs with yeast otitis.","['Hensel P', 'Austel M', 'Wooley RE', 'Keys D', 'Ritchie BW']",2009,20,5-6,Vet Dermatol,"Hensel P, et al.

20178479,Histological changes in the external ear canal of dogs with otitis externa.,"This study aimed to better characterise the gross anatomy of the normal ear canal, and to compare histological features of the normal ear canal to those affected by chronic otitis externa. In 40 normal ears from 20 dogs, the length of the annular and auricular cartilage was 1.2 +/- 0.2 and 4.1 +/- 0.9 cm, respectively; overall length of the external ear canal was 5.3 +/- 1.0 cm. The maximal internal diameter at the distal end of the external ear canal, the proximal opening of the auricular cartilage and the proximal end of the annular cartilage was 5.8 +/- 1.5, 0.7 +/- 0.2 and 0.5 +/- 0.1 cm, respectively. Body weight correlated positively with the overall length and diameter of the distal end of the ear canal (r = 0.78, P < 0.001; r = 0.42, P < 0.05). Morphometric evaluation was carried in 28 clinically healthy ears of 14 dogs, and 15 otitic ears of 13 dogs. Histological features of this integument revealed that the density and distribution of sebaceous and ceruminous gland tissue exhibits marked variation between individuals. Nevertheless, general patterns were observed; sebaceous tissue increases gradually from the proximal to the distal parts of the ear canal, whilst ceruminous gland tissue by contrast decreases. In otitic canine ears, the distribution of sebaceous and ceruminous glandular tissue was similar to normal ears but the glands became larger and hyperplastic (P < 0.05). Density of hair follicles was not different between healthy and otitic ears (P = 0.16), but the hair follicles became hyperplastic in otitic ears.","['Huang HP', 'Little CJ', 'McNeil PE']",2009,20,5-6,Vet Dermatol,"Huang HP, et al.

20149702,Gentamycin inhibits the growth of Malassezia pachydermatis in culture.,"BACKGROUND: Malassezia pachydermatis is a yeast of importance in both veterinary and human medicine.
AIMS: To know if M. pachydermatis grow on mycological media with high concentrations of gentamycin.
METHODS: Twenty M. pachydermatis strains were streaked on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar plates with different concentrations of gentamycin.
RESULTS: All isolates were inhibited when high concentrations of gentamycin were added.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of plates with high concentrations of gentamycin can lead to some important misdiagnoses: firstly, false-negative cultures, and secondly, an erroneous classification of M. pachydermatis as a lipid-dependent species. Moreover, all of this could be useful in two therapeutic fields: i) in animals, topical gentamycin could be an efficacious treatment for a disease such as external otitis in dogs; ii) in humans, we hypothesize that gentamycin could be regarded as a possible therapy (""antibiotic-lock"") for catheter-associated Malassezia spp. infections.","['Aspíroz C', 'Gilaberte Y', 'Rezusta A', 'Boekhout T', 'Rubio MA']",2010,27,1,Rev Iberoam Micol,"Aspíroz C, et al.

20091565,Interventions for acute otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible.We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.
MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low.Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial).In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively).One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate.No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning.Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid.The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed.Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision.Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.","['Kaushik V', 'Malik T', 'Saeed SR']",2010,,1,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Kaushik V, et al.

20066729,Exostoses of the external auditory canal in white-water kayakers.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Exostoses of the external auditory canal are benign bony tumors associated with frequent cold-water exposure. Obstruction may lead to conductive hearing loss and recurrent otitis externa, requiring surgical correction when symptoms become intolerable. This study aimed to characterize the prevalence of exostoses in white-water kayakers and identify associated risk factors and protective measures.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
METHODS: Six hundred eleven white-water kayakers from across the United States were included in the study. Percent occlusion was graded as minimal (<25%), moderate (25%-75%) or severe (>75%). Subjects completed a survey of risk factors and protective measures. Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests were performed to determine significant associations with percent occlusion. A multivariate proportional odds regression model was fit to adjust for confounding between the variables.
RESULTS: The prevalence of exostoses in kayakers was 79% (482/611); 13% (78/611) had >or=75% occlusion. Percent occlusion was associated with total years kayaked (P < .001), frequency >or=1 day/week (P < .001), male gender (P < .001), and increasing age (P = .005), although frequency, gender, and age were confounded by total years. Styles that involve repeated submersion were also associated with greater occlusion (freestyle, P = .036; squirt, P = .016). Subjects who used earplugs for a greater proportion of their kayaking career were less likely to have exostoses (P < .001). When adjusted for confounding, only total years (P = .0003) and age (P = .0027) remained significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Kayakers are the first inland population to experience exostoses at the rates seen in coastal populations (e.g., surfers). When used long-term, earplugs may be protective.","['Moore RD', 'Schuman TA', 'Scott TA', 'Mann SE', 'Davidson MA', 'Labadie RF']",2010,120,3,Laryngoscope,"Moore RD, et al.

METHODS: The four cases presented, which were drawn from the Oxford, United Kingdom, skull base pathology database, had a diagnosis of central skull base osteomyelitis.
RESULTS: Four cases are presented in which central skull base osteomyelitis was diagnosed. Contrary to malignant otitis externa, our cases were not preceded by immediate external infections and had normal external ear examinations. They presented with headache and a variety of cranial neuropathies. Imaging demonstrated bone destruction, and subsequent microbiological analysis diagnosed infection and prompted prolonged antibiotic treatment.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that in the diabetic or immunocompromised patient, a scenario of headache, cranial neuropathy, and bony destruction on imaging should raise the possibility of skull base osteomyelitis, even in the absence of an obvious infective source. The primary goal should still be to exclude an underlying malignant cause.","['Clark MP', 'Pretorius PM', 'Byren I', 'Milford CA']",2009,19,4,Skull Base,"Clark MP, et al.

21418684,Otitis externa.,"INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, people with absence of ear wax or with narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.
METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical and prophylactic treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
RESULTS: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid drops or spray, topical aluminium acetate drops, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical anti-infective agents, topical corticosteroids, and water exclusion.","['Hajioff D', 'Mackeith S']",2010,2010,,BMJ Clin Evid,Hajioff D and Mackeith S.

During a 7-year period at our institution, we treated 6 patients with necrotizing OE who were not diabetic, who were not immunocompromised, and who were relatively young (age range: 27 to 65 yr; mean: 42.8). The necrotizing OE in these patients was less aggressive but just as severe as its usual presentation in older diabetic or immunocompromised patients. All 6 patients had evidence of bony erosion on computed tomography of the temporal bones, although 4 had negative findings on technetium-99m scintigraphy. Four of the 6 patients required mastoid exploration and fascia lata grafting, and the other 2 chose to undergo extensive daily microdebridements and intravenous antibiotics followed by 6 weeks of oral antibiotics. We recommend that a diagnosis of necrotizing OE be kept in mind when evaluating any patient who presents with severe otalgia, particularly in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the external auditory canal, edema, granulation tissue, and bony erosion.","['Glynn F', 'Walsh RM']",2009,88,12,Ear Nose Throat J,Glynn F and Walsh RM.

20000063,Attitude of self ear cleaning in black Africans: any benefit?,"UNLABELLED: Wax removal compromises the integrity of the ear's defenses. It is a leading cause of otitis externa, Otomycosis and impaired hearing. Aims of the study are to assess the knowledge and implication of self ear cleaning among black Africans.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study carried out at the Tundun-wada community and National Ear Care Centre, Kaduna with administration of structured questionnaire after an informed consent and ethical clearance. Information retrieved includes biodata, believe, reason and object for cleaning of the ear, associated problems or benefit and examination.
RESULTS: A total of 372 form the basis for the study, age range 1-76 yr with a mean age of 30.37 yr, median age 29.00 (S.D. = 13.79) and M:F ratio of 1:1. Mother responded for their children except for grown up. About 47.3% of the subjects were unemployed who were either children or complete house wife. About 90% of the subjects interviewed do self ear cleaning and over 90% believe ear should be cleaned to remove wax, because of itching in over 50% while a few is due to cosmetic reason. Cotton bud was the commonest material used for cleaning. About one-third of the subject has formed the habit unconsciously over 10 years. The entire subjects interviewed had their ear examined; about 27% had ear discharge then wax impaction in 22% then foreign body 12%.
CONCLUSION: The habit of self ear cleaning should be discouraged as it is slow otologic poison with an attendant long term effect.","['Afolabi AO', 'Kodiya AM', 'Bakari A', 'Ahmad BM']",2009,6,1,East Afr J Public Health,"Afolabi AO, et al.

19999361,Change of external auditory canal pH in acute otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated (1) the correlation between the degree of acute otitis externa (AOE) and a change of pH and (2) the recovery of pH after acidification compared to an antibiotic otic solution in AOE. A change of pH in the external auditory canal (EAC) is very important for the pathogenesis of otitis externa. Therefore, not only an antibiotic otic solution, but also acidification, is known to be a good treatment for AOE. However, pH has only been investigated in chronic otitis externa, and not in AOE.
METHODS: This was a prospective randomized control study. Forty adult patients (56 ears) with AOE and 40 normal control subjects (80 ears) participated in this study. The severity of disease was graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The pH of each EAC was then measured. The patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups: one for vinegar irrigation and the other for topical antibiotics. The pH of the diseased ears was measured at 1 and 2 weeks after the treatment.
RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) pH for the normal control subjects was 5.4 +/- 0.48, and the EAC lost its acidity proportionately to the degree of disease (p < 0.05). For both the vinegar irrigation and topical antibiotic groups, the acidity was restored dramatically (p < 0.05) at 1 and 2 weeks for the moderate and severe grades of otitis, but not for the mild grade. There was no difference in recovery between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The EAC lost its acidity proportionately to the degree of disease in AOE. Vinegar irrigation and topical antibiotics were equally effective for restoration of pH.","['Kim JK', 'Cho JH']",2009,118,11,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,Kim JK and Cho JH.

19998578,Therapeutic properties and tolerance of procaine and phenazone containing ear drops in infants and very young children.,"UNLABELLED: Since ear pain is often intolerable in very young children with acute otitis media (AOM), a safe pain reduction is indispensable both from the medical as well as from the ethical point of view.
METHODS: To confirm the safety and therapeutic properties of ear drops (Otalgan) consisting of the short acting local anesthetic procaine hydrochloride (CAS 51-05-8) and the anti-inflammatory component phenazone (CAS 60-80-0), a multi-center, non-interventional post marketing surveillance (PMS) study was performed in 428 children (f/m: 45.6%/ 54.4%) aged between 0 and 6 years (mean 3.44 ys). Otalgia as the overall diagnostic criterion present in all children was allotted to otitis media in 398 (93%) and to otitis externa in 28 patients (6.5%), while in two patients, both diagnoses were documented.
RESULTS: No adverse drug reactions (ADR) to the target medication have been detected during the entire study. The evaluation of tolerance by the physicians (mean score 1.38) and by the children/ parents (mean score 1.48) was in compliance with the absence of ADR. The drug tolerance was rated by the physicians in 99.8% of the cases as very good (62.2%; n = 266) or good (37.6%; n = 161). In one child (0.2%), the tolerance was evaluated by the physician as moderate. The judgement of parents revealed for all children either a very good (51.9%; n = 222) or good (48.1%; n = 206) evaluation of tolerance. The target medication was tolerated well, independent of the duration of treatment (2 to 10 days with a median of 5 days), of the daily dose and of the accumulated dose per treatment cycle, i.e. longer treatments and higher doses were not associated with a worsening of tolerance evaluations. Even in the highest dose class of over 100 drops per treatment cycle, no changes of tolerance could be revealed. As far as can be derived from non-controlled observational data, the results also confirm the known efficacy profile of the target medication in children. Under the treatment, the initial mean pain score of 2.33 was reduced by nearly 93% down to 0.17, accompanied by a corresponding normalization of the otoscopic findings of the ear canal and the tympanic membrane, and by the Improvement of the general condition. In 95.3% of the children, the physicians rated the efficacy of the target medication as very good (n = 156; 36.4%) or good (n = 252; 58.9%) while in 14 patients (3.3%) the efficacy was scored as moderate, in 4 patients (0.9%) as minimal and in two patients as inadequate (0.5%). The results also demonstrate that with the use of the target medication for local symptomatic treatment of pain in the outer ear canal and in AOM in children, the use of antibiotics in most of the cases can be avoided.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings are in full accordance with the results of former clinical studies, with positive evaluations of ototoxicity and with accumulated pharmacovigilance data showing that since introduction of the drug in 1911, no ADR have ever been reported in children. The study confirms that the target medication provides a safe and rapid pain reduction and improvement of inflammation in very young children suffering from painful acute inflammatory ear conditions.","['Adam D', 'Federspil P', 'Lukes M', 'Petrowicz O']",2009,59,10,Arzneimittelforschung,"Adam D, et al.

19952510,Occurrence of Malassezia species in Persian and domestic short hair cats with and without otitis externa.,"The yeasts of the Malassezia genus are opportunistic microorganisms in the skin and auricular canal of human and animals, mainly cats, and can cause otitis externa and dermatitis disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of different species of Malassezia in the external ear canal of cats with and without otitis externa. Thirty-one normal cats and 82 animals with otitis externa were clinically examined. Sterile cotton swabs were used to collect specimens from the external ear canal and streaked onto the surface of Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and modified Dixon agar. Malassezia yeasts were isolated from 95.1% and 48.4% of the cats with and without otitis externa, respectively. The rate of isolation in affected animals versus normals was highly significant (P<0.05). Out of the 137 isolates obtained from cats with otitis, 57.7% were identified as M. pachydermatis (with significant frequency; P<0.05), 15.4% as M. obtusa, 11.4% as M. globosa, 7.3% as M. slooffiae, 4.1% as M. sympodialis, 2.4% as M. furfur and 1.6% as M. restricta. Malassezia species were frequently isolated from subjects with age range from 1 to 4 years old (42.7%). Our finding of Malassezia isolates indicated that feline otitis externa can be associated with lipid-dependent Malassezia species in addition to the non lipid- dependent species M. pachydermatis.","['Shokri H', 'Khosravi A', 'Rad M', 'Jamshidi S']",2010,72,3,J Vet Med Sci,"Shokri H, et al.

Exposure of TPA on the ear of the BALB/c mice caused a marked increase in both ear thickness and skin water content. The ear thickness was measured for TPA-induced ear was 0.54 mm, as compared to control (0.23 mm). Treatment with 1% and 10% of essential oil caused significant decrease in ear thicknesses which were measured to be 0.30 and 0.35 mm, as well as reduce the water content about 51% and 53% in the TPA-induced skin inflammation model, respectively. Furthermore, histological analysis clearly confirmed that Z. jujuba essential oil inhibited the inflammatory responses of skin inflammation in animal model. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the essential oil of Z. jujuba seeds might accelerate the development of new drugs for various inflammatory diseases.","['Al-Reza SM', 'Yoon JI', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim JS', 'Kang SC']",2010,48,2,Food Chem Toxicol,"Al-Reza SM, et al.

A 53-year-old woman had been treated for PPP for 2 years. She complained of hearing loss in the right ear, and otitis externa was diagnosed. The pure-tone audiogram (PTA) indicated mild hearing loss in the right ear, and her hearing continued to deteriorate despite recovery from inflammation. Her tympanogram was of the As-type, and acoustic reflex was absent in the right ear. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral normal ossicles and cochleas. Bone scintigraphy revealed tracer uptake in the bilateral sternoclavicular joints, glenohumeral joints, and the capital humerus. She was hospitalized for arthralgia, and the pain was controlled with steroid therapy. Her right hearing deteriorated soon after the tapering of the steroid; her hearing recovered after cyclosporine therapy was initiated. The first tonsil provocation test showed increased blood cells in the urine, and the second test showed exacerbation of pustulosis. Despite immunosuppressant therapy, the arthritis attacks and hearing loss persisted; therefore, tonsillectomy was performed, which improved PPP. However, her hearing remained unchanged after the operation. We considered that irreversible changes might have already developed in the ossicular joints, and ossicular reconstruction was performed. Thereafter, her hearing and earache improved.","['Shimizu S', 'Yukawa K', 'Kawaguchi S', 'Okubo Y', 'Suzuki M']",2010,37,4,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Shimizu S, et al.

19814968,[Considerations on acute otitis externa for its optimized treatment].,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the optimal treatment for diffuse acute otitis externa (DAOE) by means of a new staging system based on clinical and otoscopic findings.
METHODS: Monitoring of otitis cases diagnosed at our Centre over the last 21 months (n=1,026), taking into account those who returned for a second visit, either via the emergency service or with a prior appointment. Staging of otitis externa by degree of obstruction of the external auditory canal (EAC): under 25% (type I, n=174); between 25% and 75% (type II; n=277); over 75% (type III; n=359); total obstruction due to organized oedema (type IV; n=216).
RESULTS: In most cases at an advanced stage, the canal was cleared by aspiration and placement of gauze or cellulose sponges. Ototopical drops were chosen in more than 95% of cases in every group, but anti-inflammatory and systemic antibiotic agents were administered in significantly larger amounts to patients in stages III and IV. Stage IV showed a statistically significant increase in the percentage of second visits. These manoeuvres improved pain, fullness and otorrhea significantly faster in stages I and II.
CONCLUSIONS: Staging of otitis allows comparisons of the level of involvement and treatment recommendations: aspiration is advisable in stages II, III and IV; placement of a wick inside the canal is necessary in stages III and IV. Ototopical drops seem to be needed in every case and systemic antibiotics almost only in stage IV. Acidifying agents and topic glycerine vehicles access the canal better than aqueous solutions and would be the first choice in advanced stages.","['García Callejo FJ', 'Muñoz Martínez N', 'Achiques MT', 'Conill Tobías N', 'Montoro Elena MJ', 'Algarra JM']",2009,60,4,Acta Otorrinolaringol Esp,"García Callejo FJ, et al.

19776401,Combined immunodeficiency associated with DOCK8 mutations.,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent sinopulmonary and cutaneous viral infections with elevated serum levels of IgE are features of some variants of combined immunodeficiency. The genetic causes of these variants are unknown.
METHODS: We collected longitudinal clinical data on 11 patients from eight families who had recurrent sinopulmonary and cutaneous viral infections. We performed comparative genomic hybridization arrays and targeted gene sequencing. Variants with predicted loss-of-expression mutations were confirmed by means of a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay and immunoblotting. We evaluated the number and function of lymphocytes with the use of in vitro assays and flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Patients had recurrent otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonias; recurrent Staphylococcus aureus skin infections with otitis externa; recurrent, severe herpes simplex virus or herpes zoster infections; extensive and persistent infections with molluscum contagiosum; and human papillomavirus infections. Most patients had severe atopy with anaphylaxis; several had squamous-cell carcinomas, and one had T-cell lymphoma-leukemia. Elevated serum IgE levels, hypereosinophilia, low numbers of T cells and B cells, low serum IgM levels, and variable IgG antibody responses were common. Expansion in vitro of activated CD8 T cells was impaired. Novel homozygous or compound heterozygous deletions and point mutations in the gene encoding the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 protein (DOCK8) led to the absence of DOCK8 protein in lymphocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Autosomal recessive DOCK8 deficiency is associated with a novel variant of combined immunodeficiency.","['Zhang Q', 'Davis JC', 'Lamborn IT', 'Freeman AF', 'Jing H', 'Favreau AJ', 'Matthews HF', 'Davis J', 'Turner ML', 'Uzel G', 'Holland SM', 'Su HC']",2009,361,21,N Engl J Med,"Zhang Q, et al.

These inflammatory processes are often accompanied by reactive locoregional lymphadenopathy. An inadequate or insufficient systemic therapy may lead to the persistence of otalgia and of signs of flogosis. The administration of local intradermaltherapy allows a strengthening of the pharmacological effect and a reduction in the quantity of drug used. It provides a rapid improvement in the locoregional signs of infection.Intradermal injection is performed on two pretragral points, two retroauricular points and one in the posterior surface of the pinna. The drugs injected are corticosteroids and antibiotics.The administration of intradermal therapy in the cases presented gave excellent results: control of pain, rapid improvement in the signs of infection, complete recovery from the flogosis, no side-effects.The intradermal lijection of small quantities of drugs allows a rapid and complete recovery from external otitis while the systemic approach leads often to the persistence of the flogosis.","['Savastano M', 'Ferraro SM', 'Marioni G']",2009,38,5,J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Savastano M, et al.

For that we sampled 360 goats slaughtered at abattoirs in the summer to identify those infested with the mite. We found only 20 infested, so used all of those plus another 47 uninfested goats selected systematically from the population negative for the isolation of Mycoplasmas. These goats came from the regions of Queretaro, Guanajuato, Sinaloa and Estado de México. Sterile swabs were taken from each ear canal of the carcass after removal of the pinna for microscopic observation of the mites and for the isolation of Mycoplasmas in both study groups. The swab samples were inoculated in Friis media for the isolation of Mycoplasmas; then, the isolates were biochemically characterized and identified serologically. We recovered isolates from the earwax of only nine of the 47 control goats, but from the earwax of 11 of the 20 infested goats; another four infested goats had Mycoplasma isolated from the mites but not from the earwax. Mycoplasma cottewii and Mycoplasma yeatsii were the only Mycoplasmas isolated from the uninfested goats, and also were the predominant (29 of 34) isolates from the infested goats and/or from the mites.","['Jimena ON', 'Laura JM', 'Elena MM', 'Alonso NH', 'Teresa QM']",2009,92,1-2,Prev Vet Med,"Jimena ON, et al.

METHODS: The study was done at a non-government ENT center at Jaipur. From 1975 to 2005, >125000 patients of different diseases were evaluated here. The study includes randomly selected patients (n = 11454) from years 1980 to 2000 at an interval of 5 years to evaluate disease trends. Significance of trends was evaluated using least squares regression.
RESULTS: In the years 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 mean age of patients was 26.60 ± 17.81 (range 0.16 to 85), 27.07 ± 16.91 (0.08 to 90), 28.30 ± 17.73 (0.25 to 90), 28.79 ± 17.8 (0.25 to 90) and 28.74 ± 17.81 (0.25 to 85) years respectively. 51 types of ENT diseases were observed of which 19 contributed to 76.8% (8807) patients and analysis was restricted to them. Chronic suppurative otitis media (2203, 19.2%), otitis externa (859, 7.5%), deviated nasal septum with nasal obstruction (717, 6.3%) and chronic tonsillitis (695, 6.1%) were the most common, followed by ear wax (569, 4.9%), sensorineural hearing loss (545, 4.7%), chronic rhinosinusitis (428, 3.7%) and epistaxis (320, 2.8%). There was increasing trend for stomatitis (b = 0.0014), deviated nasal septum (b = 0.0290), allergic rhinitis (b = 0.0023), epistaxis (b = 0.0002), acute tonsillitis (b = 0.0003), hoarseness (b = 0.0017), deaf mutism (b = 0.0005), sensorineural hearing loss (b = 0.0038), tinnitus (b = 0.0006) and ear wax (b = 0.0050). Declining trend was observed for chronic rhinosinusitis (b = -0.0155), otitis externa (b = -0.0063), chronic suppurative otitis media (b = -0.0001), acute otitis media ( = -0.0007), secretory otitis media (b = -0.0013), otosclerosis (b = -0.0007), vertigo (b = -0.0007), neck swelling (b = -0.0005) and chronic tonsillitis (b = -0.0194).
CONCLUSION: This study from an Indian urban ENT center shows a significantly increasing trend in chronic and degenerative ear diseases and decline in infection related diseases.","['Gaur K', 'Kasliwal N', 'Bhandari A', 'Amisha B', 'Gupta VP', 'Gupta R']",2009,61,3,Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Gaur K, et al.

19697430,Facial clefting and oroauditory pathway manifestations in ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome.,"Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) Syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by ectodermal dysplasia, along with other malformations such as cleft lip and palate, and various secondary issues such as chronic sinusitis, otitis media, and conductive hearing loss (CHL). The International Research Symposium for AEC Syndrome convened at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Patients with a suspected diagnosis of AEC syndrome attended, and members of the dental, dermatology, plastic surgery, otolaryngology, and audiology services examined each patient. Eighteen patients with a diagnosis of AEC were evaluated. Mean age was 7.5 years (range: 4 months-30 years). Fourteen of the 15 subjects tested (93.33%) demonstrated CHL, with seven showing moderate to severe hearing deficits (41-90 dB). Nine of 13 respondents reported hoarseness or voice problems; 8 were noted to display this on examination. Fourteen of 16 subjects reported speech was below average for age; 8 were in speech therapy. All 18 subjects reported a history of otitis externa or otitis media. Eleven of the subjects (61.11%) required myringotomy and pressure equalizing (PE) tubes. All patients demonstrated cleft palate defects. Of these, 16 (94.11%) presented with clefting of the soft palate, and 10 (58.82%) showed hard palate defects. Three subjects (16.67%) were noted to have submucous clefts. Our experience leads us to propose that while the oroauditory problems in those with AEC syndrome is likely multifactorial, many issues may stem from palatal clefting. Despite this, some abnormalities persist following surgical cleft closure, which indicates other complicating factors are also involved.","['Cole P', 'Hatef DA', 'Kaufman Y', 'Magruder A', 'Bree A', 'Friedman E', 'Sindwani R', 'Hollier LH']",2009,149A,9,Am J Med Genet A,"Cole P, et al.

Low circulating concentrations of total serum thyroxine (TT(4)) and free thyroxine (fT(4)) and an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone concentration supported a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. Thyroid scintigraphy did not show uptake of radioactive technetium in the thyroid area. Treatment with levothyroxine resulted in clinical improvement. Recurrence of dermatitis 8 months after onset of treatment resulted in euthanasia of the cat. On post-mortem examination, thyroid tissue was not identified on gross or histological examination. Pituitary immunohistochemistry identified hyperplasia of chromophobe cells.","['Blois SL', 'Abrams-Ogg AC', 'Mitchell C', 'Yu A', 'Stoewen D', 'Lillie BN', 'Kiupel M']",2010,12,2,J Feline Med Surg,"Blois SL, et al.

19673983,A controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation in chronic otitis due to antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa; a preliminary report of efficacy.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation (Biophage-PA) targeting antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic otitis.
DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial approved by UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees (COREC) ethical review process.
SETTING: A single specialist university hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: 24 patients with chronic otitis with a duration of several years (2-58). Each patient had, at the time of entry to the trial, an ear infection because of an antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa strain sensitive to one or more of the six phages present in Biophage-PA. Participants were randomised in two groups of 12 treated with either a single dose of Biophage-PA or placebo and followed up at 7, 21 and 42 days after treatment by the same otologist. Ears were thoroughly cleaned on each occasion and clinical and microbiological indicators measured.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician assessed erythema/inflammation, ulceration/granulation/polyps, discharge quantity, discharge type and odour using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Patients reported discomfort, itchiness, wetness and smell also using a VAS. Bacterial levels of P. aeruginosa and phage counts from swabs were measured initially and at follow-up. At each visit patients were asked about side effects using a structured form. Digital otoscopic images were obtained on days 0 and 42 for illustrative purposes only.
RESULTS: Relative to day 0, pooled patient- and physician-reported clinical indicators improved for the phage treated group relative to the placebo group. Variation from baseline levels was statistically significant for combined data from all clinic days only for the phage treated group. Variation from baseline levels was statistically significant for the majority of the patient assessed clinical indicators only for the phage treated group. P. aeruginosa counts were significantly lower only in the phage treated group. No treatment related adverse event was reported.
CONCLUSION: The first controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation showed efficacy and safety in chronic otitis because of chemo-resistant P. aeruginosa.","['Wright A', 'Hawkins CH', 'Anggård EE', 'Harper DR']",2009,34,4,Clin Otolaryngol,"Wright A, et al.

Previous reports have demonstrated that significant intra-species variability exists in the DNA sequence of the intergenic spacer 1 region (IGS1), particularly amongst M. globosa, M. restricta and M. pachydermatis, and that certain IGS genotypes are associated with various epidemiological factors, including host disease status. In the present study, we demonstrated that the IGS1 sequences of 12 UK isolates of M. nana from cats and of six isolates from Spain (5 cat, 1 dog) were identical to each other and to CBS 9557, the M. nana type culture originally obtained from a Japanese cat with otitis externa. Further studies are needed to determine whether other genotypes of M. nana can be identified and associated with geographical regions and the species and disease status of mammalian hosts.","['de Bellis F', 'Castellá G', 'Cabañes FJ', 'Bond R']",2010,48,2,Med Mycol,"de Bellis F, et al.

19649486,Otomycosis: a retrospective study.,"UNLABELLED: Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the external ear canal with only a few studies about its real frequency in Brazil.
AIM: to evaluate otomycosis frequency and characteristics in patients with clinical suspicion of external otitis.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study with transversal cohort (2000-2006).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 103 patients were assigned to mycological diagnosis (direct microscopic examination and culture).
RESULTS: Otomycosis was diagnosed in 19.4% of the patients. Patient age varied from 2 to 66 years (an average of 23.5 years of age), and 60% of otomycosis cases were seen in women between 2 to 20 years of age. Chronic otitis, previous antibiotic therapy and the lack of cerumen were predisposing factors; itching, otalgia, otorrhea and hypoacusis were the symptoms reported by the patients. The most frequently isolated species were C. albicans (30%), C. parapsilosis (20%), A. niger (20%), A. flavus (10%), A. fumigatus (5%), C. tropicalis (5%), Trichosporon asahii (5%) and Scedosporium apiospermum (5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Otomycosis is endemic in João Pessoa-PB. Clinical exam and mycological studies are important for diagnostic purposes because otomycosis symptoms are not specific.","['Pontes ZB', 'Silva AD', 'Lima Ede O', 'Guerra Mde H', 'Oliveira NM', 'Carvalho Mde F', 'Guerra FS']",2009,75,3,Braz J Otorhinolaryngol,"Pontes ZB, et al.

19592181,"PCR-AGE, automated and manual methods to identify Candida strains from veterinary sources: a comparative approach.","The increasing incidence of candidiasis has drawn the attention of scientists and clinicians attempting to improve methods of studying Candida yeasts. PCR amplification followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-AGE) and the manual method (morphological characteristics, biochemical profiles and culturing on CHROMagar-Candida) and VITEK 2 automated method were used to test a total of 30 fungal strains from dog sources. The strains were obtained from cases of dermatitis, otitis externa and from the ears, oral mucosa, vaginal mucosa, prepuce and perianal region of clinically normal dogs. After identification as Candida yeasts by the manual method, the strains were analyzed using both VITEK and PCR-AGE methods. Isolates of C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, C. krusei ATCC 6258 and C. albicans ATCC 10231 were included as controls. The universal primers ITS1, ITS3 and ITS4 were used in two independent PCR reactions. Of 30 yeast isolates, 3 isolates (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C. rugosa and C. parapsilosis) that were incompletely identified by the manual method were identified with the PCR-AGE and VITEK methods. The results revealed a 96.7% and 86.7% concurrent identification between the PCR-AGE and VITEK methods versus the manual method, respectively. PCR-AGE showed a greater level of concordance with the manual method, besides being faster and more sensitive than the other methods examined, and is therefore indicated for routine diagnostic testing of Candida spp. strains from veterinary sources.","['Brito EH', 'Brilhante RS', 'Cordeiro RA', 'Sidrim JJ', 'Fontenelle RO', 'Melo LM', 'Albuquerque ES', 'Rocha MF']",2009,139,3-4,Vet Microbiol,"Brito EH, et al.

19591696,Audit of frequent attendees to an ENT emergency clinic.,"OBJECTIVE: To audit the number of patients attending an ENT emergency clinic more than twice in the same clinical episode.
METHOD: A completed audit cycle. The inclusion criterion for the retrospective arm was patients who had attended the ENT emergency clinic more than twice between 1 September to 30 November 2007. Data were analysed and interventions implemented. The re-audit, using the same inclusion criteria, was done between 1 March to 31 May 2008.
RESULTS: The initial audit found that 38 patients were seen more than twice in the ENT emergency clinic, giving rise to 81 'excess' clinic appointments. After intervention, the re-audit identified 19 patients who were seen more than twice in the ENT emergency clinic, giving rise to 24 'excess' clinic appointments.
CONCLUSION: By insisting that patients seen more than twice in the ENT emergency clinic were reviewed by a senior clinician, and by introducing a management guideline for acute otitis externa, we reduced excess clinic appointments by 70 per cent.","['Fishpool SJ', 'Stanton E', 'Chawishly EK', 'Hicklin LA']",2009,123,11,J Laryngol Otol,"Fishpool SJ, et al.

DESIGN: Retrospective data collection from published literature, and binary logistic regression analysis of the effect on outcome of identified signs and symptoms.
RESULTS: Six factors were identified as prognostic of a poorer outcome, including facial nerve involvement, additional cranial nerve involvement, non-cranial nerve neurological involvement, extensive granulations (or oedema) in the external auditory canal, bilateral symptoms and aspergillus species as the causative organism. A four-point scoring model based on these findings is presented.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel, systematic method of data analysis was utilised to construct a prognostic scoring model for necrotising otitis externa.

19545461,Gustatory otorrhoea: a rare case of congenital external ear salivary fistula.,"OBJECTIVE: We present an extremely rare case of a 44-year-old woman with right gustatory otorrhoea and otalgia.
CASE REPORT: The patient had been initially treated for otitis externa after Pseudomonas aeruginosa was grown from a microbiological swab. The otorrhoea fluid was collected and tested positive for amylase. Sialography and computed tomography imaging of the temporal bone confirmed a sialo-aural fistula from the right parotid gland to the bony external acoustic meatus. The defect was consistent with a patent foramen of Huschke. The fistula was identified surgically via a superficial parotidectomy approach, after contrast injection of Bonney's blue dye into the parotid duct, and then ligated and divided. The patient had immediate and sustained resolution of her otorrhoea.
CONCLUSIONS: Sialo-aural fistulae are extremely rare, and usually arise as a complication of surgery or as an acquired disease process. To date, only four cases have been reported. This case demonstrates the use of sensitive investigation involving sialography and computed tomography, as well as successful surgical management, with complete resolution of symptoms.","['De Zoysa N', 'Vasani S', 'Kaniyur S', 'Frosh A']",2009,123,12,J Laryngol Otol,"De Zoysa N, et al.

Recognition of this condition as different from malignant necrotizing otitis externa (MNOE) and carcinoma of the external ear is important because its treatment is very different. The best choice of treatment for BNOE is not clear because both long-term medical therapy and surgery have been advocated as first-line treatments.

19505383,In vitro evaluation of the synergistic activity of neomycin-polymyxin B association against pathogens responsible for otitis externa.,"The most recent guidelines recommend, for otitis externa antibiotic therapy, the use of topical formulations in that they are very safe, have a quicker effect and do not induce bacterial resistance compared to systemic therapy. The choice of the class of antibiotics in empiric therapy of otitis externa must take into consideration the polymicrobic nature of the infection that includes both bacteria (Grampositive and Gram-negative) and mycetes. For this reason, in this study we evaluated the synergic activity of neomycin in association with polymyxin B against the pathogens commonly responsible for otitis externa, compared to that of a single antibiotic (ciprofloxacin). The polymyxinB/neomycin association shows clear synergic effects with values of both Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) reduced by 3-4 times with respect to the single antibiotic; and in P. aeruginosa the synergistic effect of the neomycin/polymyxin B association with respect to neomycin was more evident (5-6 times), with an intrinsic in vitro activity constantly higher than that of ciprofloxacin alone or in association with hydrocortisone. From the analysis of the data obtained in vitro, we can conclude that the possibility of using a topical formulation containing a synergistic association of antibiotics, such as neomycin-polymyxin B, in such a way as to obtain the maximum effect in the minimum time with an increase in the spectrum of action of non-bacterial pathogens, is an optimal choice for the clinician for the empiric therapy of otitis externa.","['Tempera G', 'Mangiafico A', 'Genovese C', 'Giudice E', 'Mastrojeni S', 'Nicolosi D', 'Ferneri PM']",2009,22,2,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,"Tempera G, et al.

RESULTS: A total 26 patients with a mean age of 63.7+/-10.2 years were included. All had a history of DM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.2%), and fungus (15.4%) were most frequently found in pus cultures. Cranial nerves were involved in 11 patients: the facial nerve was most frequently (38.46%) involved. Complications such as osteomyelitis (11 patients) and intracranial involvement (3 patients) were noted in this series. Mastoidectomy was performed in 12 patients. A total of five patients died.","['Chen CN', 'Chen YS', 'Yeh TH', 'Hsu CJ', 'Tseng FY']",2010,130,1,Acta Otolaryngol,"Chen CN, et al. Outcomes of malignant external otitis: survival vs mortality.

19430186,[A study of otitis externa associated with Malassezia].,"Malassezia-positive smears can be recognized from otitis externa, however, there are few references in the literature to the relation between Malassezia and otitis externa. Therefore, the bacterial and clinical characteristics of 72 cases (63 patients) with otitis externa were investigated at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Takinomiya General Hospital to analyze this. Thirty-seven cases were bacterial otitis externa, 20 cases were fungal otitis externa, and 15 cases were etiological agents unknown in this study. The causative organisms in fungal otitis externa were the genera Aspergillus (10 cases), Malassezia (5) and Candida (5), respectively. We suspected that 5 cases were caused by Malassezia because Malassezia cell counts were greater than 10 per field (x 400), and a large number of Malassezia were isolated from all cases. In these cases, many squamous epithelial cells were observed by direct examination, and cells from the middle or basal layer of the ear canal were also recognized in three cases. Therefore, accelerated turnover of epidermal cells of the ear canal was suggested. The main symptoms were itching and fullness in the ear, with observations of redness and erosion in objective deterioration, and we felt that these conditions were similar to seborrheic dermatitis (SD). In addition, these five cases were confirmed as fungus-related otitis externa by their improvement with antifungal agents.","['Shiota R', 'Kaneko T', 'Yano H', 'Takeshita K', 'Nishioka K', 'Makimura K']",2009,50,2,Nihon Ishinkin Gakkai Zasshi,"Shiota R, et al.

19416607,"The potential role of primary care in the management of common ear, nose or throat disorders presenting to the emergency department in Greece.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of common ear, nose or throat (ENT) conditions presenting to emergency departments that could be managed by a primary healthcare system Method: Between January 2001 and January 2006 a total of 33 792 patients attended the ENT emergency department of one hospital. All cases were included in this retrospective study. The registry of ENT emergency department was analysed; age, sex and clinical diagnosis were tabulated. All patients were evaluated by a specialist. Classification of the cases was based on the main symptom seeking care.
RESULTS: A total of 33 792 patients visited the otorhinolaryngology emergency department. Of these, 17 775 patients (52.6%) were men and 16 017 (47.4%) were women. Over 40% of the cases were classified in eight major groups of diagnosis. Acute tonsillitis (12.5%) and acute pharyngitis (11.4%) followed by acute otitis externa (5.9%) were the most common causes of all ENT emergency department visits. The admission rate was 1.2 % and only 0.6% (84) of patients were referred to other specialties.
CONCLUSION: Most common ENT disorders presenting to the emergency department in Greece could be managed at the level of primary health care.

19386217,Allergic contact dermatitis to antibacterial agents.,"Topical antibiotics are frequently introduced in therapy by various specialists, e.g., dermatologists-venereologists, ENT specialists, proctologists, ophthalmologists, and others. In dermatology, topical antibiotics are used in the treatment of superficial inflammatory skin lesions, acne and rosacea. These agents are also used in the prevention of inflammatory lesions after surgical and corrective procedures. Long-term and uncontrolled application of topical antibiotics, on the skin with impaired protective barrier in particular, implies a risk for the development of hypersensitivity to these agents. Considering the very wide utilization of these agents, hypersensitivity to topical antibiotics poses a major problem worldwide. The groups at a high risk of contact sensitivity to topical antibiotics include patients with chronic venous insufficiency, chronic ulcers and chronic otitis externa, as well as individuals at occupational exposure to antibiotics, e.g., human medicine and veterinary medicine professionals, pharmaceutical industry workers, cattle breeders, etc. When long-term therapy fails to result in improvement in the above mentioned chronic states, the possibility of allergic reactions to topical agents should be taken in consideration. Cross-sensitivity, which is frequently associated with the use of topical aminoglycoside antibiotics, poses a significant problem.","['Gorgievska Sukarovska B', 'Turcić P', 'Marasović D', 'Lipozencić J']",2009,17,1,Acta Dermatovenerol Croat,"Gorgievska Sukarovska B, et al.

METHOD: We present a case report and a review of the world literature concerning osteomyelitis of the temporal bone secondary to malignant otitis externa.
RESULTS: A 60-year-old diabetic man developed osteomyelitis of the temporal bone and a temporoparietal abscess as advanced complications of malignant otitis externa. He was successfully treated in our institution using a post aural incision after draining the abscess and excising the fistula, a modified radical mastoidectomy with canal wall down procedure with sequesterectomy and debridement of surrounding area done.
CONCLUSION: The terms 'osteomyelitis of the temporal bone', 'skull base osteomyelitis' and 'malignant otitis externa' have not been clearly defined, and have in the past often been used interchangeably in the literature. Osteomyelitis of the temporal bone can occur secondary to malignant otitis externa, acute otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media or trauma.

Clinical guidelines exist for the management of this condition. This study explores the pattern of causative pathogens and management of AOE by general practitioners in North Queensland.
METHODS: Eight general practices in three regional cities of North Queensland participated in the study. The three components were: a retrospective case audit of AOE management, a survey of GPs' self reported usual management, and collection of clinical data and microbiological specimens from new cases.
RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common causative pathogen in all regions, GPs correctly identified the most common pathogens, there was variation in the use of oral antibiotics between regions (15.8-36.6%), ear syringing is commonly used in managing AOE (51.3%), and most patients (68.9%) required only one GP appointment.
DISCUSSION: General practitioners have good knowledge of the causative pathogens for AOE in their region. While clinical guidelines are generally followed, there is some variation in the prescription of oral antibiotics and use of ear syringing in managing this condition.","['Cheffins T', 'Heal C', 'Rudolphy S']",2009,38,4,Aust Fam Physician,"Cheffins T, et al.

19327936,Lemierre syndrome complicating otitis externa: case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, known as Lemierre syndrome, is a rare disorder usually caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, a Gram-negative anaerobic organism that normally inhabits the oropharynx. Lemierre syndrome usually follows primary oropharyngeal infections and affects previously healthy adolescents and young adults in a characteristic manner, often with fatal results if left untreated. There have been a significantly increasing number of reported cases of Lemierre syndrome, possibly reflecting the trend to withhold antibiotics for initially uncomplicated oropharyngeal infections.
OBJECTIVES: We hope to alert the reader to a potentially fatal disease process that has recently been increasingly identified, by reporting a unique manifestation of Lemierre syndrome, and by reviewing the current literature.
CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with a chief complaint of fever, ear pain, and generalized weakness. She was noted to be in septic shock, with left neck erythema and swelling. A computed tomography scan showed thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein (IJV), which was later excised. She recovered after a course of intravenous and oral antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: Septic thrombophlebitis of the IJV is associated with multiple sources and organisms. This case is unique in both the organism (Peptococcus anaerobius) and the source (otitis externa). This disease process must be identified early and aggressively treated to avoid significant morbidity and mortality.","['Hile LM', 'Gibbons MD', 'Hile DC']",2012,42,4,J Emerg Med,"Hile LM, et al.

19318887,Current bacteriology of suppurative otitis: resistant patterns and outcomes analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic resistance has complicated the management of the draining ear. In this study, we examine the factors predisposing to resistance, as well as the role culture played in the management of these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with a complaint of otorrhea during a 3-year period. Demographic factors, the patients diagnosis, previous antimicrobial use, the organism isolated, the resistance pattern of the organism, the treatment instituted, the treatment changed, and the efficacy of treatment were all examined.
RESULTS: Previous antibiotic use resulted in a significantly increased rate of resistance only for the diagnosis of otitis externa (p = 0.01). No other factors were found to be clinically significant. The previous use of ototopical quinolones was shown to be correlated with a significant increase in quinolone resistance (p = 0.01). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated was shown to have 60% and 33% resistance rates to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively. The overall treatment failure rate was 36% but rose to 50% for infections involving highly resistant bacteria (p = 0.01). Treatment was changed based on culture results in 21% of cases.
CONCLUSION: Previous antibiotic use is correlated with increased bacterial resistance in the case of otitis externa. Highly resistant bacteria were associated with an increased rate of treatment failure. Culture plays an essential role in the management of refractory otorrhea.","['Saunders JE', 'Raju RP', 'Boone J', 'Berryhill W']",2009,30,3,Otol Neurotol,"Saunders JE, et al.

19192973,Differences in bacteriologic treatment failures in acute otitis externa between ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone and neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone: results of a combined analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment failure rates for the two major acute otitis externa (AOE) pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, by topical therapy with ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (CDex) or neomycin 0.35%/polymyxin B 10,000 IU/mL/hydrocortisone 1% (Cort) based on clinical and microbiological failure in patients positive for these pathogens at baseline.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A combined analysis was conducted from two similar, but non-identical clinical trials involving CDex vs. Cort. Outcomes of the combined efficacy analysis were treatment failure rates and antibiotic susceptibility values for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The raw data for the treatment failure rates from the two studies were combined to calculate the overall treatment failure rates of each treatment group. Chi-square tests of independence were conducted to assess differences in treatment failure rates between treatment groups.
RESULTS: Of the 789 patients with culture-positive ears prior to the initiation of therapy, 61.0% (n = 481) were positive for P. aeruginosa and 8.9% (n = 70) were positive for S. aureus. While treatment failure rates for S. aureus were similar for the two therapies, CDex had a significantly lower treatment failure rate than Cort (5.1 vs. 13.0%; p = 0.0044) for P. aeruginosa. All of the persisting P. aeruginosa and S. aureus isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones and neomycin/polymyxin B.
LIMITATIONS: The analysis strength is dependent on pooled data from similar studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Ototopical ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% more effectively eradicates P. aeruginosa compared to Cort. Eradication of S. aureus by either drug was similar. These results favor CDex as a better first-line choice in the treatment of AOE compared to Cort.","['Dohar JE', 'Roland P', 'Wall GM', 'McLean C', 'Stroman DW']",2009,25,2,Curr Med Res Opin,"Dohar JE, et al.

19152587,Plasma and ear tissue concentrations of enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin in dogs with chronic end-stage otitis externa after intravenous administration of enrofloxacin.,"The purpose of this study was to measure the concentrations of enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin following intravenous administration of enrofloxacin in the plasma and ear tissue of dogs with chronic end-stage otitis undergoing a total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy. The goals were to determine the relationship between the dose of enrofloxacin and the concentrations of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and determine appropriate doses of enrofloxacin for treatment of chronic otitis externa and media. Thirty dogs were randomized to an enrofloxacin-treatment group (5, 10, 15 or 20 mg kg(-1)) or control group (no enrofloxacin). After surgical removal, ear tissue samples (skin, vertical ear canal, horizontal ear canal, middle ear) and a blood sample were collected. Concentrations of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the plasma and ear tissue were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Repeated measures models were applied to log-transformed data to assess dosing trends and Pearson correlations were calculated to assess concentration associations. Ear tissue concentrations of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than plasma concentrations. Each 5 mg kg(-1 )increase in the dose of enrofloxacin resulted in a 72% and 37% increase in enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin concentrations, respectively. For bacteria with an minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.12-0.15 or less, 0.19-0.24, 0.31-0.39 and 0.51-0.64 microg mL(-1), enrofloxacin should be dosed at 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg kg(-1), respectively.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series.
ANIMALS: Dogs (n=20) with aural cholesteatoma.
METHODS: Case review (1998-2007).
RESULTS: Twenty dogs were identified. Clinical signs other than those of chronic otitis externa included head tilt (6 dogs), unilateral facial palsy (4), pain on opening or inability to open the mouth (4), and ataxia (3). Computed tomography (CT) was performed in 19 dogs, abnormalities included osteoproliferation (13 dogs), lysis of the bulla (12), expansion of the bulla (11), bone lysis in the squamous or petrosal portion of the temporal bone (4) and enlargement of associated lymph nodes (7). Nineteen dogs had total ear canal ablation-lateral bulla osteotomy or ventral bulla osteotomy with the intent to cure; 9 dogs had no further signs of middle ear disease whereas 10 had persistent or recurrent clinical signs. Risk factors for recurrence after surgery were inability to open the mouth or neurologic signs on admission and lysis of any portion of the temporal bone on CT imaging. Dogs admitted with neurologic signs or inability to open the mouth had a median survival of 16 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical treatment of aural cholesteatoma may be curative. Recurrence after surgery is associated with advanced disease, typically indicated by inability to open the jaw, neurologic disease, or bone lysis on CT imaging.

The invasive process may lead to skull base osteomyelitis with progressive cranial nerve palsies and can result in irreversible hearing and neurological impairment. We report two cases of Aspergillus IOE treated with voriconazole alone and a literature review of antifungal therapy of Aspergillus IOE. Twenty-five patients, including the two described in the present report, were analyzed. Eighteen patients were treated with amphotericin B, and nine of them received itraconazole as an additional agent. Three patients received initial therapy with itraconazole, and one patient was treated with both voriconazole and caspofungin therapy. The two patients in the present report received voriconazole therapy alone with good clinical and biological tolerance despite prolonged treatment. The last patient did not receive antifungal therapy, as the diagnosis was made postmortem. Eighteen patients underwent an initial extensive surgical debridement. The majority of the patients had a favorable outcome, 17 patients experienced a complete recovery, and 6 showed a partial improvement. Both of the patients reported on here had favorable outcomes, and no aggressive surgical debridement was required. Although voriconazole has been shown to be effective for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, its precise role in the management of Aspergillus IOE had not been documented. These observations demonstrate that voriconazole could be an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for the management of Aspergillus IOE.","['Parize P', 'Chandesris MO', 'Lanternier F', 'Poirée S', 'Viard JP', 'Bienvenu B', 'Mimoun M', 'Méchai F', 'Mamzer MF', 'Herman P', 'Bougnoux ME', 'Lecuit M', 'Lortholary O']",2009,53,3,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Parize P, et al.

Onychomycosis, oral candidiasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis are observed frequently in diabetic patients. Urinary tract candidiasis in diabetic patients frequently develops into systemic candidiasis and fungus ball formation in the kidney. An estimated 50-75% of cases of rhinocerebral mucomycosis occur in diabetic patients, and ketoacidosis is thought to be the most likely predisposing factor. Invasive otitis externa is almost exclusively found in diabetic patients, and generally caused by Pseudomonas. This has been described secondary to Aspergillus in diabetic patients. Regarding cryptococcosis in non-AIDS patients, approximately 10 to 20% of these patients have diabetes. Clinicians must be aware of mycotic infection in diabetic patients with infectious disease.",['Higa M'],2008,66,12,Nihon Rinsho,Higa M. [Clinical epidemiology of fungal infection in diabetes].

19055612,Comparative in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of commercial ear cleaners.,"The aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial efficacy of ear cleaners against Staphylococcus intermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Malassezia pachydermatis. Single isolates of each organism were incubated in duplicate at 38 degrees C for 30 min with each ear cleaner diluted 1/2 to 1/256 in phosphate-buffered saline. Positive and negative controls were included. Aliquots were then incubated for 16-18 h on sheep blood agar (bacteria) or for 3 days on Sabouraud's dextrose agar (Malassezia) at 38 degrees C. The lowest dilutions exhibiting 100% antimicrobial efficacy for S. intermedius were: Cleanaural Dog 1/32; Sancerum 1/16; Otoclean 1/4; EpiOtic 1/2; MalAcetic 1/2; and Triz Plus 1/2. The results for P. aeruginosa were Sancerum and Triz Plus 1/16; Cleanaural Dog and EpiOtic 1/8; Otoclean 1/4; and MalAcetic 1/2. Results for M. pachydermatis were: Cleanaural Dog 1/32; Sancerum, Otoclean, EpiOtic and Triz Plus 1/8; and MalAcetic 1/4. Cleanaural Cat, MalAcetic HC and Triz EDTA did not display any antimicrobial activity at any dilution. Antimicrobial activity appeared to be associated with the presence of isopropyl alcohol, parachlorometaxylenol and a low pH. The results of this study may help clinicians make evidence-based decisions when selecting ear cleaners for use in individual cases.","['Swinney A', 'Fazakerley J', 'McEwan N', 'Nuttall T']",2008,19,6,Vet Dermatol,"Swinney A, et al.

19032135,Comparison of efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin otic solution 0.2% versus polymyxin B-neomycin-hydrocortisone in the treatment of acute diffuse otitis externa*.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin otic solution 0.2% to polymyxin B-neomycin-hydrocortisone (PNH) otic solution in the treatment of acute diffuse otitis externa in children, adolescents, and adults.
METHODS: This was a randomized, parallel-group, evaluator-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, noninferiority study. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure of otitis symptoms at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit. Clinical cure at the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit and percentages of patients with clinical improvement and resolution and/or improvement of otalgia at EOT and TOC visits were secondary efficacy endpoints.
RESULTS: A total of 630 patients were randomized to ciprofloxacin twice daily (n = 318) or PNH 3 times daily (n = 312) for 7 days. Ciprofloxacin was shown to be noninferior to PNH. The percentage of patients with clinical cure at the TOC visit was 86.6% with ciprofloxacin and 81.1% with PNH; the treatment difference was 5.6% in favor of ciprofloxacin (95% CI: -0.9 to 12.1). At the EOT visit, clinical cure was achieved in 70.0% and 60.5% of patients, respectively, with a treatment difference in favor of ciprofloxacin (9.5%, 95 CI: 1.2 to 17.9). In all secondary efficacy variables, ciprofloxacin and PNH showed similar results, including pain duration and resolution. The clinical cure rate for patients with baseline cultures showing P. aeruginosa was 87.5% in the ciprofloxacin group and 78.6% in the PNH group, a treatment difference of 8.9% in favor of ciprofloxacin (95% CI: 0.6 to 17.3); for patients with baseline cultures showing S. aureus, the clinical cure rate was 72.7% for the ciprofloxacin group and 75.9% for the PNH group (treatment difference of 3.1% in favor of PNH, 95% CI: -21.1% to 27.4%). Most adverse events were mild and unrelated to study medication in both treatment groups. A limitation of this study is the assessment of signs and symptoms at baseline and after treatment, which does not provide data to evaluate the interim response.
CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin otic solution 0.2% was found to be noninferior to PNH. This efficacy, good tolerability, and ease of administration make ciprofloxacin otic solution 0.2% without a topical steroid an attractive option for the treatment of acute otitis externa.","['Drehobl M', 'Guerrero JL', 'Lacarte PR', 'Goldstein G', 'Mata FS', 'Luber S']",2008,24,12,Curr Med Res Opin,"Drehobl M, et al.

The exudates of both external ears were obtained, using sterile swabs, and microorganisms were isolated according to standard microbiological techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus intermedius was done by the agar diffusion method. There was bacterial and/or fungal growth in all of the samples. These were all polymicrobial infections. Anaerobic bacteria were not isolated in any sample. The most common pathogens isolated were S. intermedius and Malassezia pachydermatis. A statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed in the isolation pattern between the right and left ears in 34 of the 50 animals (68%). High resistance rates of S. intermedius strains to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin were found. The results suggest that in bilateral canine otitis externa, each ear should be cultured separately and considered as separate units.","['Oliveira LC', 'Leite CA', 'Brilhante RS', 'Carvalho CB']",2008,49,8,Can Vet J,"Oliveira LC, et al.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Quality improvement study.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Convenience sampling (N = 84) was performed at five sites of ENT and Allergy Associates, LLC.
RESULTS: Physicians reported prescribing topical antibiotic preparations and assessing for auricular or periauricular pain in 98% of acute otitis externa cases (N = 55). In addition, 87% did not prescribe systemic antimicrobials. Pneumatic otoscopy was used by 76% of physicians as a method for otitis media with effusion diagnosis and 10% administered a hearing test within 6 months before tympanostomy tube placement (N = 29). Furthermore, as recommended, 86% did not prescribe decongestants or antihistamines whereas 93% and 90% did not prescribe antimicrobials or systemic steroids, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although compliance in this study was generally high across both measure sets, actual use of the face sheet forms for appropriate patients was lower than the 80% reporting mandate by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that allows physicians to receive the monetary bonus. Incentive-based reporting should be continuously investigated to assess challenges for evaluating current measures.","['Patel MM', 'Eisenberg L', 'Witsell D', 'Schulz KA']",2008,139,4,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Patel MM, et al.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to isolate, identify and determine the Antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms causing otitis externa (OE).
METHODS: Twenty-seven swabs were taken from the ears of 27 patients with OE for culture and 22 microorganisms were isolate to evaluate sensitivity. In vitro susceptibility tests were performed by agar diffusion disk and results were interpreted according to Clinical Laboratory Standards.
RESULTS: 10 Ear cultures were positive for S. aureus , 8 for P. aeruginosa, 5 for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and 4 for fungal organisms (Candida albicans e C. Krusei). Gentamicin and quinolones were active against all bacteria tested and significant resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate was observed. The tested species of Candida had been sensitive to amphothericin B, nystatin, fluconazole and clotrimazole and resistant to miconazole.
CONCLUSION: Acute external otitis is a polymicrobial infection and proper knowledge regarding microorganism etiology and susceptibility will contribute to rational antibiotic usage and treatment success.","['Nogueira JC', 'Melo Diniz Mde F', 'Lima EO', 'Lima ZN']",2008,74,4,Braz J Otorhinolaryngol,"Nogueira JC, et al.

OE can be accompanied not only by relatively slight pain and light swelling of the skin of the auditory canal, but also by severe pain, complete obstruction of the external meatus and retroauricular swelling. An uncomplicated infection can normally be treated by cleaning of the meatus by an ENT specialist and local application of a broad-spectrum antibiotic or an antiseptic supplemented with corticoids as well as antimycotics.

METHODS: A questionnaire was presented to 800 owners of dogs or cats who visited one of the four participating clinics in Finland in February 2006.
RESULTS: A total of 482 owners completed the questionnaire (60.3 per cent response rate); 90 per cent of the respondents were female. Owners classified surgical procedures (for example, fracture repair, skin tumour removal and neutering) as more painful than medical conditions (otitis externa and lameness). In addition, owners disagreed most with statements that they had received sufficient information on the appropriate methods of management of animal pain and that the recognition of animal pain is easy. With respect to surgical procedures, owners expressed greatest concern in relation to the animal experiencing fear or anxiety during hospitalisation and the presence of postoperative pain.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The animal owners had concerns about the presence and management of animal pain, fear and anxiety. Knowledge of these animal owner opinions could aid veterinary practitioners when communicating with their clients on medical and surgical patient management. Furthermore, studies are merited to clearly define how best to successfully respond to these owner attitudes.","['Väisänen MA', 'Tuomikoski-Alin SK', 'Brodbelt DC', 'Vainio OM']",2008,49,12,J Small Anim Pract,"Väisänen MA, et al.

18769078,Occupational health in small scale and household industries in Nepal: a situation analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Making working conditions safe and healthy is the interest of workers, employers and the Government.Although it seems simple and obvious, this idea has not yet gained meaningful recognition in Nepal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in ten small scale industries of Kathmandu valley. Altogether 545 questionnaires on socioeconomic and occupational history were filled up. Similarly, Workplace Occupational Health Assessment was done in all ten industries. A thorough medical examination of 135 child workers was done using a structured questionnaire to find out the health effects due to occupational hazards.
RESULTS: Out of the total 545 workers present in the industries under study, 135 (24.8%) were child workers. Higher proportion of child workers (97%) was illiterate compared to 3% of children with primary level education. Among the child workers, 23 (17%) were girls. The majority of the child labourers were suffering from conditions like otitis externa, otitis media, scabies, anaemia, upper respiratory diseases, nasal problems, abdominal pain etc.
CONCLUSION: The occupational health and safety practices in small scale industries in Kathmandu have been found to be unsatisfactory. Child labour is a serious problem. Out of ten industries, six have employed child workers and the working conditions range from bad to terrible. Health and welfare of the child workers was also not satisfactory.","['Joshi SK', 'Dahal P']",2008,6,2,Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),Joshi SK and Dahal P.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerumen samples were collected from 75 normal, healthy subjects aged from seven to 80 years, without ear pathology, who attended the ear, nose and throat out-patient clinic of the University Malaya Medical Center from May 2006 to October 2006. Of these 75 samples, 31 had no growth when cultured on nutrient agar. Inhibition studies on these 31 samples were performed for Staphylococcus aureus (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 25923), Esherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Candida albicans. Nutrient agar was used to conserve all three bacterial strains and Sabouraud dextrose agar was used for Candida albicans.
RESULTS: A decrease in Staphylococcus aureus growth was observed for 27 of the 31 samples. All 31 samples induced decreased growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while 29 induced decreased growth of Candida albicans. However, only four samples induced decreased growth of Escherichia coli.

Recognition and control of the predisposing factors are therefore key factors for successful therapy and prevention of recurrent infections. Currently, Malassezia dermatitis/otitis is managed by the use of antifungal drugs. Systemic therapy is often necessary, in particular when clinical signs are severe and widespread. Ketoconazole and Itraconazole are the most commonly used drugs. Topical therapy is an alternative in case of localized lesions and external ear localizations. Different commercial formulations, available in clinical practice in form of creams, gels, lotions, sprays and ear drops are often used as adiuvants to systemic therapy. Topicals more frequently used are represented by imidazolic antifungals, chlorhexydine and lime sulphur. The presentation deals with more recent advances about the protocols for treatment of Malassezia-related diseases in the dog. New perspectives, as the use of natural compounds, immunotherapy and inhibitors of yeast adherence factors, are also discussed.","['Peano A', 'Gallo MG']",2008,50,1-2,Parassitologia,Peano A and Gallo MG.

18673325,In vitro photodynamic eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in planktonic and biofilm culture.,"Photodynamic disinfection (PDD) is a nonantibiotic approach to treating drug-resistant bacterial infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, is problematic because of its propensity to develop antibiotic resistance and its ability to secrete a protective biofilm matrix. This study examined the ability of PDD to eradicate planktonic and biofilm cultures of P. aeruginosa in vitro. Planktonic P. aeruginosa cultures were briefly exposed to a methylene blue-based photosensitizer formulation and subjected to energy doses ranging from 1.7 to 20.6 J cm(-2) using a 670 nm nonthermal diode laser. Biofilms were grown for 24 and 48 h and exposed to photosensitizer for 30 s before illumination with 13.2 or 26.4 J of energy. A single exposure of planktonic P. aeruginosa to photosensitizer at >15.5 J cm(-2) resulted in 100% eradication (>7 log(10) reduction from control), an effect that could be decreased significantly in the presence of the singlet oxygen quenchers l-tryptophan and sodium azide. Decreasing the energy dose below this threshold by varying both power density and illumination duration resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in bacterial kill. In addition, 24 h biofilm viability was reduced by 99% with single exposure and 99.9% with double exposure, while 48 h biofilm viability was reduced by >99.999% with both single and double exposures. This study shows that PDD is effective in eradicating planktonic and biofilm cultures of P. aeruginosa, supporting the concept that translation into clinical practice for indications such as otitis externa and wound disinfection is a viable option.","['Street CN', 'Gibbs A', 'Pedigo L', 'Andersen D', 'Loebel NG']",2009,85,1,Photochem Photobiol,"Street CN, et al.

DESIGN: A special questionnaire was designed and completed by all patients covering personal details, medical history, results of otolaryngological examination and bacteriological and mycological investigations.
SUBJECTS: 249 patients of the Outpatient Department of Laryngology at the Regional Hospital in Bełchatów with symptoms of external otitis. For analysis of relationships between particular signs/symptoms and species/genera of microorganisms, statistical tests were used: chi2 test, chi2 test with Yate's modification, C-Pearson index, and Fisher exact test for very small samples.
RESULTS: There is a statistical dependence between discharge, hearing loss, swelling of skin, scant, dried discharge with fetid odour and bacteria isolated from the external ear canal. Similar dependence exists between pain, hearing loss, no smelly discharge or wet, black plug of fetid odour and fungi. Also there is a statistical dependence between pruritus, red skin and grey, fetid discharge and mixed flora.
CONCLUSIONS: Some of symptoms and signs are connected with definite etiological factors which is important not only for correct diagnosis but also for institution of appropriate and effective treatment.

18606053,Dexamethasone phosphate in antibiotic ear drops for the treatment of acute bacterial otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of polymyxin sulfate 7500 IU/neomycin sulfate 3500 IU/dexamethasone phosphate 0.1% (PN+Dx) otic solution with polymyxin sulfate 7500 IU/neomycin sulfate 3500 IU (PN-Dx) in patients with acute bacterial otitis externa (AOE), in order to determine the possible benefit of the addition of dexamethasone.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Active controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, multi-center clinical trial in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist practices with a planned interim analysis for sample size adaptation. In total, 338 patients aged 18-76 who had a previous episode of otitis externa within the last year were randomized to receive 10 +/- 2 days of treatment with two drops, three times daily, of either PN+Dx or PN-Dx.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in the clinical symptom score (consisting of the subscores redness, swelling, pain, and secretion) and of the visual analogue scale (VAS) rating for pain from Visit 1 (Day 1) to Visit 2 (Day 4 +/- 1), patient's assessment of efficacy at Visit 3 (Day 10 +/- 2), and the frequency and type of adverse events.
RESULTS: There was a significantly greater reduction of swelling from Visit 1 to Visit 2 with PN+Dx, and more patients rated the efficacy of PN+Dx as 'very good' or 'good' at Visit 3 (p = 0.03). There was also a significantly greater decrease in the clinical symptom score from Visit 1 to Visit 2 in the PN+Dx group in patients who had at least a moderately severe symptom score with more than seven points at Visit 1 (p = 0.01) and in patients suffering from their current episode of otitis externa for more than 2 days (p = 0.02). In total, 14 adverse events were reported during the study period with no related adverse drug reactions for PN+Dx.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of dexamethasone phosphate to polymyxin B/neomycin significantly reduces swelling in patients with AOE and leads to significantly higher patient's ratings of treatment efficacy. It especially leads to an overall reduction of symptoms in cases of moderately or more severe otitis externa and cases lasting for more than 2 days.","['Mösges R', 'Schröder T', 'Baues CM', 'Sahin K']",2008,24,8,Curr Med Res Opin,"Mösges R, et al.

18598837,A single topical agent is clinically equivalent to the combination of topical and oral antibiotic treatment for otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate clinical equivalence (statistical noninferiority) of topical ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone (CHC, Cipro HC) and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone (NPH, Cortisporin) with systemic amoxicillin (AMX, Amoxil), for treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).
DESIGN: Randomized, active-control, observer-blind, multicenter trial.
PATIENTS: Altogether, 206 patients were enrolled (CHC, 106; NPH + AMX, 100). Patients were > or =1 year of age, had AOE >2 days with at least mild symptoms, and gave informed consent. All were evaluable for safety, and 151 were evaluable for efficacy.
INTERVENTIONS: Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone 3 drops twice daily for 7 days (adults and children) or NPH 4 drops (adults) or 2 drops (children) with AMX 250 mg (adults and children) 3 times daily for 10 days, as directed in approved product labeling.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy 7 days after treatment ended (test of cure). Secondary variables included time to end of pain, symptom scores (otalgia and tenderness) and microbiological eradication. Noninferiority was declared if the lower confidence limit around the measurement difference was above -10 (nearer zero).
RESULTS: Response to therapy was higher for CHC (95.71% vs 89.83%) but was statistically noninferior (lower confidence limit, -4.98) to NPH + AMX. Median time to end of pain was 6 days for both groups. Noninferiority was declared for symptom scores at all measurement periods and for microbiological eradication. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone is clinically equivalent to NPH + AMX for the treatment of AOE in adults and children. However, low systemic exposure, absence of ototoxicity, and less frequent dosing clearly favor Cipro HC.","['Roland PS', 'Belcher BP', 'Bettis R', 'Makabale RL', 'Conroy PJ', 'Wall GM', 'Dupre S', 'Potts S', 'Hogg G', 'Weber K', 'Cipro HC Study Group']",2008,29,4,Am J Otolaryngol,"Roland PS, et al.

A double-blind randomised controlled trial was performed from February 2003 to April 2005 in an otolaryngology emergency clinic (acute urban teaching hospital) in the United Kingdom. Patients were followed up for 2 weeks. Forty-five adults with otitis externa based on the presence of oedema, discharge or debris in the outer ear canal were recruited. The patients were randomised to one of the two treatment groups, namely using betamethasone sodium phosphate 0.1% (Vista-Methasone) or betamethasone sodium phosphate 0.1% with neomycin sulphate 0.5% (Vista-Methasone N), and were instructed to use the trial medication at three drops three times a day for 2 weeks. Subjects' visual analogue symptom scores (blockage, pain, discharge, and itching) for otitis externa pre-treatment (day 0) and post-treatment (day 15), percentage changes in visual analogue symptom scores as a result of treatment, proportion of patients whose symptom scores failed to improve or deteriorated on treatment were analysed. The two experimental arms demonstrated statistically similar presenting symptom scores at recruitment (mean symptom scores of 19.2 for betamethasone group and 28.7 for betamethasone-neomycin group). The mean symptom score change in response to treatment was 82.8 and 47.8% in the betamethasone-neomycin and betamethasone-alone groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in median percentage symptom score change in response to treatment. All patients in the betamethasone-neomycin group showed symptom improvement but in the betamethasone alone group, five patients got worse (Fishers exact, P = 0.05).

18520626,Otogenic cranial base osteomyelitis: a proposed prognosis-based system for disease classification.,"OBJECTIVES: To review the presentation, microbiology, and long-term results of treating otogenic cranial base osteomyelitis to develop a prognosis-based disease classification system.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with otogenic cranial base osteomyelitis treated between 1989 and 2002 were studied. Patient demographics, presentation, pathogens, details of therapy, and disease-specific survival were recorded. Patients were stratified using Technetium-99 single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) at presentation into 4 grades: I, mild uptake; II, focal mastoid/temporal bone uptake not reaching midline; III, petrous temporal bone uptake reaching midline; and IV, uptake crossing midline, involving the contralateral temporal bone. Actuarial analysis was used to identify prognostic factors.
RESULTS: There were 27 men. The average age at presentation was 65 +/- 16 years (range, 19-95 yr). The median age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity score was 5, and 63% of patients were diabetic. The most common presenting symptoms were pain and otorrhea, and 8 patients had cranial nerve neuropathy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacterial pathogen (n = 28; 74%), and 9 patients had fungal or mixed infections. On average, antibiotics were administered for 161 days, and 6 patients had concomitant surgery. The average follow-up was 33 months, and 3-year disease-specific survival was 76%. Univariate predictors of survival were the SPECT grade, fungal/mixed infections, Charlson score, immune compromise, and cranial nerve neuropathy. The only independent predictor of survival on multivariate Cox regression was the SPECT stage at presentation.
CONCLUSION: Cranial base osteomyelitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and requires prolonged treatment. Long-term outcome can be predicted from the initial SPECT scan.","['Lee S', 'Hooper R', 'Fuller A', 'Turlakow A', 'Cousins V', 'Nouraei R']",2008,29,5,Otol Neurotol,"Lee S, et al.

18501018,"Sebaceous adenitis in Swedish dogs, a retrospective study of 104 cases.","BACKGROUND: Sebaceous adenitis (SA) is an uncommon, immune mediated skin disease in dogs. The aim was to retrospectively investigate SA in dogs in Sweden with respect to breed, sex and age distribution. A second aim was to retrospectively compare clinical signs in dogs with generalized SA and to estimate the survival after diagnosis in the English springer spaniel, standard poodle and the akita.
METHODS: In total 34 Swedish veterinarians contributed with 104 clinically and histologically verified SA cases. Breed, gender and age at diagnosis were registered for each case. The degree of clinical signs at time for diagnosis and at follow-up and information about treatments, concurrent diseases and euthanasia were recorded for the springer spaniels, standard poodles and akitas using a standardized questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 104 cases of SA were included; most cases were recorded for the springer spaniel (n = 25), standard poodle (n = 21) and the akita (n = 10). These three breeds, together with the lhasa apso and the chow-chow, were the most common when national registry data from the Swedish Board of Agriculture and Swedish Kennel Club were considered. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.8 years. The proportion of males was 61%. When the springer spaniels, standard poodles and the akitas with generalized signs were compared (n = 51), the spaniels showed significantly more severe clinical signs than the poodles at diagnosis regarding alopecia, seborrhoea, pyoderma and the overall severity of clinical signs. At follow-up, the degree of clinical signs for otitis externa and pyoderma differed significantly between the breeds. The estimated median survival time was 42 months. In dogs where data regarding survival was available at the end of the study (n = 44), SA was reported to be the reason for euthanasia in 14 dogs, whereof 7 within 24 months after diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: The result of this study implicates that the English springer spaniel is a breed predisposed to SA and that it has more severe clinical signs than the standard poodle. A large proportion of the dogs (spaniel, poodle and akita) investigated regarding survival were reported to have been euthanized to great extent due to the disease.","['Hernblad Tevell E', 'Bergvall K', 'Egenvall A']",2008,50,1,Acta Vet Scand,"Hernblad Tevell E, et al.

DESIGN: This in vitro study assessed wick expansion and absorption of drops when different ear drop preparations were applied. Nine commonly used ear drop preparations were tested (Gentisone HC, Sofradex, Otomize, Betnesol, Exocin, Canesten, Locorten-Vioform, EarCalm and ichthammol glycerin) with a standard expandable ear wick.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight, length and width of otowick following exposure to ear drops.
RESULTS: There was a marked difference in the absorption and expansion of the otowick when different drops were used. This corresponded to the aqueous or oil base of each preparation. All aqueous ear drop preparations (i.e. Gentisone HC, Sofradex, Otomize, Betnesol, Exocin and EarCalm) produced similar rates of absorption into, and expansion of, the otowick. The oil-based ear drop preparations (i.e. Canesten, Locorten-Vioform and ichthammol glycerin) failed to expand the wick and showed poor rates of absorption into the wick.

When the ear is not the source of the pain (secondary otalgia), the ear examination is typically normal. The cause of primary otalgia is usually apparent on examination; the most common causes are otitis media and otitis externa. The cause of secondary otalgia is often difficult to determine because the innervation of the ear is complex and there are many potential sources of referred pain. The most common causes are temporomandibular joint syndrome, pharyngitis, dental disease, and cervical spine arthritis. If the diagnosis is not clear from the history and physical examination, options include a trial of symptomatic treatment without a clear diagnosis; imaging studies; and consultation with an otolaryngologist. Patients who smoke, drink alcohol, are older than 50 years, or have diabetes are at higher risk of a cause of ear pain that needs further evaluation. Patients whose history or physical examination increases suspicion for a serious occult cause of ear pain or whose symptoms persist after symptomatic treatment should be considered for further evaluation, such as magnetic resonance imaging, fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement.","['Ely JW', 'Hansen MR', 'Clark EC']",2008,77,5,Am Fam Physician,"Ely JW, et al.

18336426,Investigation of aural bacterial and fungal flora following otitis in captive okapi (Okapia johnstoni).,"Ten cases of otitis in nine captive okapi were observed at a captive zoological institution. Duration of clinical signs ranged from 3 days to 7 months. Two individuals each had a recurrence. A variety of fungi and bacteria were isolated from the aural canals of healthy okapi and their environments. Numerous different bacterial and fungal pathogens were cultured. Surveys investigating the occurrence of ear disease and related environmental factors from 15 other institutions that house okapi revealed otitis was only seen at one institution. While it appears that many bacterial and fungal pathogens are found in the okapi ear canal, it is suspected that environmental conditions, such as fungal load, air and hay quality, humidity, and temperature may be predisposing factors leading to ear infections in this species.","['Allender MC', 'Langan J', 'Citino S']",2008,19,2,Vet Dermatol,"Allender MC, et al.

18324410,The management of otitis externa: a randomised controlled trial of a glycerol and icthammol ribbon gauze versus topical antibiotic and steroid drops.,"We compared the use of glycerol and icthammol (G&I) ribbon gauze versus topical antibiotic and steroid drops in the management of otitis externa. Patients presenting with acute otitis externa were systematically recruited from attendance in the ENT emergency clinic. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, diabetic patients, and those who had been previously treated for otitis externa by the department within the last month. A total of 43 patients were recruited with 48 infected ears, the mean patient age was 47 years, (range 18-80 years). Patients were randomised to either insertion of a G&I ribbon gauze or topical ear drops by means of a ballot with no stratification. All patients were reviewed 5 days later. Patients were asked to comment on their pain using the ten point visual analogue pain score. Oedema of the canal wall, presence of debris and visibility of the tympanic membrane were graded on microscopy. Patient satisfaction and return to work were assessed. There was a statistically significant decrease in the pain score between each visit for the entire group of patients and decrease in canal wall swelling (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between drops and ribbon gauze in terms of pain relief, canal wall oedema, or aural discharge. Following microbiological analysis, 27.8% of bacteria were resistant to neomycin. The cost of treatment with G&I is less than a third of that for topical antibiotic-steroid drops and requires less patient compliance. Patient concerns with the ribbon gauze included its cosmetic appearance and loss of hearing and with drops included frequency of application. We recommend the use of G&I ribbon gauze as first-line treatment, particularly for those who have had allergies to carriers of drops, those that are poorly compliant or with poor manual dexterity, for example patients with rheumatic hands.","['Hornigold R', 'Gillett D', 'Kiverniti E', 'Harries M']",2008,265,10,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Hornigold R, et al.

18317396,Predicting outcome of malignant external otitis.,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant external otitis (MEO) continues to pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The lack of a diagnostic study since 1987 combined with recent findings of quinolone-resistant MEO prompted the present analysis of MEO outcome in a major tertiary medical center.
METHODS: Seventy-five consecutive patients hospitalized for suspected MEO between 1990 and 2003 were divided into 2 diagnostic groups: MEO Type 1, presence of all obligatory clinical and radiologic criteria and most of the occasional criteria of Cohen and Friedman or absence of 1 obligatory criterion with failure of intensive treatment, and MEO Type 2, absence of one of the obligatory criteria with treatment response within 1 week. The groups were compared for demographic data, underlying diseases, ear parameters, culture findings, length of hospitalization, and treatment before hospitalization, obtained from the charts.
RESULTS: Both types of MEO affected mostly diabetic patients and were characterized by granulations and discharge in the external ear, severe prolonged pain, soft tissue involvement and bone destruction on computed tomographic scan, and growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in culture. However, Type 1 MEO was associated with a significantly older patient age at presentation, higher rate of oral antidiabetic treatment, history of diabetic (vascular) complications, computed tomographic findings of nasopharyngeal involvement (soft tissue swelling, soft tissue asymmetry, or abscess formation), bone destruction, and temporomandibular joint involvement-all of which led to significantly longer treatment and shorter survival.
CONCLUSION: The worse prognosis of Type 1 MEO compared with Type 2 should alert clinicians to establish earlier diagnosis and treatment.","['Joshua BZ', 'Sulkes J', 'Raveh E', 'Bishara J', 'Nageris BI']",2008,29,3,Otol Neurotol,"Joshua BZ, et al.

18314283,Microbiology of otitis externa in the secondary care in United Kingdom and antimicrobial sensitivity.,"INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa is one of the most common conditions seen in the otolaryngology clinics. There are no recently published studies that have looked at the causative pathogens of the otitis externa seen in secondary care in the United Kingdom and their antimicrobial sensitivities. We present results of a prospective study to determine the current bacteriology of the condition.
METHODS: Swabs were taken from the external auditory canals of the patients who presented to the otolaryngology emergency clinic with symptoms of otitis externa. These were analysed using microscopy, culture and sensitivity testing in one laboratory. The samples were cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, Sabouraud agar, fastidious anaerobes agar with neomycin and staph/strep agar. Antimicrobial sensitivities of isolated pathogens were tested on iso-sensitest and blood agars using the BSAC disc diffusion template program.
RESULTS: The most commonly identified pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (45.1%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (9%), anaerobes (6.3%), beta haemolytic Streptococcus group G (2.8%), beta haemolytic Streptococcus group A (1.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.7%), methicillin resistant S. aureus (0.7%), Candida species (9.7%), Aspergillus species (4.2%) and Absidia corymbifera (0.7%). One hundred percent resistance of Pseudomonas isolates to neomycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim and amoxicillin was observed while most were sensitive to ciprofloxacin (100%), polymixin B (100%) and gentamicin (98.5%). S. aureus isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and flucloxacillin (100%). 92.3% were sensitive to neomycin and chloramphenicol. Resistance to penicillin and amoxicillin is observed. All isolates anaerobes were sensitive to metronidazole.
CONCLUSION: Polymixin B, gentamicin or ciprofloxacin topical preparations should be used as first line treatment of otitis externa. If the infection does not settle swab results should be used to guide further treatment.","['Ninkovic G', 'Dullo V', 'Saunders NC']",2008,35,4,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Ninkovic G, et al.

18313638,[Fungal necrotizing external otitis].,"OBJECTIVE: Fungal necrotizing otitis externa is rare, although its frequency has increased over the last few years. We report four cases, which to our knowledge make up the largest series published and discuss the main diagnostic problems and the management of this infection.
OBSERVATIONS: Our study investigated two men and two women, all diabetics, aged between 69 and 74 years. All four patients were first treated for bacterial necrotizing otitis externa. Diagnosis was reviewed after a lack of response to antibiotic therapy. Aspergillus flavus and Candida parapsilosis were the fungal agents isolated in each of the two patients. Diagnosis was established based on the pathological specimen for one patient. The last patient was treated without identifying the causal fungus. Two patients developed facial paralysis during disease progression. Treatment was based on intravenous amphotericin B and oral itraconazole. Three patients are now free of disease after a three- to six-month course of antifungal therapy; one patient was not followed up.
CONCLUSION: Fungal necrotizing otitis externa should be suspected in cases where there is no response to antipseudomonal antibiotic therapy. Deep biopsies from the external auditory canal or the mastoid are usually needed to confirm the diagnosis.","['Mani R', 'Belcadhi M', 'Krifa N', 'Abdelkefi M', 'Ben Said M', 'Bouzouita K']",2008,125,1,Ann Otolaryngol Chir Cervicofac,"Mani R, et al.

18297370,Otitis externa: quality of life assessment.,"INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa (OE) is an extremely common dermatological condition that can affect social life and employment, but formal studies of its general health impact are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were two-folded, first to assess the impact of OE on various health determinants as measured by the Finlay's dermatological quality of life index (DLQI) and second to see if there was any difference on quality of life (QoL) of patients with acute and chronic OE.
METHODS: A prospective questionnaire study was carried out. The study included 85 consecutive adult patients with both acute and chronic OE attending the casualty department of a regional otolaryngology unit.
RESULTS: Both groups of patients reported a significantly poor QoL, particularly patients with acute OE, whom were significantly affected by the condition.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that OE has a significant impact on the QoL particularly in patients with acute and chronic OE.","['Ali R', 'Burns P', 'Donnelly M']",2008,177,3,Ir J Med Sci,"Ali R, et al.

18277706,Isolation of Malassezia pachydermatis and M. sympodialis from the external ear canal of cats with and without otitis externa.,"The objective of this study was to determine the presence of Malassezia spp. in the external ear canal of cats with and without otitis. Forty-five animals were studied, 20 with and 25 without otitis externa (OE). Cerumen or secretion from external ear canal samples was cultured on modified Mycosel agar and sterile olive oil was added to the surface of the medium before specimen seeding. The isolates were analysed for macro- and micromorphology and identified by catalase tests and on the basis of growth on Tween 20, 40, 60 and 80. Malassezia spp. were isolated from 15 out of 20 (75%) animals with otitis and from 7 out of 25 (28%) cats without OE; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < or = 0.05). Malassezia pachydermatis and M. sympodialis were isolated from 60% (12/20) and 40% (8/20) of cats with otitis, respectively, with no significant difference in the frequency of isolation between the two species. In the microflora of the healthy ear canal M. pachydermatis was significantly more common (6/25, 24%) than M sympodialis (1/25, 4%). The present investigation confirms that M. sympodialis can also act as an aetiological agent of feline OE, and if commercial veterinary laboratories do not use media with added lipids for the isolation of Malassezia spp., this might lead to false-negative results.","['Dizotti CE', 'Coutinho SD']",2007,55,4,Acta Vet Hung,Dizotti CE and Coutinho SD.

However, data about the lifetime prevalence of these disorders are insufficient. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of ENT disorders in scuba divers correlated with their diving history.
METHODS: The study design was a non-randomized, retrospective, cross-sectional study based on questionnaires. The study population included 429 active divers attending three medical diving symposia.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of highly experienced divers (mean of logged dives m= 670.0) with a high diving certification level. Otitis externa was the most frequent disorder (43.6%). Barotrauma of the sinuses (10.9%), alternobaric vertigo (9.0%) and barotrauma of the middle ear (8.7%) played an important role as well. In contrast, inner ear barotrauma and decompression illness of the inner ear were less frequent but not rare (1.7 % each).

19450296,Otitis externa.,"INTRODUCTION: Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, people with absence of ear wax or with narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.
METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical and prophylactic treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
RESULTS: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid drops or spray, topical aluminium acetate drops, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical anti-infective agents, topical corticosteroids, and water exclusion.","['Hajioff D', 'Mackeith S']",2008,2008,,BMJ Clin Evid,Hajioff D and Mackeith S.

18036282,Ketamine in the management of generalised cephalic tetanus.,"BACKGROUND: Tetanus is a fatal infection caused by the neurotoxin tetanospasmin released by the vegetative spores of Clostridium tetani. The high mortality rate is related to frequent tetanic fits with laryngeal spasm and airway obstruction. Numerous anticonvulsants are in use, with varying efficacy in controlling fits. This case report highlights the use of ketamine as adjunctive therapy in the management of tetanus.
CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old woman was admitted with a history of recurrent left ear pain, with bloody, purulent discharge, following a self-inflicted injury. She developed tetanic spasms 24 hours after admission. She had received no immunisations. A tracheostomy was established to relieve airway obstruction, and ketamine was added to the medication when breakthrough seizures were refractory to diazepam.
CONCLUSION: Ketamine is of proven safety as an anaesthetic agent, especially in cases in which an anaesthetist is not readily available. Its effectiveness in this case, in combination with diazepam, warrants further evaluation.","['Obanor O', 'Osazuwa HO', 'Amadasun JE']",2008,122,12,J Laryngol Otol,"Obanor O, et al.

18035194,Pooled analysis of two clinical trials comparing the clinical outcomes of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension and polymyxin B/neomycin/hydrocortisone otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa in adults and children.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the clinical outcome of patients receiving topical ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (CD) otic suspension with that of those receiving polymyxin B/neomycin/ hydrocortisone (PNH) otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).
METHODS: Data from 2 institutional review board-approved, multicenter, observer-masked, parallel-group, randomized, noninferiority clinical trials conducted at 76 institutions across the United States between April 1998 and July 1999 were pooled together for this analysis. Patients > or =1 year of age diagnosed with AOE were considered for inclusion in the studies. Patients with AOE >4 weeks' duration, a perforated tympanic membrane, chronic suppurative otitis media, or use of either antibiotics or steroids within the previous 7 days were excluded from the studies. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CD or PNH for 7 days. CD was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients > or =12 years of age BID. PNH was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients > or =12 years of age TID. The clinical investigators were blinded to treatment assignment. Due to the different dosing regimens, patients were not blinded, but they also were not directly informed of their treatment assignments. Otic inflammation, tenderness, edema, and discharge were clinically assessed on days 3, 8, and 18 of the studies. Otic inflammation and edema were evaluated using a 4-point scale (none = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; and severe = 3). Otic tenderness and discharge were rated on a binomial scale (absent = 0 and present = 1). The clinical assessments were aggregated into a 9-point composite clinical scale (range, 0-8) to compare baseline severity between groups. For the final outcomes assessment in this study, the aggregated clinical scores were dichotomized into cured (0) versus noncured (>0) and analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier survival technique. A log-rank test was used to compare the cure curves between treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier summary statistics provide the mean and median times to cure, and the mean times to cure for the 25th and 75th patient quartiles. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring patients for adverse events at each visit.
RESULTS: Data from 1072 patients (1242 ears) were included in the analysis (CD, 537 patients; PNH, 535 patients). Baseline AOE severity and demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The mean patient age was 21.7 and 22.0 years in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. Both groups were similar with respect to sex, with 50.7% and 53.5% females in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. The racial composition was predominately white (88.6% vs 84.9% in the CD and PNH groups, respectively). The log-rank test revealed a significant difference in the AOE cure curves between the CD and PNH groups (P = 0.038). The proportions cured in the AOE at-risk groups at the day-3, -8, and -18 assessments in the CD and PNH treatment groups were 0.14 and 0.10, 0.75 and 0.72, and 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier summary statistics indicated that the mean time to cure was 0.6 day less with CD compared with PNH (9.7 vs 10.3 days). Treatment-related adverse event rates were similar between the 2 groups and occurred in 3.8% of the patients. The most common adverse events included otic pruritus (2.1%), otic congestion (0.6%), otic debris (0.5%), otic pain (0.3%), superimposed ear infection (0.3%), and erythema (0.1%).
CONCLUSION: These data from 2 previous studies suggest that time to cure was significantly less with CD compared with PNH in patients with AOE.","['Rahman A', 'Rizwan S', 'Waycaster C', 'Wall GM']",2007,29,9,Clin Ther,"Rahman A, et al.

17998667,Isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria from external ear canal of cancer patients at Shafa Cancer Hospital-Ahwaz.,"A bacteriological study of external ear canal was performed in 52 hospitalized cancer patients and 42 non hospitalized cancer patients at Shafa hospital, Ahwaz. Study was under taken to find out the normal flora changes in the external ear canals and to observe the prevalence of external otitis among these cancer patients. The control group consisted of 40 non-cancer patients. We observed the following bacteria among hospitalized cancer patients. Staphylococcus Coagulase negative (51.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.9%). Similarly, among non hospitalized cancer patients, Staphylococcus Coagulase negative (45.2%), S. aureus (9.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.7%). Incidence of Staphylococcus Coagulase negative and Streptococci pneumoniae is higher in control group than that in cancer patients. We have concluded that cancer patients probably suffer from external otitis more frequently because of enhanced colonization by S. aureus (P < 0.05).

DESIGN: Comparative retrospective case series.
SETTING: Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Rabin Medical Center, a tertiary care medical center.
PATIENTS: Forty-eight patients with MEO diagnosed and treated from 1990 to 2004. Eight had facial paralysis and 40 had normal facial nerve function.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings and survival.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between patients with and without facial nerve involvement in terms of age, comorbidities, duration of complaints, physical findings, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and bone scan findings. Computed tomography indicated a more progressive disease in patients with facial nerve involvement. However, no statistically significant between-group difference was found in overall survival.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: This is a ten-year retrospective review of patients aged 60 years and above seen between January 1994 and December 2003 at the ENT Surgery Department of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital.
RESULTS: Nine hundred and seventy two patients out of a total patient population of 20,600 were found to be 60 years and above. The geriatric population was thus 4.7% of our total patients. Otological disease predominated with 537 (55.2%), followed by Rhinological disease with 180 (18.5%) before Laryngological pathologies with 154 (16.4%). 65(6.7%) had unspecified diseases. CSOM was the commonest otological (25%) and Otorhinolaryngological (13.78%) problem, followed by Otomycosis Externa 94 (17.5%) and Cerumen Auris 82 (15.3%). Allergic Rhinitis was the commonest Rhinological pathology with 110 (58%) of Rhinological cases, while Chronic Pharyngitis topped the list of diseases of the throat with 62 (34.4%).

Treatment of the most severe forms of otitis externa involves aural toilet, followed by the application of a topical preparation, commonly in the form of an ear canal dressing. A prospective single-blind randomized controlled trial was performed to compare the efficacy of 10% glycerine-ichthammol (GI) solution and Triadcortyl (TAC) ointment, both applied as ear canal dressings, in the initial management of severe acute otitis externa. A total of 64 patients were studied. Both treatment modalities were proven efficacious in the treatment of severe acute otitis externa. Although there was a statistically significant improvement of pain parameters in the TAC group, we found no significant differences in clinical findings between the two groups. Therefore, it is recommended that GI dressing can be used instead of an antibiotic dressing as an initial treatment of severe acute otitis externa on the basis of cost, avoidance of resistance and toxicity.","['Masood A', 'Moumoulidis I', 'Ray S', 'Chawla O', 'Panesar J']",2008,265,8,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Masood A, et al.

17907013,Psoriasis of the face and flexures.,"Facial and flexural psoriasis may impair the quality of life of psoriatic patients considerably. For the adequate management of psoriasis it is important to pay attention to lesions at these sensitive sites, which require an approach different to that for lesions on other sites in several respects. An extensive literature search was carried out to collect evidence-based data on facial and flexural psoriasis with respect to epidemiology, clinical aspects, pathogenetic factors and various treatments. Subsequently, a panel of experts, the Copenhagen Psoriasis Working Group (CPWG), discussed these aspects and several recommendations were formulated reconciling the evidence-based data. Facial psoriasis occurs in 17-46% of psoriatics and flexural psoriasis is experienced by 6.8-36% of patients with psoriasis. Therefore, psoriasis at these sites cannot be regarded as a rare manifestation. Facial psoriasis is a prognostic marker indicating a poor prognosis of psoriasis. Facial and flexural psoriasis cannot be regarded as distinct disease entities but rather as site variations. The clinical features of facial psoriasis suggest that there are three subtypes: hairline psoriasis, sebo-psoriasis and true facial psoriasis. Otitis externa and ocular manifestations should not be neglected. Evidence that microbiological factors may be relevant to facial and flexural psoriasis is virtually absent. For facial psoriasis the response to UV radiation is variable. At least 5% of psoriatics have photosensitive psoriasis. In these patients photosensitive diseases such as lupus erythematodes and polymorphic light eruption have to be excluded. Based on the literature assessment and working group discussions the CPWG concluded the following. (1) Low-potency topical corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogues and calcineurin inhibitors are first choice treatments in facial and flexural psoriasis. Evidence for the efficacy of the first two modalities is at level 3 while it is at level 1 for the third one. An individualized approach is indicated; for example, in case of corticosteroid side effects in the past the other two modalities should be selected and in unstable psoriasis prone to irritation, monotherapy with vitamin D3 analogues should be avoided. (2) Antimicrobial treatments are not indicated for facial and flexural psoriasis. (3) Dithranol and tar treatment are not indicated as first-line treatment but only if the first-line options fail. (4) In case topical therapies are not effective, phototherapy and systemic treatments are indicated. (5) For future drug development the combination of vitamin D3 analogues with low strength corticosteroids is recommended.","['van de Kerkhof PC', 'Murphy GM', 'Austad J', 'Ljungberg A', 'Cambazard F', 'Duvold LB']",2007,18,6,J Dermatolog Treat,"van de Kerkhof PC, et al.

17845622,Aetiology of canine otitis externa: a retrospective study of 100 cases.,"The objective of this retrospective study was to investigate in 100 dogs with otitis externa (OE) the possible associations between signalment, history, clinical and laboratory findings and the various primary, secondary and perpetuating causative factors of ear canal inflammation. The age of the dogs ranged from 3 months to 14 years (median: 4.75 years) and they included 45 males and 55 females. Cocker spaniels, Jura des Alpes and Brittany spaniels were significantly overrepresented among dogs with OE when compared to the hospital canine population. In the majority of the cases, OE was chronic-recurrent (63%) or bilateral (93%). Allergic dermatitis (43/100 dogs), grass awns (12/100) and otoacariasis (7/100) were the most common primary causative factors; no primary factor could be incriminated in 32 cases and more than one was found in three dogs. Malassezia spp. (66/100 dogs), cocci (38/100) and rods (22/100) were the secondary causative factors, while ear canal stenosis (38/100) and tympanic membrane perforation-otitis media (25/100) were the most important perpetuating factors. Atopic dermatitis and adverse food reactions-associated OE was more common in females and dogs with a history of pruritic skin disease, while grass awn-induced OE occurred in cocker spaniels and acute cases. Tympanic membrane perforation was less frequent in atopic dermatitis and adverse food reactions-associated OE, but more common when otoscopic and ear canal cytological examination revealed the presence of grass awns and rods, respectively. Finally, cocci overgrowth was positively associated with ear canal stenosis.","['Saridomichelakis MN', 'Farmaki R', 'Leontides LS', 'Koutinas AF']",2007,18,5,Vet Dermatol,"Saridomichelakis MN, et al.

17825115,A previously unidentified Chorioptes species infesting outer ear canals of moose (Alces alces): characterization of the mite and the pathology of infestation.,"BACKGROUND: During the past decade, Chorioptes mites occupying the outer ear canals have been a common finding at routine necropsies of moose (Alces alces) in Sweden, but neither the taxonomy of the mites nor lesions from the infestation have been investigated. In this study, the mites are characterized by morphological and molecular techniques, and the histopathology of the skin of the outer ear canal is described.
METHODS: External auditory meatuses from 53 necropsied moose were examined for the presence of Chorioptes, and samples from outer ear canals were taken for histopathological and microbiological examination. A proportion of the mites from each moose was identified to species. The DNA was extracted from mites from three moose, and their ITS-2 sequences were determined; these sequences were compared phylogenetically to sequences from other Chorioptes taxa.
RESULTS: Chorioptes mites were found in 43 (81%) of the 53 moose. The mites had morphological and genetic characteristics distinct from those of C. texanus and C. bovis, the two species generally accepted within the genus. Morphology also did not argue for a diagnosis as C. crewei, C. mydaus or C. panda. On histopathology, lesions were characterized by a hyperplastic perivascular to interstitial dermatitis with epidermal hyperkeratosis and crust formation. Dermal inflammatory infiltrates were composed of mixed T- and B-lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, whereas eosinophils were notably uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from the infested epidermis of five of 14 examined moose.
CONCLUSION: Chorioptes mite infestation was frequently detected in the outer ear canals of moose in Sweden. The mites were evidently pathogenic, being associated with inflammatory lesions of the external auditory meatus. Our studies indicate infestations with a previously undescribed Chorioptes species.","['Hestvik G', 'Zahler-Rinder M', 'Gavier-Widén D', 'Lindberg R', 'Mattsson R', 'Morrison D', 'Bornstein S']",2007,49,1,Acta Vet Scand,"Hestvik G, et al.

The complications observed include bruise or laceration and bleeding from the external auditory canal (16.3%), otitis externa (6.5%) and traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (1.7%).
CONCLUSION: Despite a high proportion of cases managed in the office setting, complication rates were within acceptable levels. There is need to develop practical criteria that will be beneficial to primary health care givers to determine which patients could be managed in the primary care setting with acceptable outcome.","['Ologe FE', 'Dunmade AD', 'Afolabi OA']",2007,74,8,Indian J Pediatr,"Ologe FE, et al.

17762793,Tracheolaryngeal complications of inherited epidermolysis bullosa: cumulative experience of the national epidermolysis bullosa registry.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To accurately determine the frequency with which complications arise in the ears, noses, and throats of patients with inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) as well as the cumulative risk of tracheolaryngeal stenosis or stricture.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (3,280 patients) with a nested, randomly sampled longitudinal subcohort (n=450), representing data collection, stratified by major EB subtype, of the National EB Registry, an epidemiologic project focused on enrolling all EB patients within the continental United States from 1986 to 2002, to permit generalization of findings to the entire American EB population.
METHODS: Systematic epidemiologic case finding and data collection were performed throughout the continental United States, followed by subclassification of patients by EB subtype. ENT complications were quantified via contingency tables (as frequencies) and lifetable analyses. Frequencies of surgical procedures were also determined.
RESULTS: The most important clinical ENT complication in inherited EB was tracheolaryngeal stenosis or stricture, arising during early childhood and primarily within infants and children with junctional EB (JEB) (cumulative risk of 39.8% and 12.8% in Herlitz and non-Herlitz JEB, respectively, by ages 6 and 9). Other uncommon complications included chronic otitis media, chronic otitis externa, and hearing loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the potential risk for sudden airway occlusion and death, meticulous surveillance by a pediatric otolaryngologist is a critical part of the overall management of infants and children with EB, especially those with JEB and two rare subtypes of generalized EB simplex. Elective tracheostomy should be considered in EB infants and children with evidence of airway embarrassment.","['Fine JD', 'Johnson LB', 'Weiner M', 'Suchindran C']",2007,117,9,Laryngoscope,"Fine JD, et al.

17721365,Necrotizing external otitis: a report of 46 cases.,"OBJECTIVES: To define germs involved, clinical presentation, treatment regimen, and prognostic factors in necrotizing external otitis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study reviewing a series of 46 patients treated during 10 years in a tertiary care center. Diagnosis was confirmed by using otomicroscopy, computed tomographic and/or magnetic resonance imaging scan and bone scintigraphy (Te 99 and Ga 26 bone scan). Patients were provided ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin intravenously and monitored using a Ga-67 bone scan. The following were assessed: presenting symptoms, general context, bacteriological analysis, imaging protocol sensitivity, complications, delay to healing, and cure rate.
RESULTS: Sex ratio was 2.29 (mean age, 73.6 yr). The most common presenting symptoms were otalgia and otorrhea in 97.8 and 91.3%, respectively. Facial paralysis was present in 19.6% of cases. Thirty patients had diabetes mellitus (65.2%), and 8 were immunocompromised (17.4%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 69.2% of cases and was resistant to ciprofloxacin in 18.5%, but was susceptible to ceftazidime in all cases. Four patients died during the treatment (4.4%), but only 2 of disease. The mean delay to healing was 14 weeks (SD, 9.7). Healing rate was 95.6%. No relapse was observed after a mean follow-up of 78.4 weeks (SD, 36.5 wks). Two factors significantly influenced the prognosis: facial paralysis and existence of systemic factors for immune deficiency (p = 0.023 and 0.038, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The association of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime was efficient in countering the increasing resistance of P. aeruginosa to quinolones. We propose a prognostic classification of necrotizing external otitis based on the presence of facial paralysis and/or systemic factors.","['Franco-Vidal V', 'Blanchet H', 'Bebear C', 'Dutronc H', 'Darrouzet V']",2007,28,6,Otol Neurotol,"Franco-Vidal V, et al.

17681615,"Acute mastoiditis in children: the ""Ferrara"" experience.","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the clinical features and outcomes of acute mastoiditis in children referred to the ENT/Audiology Department of the University of Ferrara from January 1994 to December 2005. It also aims to discuss risk factors and to find predictors for surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective study on case sheets of children with an acute mastoiditis diagnosis was carried out. Fifty-five cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria: they presented otoscopical evidence of acute otitis media and inflammatory findings of the mastoid area such as post-auricular swelling, redness or tenderness, protrusion of the auricle and/or radiological findings.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were only treated with antibiotic therapy, tympanocentesis alone was performed in 11 cases; in 5, a ventilation tube was positioned. Mastoidectomy was performed in 13 patients. The group who underwent mastoidectomy had a median hospital stay of 15 days (5-54), in this group were found the following complications: 1 meningitis, 1 meningo-encephalitis, 1 lateral and sigmoid sinus thrombosis, 1 facial palsy.
CONCLUSION: the incidence of otomastoiditis does not seem to be decreasing, on the contrary, in some countries, it seems to be on the increase. Our experience cannot confirm a real increase of the incidence but we noted periodic variations during the time of observation. It is important, that careful attention is paid to the clinical assessment of children who are 2-years old or under, as they seem to be more exposed to the risk of clinical complications; therefore, it is highly recommended that the otologist and the paediatrician collaborate closely.","['Palma S', 'Fiumana E', 'Borgonzoni M', 'Bovo R', 'Rosignoli M', 'Martini A']",2007,71,11,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Palma S, et al.

To investigate the degree of correlation between CT findings scan and the patients clinical status focusing on a subgroup of patients with cranial nerve palsies. Diagnosis of malignant external otitis was confirmed in 23 patients (average age 71 years, age range 39-87) based on criteria of severe pain, otitis externa refractory to conventional treatments and possibly diabetes mellitus and pseudomonas detection. CT was performed on 23 of these patients. Results from these scans were analysed and correlated with patient clinical status. Retrospective analysis of CT images and medical notes were used for data analysis.The CT scans of all 23 patients showed evidence of involvement of disease outside the external auditory canal, confirming the diagnosis. Sixteen out of 23 patients (70%) demonstrated evidence of bone erosion. Four of the 16 showed involvement of the petrous apex. From our subset of ten patients with cranial nerve involvement, eight demonstrated evidence of bone erosion and two showed mastoid and middle ear involvement without bone erosion. All four patients with petrous apical involvement presented with cranial nerve palsies (two lower cranial nerve palsies, one seventh nerve palsy and one combined lower and seventh nerve palsy). CT scanning was found to be a fast and economical tool in the initial assessment of patients with malignant external otitis. Petrous apex involvement was constantly associated with cranial nerve palsies, usually the lower cranial nerves. CT findings of temporal bone in itself however, were not closely correlated to the clinical outcome of the patients.","['Sudhoff H', 'Rajagopal S', 'Mani N', 'Moumoulidis I', 'Axon PR', 'Moffat D']",2008,265,1,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Sudhoff H, et al.

17673384,Topical tacrolimus treatment for chronic dermatitis of the ear.,"Recurrent exacerbation in chronic recalcitrant external otitis (EO) often warrants multidisciplinary treatment and collaboration with a dermatologist. The aim of this pilot study was to ascertain the efficacy of topical tacrolimus ointment application in chronic, non-infectious and therapy-resistant EO. In a prospective clinical study, the efficacy of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% was examined in 53 patients with therapy-refractory chronic EO of confirmed non-infectious etiology. Clinical examination took place prior to treatment (V1), at the end (V2) and during follow-up investigations (V3) of 28 patients over 10-22 months. Patients were evaluated for the symptoms otalgia, edema, otorrhea, erythema, pruritus and desquamation on a 6-point scale. The short-term results after topical application of tacrolimus (V2) showed a clear improvement in 85% of the patients (N = 45) and significant drop in severity scores for all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). The long-term follow-up studies (V3) revealed that a one-time treatment cycle led to complete remission in 46% of patients (N = 28). The remaining 54% had recurrent EO events, however, with significantly longer symptom-free intervals. Within the observation period, no relevant local or systemic side effects were observed, except for occasional skin burning, stinging, or itching. This interdisciplinary study between dermatologists and ENT specialists clearly demonstrates that the topical application of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment is an effective and well-tolerated new option in the treatment of chronic recalcitrant EO. Furthermore, it shows that dermatologists, with their experience in topical immunomodulatory therapy, can make valuable contributions to the treatment of inflammatory disorders in other medical fields.","['Harth W', 'Caffier PP', 'Mayelzadeh B', 'Haupt H', 'Sedlmaier B', 'Richard G']",2007,17,5,Eur J Dermatol,"Harth W, et al.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Eighteen MEO patients who underwent CT on admission were included in this retrospective study conducted at a tertiary center. The number and extent of anatomical areas involved according to CT were compared to clinical course severity.
RESULTS: The patients were categorized into two groups according to clinical course. There were 13 patients in the ""nonsevere"" group and 5 in the ""severe."" In six out of eight CT anatomical areas the ""severe"" group had significantly higher scores (P < 0.05 to P < 0.0005). The average number of areas involved in the ""nonsevere"" group was 2.9 and in the ""severe"" 5.4 (P < 0.0005).
CONCLUSION: We found a clear correlation between clinical course and initial CT findings in MEO patients.

The percentage of CIP/DEXtreated patients with severe pain decreased rapidly within the first 12 h; this contrasted with an increase in pain among NPH-treated patients. CIP/DEX-treated patients had significantly less inflammation (P=.0043) and edema (P=.0148) than NPH-treated patients. Overall, these results support greater pain relief attained over the first 3 d in patients with acute otitis externa treated with CIP/DEX compared with NPH and a rapid reduction in severe pain after initiation of treatment.","['Roland PS', 'Younis R', 'Wall GM']",2007,24,3,Adv Ther,"Roland PS, et al.

17610484,Effects of otic betamethasone on intradermal testing in normal dogs.,"Otitis externa is common in atopic dogs and is frequently treated using potent glucocorticoids topically. These preparations can cause adrenal suppression and affect skin test reactivity. The purpose of this study was to determine if an otic product containing betamethasone could decrease skin reactivity in normal dogs. Sixteen laboratory beagles were used in a cross-over, blinded trial. Dogs were enrolled in two groups; one received placebo and the other a betamethasone-containing otic preparation (Otomax) twice daily for 2 weeks. After a 4-week wash-out period, treatments were switched. Dogs were intradermally tested on days 0 and 14 of each treatment period with histamine phosphate (1 : 100,000 and 1 : 200,000 w/v) and allergens common in the area. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests were done before and after treatment to investigate adrenal suppression. After 2 weeks of otic betamethasone, Dermatophagoides farinae (P = 0.0034), Cynodon dactylon (P = 0.0459) and histamine 1 : 100,000 w/v (P = 0.0028) reactions were significantly reduced. Pre-treatment post-ACTH serum cortisol levels and those obtained after both treatments did not differ statistically (P = 0.6362). Betamethasone induced a slight but statistically significant elevation (P = 0.0002) of serum alkaline phosphatase. Despite the increase, values were within normal range. It is concluded that, although otic betamethasone did not suppress adrenal glands, it mildly suppressed intradermal reactions to 1 : 100,000 w/v histamine, D. farinae and C. dactylon.","['Ginel PJ', 'Garrido C', 'Lucena R']",2007,18,4,Vet Dermatol,"Ginel PJ, et al.

17592657,Management of granular myringitis: a systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Granular myringitis is a chronic disorder characterised by lateral squamous de-epithelialisation and granulation of the tympanic membrane. Untreated, granular myringitis can lead to post-inflammatory medial external auditory canal fibrosis, acquired canal atresia and inflammatory infiltration of the deep canal.
AIM: This study aimed to establish optimal management strategies which could be applied to clinical practice, through systematic review of the current literature.
METHODS: Current literature was obtained by searching evidence-based medical databases, the Cochrane database, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Cochrane controlled trials register, Ovid Medline, the various British Medical Journal imprint journals, individual journal websites and citation indexes, and by hand-searching current journals. Detailed inclusion criteria were set. Data were retrieved from the selected studies and checked for accuracy and consistency. The primary outcome measured was the effect of the proposed intervention on recurrence of granular myringitis, compared with empirical antibiotic therapy.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight publications were identified, dating from 1964 to 2005; 46 of these were potentially relevant. After assessment using the preset inclusion criteria, only two studies remained. El-Seifi and Fouad (2000) found that surgical excision of granulation tissue resulted in an 80 per cent reduction in recurrence of granular myringitis when compared with conventional antibiotic therapy. However, Jung et al. (2002) demonstrated a 96 per cent reduction in granular myringitis recurrence when managed with dilute vinegar solution.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a reduced recurrence of granular myringitis in both studies' intervention groups, although neither study was randomised or blinded, making it difficult to assess the clinical relevance of the results. However, the following conclusions can be inferred. (1) Conventional topical antibiotic and steroid drops appear to be less efficacious and more likely to lead to recurrence of symptoms, compared with other proposed treatment modalities. (2) Treatment with dilute vinegar solution presents a logical, unharmful alternative to conventional antibiotic drops. Further research of high value is needed.","['Neilson LJ', 'Hussain SS']",2008,122,1,J Laryngol Otol,Neilson LJ and Hussain SS. Management of granular myringitis: a systematic review.

17586789,Requirement for additional treatment for dogs with atopic dermatitis undergoing allergen-specific immunotherapy.,"Allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) is one of the main treatments for atopic dermatitis in dogs, but it often requires additional treatments such as antibacterial and antifungal therapy for secondary bacterial and yeast infections, or antipruritic drugs to control the clinical signs or treat the adverse effects of the immunotherapy. Twenty-seven dogs enrolled in a study of ASIT were clinically assessed four times over a period of nine months; their requirement for treatment for secondary bacterial and yeast infections, for the administration of glucocorticoids as additional antipruritic therapy, and for the treatment of any adverse effects of the ASIT were evaluated. Twenty (74 per cent) of the dogs were treated for superficial bacterial pyoderma, 18 (66.6 per cent) required treatment for Malassezia species dermatitis on one or more occasions, eight (29.6 per cent) required treatment for otitis externa due to Malassezia species or bacteria, and eight required glucocorticoids to control their clinical signs. Five (18.5 per cent) of the dogs experienced adverse effects due to the ASIT and two required treatment with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists) in order to continue with the ASIT.","['Colombo S', 'Hill PB', 'Shaw DJ', 'Thoday KL']",2007,160,25,Vet Rec,"Colombo S, et al.

17544265,Sex differences in the incidence and severity of respiratory tract infections.,"Sex is a significant epidemiological factor for several diseases. However, the role of sex in the development and outcome of various infections has not been extensively studied with the notable exception of urinary tract infections. We searched in the PubMed database to identify articles that could provide relevant data regarding sex differences in the incidence and severity of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). We extracted data from 84 relevant studies that provided information regarding sex differences in the incidence and severity of RTIs. Females are more commonly affected with infections of the upper respiratory tract, specifically sinusitis, tonsillitis, and otitis externa. On the other hand, males are more commonly affected with otitis media, croup, and most important, lower RTIs. It is also evident from the reviewed evidence that the course of most RTIs is more severe in males than in females, leading to higher mortality in males, especially in community-acquired pneumonia. In conclusion, the available data suggest that males are more susceptible than females to most types of RTIs in all age groups (adults and children). Overall, it seems that males develop RTIs more frequently than females, except for sinusitis, otitis externa, and probably tonsillitis. Anatomic, lifestyle, behavioural, and socioeconomic differences between males and females may explain the observed findings. The role of sex hormones in the regulation of the immune system may also contribute to the reported sex differences in the incidence and severity of the various types of RTIs, especially in adolescents and adults.","['Falagas ME', 'Mourtzoukou EG', 'Vardakas KZ']",2007,101,9,Respir Med,"Falagas ME, et al.

In a double-blind study 151 patients with a unilateral acute bacterial otitis externa were randomized either to receive an ointment with polymyxin-B sulfate (7,500 I.E./g) + bacitracin (300 I.E./g) alone (AB) or the same antibiotic ointment with 10 mg hydrocortisone acetate/g ointment (AB + HC). Primary efficacy endpoint was the change of an aggregate clinical symptom score (CSS) (subscores: redness, swelling, pain and secretion) found at Visit 2 versus baseline (Visit 1). Secondary outcome parameters were the change of the CSS from Visit 1 to the study termination, and the changes in the subscores and of a visual analog scale for pain. In the group treated with AB + HC, significantly more patients with severe redness [14 (56%) vs. 7 (28%), P = 0.045] or severe secretion [23 (70%) vs. 10 (40%), P = 0.024] at inclusion were symptom-free at the last visit.

One isolate was from an asymptomatic child. Detailed data on travel history inside Austria was available for 5 of these 8 patients: all 5 had visited or lived near Austria's largest lake. The concentration of salt in this westernmost steppe lake in Europe is approximately one-twentieth of that of sea water. Why otitis and not diarrhea is the dominating manifestation of non-O1/non-O139 infection acquired in Austria remains to be elucidated. We hypothesize that diarrhea due to Vibrio cholerae serogroups other than O1 and O139 acquired in Austria may simply be unrecognized by the standard operating procedures employed in clinical microbiology laboratories. Testing for Vibrio cholerae is not considered necessary for domestically acquired diarrhea. Only in patients who acquired diarrhea abroad, do physicians sometimes consider cholera as a differential diagnosis, thereby prompting the laboratory to use thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose (TCBS) agar plates.","['Huhulescu S', 'Indra A', 'Feierl G', 'Stoeger A', 'Ruppitsch W', 'Sarkar B', 'Allerberger F']",2007,119,7-8,Wien Klin Wochenschr,"Huhulescu S, et al.

17473694,Cranial nerve involvement in malignant external otitis: implications for clinical outcome.,"BACKGROUND: Malignant external otitis is an uncommon, potentially lethal infection of the temporal bone primarily affecting elderly diabetic patients.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cranial nerve involvement in malignant external otitis affects or predicts the clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: Diagnosis of malignant external otitis was established in 23 patients (average age, 71 yr; range, 39-87) based on inclusion criteria of severe pain, otitis externa refractory to conventional treatments, diabetes mellitus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa detection. Computed tomography confirmed temporal bone involvement extending outside the external auditory canal.
DATA ANALYSIS: Retrospective analysis of hospital records.
RESULTS: Ten of 23 (43.5%) patients showed cranial nerve involvement. The following cranial nerves were affected: facial nerve (6/10), lower cranial nerves (combination of IX, X, XI, XII) (3/10), and extended nerve palsy (VI, VII, IX, X, XI) (1/10). Thirteen of 23 (56.5%) patients displayed no cranial nerve involvement. All patients were treated with long-term, high-dose antibiotic treatment dependent on the microbiological findings.
CONCLUSIONS: All patients with lower cranial nerve palsy recovered normal function; however, the facial nerve palsy was significantly less likely to improve by medical treatment. Cranial nerve involvement did not affect the patient survival rate under an optimized medical treatment in our series.","['Mani N', 'Sudhoff H', 'Rajagopal S', 'Moffat D', 'Axon PR']",2007,117,5,Laryngoscope,"Mani N, et al.

17450104,Ototoxic effect of Burow solution applied to the guinea pig middle ear.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ototoxicity of Burow solution as an otologic preparation.
BACKGROUND: Burow solution has been used for years in the treatment of acute or chronic otitis externa and chronic suppurative otitis media. This acidic solution has antibacterial and antiedematous properties. Ototoxic effect of Burow solution has not been known, so the current study was designed to observe the ototoxic effect of Burow solution experimentally.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments were performed in 32 young, male albino guinea pigs (weight, 450-550 g). Twenty animals in the experimental group were divided into 2 groups of 10 animals each. The first group received 13% Burow solution (13% aluminum subacetate), and the second received 4% Burow solution (4% aluminum subacetate). Twelve animals in the control group were divided into 2 groups of 6 animals each. The first group received gentamicin (40 mg/mL; ototoxic control), and the second received saline solution (negative control). Under general anesthesia, pretreatment auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from the right ear were obtained from the animals in all groups. The right tympanic membranes were widely perforated, and a small piece of Gelfoam was applied to the middle ear. Ear solutions at concentrations of 0.1 mL were applied through transcanal approach to the middle ear twice a day in 10 days. Under general anesthesia, the Gelfoam was removed from the right middle ear, and posttreatment ABRs were obtained 14 days later after the initial time in all groups.
RESULTS: Baseline ABR results were normal in right ears of all animals tested. Animals undergoing placement of Gelfoam with either 13% Burow solution, 4% Burow solution, or saline in the middle ear showed no changes in ABR threshold. The gentamicin group showed significant change in the ABR threshold.
CONCLUSION: Burow solution was considered to be an effective and safe otologic preparation.","['Serin GM', 'Ciprut A', 'Baylançiçek S', 'Sari M', 'Akdaş F', 'Tutkun A']",2007,28,5,Otol Neurotol,"Serin GM, et al.

17444935,Traumatic endotracheal intubation in the cat.,"BACKGROUND: Orotracheal intubation is a commonly performed procedure in the cat, but it is not without complications. Tracheal rupture has been reported in cats, but trauma to the arytenoids from intubation has not been documented.
OBSERVATIONS: An otherwise healthy, 5-year-old male domestic shorthair cat presented for total ear canal ablation to resolve intractable otitis media and externa. The cat was premedicated with glycopyrrolate, hydromorphone, and acepromazine. Anesthesia was induced with diazepam and ketamine, and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. During orotracheal intubation, the larynx was poorly visualized and excessive force was used to perform intubation. Subsequently, blood was observed in the larynx and laryngoscopy revealed a tear lateral to the patient's right arytenoid which had been created during intubation. The larynx was re-intubated normally and the cat suffered no obvious ill effects from the trauma to the larynx.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct observation and proper technique must be employed during orotracheal intubation in cats in an attempt to avoid laryngeal trauma.","['Hofmeister EH', 'Trim CM', 'Kley S', 'Cornell K']",2007,34,3,Vet Anaesth Analg,"Hofmeister EH, et al.

17440424,Tacrolimus: a new option in therapy-resistant chronic external otitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the novel topical immune modulator tacrolimus in chronic uninfectious otherwise therapy-resistant external otitis (EO).
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 53 patients aged 5 to 83 years. An ear wick containing 0.1% tacrolimus ointment (Protopic) was inserted into the external auditory canal every 2nd to 3rd day. Altogether, the wick was changed three times. The pre-, intra- and posttherapeutic state of the clinical parameters otalgia, edema, otorrhea, erythema, pruritus, and desquamation was rated by means of a 6-point score system. Treatment efficiency was evaluated on the basis of follow-up investigations at 3-month intervals, a standardized findings sheet, and photograph documentation.
RESULTS: The short-term results showed a clear improvement in 85% of the patients and significant reductions of the severity levels for all clinical parameters investigated (P < .001). Concerning the long-term results, a one-time treatment cycle led to complete healing in 46% of the patients throughout a follow-up of 10 to 22 months. Of the patients, 54% had recurrent EO events with significantly extended mean symptom-free intervals. Reapplied tacrolimus treatment patterns attenuated the relapsing course of disease and significantly reduced the number of EO episodes. Within the observation period, no relevant side effects were observed, except for a local feeling of heat, occasional skin burning, and itching.
CONCLUSIONS: The topical application of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment in the outer ear canal appears to be an effective and well-tolerated new option in corticosteroid-free treatment of chronic therapy-resistant EO.","['Caffier PP', 'Harth W', 'Mayelzadeh B', 'Haupt H', 'Sedlmaier B']",2007,117,6,Laryngoscope,"Caffier PP, et al.

17385560,In vitro antimicrobial activity of the leaf extract of Harungana madagascariensis Lam. Ex Poir. (Hypericaceae) against strains causing otitis externa in dogs and cats.,"Otitis externa in dogs and cats is always caused by a combination of yeasts and bacteria, among which the most important are Malassezia pachydermatis, Staphylococcus intermedius and Pseudomonas species. These organisms often develop resistance to classical antimicrobial agents. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activities of an ethyl acetate leaf extract of Harungana madagascariensis against the organisms cited, to carry out the phytochemical investigation of this extract and to determine its bioactive chemical class using dilution techniques, the bioautography method and the standard phytochemical method described by Harborne (1973). Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of saponins, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids and anthracenic derivatives. The bioassay showed that the antimicrobial properties may be attributed to astilbin, a flavanone derivative identified on the basis of its spectroscopic data. The results suggest that the extract could be used in an antimicrobial preparation effective against the whole range of organisms incriminated in otitis externa in dogs and cats, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 250 microg/ml.","['Moulari B', 'Pellequer Y', 'Chaumont JP', 'Guillaume YC', 'Millet J']",2007,55,1,Acta Vet Hung,"Moulari B, et al.

17364352,Osteomyelitis in the head and neck.,"CONCLUSION: All bones of the facial skeleton and spine are susceptible to osteomyelitis due to various predisposing conditions. Current radiological tools are sufficient to provide adequate diagnosis. Treatment can be conservative resection of the diseased bone with adequate clearance in all cases except in cases of osteomyelitis due to osteoradionecrosis (ORN) where resection has to be more radical.
OBJECTIVE: In today's antibiotic era, osteomyelitis in the head and neck is a rare occurrence. Dealing with osteomyelitis in head and neck bones is not the same as in other bones of the body due to the nature of the bones, complex anatomy of the region, and esthetics. Our purpose was to analyze the behavior of osteomyelitis in the head and neck bones and its management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 cases of osteomyelitis in head and neck were reviewed in a 10-year period. Pus for culture, antibiotic sensitivity, and radiology were the main investigations. A medical line of treatment was effective in acute cases. Surgery was opted for in chronic cases.
RESULTS: Mandible, frontal bone, cervical spine, maxilla, temporal bones, and nasal bones were involved, in descending order of frequency, i.e. the mandible was the most common bone affected. Nine patients were diagnosed as having acute osteomyelitis (11%); 75 were diagnosed as having chronic osteomyelitis (89%). Radiation-induced ORN leading to osteomyelitis was the most common cause of osteomyelitis of the mandible (13 of the 32 cases; 41%). Odontogenic infections and chronic sinusitis each gave rise to osteomyelitis in 3 of 10 cases (30%) of the patients with osteomyelitis of the maxilla. Chronic sinusitis was the main cause of frontal bone osteomyelitis in all 20 cases (100%). Tuberculosis (10 of 15 cases; 67%) and malignancy (5 of 15 cases; 33%) were the main predisposing factors in cervical spine osteomyelitis. Malignant external otitis (MEO) with diabetes mellitus was an underlying factor in all four cases of osteomyelitis of the temporal bone. Of the 18 patients with a diagnosis of ORN, the mandible was found to be the most susceptible bone (13 cases; 72%), followed by the maxilla (four cases; 22%) and cervical spine (1 case). Acute osteomyelitis responded to antibiotics. Sequestrectomy was carried out in all chronic cases but in cases of ORN more radical surgery was performed.","['Prasad KC', 'Prasad SC', 'Mouli N', 'Agarwal S']",2007,127,2,Acta Otolaryngol,"Prasad KC, et al.

Twenty-six dogs with unilateral or bilateral bacterial otitis externa from multiple referral practices were included in this prospective study. Triplicate samples collected simultaneously from the same location in the external ear canal were randomly submitted to three laboratories for culture and susceptibility testing. Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 18 of 34 (53%) ears. All three laboratories agreed on the presence of Pseudomonas spp. in 15 (83.3%) ears sampled. However, two laboratories agreed on two (11.1%) occasions, and on one occasion (5.5%) Pseudomonas spp. were identified in only one laboratory. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibilities to 11 antibiotics were compared between laboratories B and C. Using laboratory-defined susceptibility of sensitive (S), intermediate (I) and resistant (R), none of the 16 Pseudomonas spp. with MIC data reported had identical patterns of antibiotic susceptibility. Agreement in susceptibility to individual antibiotics was observed in 13 of 16 (81%) occasions for amikacin and gentamicin, 10 of 16 (63%) occasions for ticarcillin, and nine of 16 (56%) for enrofloxacin. These results indicate that Pseudomonas spp. were identified by all three laboratories chosen for this study in 83% of the time. Moreover, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and MIC values reported to veterinarians may not agree between laboratories. Veterinarians should interpret bacterial culture and susceptibility results with multiple caveats including variability between laboratories.","['Schick AE', 'Angus JC', 'Coyner KS']",2007,18,2,Vet Dermatol,"Schick AE, et al.

There was a significant reduction in Malassezia growth in ER + keto at all time points (P < 0.0001) compared to time zero. Neither ER nor H2O had any effect on the growth of Malassezia. ER + keto was significantly more effective in reducing Malassezia growth (P < 0.0001) at all time points compared to both ER and H2O. ER + keto may be useful in the treatment of Malassezia otitis externa. Future studies should be performed to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of ER + keto as treatment for otic infections caused by Malassezia.","['Cole LK', 'Luu DH', 'Rajala-Schultz PJ', 'Meadows C', 'Torres AH']",2007,18,2,Vet Dermatol,"Cole LK, et al.

17355420,Evidence-based veterinary dermatology: a systematic review of interventions for treatment of Pseudomonas otitis in dogs.,"The efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions to treat canine Pseudomonas otitis externa and media were evaluated based on the systematic review of clinical trials published between 1967 and 2006. Clinical trials were included if Pseudomonas species were cultured from the ears of dogs with otitis externa or otitis media prior to treatment, and if the outcome of these interventions was reported at the end of the study. Studies were compared with regard to design characteristics (randomization generation and concealment, masking, intention-to-treat analyses), benefit (microbiological and/or clinical resolution of the Pseudomonas otitis), and adverse effects. Ten trials reporting data on 162 patients and 13 different pharmacological interventions were identified. Based on the accepted criteria for quality of evidence, there is insufficient evidence for or against recommending the use of any of these treatments for Pseudomonas otitis in dogs. This is largely because there is only one trial supporting the use of each treatment option and none were randomized controlled trials. Future studies need to be prospective, randomized, blinded and controlled; designed to evaluate pharmacological interventions for otitis regardless of the infective organism; have appropriate statistical advice on recruitment numbers, the power of the study and appropriate statistical analysis; include details of underlying conditions and concomitant treatments; and be designed such that inclusion criteria include microbial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity, and outcome assessments include clinical examination, cytology and microbial culture.","['Nuttall T', 'Cole LK']",2007,18,2,Vet Dermatol,Nuttall T and Cole LK.

OBJECTIVE: To report three more cases of idiopathic, inflammatory, medial meatal, fibrotising otitis and to further consider the possible relationship between this condition and lichen planus.
PATIENTS: Three adult patients with idiopathic, inflammatory, medial meatal, fibrotising otitis, two with bilateral aural symptoms, treated and followed up at the department of otorhinolaryngology of Helsinki University Hospital.
RESULTS: We found idiopathic, inflammatory, medial meatal, fibrotising otitis, affecting solely the glabrous skin of the osseous part of the external ear canals, in three patients who also suffered from severe oral lichen planus.
CONCLUSIONS: The aetiopathology or pathophysiology of idiopathic, inflammatory, medial meatal, fibrotising otitis may be linked with lichen planus.

17319983,Perichondritis of the auricle and its management.,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a study of patients presenting with perichondritis of the auricle and to analyse the possible aetiological factors responsible, the bacteriological agents involved, the treatment modalities and the complications of such infections.
SETTING: Academic department of otolaryngology.
DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study of patients treated over a five-year period.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-one patients with clinically proven perichondritis of the auricle, with or without diabetes mellitus (i.e. malignant otitis externa).
RESULTS: Based on the severity of the disease, otherwise uncomplicated patients were assigned to group A and divided into three cohorts. Patients with perichondritis secondary to malignant otitis externa were analysed separately as group B. Men formed the majority of the patients and most were young (16-35 years). Trauma was the main cause (46 per cent) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most common micro-organism isolated. The condition was managed conservatively with antibiotics alone in 19 patients (31 per cent) and these cases had no residual deformity at follow up (group A, stage one). Incision and drainage was performed in a further 19 patients (31 per cent), resulting in minor residual deformity in one half (group A, stage two). Debridement was performed in 17 patients, and these patients had either gross (29 per cent) or minor residual deformity (71 per cent; group A, stage three). Six patients with perichondritis secondary to malignant otitis externa were managed by wound debridement via a post-auricular approach; all had minor residual deformities.
CONCLUSIONS: Perichondritis can be divided into two groups, depending on cartilage loss and on the presence or absence of malignant otitis externa. The treatment used and the residual deformity that will ensue are entirely dependent on the stage of disease.","['Prasad HK', 'Sreedharan S', 'Prasad HS', 'Meyyappan MH', 'Harsha KS']",2007,121,6,J Laryngol Otol,"Prasad HK, et al.

We report a case of pinnal neurofibroma in which the primary complaint was otitis externa; hearing loss and cosmetic deformity were also present. Surgical excision resulted in an excellent functional and cosmetic outcome. This case demonstrates that neurofibroma of the pinna in the area of the external meatus can produce functional as well as cosmetic impairment, and surgery can produce a very satisfactory result.","['Shaida AM', 'Yung MW']",2007,86,1,Ear Nose Throat J,"Shaida AM and Yung MW.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study comprises 97 cases of clinically and mycologically proven otomycosis or fungal otitis externa gathered during a 12-year period.
RESULTS: Most cases were unilateral (90.7%) and the main predisposing factors associated with the disease were trauma (secondary to the constant scratching) and the use of topical antibiotics. Major causal agents were several species of Aspergillus (63.9%), of which Aspergillus flavus was commonest (26%), followed by Candida albicans (26.8%) and Aspergillus niger (21%).

The aim of this study was to determine the patients demographics, clinical and radiological findings, and outcomes of this condition.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively follow 5 patients with a diagnosis of skull base osteomyelitis between 2004 and 2005. Clinical, biologic and imaging data were collected, and also follow-up during treatment.
RESULTS: The five patients were men and the average age at presentation was 75 years (63-89). All except one had a previous diabetes mellitus, with a more or less recent clinical story of otitis externa. All of them suffered of headaches and cranial nerve(s) deficits, particularly facial nerve. Diagnosis was made on MRI with gadolinium injection and fat saturation, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified as pathogen in all cases. One patient deceased of cranial nerves palsy complication. In 4 cases we found previously a too short or non adapted treatment of necrotizing otitis externa.
CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of headache, cranial nerves deficit and abnormal skull base imaging on MRI with Fat sat, osteomyelitis should be consider as the likely diagnosis. This complication should be avoided by optimal management of necrotizing otitis externa.","['Bouccara D', 'Simon-Blancal V', 'Rodallec M', 'Cyna-Gorse F', 'Mosnier I', 'Fantin B', 'Sterkers O']",2007,124,1,Ann Otolaryngol Chir Cervicofac,"Bouccara D, et al.

17241805,Atypical manifestations of feline inflammatory polyps in three cats.,"Inflammatory polyps of the feline middle ear and nasopharynx are non-neoplastic masses that are presumed to originate from the epithelial lining of the tympanic bulla or Eustachian tube. The exact origin and cause are unknown, however, it is thought that inflammatory polyps arise as a result of a prolonged inflammatory process. It is unclear whether this inflammation initiates or potentiates the development and growth of inflammatory polyps. Cats with inflammatory polyps typically present with either signs of otitis externa and otitis media or with signs consistent with upper airway obstruction. Traditional diagnostics involve imaging of the tympanic bulla either with skull radiographs or computed topography (CT). Treatment consists of traction and avulsion of the polyp with or without ventral bulla osteotomy (VBO) to remove the epithelial lining of the tympanic bulla. The three cases described here are unusual manifestations or presentations of feline inflammatory polyps that address the following issues: (1) concurrent otic and nasopharyngeal polyps, (2) potential association with chronic viral infection, (3) polyp development in the contralateral middle ear, (4) CT appearance of the skull following VBO, and (5) development of secondary pulmonary hypertension.","['MacPhail CM', 'Innocenti CM', 'Kudnig ST', 'Veir JK', 'Lappin MR']",2007,9,3,J Feline Med Surg,"MacPhail CM, et al.

17196671,"Canal atresia: ""surgery or implantable hearing devices? The expert's question is revisited"".","OBJECTIVES: (1) Evaluate hearing results in patients managed with external auditory canal reconstruction; (2) compare results to the expectations from treatment with surgical; placement of an osteo-integrated bone-conduction device (BAHA system); (3) assess complications of both interventions; (4) evaluate the medical cost-effectiveness of each avenue of management at 2005 rates for billings based upon relative value units (RVUs).
METHODS: (1) Retrospective chart review for 36 ears in 29 pediatric patients who underwent surgical canal reconstruction at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital in a major urban center with assessment of management techniques and surgical and audiologic outcomes. (2) Retrospective chart review of six pediatric patients who underwent BAHA placement in a major urban center with assessment of management techniques and surgical and audiologic outcomes. (3) Cost reassessment at 2005 billings rates based upon RVUs for canal reconstruction versus BAHA system and comparative analysis.
RESULTS: (1) The average post-operative hearing loss in the right ear was 34.3 dB left ear was 31.6 dB. The average gain per ear was 17.3 dB. (2) Twenty-seven (93%) of EAC reconstruction patients required some form of amplification post-operatively. (3) Data available for three of the BAHA patients reflected the predicted average gain in dB (predicted 34.3 dB, observed 31.8 dB). (4) Early complications of canal reconstruction included removal of the packing by the patient, post-operative bleeding and post-operative hematoma. (5) Late complications included recurrent canal stenosis, recurrent otitis externa, canal prolapse and canal cholesteatoma. (6) Uncomplicated external auditory canal reconstruction cost $51,505.98 or $2909.94/dB of hearing gain based upon billings fro RVUs. (7) Uncomplicated two-staged BAHA system placement cost $42,448.85 or $1237.57/dB of hearing gain based upon billings for RVUs. (8) Uncomplicated single-staged BAHA system placement cost $28,341.00 or $826.27/dB of hearing gain based upon billings for RVUs.
CONCLUSIONS: Study results indicate that even with significant investments in EAC reconstruction, most patients still required some form of amplification. There are also significant risks of early and late complications from the reconstructive procedure. Studies indicate and our results support that the osteo-integrated bone-conduction device (BAHA system) can achieve truly acceptable hearing (<or=15 dB) in school-aged children with normal bone curves, and it can match the bone-curves for children with sensorineural hearing loss. The two-staged BAHA system placement may be provided at almost one-third the cost to the medical system, on a decibel-for-decibel basis. The single-stage BAHA system placement yields even greater cost savings at just over one-quarter of the cost of surgical EAC reconstruction on a decibel-for-decibel basis. Additionally, there are fewer complications and fewer follow-up visits for the care of the implant system. This is an added value to the parents and patient for the savings in opportunity costs related to the lost time at work and school for office visits and peri-operative care. Overall, it appears that osteo-integrated bone-conduction devices may provide a higher quality of outcome for patients while resulting in significant economic savings.","['Evans AK', 'Kazahaya K']",2007,71,3,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Evans AK and Kazahaya K.

17184455,"Prospective randomised single-blind controlled trial of glacial acetic acid versus glacial acetic acid, neomycin sulphate and dexamethasone spray in otitis externa and infected mastoid cavities.","OBJECTIVES: The literature reports the merits of antibacterial, antibiotic and steroid agents in treating otological infections but no controlled clinical trial has directly compared 2% glacial acetic acid (EarCalm; Stafford-Miller Ltd, Brentford, UK) against 2% glacial acetic acid, 0.1% dexamethasone and 3250 U/ml of neomycin sulphate (Otomize; Stafford-Miller Ltd) in the treatment of otitis externa and infected mastoid cavities.
DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Outpatients, Derby Royal Infirmary, Derby, UK.
PATIENTS: Emergency and GP referrals with acute otitis externa (n = 53) and infected mastoid cavities (n = 56).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Otoscopy was performed at initial randomisation and then at 2 and 4 weeks, the ear assessed for active and inactive disease.
RESULTS: Patients with active otitis externa, 71% (15/21) resolved with glacial acetic acid, dexamethasone and of neomycin sulphate after 2 weeks, increasing to 86% (18/21) after 4 weeks treatment. Patients on glacial acetic acid had only 38% (12/32) resolution after 4 weeks (P < 0.0005). Two per cent glacial acetic acid, dexamethasone and neomycin sulphate resolved only 30% (8/27) of infected mastoid cavities compared to only 10% (3/29) on glacial acetic acid (P < 0.07). A further 2 weeks treatment this increased to 67%, (18/27) with glacial acetic acid, dexamethasone and neomycin sulphate and 48% (14/29) with glacial acetic acid. These results are not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Glacial acetic acid, dexamethasone and neomycin sulphate is significantly more effective in treating otitis externa when compared with glacial acetic acid. This effect failed to be significant in the infected mastoid cavities group. We therefore recommend that in conjunction with aural toilet, antibiotic/steroid combination is more effective than an antibacterial agent for otitis externa.

17183230,"Surveillance for waterborne disease and outbreaks associated with recreational water--United States, 2003-2004.","PROBLEM/CONDITION: Since 1971, CDC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have collaboratively maintained the Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System for collecting and reporting waterborne disease and outbreak (WBDO)-related data. In 1978, WBDOs associated with recreational water (natural and treated water) were added. This system is the primary source of data regarding the scope and effects of WBDOs in the United States.
REPORTING PERIOD: Data presented summarize WBDOs associated with recreational water that occurred during January 2003-December 2004 and one previously unreported outbreak from 2002.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: Public health departments in the states, territories, localities, and the Freely Associated States (i.e., the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, formerly parts of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands) have primary responsibility for detecting, investigating, and voluntarily reporting WBDOs to CDC. Although the surveillance system includes data for WBDOs associated with drinking water, recreational water, and water not intended for drinking, only cases and outbreaks associated with recreational water are summarized in this report.
RESULTS: During 2003-2004, a total 62 WBDOs associated with recreational water were reported by 26 states and Guam. Illness occurred in 2,698 persons, resulting in 58 hospitalizations and one death. The median outbreak size was 14 persons (range: 1-617 persons). Of the 62 WBDOs, 30 (48.4%) were outbreaks of gastroenteritis that resulted from infectious agents, chemicals, or toxins; 13 (21.0%) were outbreaks of dermatitis; and seven (11.3%) were outbreaks of acute respiratory illness (ARI). The remaining 12 WBDOs resulted in primary amebic meningoencephalitis (n = one), meningitis (n = one), leptospirosis (n = one), otitis externa (n = one), and mixed illnesses (n = eight). WBDOs associated with gastroenteritis resulted in 1,945 (72.1%) of 2,698 illnesses. Forty-three (69.4%) WBDOs occurred at treated water venues, resulting in 2,446 (90.7%) cases of illness. The etiologic agent was confirmed in 44 (71.0%) of the 62 WBDOs, suspected in 15 (24.2%), and unidentified in three (4.8%). Twenty (32.3%) WBDOs had a bacterial etiology; 15 (24.2%), parasitic; six (9.7%), viral; and three (4.8%), chemical or toxin. Among the 30 gastroenteritis outbreaks, Cryptosporidium was confirmed as the causal agent in 11 (36.7%), and all except one of these outbreaks occurred in treated water venues where Cryptosporidium caused 55.6% (10/18) of the gastroenteritis outbreaks. In this report, 142 Vibrio illnesses (reported to the Cholera and Other Vibrio Illness Surveillance System) that were associated with recreational water exposure were analyzed separately. The most commonly reported species were Vibrio vulnificus, V. alginolyticus, and V. parahaemolyticus. V. vulnificus illnesses associated with recreational water exposure had the highest Vibrio illness hospitalization (87.2%) and mortality (12.8%) rates.
INTERPRETATION: The number of WBDOs summarized in this report and the trends in recreational water-associated disease and outbreaks are consistent with previous years. Outbreaks, especially the largest ones, are most likely to be associated with summer months, treated water venues, and gastrointestinal illness. Approximately 60% of illnesses reported for 2003-2004 were associated with the seven largest outbreaks (>100 cases). Deficiencies leading to WBDOs included problems with water quality, venue design, usage, and maintenance.
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: CDC uses WBDO surveillance data to 1) identify the etiologic agents, types of aquatic venues, water-treatment systems, and deficiencies associated with outbreaks; 2) evaluate the adequacy of efforts (i.e., regulations and public awareness activities) to provide safe recreational water; and 3) establish public health prevention priorities that might lead to improved regulations and prevention measures at the local, state, and federal levels.","['Dziuban EJ', 'Liang JL', 'Craun GF', 'Hill V', 'Yu PA', 'Painter J', 'Moore MR', 'Calderon RL', 'Roy SL', 'Beach MJ', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)']",2006,55,12,MMWR Surveill Summ,"Dziuban EJ, et al.

Twenty six granulation tissue specimens (twenty two--from chronic otitis media, four--from prolongated otitis externa) taken during surgery were analyzed. The angiogenesis (microvessel density) was measured in paraffin-embedded tissue by an immunohistochemical method, by staining for endothelial cells with a monoclonal antibody against CD 34. The presence of CD 34 was found in all specimens. The expression was more intense in tissue samples from the group with good clinical course (good healing and without recurrence) than those in the group with poor healing and recurrence (mean number of dots for mm2 589,2 vs 533,3, respectively) and from the group without bacterial infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa than those with this infection (mean number of dots for mm2 645,5 vs 440,8, respectively), but differences were not significant. In conclusion it is suggested that angiogenesis may contribute to different clinical course of chronic otitis media.","['Pajor A', 'Jankowski A', 'Danilewicz M', 'Durko T']",2006,60,4,Otolaryngol Pol,"Pajor A, et al.

17145082,The management of general and disease specific ENT problems in children with Epidermolysis Bullosa--a retrospective case note review.,"OBJECTIVE: Epidermolysis Bullosa encompasses a group of inherited disorders characterized by excessive susceptibility of the skin and mucosa to separate from underlying tissues following mechanical trauma. Information in the literature and guidance on the management of Ear, Nose and Throat problems in such children is scarce. The aim of this study is to report the experience of an Ear, Nose and Throat department in a tertiary paediatric hospital linked to a national Epidermolysis Bullosa unit, describing how children have presented and the care that has been given including a theatre protocol aimed at reducing shearing forces.
METHODS: Retrospective case note review of Epidermolysis Bullosa patients referred to Otolaryngology over an 8-year period.
RESULTS: Reviewing notes of 307 EB patients identified 15 that had been referred to the ENT department. Four children with middle ear effusions were effectively treated by watchful waiting or grommets. Three children with otitis externa had some relief from careful microsuction but reinfection from ulcers on other parts of the children's bodies tended to occur. One child with profound sensorineural hearing loss benefited from cochlear implantation but later passed away from unrelated sepsis. One child with intrinsic rhinitis was treated with steroid and then a salt-water nasal spray. Five children had nasal crusting documented, although this was not a specific reason for referral. When severe this had been treated with topical steroids by the dermatology team. One patient with obstructive sleep aponea had tonsillectomy and examination of the post-nasal space. Of the five patients referred with glottic or supraglottic scarring, the management of four included a tracheostomy. When carried out tracheostomy sites healed well in each case. With repeated endoscopic procedures it was subsequently possible to remove the tracheostomy in the two of the children. Using a special theatre protocol no new ulcers were recorded as being precipitated by any of the procedures children underwent.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimal management depends on the support of a multidisciplinary team, including otolaryngologists, pediatricians, dermatologists, anaesthetists, and specialist nurses. Adherence to a protocol for theatre management can help avoid intraoperative complications.","['Hore I', 'Bajaj Y', 'Denyer J', 'Martinez AE', 'Mellerio JE', 'Bibas T', 'Albert D']",2007,71,3,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Hore I, et al.

We report a patient for whom the surgical exploration of the middle ear revealed a benign tumor: a myxoma. These neoplasias are rare tumors in the head and neck region. The typical tumor site is the atrium of heart. In the ear, the tumor grows slowly and remains asymptomatic unless it irritates structures such as the facial nerve or the vestibular organ. Histologically, the tumor presents a ""myxoid"" matrix that is rich in acid mucopolysaccarides. The treatment of choice is complete surgical resection. Using the case presented, we discuss the causality between the tumor and the facial palsy, although during the operation the bony canal of the nerve was found to be intact. In any cases with clinically and radiologically unclear findings of the ear in connection with facial palsy, surgical exposure should be considered.","['Zehlicke T', 'Punke C', 'Haase K', 'Boltze C', 'Pau HW']",2008,56,2,HNO,"Zehlicke T, et al.

17111889,Otitis externa: Review and clinical update.,"Otitis externa can take an acute or a chronic form, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 persons annually and the chronic form affecting 3 to 5 percent of the population. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial (90 percent of cases) or fungal (10 percent of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or to local trauma. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized dermatologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can be followed by canal edema, discharge, and pain, and eventually by extra-canal manifestations. Topical application of an acidifying solution is usually adequate in treating early disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopical is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, and oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or those who are immunocompromised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis.","['Osguthorpe JD', 'Nielsen DR']",2006,74,9,Am Fam Physician,Osguthorpe JD and Nielsen DR.

17111805,[Epidemiologic study on hearing impairment and ear diseases in old people].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of hearing impairment and ear diseases in old people and provide scientific data for drawing up the prevention and treatment strategies.
METHODS: Using the probability proportion to size (PPS) method, 1261 people over 60 years were investigated in 40 clusters in Jiangsu Province with the WHO protocol.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hearing impairment was 58.1% (the standardized rate: 59.5% in the whole country, 60.9% in Jiangsu province). Degrees of hearing impairment were mild (33.1%), moderate (17.8%), severe (5.9%) and profound (1.3%). The prevalence of hearing disability was 25.0% (the standardized rate: 26.6% in the whole country, 28.1% in Jiangsu province). There were significant difference of the prevalence between male and female, as well as urban and rural, and different ages. The prevalence of the ear diseases was auricle malformation (0.2%), wax (1.7%), otitis externa (0.1%), fungi (0.5%), serous otitis media (1.2%), chronic suppurative otitis media (1.6%), dry perforation of tympanic membrance (2.3%). The causes of hearing impairment were ear diseases (2.9%), non-infectious condition (92.6%), genetic condition (0.3%) and undetermined causes (4.2%). Of which, 31.1% of persons needed hearing aids while 2.3% of persons needed medicine treatment, but 0.9% of persons needed non-urgent surgery and 1.0% of persons needed other treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hearing impairment and disability in the old rised obviously than the last investigation in 1987. It was a heavy burden for social development in China. The government and the whole society should take more concern about the problem. The scientific strategies of prevention and treatment were urgently needed and implemented.","['Liu C', 'Bu XK', 'Xing GQ', 'Zhou L', 'Xu X', 'Wang DY', 'Chen ZB', 'Zhou H', 'Tian HQ', 'Li XL', 'Lu L', 'Zhao XN', 'Li FL', 'Tan CQ']",2006,41,9,Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi,"Liu C, et al.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective review of 132 patients with a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis treated from 1998 to 2004 in an academic otology practice.
RESULTS: Otalgia and otorrhea were the most common presenting complaints (48%). Prior otologic procedures increase the risk of developing otomycosis. Residual disease was observed in 13% and recurrence in 15% of the subjects. The presence of a mastoid cavity was associated with higher recurrent and residual disease rates. Topical ketoconazole, cresylate otic drops, and aluminum acetate otic drops were all relatively effective with >80% resolution rate on initial application, although topical ketoconazole had a higher resolution rate and lower rate of disease recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Otomycosis can usually be diagnosed by clinical examination and often occurs in the setting of persistent otorrhea. Complications are not uncommon but usually resolve with application of appropriate topical antifungal agents.

17063708,Outcomes of pituitary tumor irradiation in cats.,"BACKGROUND: Information on tumor control and normal tissue effects of radiotherapy to treat pituitary tumors in cats is limited.
HYPOTHESIS: Radiation therapy is effective in controlling the clinical signs associated with pituitary tumors in cats, with a low incidence of adverse effects.
ANIMALS: Eight cats were irradiated at Colorado State University between 1991 and 2002 for spontaneous pituitary tumors.
METHODS: A retrospective review of records was made to assess tumor control and incidence of radiation-induced adverse effects.
RESULTS: Pituitary carcinoma was diagnosed in 2 cats and pituitary adenoma in 6 cats. Total radiation dosage ranged from 4,500 to 5,400 cGy administered Monday through Friday in 270 or 300 cGy fractions. Acute effects were limited to epilation and mild otitis externa. Focal brain necrosis adjacent to regrowth of a pituitary carcinoma and a second tumor in the radiation field were reported as possible late effects. Median survival, regardless of cause of death of the 8 cats, was 17.4 months (range, 8.4 to 63.1 months). Median survival could not be determined if cats were censored for non-tumor-related causes of death. Six cats were alive at 1 year, and 3 cats were alive at 2 years after treatment. Tumor recurrence was seen in 1 cat with a pituitary carcinoma. Neurologic signs improved within 2 months in all 5 cats that presented with abnormal neurologic signs. Clinical signs caused by a concurrent endocrine disorder began to improve within 1-5 months in the 7 cats with hyperadrenocorticism or acromegaly.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Radiation therapy is an effective primary treatment modality for cats presenting with neurologic signs associated with a pituitary mass and can improve clinical signs associated with concurrent hyperadrenocorticism or acromegaly in cats with no neurologic abnormalities.","['Mayer MN', 'Greco DS', 'LaRue SM']",2006,20,5,J Vet Intern Med,"Mayer MN, et al.

Four S. pseudintermedius strains used for control purposes reacted positively with the S. intermedius nuc PCR showing the close relationship between both species. Investigating the 45 S. intermedius and four S. pseudintermedius strains for the prevalence of the exfoliative toxin SIET encoding gene yielded the presence of the gene for 21 of the S. intermedius and two of the S. pseudintermedius strains. Partial sequencing of the toxin gene of a single S. intermedius strain and comparing this sequence with that obtained from GenBank revealed an almost complete identity. The presence of the exfoliative toxin gene could mainly be found among S. intermedius isolated from skin and wound infections and from otitis externa possibly indicating a role of this toxin for the clinical symptoms.","['Lautz S', 'Kanbar T', 'Alber J', 'Lämmler C', 'Weiss R', 'Prenger-Berninghoff E', 'Zschöck M']",2006,53,9,J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,"Lautz S, et al.

17059629,A long term follow up of conchal flap meatoplasty in chronic otitis externa.,A long-standing diffuse chronic otitis externa can lead to itching. Resultant scratching may then lead to irreversible skin changes with canal stenosis by scar tissue. The poor ventilation and increased humidity gives rise to bacterial and fungal growths leading to breakdown of the skin defences and worsening itching. This vicious itching-scratch cycle or downward spiral often fails to respond to medical treatment. For these cases a simple conchal flap meatoplasty may improve ventilation of the external auditory canal and may lead to a self cleaning ear. We reviewed 84 patients who had undergone conchal flap meatoplasty in Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust Hospitals from April 1993 to June 2002.

17040598,Prospective study of the microbiological flora of hearing aid moulds and the efficacy of current cleaning techniques.,"INTRODUCTION: Wearing hearing aid earmoulds has been implicated as a predisposing factor in the development of chronic otitis externa. Audiologists come into contact with a large number of hearing aid earmoulds and these could potentially harbour pathogenic micro-organisms, with the risk of subsequent cross infection. Cleaning with dilute alcohol is widely used in an attempt to break the chain of infection.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence and nature of microbial flora on hearing aid earmoulds and the efficacy of cleaning methods used to prevent cross infection.
SETTING: Secondary health care within the audiology department of Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.
DESIGN: A prospective, observational study.
METHODS: Hearing aid earmoulds were swabbed before and after cleaning. Samples were cultured to determine qualitatively and quantitatively the microbiological flora present before and after cleaning.
RESULTS: Twenty out of 21 (95 per cent) earmoulds had microbes present and, of these, 19/20 (95 per cent) had a polymicrobial profile. Coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were the most frequent microbial isolates, but pathogenic bacteria and fungi were also demonstrated on earmoulds both before and after cleaning.
CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial flora, including recognized pathogens, that colonizes earmoulds may lead to chronic otitis externa. Cleaning with 70 per cent alcohol solution was ineffective, in particular for pathogenic fungi on earmoulds.","['Ahmad N', 'Etheridge C', 'Farrington M', 'Baguley DM']",2007,121,2,J Laryngol Otol,"Ahmad N, et al.

17031764,[Malignant external otitis].,"Malignant external otitis or skull base osteomyelitis and osteoradionecrosis of the skull base and the skull are potentially life-threatening conditions. The standard methods of treatment involve the use of antibiotics, local treatment and, where necessary, surgical excision of necrotic tissue. These approaches do not provide a complete cure in many cases. Severe functional deficits and even death can occur in advanced stages. We conducted a long-term retrospective follow-up study and report on a multimodal approach that we have been using with great success since 1987. The four cornerstones of this treatment are surgical debridement, combinations of antibiotics, specific immunoglobulins, and adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This multimodal treatment approach has proved to be highly effective in improving the survival and quality of life of the patients concerned.

17031324,Infective causes of facial nerve paralysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the functional recovery in a cohort of patients with facial nerve paralysis (FNP) due to infective cause.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review based on patients identified from a prospectively maintained database of patients with FNP. The case notes of identified patients were reviewed.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: The patients were identified from a database of 1074 patients with FNP. One hundred twenty of the 150 patients identified as having FNP due to an infectious disease caused by herpes zoster oticus were excluded from the study. The remaining 30 patients were included in the study.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated both operatively and nonoperatively. Operative treatment included myringotomy and ventilation tube placement, cortical mastoidectomy, modified radical (canal wall down) mastoidectomy, petrous apicectomy, and lateral temporal bone resection.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This study used the House-Brackmann (HB) grade of facial function at 1 year after initial assessment. The patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database of all patients presenting with FNP to a single specialist otolaryngologist (G.R.C.) between June 1988 and April 2005. The database contains information including demographic details, dates of presentation, diagnostic modalities used, diagnosis, interventions, and HB grade. The patients in this series presented between August 4, 1989 and August 26, 2003.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with 30 facial nerve paralyses were identified. The causes of FNP were acute otitis media (n = 10); cholesteatoma (n = 10 [acquired, 7; congenital, 3]); mastoid cavity infections (n = 2); malignant otitis externa (n = 2); noncholesteatomatous chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM; n = 2); tuberculous mastoiditis (n = 1); suppurative parotitis (n = 1); and chronic granulomatosis (n = 1). The patients with noncholesteatomatous CSOM who presented sooner after the onset of facial nerve symptoms had greater facial nerve recovery when assessed using the HB grade at 1 year.
CONCLUSION: FNP due to infective causes other than herpes zoster oticus is rare. Patients with noncholesteatomatous CSOM and FNP have a better outcome than those with FNP due to cholesteatoma. Patients with FNP due to acute otitis media tend to have a good prognosis without surgical decompression of the facial nerve being required.","['Makeham TP', 'Croxson GR', 'Coulson S']",2007,28,1,Otol Neurotol,"Makeham TP, et al.

17021784,The use of trichloroacetic acid in the treatment of acute external otitis.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in the treatment of acute external otitis (AEO) in comparison with a standard clinical treatment. All patients who consecutively presented in our emergencies with AEO during the summer months of the previous year were included in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups: the study group included 117 patients treated with TCA and the control group included 98 patients treated with ear drops containing antibiotic and corticosteroid. Occasionally, an antibiotic was administered orally for 7 days, in severe cases of AEO. All patients were evaluated on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10, whereas another review appointment was given 20 days later. Outcome measures included evaluation of efficacy using a six-step infection score and tolerability by visual analogue scale. Additionally, adverse reactions, complications and recurrencies were recorded. Treatment was successful for all patients of the study group, whereas 8 failures were found in the control group. The infection score improved faster in the study group than in the control group, resulting in an earlier clinical cure (mean 4.1 and 8.6 days, respectively). Tolerability was significantly better in the study group, on all points of evaluation. Complications and adverse reactions were minimal on both groups. Our results show that TCA is a very effective and nontoxic agent for the treatment of AEO. Rapid pain relief and prevention of recurrencies are its main advantages.","['Kantas I', 'Balatsouras DG', 'Vafiadis M', 'Apostolidou MT', 'Pournaras A', 'Danielidis V']",2007,264,1,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Kantas I, et al.

16995959,Resistance of Pseudomonas to ciprofloxacin: implications for the treatment of malignant otitis externa.,"For fifteen years oral ciprofloxacin has been the standard treatment for malignant otitis externa, a sometimes fatal osteomyelitis of the skull base usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Resistance to ciprofloxacin is developing. Over a 16-month period, we saw five cases where malignant otitis externa progressed, with the development of cranial nerve palsies in four cases, despite oral ciprofloxacin. Prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy became necessary. One case was managed largely as an out-patient, but four patients spent many weeks in hospital. Only two cases had diabetes and this was monitored and controlled. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four of the five cases, but antibiotic sensitivity to ciprofloxacin was not determined. In one case a later isolate was tested and found to be ciprofloxacin resistant. Progress was monitored by serial C-reactive protein (CRP) and white cell count. For diagnosis and assessing response to treatment we considered serial magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography more useful than isotope bone scan. There must be a readiness to use intravenous antibiotics, as a response to ciprofloxacin can no longer be assumed. Bacterial isolates must be tested for sensitivity to antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, and further biopsy and culture are essential if treatment fails.","['Bernstein JM', 'Holland NJ', 'Porter GC', 'Maw AR']",2007,121,2,J Laryngol Otol,"Bernstein JM, et al.

16985477,Granular myringitis: Incidence and clinical characteristics.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence and the clinical features of granular myringitis (GM).
STUDY DESIGN: A 2-year prospective cohort study.
SETTING: A primary otolaryngology clinic affiliated with a tertiary academic referral center.
PATIENTS: All-aged patients diagnosed with GM who had no apparent middle ear disease or did not undergo ear surgery.
INTERVENTION: Otoscopy and bacteriologic and histopathologic studies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Granular myringitis was noted in 0.41% of patient's population presenting different forms.
RESULTS: Granular myringitis was detected in 26 patients. Recurrent infection occurred in seven (26.9%) and bilateral GM in five patients (19.2%). Perforation of the tympanic membrane (TM) was noted in eight patients (30.7%), six of which closed spontaneously. Otoscopic findings could be classified into three grades: focal de-epithelization (in 10), focal polypoid granulations (in 13), and diffuse polypoid formation over the entire TM (in 3). Histopathologic examination disclosed tiny fragments of granulation tissue infiltrated by nonspecific chronic and acute inflammatory reaction.
CONCLUSION: Granular myringitis is encountered not infrequently in primary otolaryngology practice and presented different forms, recurrent episodes, and bilateral involvement. Topical application of antibiotics or caustic agents was successful in all cases. Perforation of the TM may develop and resolve spontaneously during the course of the disease.","['Wolf M', 'Primov-Fever A', 'Barshack I', 'Polack-Charcon S', 'Kronenberg J']",2006,27,8,Otol Neurotol,"Wolf M, et al.

Twice-daily topical treatment with ofloxacin otic solution (0.3% [Floxin otic solution]) for 10 days has been reported to be as effective and well tolerated as neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone otic suspension (Cortisporin otic suspension) administered four times daily for 10 days.
OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy, safety, and ear-pain resolution of once-daily ofloxacin otic solution (0.3%) versus neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone otic suspension administered four times daily, in children with OE. RESEARCH DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, evaluator-blinded study was conducted at 34 centers in 278 pediatric OE patients aged 6 months to 12 years. Patients received five drops of ofloxacin otic solution (0.3%) in the affected ears once daily or three drops of neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone otic suspension four times daily, for 7-10 days. Patient evaluations were performed at pretherapy (day 1), end of therapy (days 7-9), and test of cure (7-10 days post-treatment) visits. Data for 208 patients were clinically evaluable and those for 90 patients were microbiologically evaluable. Scores were obtained for patient assessments of pain severity.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The overall clinical response was cure in the clinically evaluable patients, demonstrated by resolution of OE signs and symptoms at the test of cure visit. The overall clinical-microbiological response was cure in the microbiologically evaluable patients demonstrated by both clinical cure and microbiological eradication.
RESULTS: For the clinically evaluable patients, equivalent cure rates were obtained between the once-daily ofloxacin-treated and four-times-daily neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone-treated patients (93.8% and 94.7%, respectively). For the clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients, the overall cure rates were 96.4% versus 97.1% for the ofloxacin-treated and neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone-treated patients, respectively. The eradication rates for the prevalent pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 98% versus 100% for ofloxacin-treated and neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone-treated patients, respectively. Decreases in pain severity were similar in both treatment groups. Statistical analyses were limited by the small numbers of patients in each treatment group.
CONCLUSION: In the treatment of OE in children, once-daily ofloxacin otic solution was as effective and safe as neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone otic suspension given four times daily. The two treatments provide rapid and comparable pain relief; however, ofloxacin otic solution does not have the risk of ototoxicity associated with neomycin and provides effective pain relief without adjunctive steroids.",['Schwartz RH'],2006,22,9,Curr Med Res Opin,"Schwartz RH.

16934209,Medical illnesses and injuries encountered during surfing.,"Surfing is an exciting sport enjoyed in many coastal communities around the globe. Participants are prone to various conditions ranging from acute injuries to conditions borne from chronic environmental exposure. Lacerations, contusions, sprains, and fractures are the common types of acute traumatic injury. Injury from the rider's own surfboard is the prevailing mechanism of injury. Interaction with marine animals may lead to injury through envenomation. Although jellyfish stings are common, no definitive treatment strategy has been proven most effective in dealing with such stings. Exposure to jellyfish and other nematocyst-containing larvae can cause a reaction known as seabather's eruption. Stingrays and coral reefs present further hazards to the surfboard rider. Infection of wounds is often seen and should be treated with fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporins to cover Vibrio species, along with Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Otologic sequelae of surfing include auditory exostoses, ruptured tympanic membrane, and otitis externa.","['Taylor KS', 'Zoltan TB', 'Achar SA']",2006,5,5,Curr Sports Med Rep,"Taylor KS, et al.

16916355,"Evaluation of a local anesthetic delivery system for the postoperative analgesic management of canine total ear canal ablation--a randomized, controlled, double-blinded study.","OBJECTIVE: To determine if a constant rate local anesthetic delivery system is more effective than continuous intravenous (IV) morphine infusion for postoperative analgesia.
ANIMALS: Twenty client-owned dogs undergoing total ear canal ablation.
METHODS: Dogs were randomly assigned to the lidocaine group (LID) or the morphine group (MOR). The LID group received a constant rate infusion of lidocaine locally and a continuous IV infusion of saline, while the MOR group received a constant rate infusion of saline locally and a continuous IV infusion of morphine. The primary investigator evaluated each patient and determined a hospital behavior score, anesthesia recovery score, preoperative pain score, and serial postoperative pain and sedation scores over 38 hours. Pain and sedation observations were videotaped and scored by three additional evaluators. Evaluators were blinded to treatment assignments.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, weight, hospital behavior scores or anesthesia recovery scores. The primary investigator's pain scores were not significantly different, but sedation scores were significantly lower for the LID group. Sedation and pain scores by the video evaluators were not significantly different between groups. Kappa agreement between observers was poor, but better agreement was noted between sedation scores than pain scores. Drug-related complications were significantly lower in the LID group (n = 0) compared with the MOR group (n = 5). Wound complications were not significantly different (LID = 4, MOR = 4). Intravenous delivery complications occurred in 12 (60%) patients. Local delivery complications occurred in five (25%) dogs. Delivery complications were not significantly different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Continuous incisional lidocaine delivery was an equipotent and viable method of providing postoperative analgesia compared with IV morphine. Lidocaine delivery resulted in a trend toward lower pain scores, significantly lower sedation scores, and no dogs requiring analgesic rescue. Wound complications secondary to local infusion were minor and self-limiting. Drug-related complications occurred only in the MOR group.","['Wolfe TM', 'Bateman SW', 'Cole LK', 'Smeak DD']",2006,33,5,Vet Anaesth Analg,"Wolfe TM, et al.

16842307,Presentation and management of aural foreign bodies in two Australian emergency departments.,"OBJECTIVE: To survey and compare the type and management of foreign bodies found in adult and paediatric ears presenting to an Australian otorhinolaryngology and a general ED.
METHODS: Retrospective case study with data collated from two centres. Chart reviews of a total of 330 patients presenting with aural foreign bodies to the ED of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital and the ED of The Bendigo Hospital, both situated in the state of Victoria, Australia, were surveyed for patient demographics, foreign body description and referral and removal pattern.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventeen adults and 113 children were included in the study. The most common foreign bodies in children were beads, cotton tips, insects and paper, and in adults cotton tips, insects, cotton wool and silicone ear plugs. Flying insects were far more common in the Australian population than cockroaches found in surveys in other countries. Children were significantly more likely to have initially been seen by their Local Medical Officer than adults (P < 0.001) and to require a general anaesthetic for removal of the object(s) (P < 0.001). Adults were more likely to have associated otitis externa at the time of presentation (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Aural foreign bodies are a frequent presentation to the ED. Recognition of patients requiring early specialist referral is important. Adults present with a different profile of aural foreign objects to children and require different management. The use of cotton tips or cotton wool in the external ear canal and silicone ear plugs should be discouraged.","['Ryan C', 'Ghosh A', 'Wilson-Boyd B', 'Smit D', ""O'Leary S""]",2006,18,4,Emerg Med Australas,"Ryan C, et al.

OBSERVATION: A 65-year-old diabetic man was treated for invasive otitis externa complicated by destructive osteomyelitis of the ipsilateral temporomandibular joint. The diagnosis was suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging. The course was favorable with medical treatment.
DISCUSSION: Osteomyelitis is an extremely unusual complication of invasive otitis externa. Diffusion of the infection toward the temporomandibular joint can be secondary to an osteitis of the bony canal or spread via congenital dehiscences of the external auditory canal.

16783712,Comparison of 4 fixation and staining methods for the cytologic evaluation of ear canals with clinical evidence of ceruminous otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Swab cytology of ear canals is one of the most useful and rapid methods to assess the presence of external ear infections. Smears are generally stained with rapid Romanowsky-type stains, with or without prior heat fixation.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare 4 different methods of fixation and staining of ear swab cytology samples from dogs.
METHODS: Eight dogs with otitis externa were selected from a dermatology referral population. A cotton swab was used to obtain ceruminous material from 12 ear canals. Four smears of each swab were prepared on glass slides (randomly identified as A, B, C, or D) and air-dried for cytologic examination. Samples marked A were stained with Dip Quick (Jorgensen Laboratories Inc, Loveland, CO, USA) after heat fixation; samples marked B were stained without heat fixation; samples marked C were heat-fixed and dipped only in the counterstain (the blue reagent) of Dip Quick; and samples marked D were dipped only in the counterstain, without heat fixation. Ten high-power fields (hpf; X100 oil immersion objective) in each slide were evaluated by 2 observers, and total numbers of keratinocytes, yeast, bacteria, and neutrophils were counted. Statistical comparison was performed using an ANOVA model applied after verifying the normal distribution of the data, and using nonparametric sign tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed in the numbers of keratinocytes, yeast, bacteria, or neutrophils among the 4 staining methods (P > .05), although significant interobserver differences were found.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that heat fixation does not improve the quality of ceruminous ear swab samples for cytologic evaluation, and propose a 1-step dip in the blue reagent alone as a rapid method of staining samples from canine ear canals.","['Toma S', 'Cornegliani L', 'Persico P', 'Noli C']",2006,35,2,Vet Clin Pathol,"Toma S, et al.

16755477,Outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection in a neonatal intensive care unit epidemiologically linked to a healthcare worker with chronic otitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the investigation and interventions necessary to contain an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and infection in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
DESIGN: Retrospective case finding that involved prospective performance of surveillance cultures for detection of MRSA and molecular typing of MRSA by repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR).
SETTING: Level III NICU in a tertiary care center.
PARTICIPANTS: Three neonates in a NICU were identified with MRSA bloodstream infection on April 16, 2004. A point prevalence survey identified 6 additional colonized neonates (attack rate, 75% [9 of 12 neonates]). The outbreak strain was phenotypically unusual.
INTERVENTIONS: Cohorting and mupirocin therapy were initiated for neonates who had acquired MRSA during the outbreak. Contact precautions were introduced in the NICU, and healthcare workers (HCWs) were retrained in cleaning and disinfection procedures and hand hygiene. Noncolonized neonates and newly admitted patients had surveillance cultures performed 3 times per week.
RESULTS: Two new colonized neonates were identified 1 month later. HCW X, who had worked in the NICU since June 2003, was identified as having chronic otitis. MRSA was isolated from cultures of swab specimens from HCW X's ear canal and nares. HCW X was epidemiologically linked to the outbreak. Molecular typing (by rep-PCR) confirmed that the isolates from HCW X and from the neonates were more than 90% similar. Retrospective review of NICU isolates revealed that the outbreak strain was initially cultured from a neonate 2 months after HCW X began working on the unit. The epidemic strain was eradicated after removing HCW X from patient care in the NICU.
CONCLUSION: An outbreak of MRSA colonization and infection in a NICU was epidemiologically linked to a HCW with chronic otitis externa and nasal colonization with MRSA. Eradication was not achieved until removal of HCW X from the NICU. Routine surveillance for MRSA may have allowed earlier recognition of the outbreak and is now standard practice in our NICU.","['Bertin ML', 'Vinski J', 'Schmitt S', 'Sabella C', 'Danziger-Isakov L', 'McHugh M', 'Procop GW', 'Hall G', 'Gordon SM', 'Goldfarb J']",2006,27,6,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,"Bertin ML, et al.

SAMPLE POPULATION: Organisms were collected from ear swab specimens from the external and middle ear and included Staphylococcus spp (n = 11; Staphylococcus intermedius [7] and Staphylococcus spp [4]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Proteus spp (5), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (11), and 1 control strain of each organism.
PROCEDURES: 3 test solutions were evaluated including EDTA, tromethamine, and benzyl alcohol (ER); EDTA and tromethamine (ER without benzyl alcohol [ER - BA]); and purified water. Ten-milliliter aliquots of each test solution were transferred into 36 tubes and inoculated with one of the organisms. Samples were retrieved from each tube at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, transferred to Petri dishes, mixed with soybean-casein digest agar, and incubated. After incubation, plates were examined for growth, and the number of colonies was expressed as CFU per milliliter.
RESULTS: ER significantly decreased bacterial growth in vitro of P aeruginosa and beta-hemolytic streptococcal organisms within 15 minutes, Proteus spp within 30 minutes, and Staphylococcus spp within 60 minutes. Comparatively, the presence of benzyl alcohol in ER significantly decreased bacterial growth of beta-hemolytic streptococcus and Proteus spp.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: On the basis of results of this study, future studies should be performed to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of ER alone as a treatment for otic infections caused by beta-hemolytic streptococcus, P aeruginosa, and Proteus spp and of ER combined with an antimicrobial agent for otic infections caused by Staphylococcus spp.","['Cole LK', 'Luu DH', 'Rajala-Schultz PJ', 'Meadows C', 'Torres AH']",2006,67,6,Am J Vet Res,"Cole LK, et al.

Otoscopic examination revealed granulation tissue and a greyish-black tumour with irregular surface. The first patient had previously been diagnosed with otitis externa with persistent ear itching for the past three years. The second patient had received tympanoplasty for treatment of chronic otitis media on the right ear ten years ago. The first case was treated with wide excision, whereas the second patient received resection of the skin of the EAC together with its adjacent soft tissue, followed by skin grafting. No tumour recurrence was noted in the fourth and third post-operative year for the first and second patient respectively. We suggest that EAC carcinoma can be detected early and treated.","['Shu MT', 'Lin HC', 'Yang CC', 'Chang KM']",2006,120,8,J Laryngol Otol,"Shu MT, et al.

16713420,MRI findings and spreading patterns of necrotizing external otitis: is a poor outcome predictable?,"AIM: To evaluate spreading patterns of necrotizing external otitis (NEO) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to identify spreading patterns related to a poor outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with NEO were divided into good and poor outcome groups according to their final clinical outcomes. Initial MRI images were retrospectively reviewed for regional abnormalities, and follow-up MRI images were reviewed for ICA flow void abnormality and for the following five spreading patterns: medial, crossed, anterior, intracranial, and combined. The frequencies of the abnormal flow void or spreading patterns were compared between the good and poor response groups.
RESULTS: Seven (50%) and seven (50%) patients were respectively allocated to the good and poor outcome groups. Retrocondylar fat infiltration was the most commonest finding on initial MRI images (93%). The frequencies of the abnormal flow void and spreading patterns in the good and poor groups, respectively, were: abnormal flow void, 0 and four (57%); anterior, two (29%) and three (43%); medial, six (86%) and seven (100%); crossed, six (86%) and seven (100%); intracranial middle cranial fossa, one (14%) and four (57%); intracranial posterior cranial fossa, four (57%) and six (86%); intracranial foramen magnum, one (14%) and six (86%).
CONCLUSIONS: NEO almost always involves the retrocondylar fat and spreads via various pathways to extracranial or intracranial spaces. The presence of an abnormal flow void and intracranial dural enhancement, particularly in the middle cranial fossa and foramen magnum, may indicate a poor prognosis.","['Kwon BJ', 'Han MH', 'Oh SH', 'Song JJ', 'Chang KH']",2006,61,6,Clin Radiol,"Kwon BJ, et al.

A bioassay-guided fractionation of this plant material showed that some extracts have potent anti-inflammatory activities. Further fractionation led to the isolation and identification of betulinic acid, a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids, and the 2alpha-hydroxy derivatives alphitolic, asiatic, and corosolic acids. The latter three were evaluated in vivo in the mouse ear assay for their topical anti-inflammatory activity, inducing inflammation with either arachidonic acid (AA) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA). Only corosolic acid was active in the AA assay, with similar potency to nimesulide, but all three triterpene acids inhibited TPA-induced inflammation with potencies comparable to that of indomethacin.","['Aguirre MC', 'Delporte C', 'Backhouse N', 'Erazo S', 'Letelier ME', 'Cassels BK', 'Silva X', 'Alegría S', 'Negrete R']",2006,14,16,Bioorg Med Chem,"Aguirre MC, et al.

In practice, otic examinations of horses are rarely done due to the perceived difficulty in visualizing the equine external ear canal and tympanic membrane, as well as the need for chemical restraint. In this study, the proximal external ear canal was examined in live horses using a handheld otoscope and in cadaver heads using video otoscopy. Visualization of the proximal ear canal of the sedated horse could be done with a handheld otoscope, but more sedation or general anaesthesia and a video otoscope would be required to adequately visualize the tympanic membrane in the live horse. The proximal ear canals of 18 horses were examined cytologically and cultured aerobically. In three horses, both ears were sampled. No cells or organisms were seen on cytological examination of 11/21 ears. Nine of the 21 ears were sterile when cultured. Ten of the 21 ears had mixed growth with low numbers of organisms (Corynebacterium sp. being most common). Two of the 21 ears had heavy growth of a single organism (Corynebacterium sp. and Staphylococcus intermedius, respectively). Equine cadaver heads were examined in cross-section by computed tomography (CT) imaging and histopathology in order to further understand the anatomy of the equine external ear canal.

DESIGN: A retrospective postal questionnaire sent to BAHA patients, with two month waiting time and one reminder, combined with case note analysis. Results compared by appropriate statistical tests with published outcomes data from the largest UK series.
SETTING: Public sector (National Health Service) district general hospital, England. Catchment population: 300,000 (mixed rural and small towns).
PARTICIPANTS: Case note analysis of sixty-three patients implanted between 1994 and 2003 (age range, six to 88 years). The commonest indication was chronic otitis media, with inability to wear a conventional hearing aid. Otitis externa, otosclerosis and sensorineural hearing loss were other indications. The questionnaire was sent to 59 patients who had worn their aid for at least six months; it was returned by 41 (69 per cent).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glasgow benefit inventory (GBI, change in health status following otolaryngological intervention); incidence of complications.
RESULTS: Bone-anchored hearing aid implantation significantly improved quality of life as measured by the GBI (p<0.001). The degree of improvement was similar to that achieved in Birmingham by Proops et al. (p>0.05, chi-squared test). Minor temporary skin infection was common (33 per cent). Thickening of the skin around the implant occurred in 17 per cent. One implant (2 per cent) failed. There were no serious complications.

16638474,Systematic review of topical antimicrobial therapy for acute otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of topical antimicrobials for acute otitis externa.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials with parallel groups permitting one or more of the following comparisons: antimicrobial vs placebo, antiseptic vs antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic vs nonquinolone antibiotic, steroid-antimicrobial vs antimicrobial, or antimicrobial-steroid vs steroid.
RESULTS: Twenty trials met inclusion criteria and 18 had data suitable for pooling. Topical antimicrobials increased absolute clinical cure rates over placebo by 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29% to 63%) and bacteriologic cure rates by 61% (95% CI, 46% to 76%). No significant differences were noted in clinical cure rates for other comparisons, except that steroid alone increased cure rates by 20% compared with steroid plus antibiotic (95% CI, 3% to 38%). Quinolone drops increased bacteriologic cure rates by 8% compared with nonquinolone antibiotics (95% CI, 1% to 16%), but had statistically equivalent rates of clinical cure and adverse events.
CONCLUSION: Topical antimicrobial is highly effective for acute otitis externa with clinical cure rates of 65% to 80% within 10 days of therapy. Minor differences were noted in comparative efficacy, but broad confidence limits containing small effect sizes make these of questionable clinical significance.

16638473,Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.
STUDY DESIGN: In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.
RESULTS: The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.
CONCLUSION: This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

In many cases conventional therapy has been prolonged, intensive and relatively ineffective, especially in infections other than bacterial (mainly fungal). We presented theoretical principles of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment in MEO, our own experience and others' experience in applying this treatment method. We treated eight patients with MEO applying pharmacotherapy, topical management, surgery in one case and also adjunct HBO. In six patients, infection was caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in one by Staphylococcus sp. and in one by Aspergillus sp. Complete recovery was achieved in seven patients. In the patient with MEO caused by Aspergillus sp., intracranial complications developed and the patient died. Our experiences in employing HBO in bacterial-caused MEO have confirmed the role of HBO as a valuable, beneficial, supporting classical treatment method. Small number of patients with MEO, especially with non-bacterial infection, and unforeseen clinical course of disease make our experience difficult to objectivize.","['Narozny W', 'Kuczkowski J', 'Stankiewicz C', 'Kot J', 'Mikaszewski B', 'Przewozny T']",2006,263,7,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Narozny W, et al.

16624600,Fibrin sealant as a treatment for canine aural haematoma: a case history.,"Aural haematomas occur commonly in dogs in which predisposing factors include trauma to the pinna, a history of violent head shaking, and acute or chronic otitis externa. Treatment usually involves invasive surgery performed under general anaesthesia but these techniques can create wounds requiring intensive aftercare. Furthermore, certain breeds of dog and/or older animals are often at greater risk due to complications arising from the use of anaesthetics. Therefore, a need exists for a less invasive procedure which can be performed easily in general practice and with minimal reliance on anaesthetics. Fibrin sealants fulfil these criteria and have been used successfully to treat aural haematomas in humans. This is the first known report on the use of fibrin sealant to treat a canine aural haematoma. In the present case, the haematoma recurred shortly after removal of the protective collar, and was subsequently treated by conventional surgery. Possible reasons for initial success of the fibrin sealant and then later recurrence of the haematoma (e.g. premature removal of the collar) are discussed.","['Blättler U', 'Harlin O', 'Mattison RG', 'Rampelberg F']",2007,173,3,Vet J,"Blättler U, et al.

Thirty dogs with end-stage otitis externa undergoing unilateral total ear canal ablation were enrolled. The dogs were randomized to one of four enrofloxacin-treatment groups or to the control group. Each dog in the treatment groups received two intravenous doses of enrofloxacin prior to surgical removal of the middle-ear tissue while the control group did not receive any enrofloxacin. One dog was excluded from the study as no middle-ear tissue was removed during surgery. Twenty-four dogs were in the enrofloxacin-treatment groups and five dogs were in the control group. In 12 of 29 dogs (41.4%), 14 of 82 (17.1%) of bacteria had discrepancies in DDT results for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Discrepancies between the control group and treatment groups were not significantly different even though the percentage of discrepancies for the combined treatment group was 19.4% compared to 6.7% for the control group. In this study, ciprofloxacin DDT results were not an accurate indicator of the in vitro susceptibility of enrofloxacin for bacteria isolated from the middle-ear tissue of dogs with end-stage otitis.","['Cole LK', 'Kwochka KW', 'Hillier A', 'Kowalski JJ', 'Smeak DD', 'Kelbick NT']",2006,17,2,Vet Dermatol,"Cole LK, et al.

The aim of this study was to quantify and compare the ceruminolytic activity of commercially available canine ear cleansers. For this purpose, the ceruminolytic activity of 13 ear cleansers was evaluated using a standardized synthetic cerumen (SSC) that mimics the composition and texture of canine cerumen. The test products were incubated with mild agitation for 20 min with 500 mg of SSC previously compacted at the bottom of a test tube. Ceruminolytic activity was then assessed by quantifying the SSC removed by decantation. This procedure was repeated five consecutive times on each tube simulating repeated applications in the canine ear canal. Good repeatability among replicates was found in this assay, allowing direct comparisons between products. The final percentage of SSC elimination ranged from none (similar to water), between 8 and 39% for three products and up to 90% for one product (P<0.001). It is concluded that, in the experimental conditions used in this study, only 1/13 products had significant ceruminolytic activity.","['Sánchez-Leal J', 'Mayós I', 'Homedes J', 'Ferrer L']",2006,17,2,Vet Dermatol,"Sánchez-Leal J, et al.

16436987,Long-term assessment after implantation of the Vibrant Soundbridge device.,"OBJECTIVE: To present long-term results with a semi-implantable middle ear implant, the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB), and analyze pre- and post-operative results of audiologic tests.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review with additional patient interview and audiologic testing.
SETTING: One tertiary referral center.
SUBJECTS: Twenty patients who met the selection criteria of the manufacturer were evaluated at least two years after implantation.
INTERVENTIONS: Monaural Implantation of the VSB in 20 patients, in two of these 20 patients implantation of the second ear in a second stage.
RESULTS: Assessment of benefit and satisfaction using the standardized International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids, the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, and Visual Analogue Scales in all patients. Fifteen patients agreed to undergo audiologic testing at follow-up including pure-tone- and speech audiometry in silence and noise. The majority of patients (13/20) reported to be satisfied or very satisfied with the VSB. Aided speech perception was comparable between the VSB and the hearing aid preoperatively. When compared to the preoperative audiograms, residual hearing from 0.5-4 kHz was significantly worse in the operated ear with 8 dB (Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.001) but only 2.6 dB in the non-operated ear (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p > 0.05). Major surgical complications did not occur. Permanent alteration in taste occurred in three patients and revision surgery was necessary in another three patients.
CONCLUSION: Satisfaction with the VSB was not superior to conventional hearing aids in subjective and in audiometric terms. Because of its impact on residual hearing and the requirement of implantation middle ear surgery, implantation of the VSB should be limited to patients with relevant side effects of hearing aids, e.g., severe chronic otitis externa.","['Schmuziger N', 'Schimmann F', 'àWengen D', 'Patscheke J', 'Probst R']",2006,27,2,Otol Neurotol,"Schmuziger N, et al.

16431060,Analysis of 95 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the external and middle ear.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics, 5-year survival, and prognostic factors of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the external and middle ear.
METHODS: A multi institutional study. Ninety five cases of patients from 10 institutions were reviewed on their age and sex distribution, initial complaints, stages, tumor locations, treatments, and outcomes. Prognostic factors were discussed based on the Pittsburgh staging system.
RESULTS: This disease seems to appear in the elderly with a peak age of 50-69 years. Males appear to be more predisposed than females with an odd ratio of 1.7. The initial complaints were not typical, while 12.6% of patients presented a history of recurrent otitis externa or chronic otitis media. Regional metastasis was recognized in 13.7% of patients, while no distant metastasis was confirmed. SCC located in the external ear could be detected in an earlier stage than that in the middle ear. The overall 5-year survival was 66.8% in total, and decreased significantly with stage. SCC in stages I and II was susceptible to each therapeutic strategy with a 5-year survival of 100%. Operation combined with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy was the major treatment for stages III and IV SCC, while radiotherapy and chemotherapy were applied mainly for those who had been considered inappropriate for operation. The overall survival was 67.2% for stage III and 29.5% for stage IV, and operation with pathologically tumor free margin could improve the survival to 72.7% when combined with radio- and chemotherapy. Stage, completeness of operation with tumor free margin, recurrence, and metastasis have significant influence on survival.
CONCLUSION: Local infiltration seems to be the main behavior of SCC in the external and middle ear. Early diagnosis and treatment were important because SCC in the earlier stage is susceptible to be cured. For tumors of advanced stage, operation should be performed with pathologically tumor free margin, and operation combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy could improve the survival. Tumor stage adds more influence on survival than its location. Recurrence and metastasis mainly occur in advanced stages and result in a poor survival.","['Yin M', 'Ishikawa K', 'Honda K', 'Arakawa T', 'Harabuchi Y', 'Nagabashi T', 'Fukuda S', 'Taira A', 'Himi T', 'Nakamura N', 'Tanaka K', 'Ichinohe M', 'Shinkawa H', 'Nakada Y', 'Sato H', 'Shiga K', 'Kobayashi T', 'Watanabe T', 'Aoyagi M', 'Ogawa H', 'Omori K']",2006,33,3,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Yin M, et al.

16429984,Comparative performance of radiography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of middle ear disease in 31 dogs.,"The purpose of this study was to compare computed tomography (CT) and radiography for diagnosing the presence and severity of middle ear disease in dogs with a history of chronic otitis externa. Thirty-one dogs undergoing a total ear canal ablation and bulla osteotomy were studied. Three normal dogs served as controls. All dogs were examined using radiography and CT. Three radiologists independently evaluated imaging studies in random order. A visual analog scale method was used for scoring certainty and severity of middle ear disease. Surgical findings were recorded intra-operatively. Bulla lining samples were submitted for histopathologic evaluation and scored by a single pathologist who also used a visual analog scale system. Findings from both imaging modalities agreed more closely with surgical findings than with histopathologic findings. With either surgical or histopathologic findings as the gold standard, CT was more sensitive than and as specific as radiographs for predicting presence and severity of middle ear disease. Observer performance with CT was more consistent than the performance with radiographs in the detection of changes that occur with middle ear disease. Both radiography and CT were more accurate for predicting the severity of the disease than its presence. Findings indicate that CT is more accurate and reliable than radiography in diagnosing middle ear disease for dogs having concurrent otitis externa, but only when severity of disease is moderate or high. With low severity of disease, diagnostic certainty for both modalities becomes more variable.","['Rohleder JJ', 'Jones JC', 'Duncan RB', 'Larson MM', 'Waldron DL', 'Tromblee T']",2006,47,1,Vet Radiol Ultrasound,"Rohleder JJ, et al.

METHODS: Retrospective case study at two tertiary referral centers with presentation of nine patients with otologic involvement of RP, review of the spectrum of otologic disorders seen, and treatment.
RESULTS: The clinical course of otologic manifestations of RP was highly variable and ranged from mild to moderate. In 6/9 patients there was an association with other autoimmune disorders. In addition to recurrent auricular chondritis, which was present in 8/9 patients, our patients had otitis externa, chronic myringitis, Eustachian tube dysfunction, conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus. All patients had their diagnosis of RP made on the basis of their otologic involvement and the response to systemic corticosteroids.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of RP is primarily clinical, but laboratory studies and biopsy may contribute as well. Once the diagnosis is suspected, the otolaryngologist should consider consultation with a rheumatologist to assist in the management of additional systemic manifestations.","['Bachor E', 'Blevins NH', 'Karmody C', 'Kühnel T']",2006,33,2,Auris Nasus Larynx,"Bachor E, et al.

16397383,Effects of beta-thujaplicin on anti-Malassezia pachydermatis remedy for canine otitis externa.,"The antifungal activity of beta-thujaplicin was evaluated against 51 Malassezia pachydermatis strains isolated from canine ear canals with or without otitis externa. For comparison, sensitivity tests were performed on M. pachydermatis isolates for nystatin, ketoconazole, and terbinafine HCl, all clinically available antifungal agents. The minimal inhibition concentrations over 50% of the tested isolates (MIC50) were 3.13 microg/ml for beta-thujaplicin and nystatin, 0.016 microg/ml for ketoconazole, and 1.56 microg/ml for terbinafine HCl. The antifungal effect for M. pachydermatis of beta-thujaplicin compared favorably with commercial antifungal agents. None of the 51 M. pachydermatis isolates showed resistance against any of the tested antibiotics investigated in this study. Ten representative isolates of M. pachydermatis were subcultured for 30 generations at concentrations close to the MIC levels of beta-thujaplicin, nystatin, ketoconazole, and terbinafine HCl, and examined to determine whether they had acquired resistance to each drug. As a result, M. pachydermatis was found to achieve resistance more easily for ketoconazole and terbinafine HCl than for beta-thujaplicin or nystatin. The MIC50 of beta-thujaplicin did not change during the course of subculture, and it is thought that the potential development of a resistant strain is low, even with continuous infusion for otitis externa therapy. beta-Thujaplicin is an inexpensive and safe treatment with anti-inflammatory and deodorant effects that can be recommended as an effective remedy for canine otitis externa.","['Nakano Y', 'Wada M', 'Tani H', 'Sasai K', 'Baba E']",2005,67,12,J Vet Med Sci,"Nakano Y, et al.

He then underwent craniotomy for drainage of the epidural abscess, followed by intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for 2 consecutive weeks until both pus and blood cultures depicted no growth of pathogens. Based on this case, synergistic antibiotic therapy using a third-generation cephalosporin or quinolone (ciprofloxacin), accompanied by metronidazole, and even a short-term aminoglycoside is recommended for the treatment of severe Klebsiella-induced necrotizing external otitis.

16235370,Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.
OBJECTIVES: Assess topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations (CSOM).
SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and article references.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials; any topical antibiotic without steroids, versus no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids; participants with CSOM.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data onto RevMan; two authors inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.
MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections and other diagnoses. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up usually short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, N = 197). No statistically significant difference was found between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) at weeks one or three: pooled RR were 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.32) (three trials, N = 402), and 0.97 (0.54 to 1.72) (two trials, N = 77), respectively. A positive trend in favour of quinolones seen at two weeks was largely due to one trial and not significant after accounting for heterogeneity: pooled RR 0.65 (0.46 to 0.92) (four trials, N = 276) using the fixed-effect model, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.17) accounting for heterogeneity with the random-effects model. Topical quinolones were significantly better at curing CSOM than antiseptics: RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.67) at one week (three trials, N = 263), and 0.58 (0.47 to 0.72) at two to four weeks (four trials, N = 519). Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to antiseptics were more mixed, changing over time (four trials, N = 254). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics; non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out. Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether quinolones may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments.","['Macfadyen CA', 'Acuin JM', 'Gamble C']",2005,2005,4,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"Macfadyen CA, et al.

16178396,Effect of tympanic cavity evacuation and flushing on microbial isolates during total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy in dogs.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in bacterial numbers, identity, and susceptibility in samples obtained from the tympanic cavity on entry (preflush) and after evacuation and lavage (postflush) and assess perioperative and empiric antimicrobial selection in dogs that underwent total ear canal ablation (TECA) with lateral bulla osteotomy (LBO) or reoperation LBO.
DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.
ANIMALS: 34 dogs.
PROCEDURE: TECA with LBO or reoperation LBO was performed on 47 ears. Pre- and postflush aerobic and anaerobic samples were obtained from the tympanic cavity. Isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were compared.
RESULTS: Different isolates (31/44 [70%] ears) and susceptibility patterns of isolate pairs (6/44 [14%] ears) were detected in pre- and postflush samples from 84% of ears. Evacuation and lavage of the tympanic cavity decreased the number of bacterial isolates by 33%. In 26% of ears, bacteria were isolated from post-flush samples but not preflush samples. Only 26% of isolates tested were susceptible to cefazolin. At least 1 isolate from 53% of dogs that received empirically chosen antimicrobials postoperatively was resistant to the selected drugs. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 6 ears.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Accurate microbiologic assessment of the tympanic cavity should be the basis for selection of antimicrobials in dogs undergoing TECA with LBO. Bacteria remain in the tympanic cavity after evacuation and lavage. Cefazolin was a poor choice for dogs that underwent TECA with LBO, as judged on the basis of culture and susceptibility testing results.","['Hettlich BE', 'Boothe HW', 'Simpson RB', 'Dubose KA', 'Boothe DM', 'Carpenter M']",2005,227,5,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Hettlich BE, et al.

16170610,Occurrence and population size of Malassezia spp. in the external ear canal of dogs and cats both healthy and with otitis.,"Malassezia yeasts are commensal organisms of human and animal skin that occasionally act as pathogens; lipid-dependent species are associated with human skin disorders. The aim of this work was to evaluate the occurrence, risk factors and population size of different species of Malassezia in the external ear canal of dogs and cats with and without otitis externa. Between 2001 and 2003, 107 healthy animals (25 cats and 82 dogs) and 123 animals with chronic otitis exteirna (48 cats and 75 dogs) were clinically examined. Sterile cotton swabs were used to collect specimens from the external ear canal and culture tests and cytological examinations were performed to detect the presence and population size of Malassezia yeasts. Malassezia yeasts were isolated from 72.9% and 40% of the cats and from 57.3% and 28.0% of the dogs, with and without otitis externa, respectively. Malassezia was frequently isolated from animals under 5 years of age. The highest prevalence of positive samples was reported in winter for cats and in autumn for dogs. Dogs with pendulous ears showed a higher incidence of infection than dogs with erect ears. More Malassezia yeasts were recovered from animals with otitis (i.e. 59.6 colony forming units - CFUs - for cats and 66.0 CFUs for dogs) than healthy animals. Out of the 413 isolates obtained from animals with and without otitis, 403 (97.6%) were identified as M. pachydermatis and 10 (2.4%) as M. globosa. A statistical evaluation of the occurrence of Malassezia yeasts in dogs and cats revealed that predisposing factors for Malassezia infections are sampling period for cats, and type of ear for dogs. The largest population of Malassezia yeasts was detected in animals with otitis, suggesting a role in the occurrence of lesions.","['Cafarchia C', 'Gallo S', 'Capelli G', 'Otranto D']",2005,160,2,Mycopathologia,"Cafarchia C, et al.

16154787,Malassezia pachydermatis isolated from normal and diseased external ear canals in dogs: a comparative analysis.,"To investigate the role of Malassezia pachydermatis as a pathogenic agent in canine otitis, a comparative analysis of isolates from normal and diseased external ear canals in dogs was undertaken. Specimens were collected from the ears of dogs with unilateral or bilateral otitis and from healthy dogs. Mycological analysis was by direct microscopy and fungal culture on Sabouraud's dextrose agar and Dixon's agar. Of the otitis specimens, 63.7% showed typical Malassezia cells on cytological examination. In samples taken from the healthy ears of dogs with unilateral otitis, only 21.43% (P<0.05) showed evidence of Malassezia. M. pachydermatis was identified cytologically and culturally in 57.53% (P<0.05), 14.29% and 30.0% of samples from the ears of dogs with otitis, from the healthy ears of dogs with unilateral otitis and from the ears of healthy dogs with no otitis. In the group with otitis associated with M. pachydermatis, the poodle was the most common breed (39.29%; P<0.05), whereas in the group without otitis, the German Shepherd breed was prominent (although this observation was not statistically significant). In both groups, the majority of dogs with M. pachydermatis were aged between 1 and 3 years (P<0.05). The higher incidence of M. pachydermatis isolated from the ears of dogs with otitis externa suggests a putative pathogenic role of this yeast in this condition.","['Girão MD', 'Prado MR', 'Brilhante RS', 'Cordeiro RA', 'Monteiro AJ', 'Sidrim JJ', 'Rocha MF']",2006,172,3,Vet J,"Girão MD, et al.

16138712,Ear problems in swimmers.,"Acute diffuse otitis externa (swimmer's ear), otomycosis, exostoses, traumatic eardrum perforation, middle ear infection, and barotraumas of the inner ear are common problems in swimmers and people engaged in aqua activities. The most common ear problem in swimmers is acute diffuse otitis externa, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common pathogen. The symptoms are itching, otalgia, otorrhea, and conductive hearing loss. The treatment includes frequent cleansing of the ear canal, pain control, oral or topical medications, acidification of the ear canal, and control of predisposing factors. Swimming in polluted waters and ear-canal cleaning with cotton-tip applicators should be avoided. Exostoses are usually seen in people who swim in cold water and present with symptoms of accumulated debris, otorrhea and conductive hearing loss. The treatment for exostoses is transmeatal surgical removal of the tumors. Traumatic eardrum perforations may occur during water skiing or scuba diving and present with symptoms of hearing loss, otalgia, otorrhea, tinnitus and vertigo. Tympanoplasty might be needed if the perforations do not heal spontaneously. Patients with chronic otitis media with active drainage should avoid swimming, while patients who have undergone mastoidectomy and who have no cavity problems may swim. For children with ventilation tubes, surface swimming is safe in a clean, chlorinated swimming pool. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss and some degree of vertigo may occur after diving because of rupture of the round or oval window membrane.","['Wang MC', 'Liu CY', 'Shiao AS', 'Wang T']",2005,68,8,J Chin Med Assoc,"Wang MC, et al.

The lipid-dependent species are associated with human skin disorders, whereas the non-lipid-dependent species (Malassezia pachydermatis) is considered as an opportunistic secondary pathogen affecting the canine skin surface and ear canal. This study evaluated the relationship between Malassezia yeasts, their population size, and the occurrence of skin lesions from healthy and skin-diseased dogs. The efficiency of cytological examination and fungal culture for Malassezia detection was also evaluated. From March 2002 to July 2003, 33 healthy dogs and 54 dogs with pruritic localized skin diseases were examined; skin swabs (1218) were collected from 7 anatomical sites for culture and cytological examination. Malassezia prevalence according to anatomical site and the agreement between cytological results and fungal cultures were statistically analyzed. Differences in mean colony forming unit counts between positive healthy and diseased dogs were evaluated using the Bonferroni test for post hoc pair-wise comparisons. In healthy dogs, Malassezia yeasts were most frequently isolated in the perianal and perioral areas. The frequency of isolation and population size of Malassezia species were higher in dogs with localized dermatitis, especially in affected areas, indicating a role for Malassezia in the occurrence of skin lesions. Malassezia pachydermatis was the species most commonly cultured from the skin and external ear canal of healthy and diseased dogs; isolation of lipid-dependent yeasts from healthy dogs was less frequent. Using fungal culture as the gold standard, cytological examination showed good relative specificity (95%) but very low relative sensitivity (30%).","['Cafarchia C', 'Gallo S', 'Romito D', 'Capelli G', 'Chermette R', 'Guillot J', 'Otranto D']",2005,17,4,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Cafarchia C, et al.

16101799,Bilateral ear canal neoplasia in three dogs.,"Bilateral ear canal infections are common in dogs. Ear canal neoplasia is usually associated with unilateral problems, and is uncommon in dogs. To the best of the author's knowledge, bilateral aural neoplasia has not been reported in dogs, and only four case reports were found in the human literature. This report presents three dogs that had bilateral tumours in their ear canals. They were presented with bilateral otitis externa. All three dogs exhibited tissue proliferation of both ear canals that did not respond to glucocorticoids. Treatment consisted of total ear canal ablation, and tissues were submitted for histopathological evaluation. Case # 1 (a 10-year-old, male cocker spaniel) was diagnosed as ceruminious gland carcinoma. Cases # 2 and 3 were diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. Case # 1 was diagnosed 4 years earlier as having keratinization disorder, which was causing its chronic ear problems. Case # 2 (a 5-year-old, female French bulldog) was diagnosed 4 years earlier as having atopic dermatitis, which did not respond to hyposensitization, and only partially responded to glucocorticoids therapy. Case # 3 (a 9-year-old, male German shepherd) was diagnosed by the referring veterinarian as having unilateral ear canal proliferation 2 months prior to presentation. However, otoscopic examination showed bilateral proliferation that obstructed both canals.

There are several reasons to consider topical treatment of otorrhea. Two are that greater concentrations can be reached locally of pharmacologically active agents and there is less risk of systemic complications and side effects. One factor that might prevent their efficacy is the formation of biofilms by pathogenic organisms. Topical treatments usually include antimicrobial agents. There is evidence that aminoglycoside-containing drops can cause ototoxicity, particularly insidious vestibular ototoxicity. Nonaminoglycosides are recommended if there is access to the middle ear. There is some evidence that the addition of steroids hastens resolution. There is little evidence on which to estimate the risk reduction of serious complications of otitis media from treatment with topical therapy. In some causes of otorrhea, nonmicrobial treatments might be just as effective. Individualized therapy is recommended.","['Bance M', 'Rutka JA']",2005,34 Suppl 2,,J Otolaryngol,Bance M and Rutka JA.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 3 cases of inadequately treated malignant otitis externa in elderly diabetic individuals leading to recurrence and atypical manifestations of skull base osteomyelitis on contralateral side with or without multiple cranial nerve involvement.
RESULTS: Two of the 3 cases died of the disease despite aggressive treatment. One case was treated successfully with combination of antipsuedamonal microbial drugs for 8 to 12 weeks and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Major complications such as thrombosis of lateral sinus and internal jugular vein, meningitis, ophthalmoplegia, blindness, cervical spine erosion and paralysis of all cranial nerves with exception of Ist cranial nerve were observed.
CONCLUSION: There is high morbidity and mortality associated with skull base osteomyelitis. In partially treated cases of malignant otitis externa, atypical symptoms and findings of unilateral severe otalgia, unremitting headache, and presence of high ESR, unilateral OME, constitute diagnostic clues of skull base osteomyelitis.

15949095,A group III steroid solution without antibiotic components: an effective cure for external otitis.,"The present study was undertaken to compare the clinical benefits of prescribing ear drops containing 0.05% solution of betamethasone dipropionate (BD), and ear drops containing hydrocortisone with oxytetracycline hydrochloride and polymyxin B (HCPB), for topical treatment of external otitis. Fifty-one patients were enrolled in this open randomized, parallel-group, multicentre study, performed in eight different ENT departments. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups: BD (n = 26) and HCPB (n = 25). Only ENT specialists investigated the patients. Bacterial and fungal cultures were raised on days 1 and 11, using swabbed material from ear canals. Twice daily the patients recorded their symptoms during the acute phase, using special diary cards.BD proved a significantly more effective cure than HCPB during the acute phase of external otitis and afforded a lower relapse frequency during a six-month follow-up period. The patients of the BD group were significantly less troubled by itching (p < 0.01) than those in the HCPB group. On day 11, at the end of the acute phase, growth of bacteria (p = 0.03) and fungi (p < 0.01) was less frequent in the BD group than in the HCPB group. No serious adverse events occurred, and those minor events observed were comparable between the two groups.Our conclusion is that the group III steroid solution, BD, cured the external otitis more effectively than did the HCPB solution, whether infected by bacteria or by fungi. No difference was evident regarding adverse effects. Furthermore, price favours a solution without any antibiotic component. In view of these observations, a group III steroid solution ought to be the preferred remedy for external otitis, whether infected or not.","['Emgård P', 'Hellström S']",2005,119,5,J Laryngol Otol,Emgård P and Hellström S.

15927274,Fungal causes of otitis externa and tympanostomy tube otorrhea.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the occurrence of fungal organisms in the setting of otitis externa and tympanostomy tube otorrhea, review the treatment course, timing of diagnosis, organism identified and time to resolution with fungal infections.
DESIGN: Retrospective review.
SETTING: Pediatric otolaryngology clinic within a tertiary care hospital.
PATIENTS: One hundred and sixty-six patients (ages 16 days to 18 years) with fungal organisms on ear culture.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of prior therapies, number of office visits, time to resolution and anti-fungal therapy.
RESULTS: Ear cultures positive for fungal organisms were found in 166 patients seen between 1 January 1996 and 30 September 2003 from a total of 1242 patients undergoing ear culture. Comparing the 3-year period (1996-1998) prior to the availability of fluoroquinolone ototopical drops to the 3-year period after (1999-2001), there is a statistically significant increase in the incidence of positive fungal culture (p<0.001). Otitis media was diagnosed in 72% of these children, with otitis externa comprising 25%. Approximately 3% carried a diagnosis of both otitis externa and otitis media. Candida albicans was identified in 43% of fungal organism-positive cultures. Candida parapsilosis was found in 24% of and Aspergillus fumigatus in 13%. The remainder of the cultures yielded three other Candida and three other Aspergillus species, each at less than 5%. Time to resolution ranged from 1 week to 9 months, with a median of 3.8 weeks for symptom resolution. Patients were treated with an average of 1.7 oral antibiotics and 1.1 ototopical agent before a culture was taken.
CONCLUSIONS: Otorrhea due to fungal organisms occurs in the setting of refractory infection and is often discovered after multiple oral and ototopical antibacterial medications. Due to the extended treatment period required to clear fungal organism, timely diagnosis with culture for bacteria and fungus is required in patients with persistent otorrhea. An increase in incidence of fungal infections of the ear was found in the period after widespread use of ofloxacin began.","['Martin TJ', 'Kerschner JE', 'Flanary VA']",2005,69,11,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Martin TJ, et al.

The identification of Malassezia species isolates from animals is important to clarify the epidemiology of these lipophilic yeasts. Malassezia species were cultured from the external ear canals of 63 out of 99 cats with otitis and 12 of 52 (23%) healthy control cats. The rate of isolation in affected animals versus controls was highly significant (P<0.01). Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated as a pure culture in 33 (45.2%) cats, associated with Malassezia globosa and Malassezia furfur in 20 (50%) and 17 (42.5%) animals, respectively. Three different species were isolated simultaneously in three cats (two cats with M pachydermatis, M globosa and M furfur, one subject with M pachydermatis, M furfur and Malassezia sympodialis). M globosa was isolated as the sole species in two animals. The present work confirms the presence of some lipid-dependent species of Malassezia in both healthy and otitic cats.","['Nardoni S', 'Mancianti F', 'Rum A', 'Corazza M']",2005,7,3,J Feline Med Surg,"Nardoni S, et al.

15909247,[Relapsing polychondritis -- a case report and review of the literature].,"PATIENT: A case of a 54-year-old woman with a three month history of recurrent bilateral chondritis of the auricles, cochlear and vestibular inner ear damage and conjunctivitis is described. The diagnosis was based only on clinical criteria (auricular chondritis, conjunctivitis, inner ear damage). Antinuclear antibodies, ANCA and HLA-DR 4 antigen were negative. The only laboratory abnormality was an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The patient has been treated successfully with Methotrexate 20 mg 1 x /week and Prednisone 15 mg/die for 4 month now.
DISCUSSION: The relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare, multisystemic and potentially fatal disease. The pathogenesis and optimal therapeutic approach is poorly understood. The disease is characterized by episodic inflammation of cartilage such as auricular, nasal and laryngotracheal. Many other proteoglycan-rich structures like inner ear, eye, kidney and blood vessels, may be involved as well. RP has an equal sex prevalence. The majority of cases appear between 40 and 60 years. Auricular inflammation is the most common feature. Effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dapsone, immunosuppressive drugs and prednisone has been described. The overall survival rates were 74 % at 5 years and 55 % at 10 in one 1986 series.
CONCLUSION: The most common clinical presentation of RP regularly involves ENT-structures. Therefore ENT-specialists should be familiar with this disease. A close interdisciplinary cooperation is essential for therapy and follow-up, because pulmonary and cardiac involvement are limiting prognostic factors.","['Tesche S', 'Wenzel S', 'Sagowski C']",2005,84,5,Laryngorhinootologie,"Tesche S, et al.

15867644,Prospective phase II trial of concomitant boost radiotherapy for stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an evaluation of response and toxicity.,"INTRODUCTION: Stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy results in loco-regional control of around 80%. This report aims to document the outcome of Stage II NPC patients treated with external beam radiotherapy delivered using an accelerated concomitant boost (C-Boost) schedule.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-five 1997 AJCC Stage II NPC patients were enrolled and analyzed in this preliminary report. The primary tumor and clinically involved nodes received a total dose of 72 Gy in 42 fractions. C-Boost for gross disease consisted of 18 Gy in 12 fractions commencing on day 19 and was delivered at least 6 hours after the first dose. Patients were assessed for response, survival, and toxicity.
RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 24 months, only one patient had pathologically confirmed local recurrence, necessitating IMRT. Two developed distant metastases for which they received chemotherapy. One died from systemic disease after refusing treatment for persistent neck lymphadenopathy. Two-year loco-regional control rates, overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 96%, 96%, and 88%, respectively. All patients experienced some degree of acute and/or late toxicity. However, the toxicity profile was comparable to that seen following standard fractionation. Acute or late toxicities directly attributable to C-Boost were not observed.
CONCLUSION: This C-Boost radiotherapy regimen administers a substantially higher biologically effective dose compared with conventional radiation schedules. Preliminary locoregional control and survival rates are promising with no significant acute and/or late toxicities.","['Lu JJ', 'Shakespeare TP', 'Thiagarajan A', 'Zhang X', 'Liang L', 'Tan S']",2005,115,5,Laryngoscope,"Lu JJ, et al.

It may be complicated by involvement of cranial nerves, principally the facial nerves and the contents of the jugular foramen. It is an uncommon condition mainly found in the elderly or in diabetics.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment for malignant otitis externa.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2004) and EMBASE (January 1985 to April 2004) with pre-specified terms. The date of the last search was 5th April 2004.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, involving adults, undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy in malignant otitis externa.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: No identified articles described randomised controlled trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of malignant otitis externa.
MAIN RESULTS: Due to the lack of data no results could be presented.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No clear evidence exists to demonstrate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy when compared to treatment with antibiotics and/or surgery. No data were found to compare rates of complication between the different treatment modalities.

METHODS: Fifty-seven swabs were taken from the ears of 52 patients with OE for culture and sensitivity. A broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of TTO for each organism.
RESULTS: In 51 percent of the swabs taken, pathogenic organisms were cultured. Of these cultures 71 percent, both bacteria and yeast, were susceptible to TTO 2 percent or less. The only organism showing resistance to TTO was Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however 25 percent of these bacteria were sensitive.
CONCLUSION: Tea tree oil may have a role to play in the treatment of OE.

SETTING: Secondary health care within the ENT departments of Addenbrooke's and Hinchingbrooke hospitals.
DESIGN: A clinical observational study.
PARTICIPANTS: Volunteers seen in ENT outpatients. Inclusion criteria for the normal ear group, was a normal ear with no history of infection or previous ear disease. Inclusion criteria for abnormal ear group commonly associated with chronic discharge. Exclusion criteria were the presence of pus or infection within the ear canal.
METHOD: The relative humidity of the external ear canal was measured in normal and abnormal ears. Abnormal ears were grouped as those commonly associated with chronic discharge, mastoid cavities, tympanic perforations, recurrent otitis externa and hearing-aided ears.
RESULTS: The range of relative humidity of normal ears is 40-70%. The humidity in abnormal ears was found to be significantly higher than the humidity in normal ears (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The raised relative humidity in the external canal may explain the predisposition of certain abnormal ears to chronic discharge and infection.

The addition of antibiotic components to steroid solutions for the treatment of external otitis is of questionable validity.
OBJECTIVE: External otitis, caused by infection with either Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Candida albicans, was established in a rat model and the treatment efficacy of a group III steroid solution was studied.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three treatments were studied: (i) a group III steroid solution; (ii) a group I steroid combined with two antibiotic components; and (iii) a saline solution. A scoring scale was used to evaluate the characteristics of the ear canal skin. Bacteriological and fungal samples were collected for culturing and ear canal skin biopsies were taken for structural analyses.
RESULTS: It was possible to cause P. aeruginosa and C. albicans infections in an animal model. In the P. aeruginosa-infected animals, only the group III steroid treatment cured all the animals.

Patients were investigated by computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), two-phase planar and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT), technetium-99m methylenediphosphonate bone scans, gallium-67 planar and SPECT scans, and indium-111 or technetium-99m labelled WBC planar and SPECT scintigraphy. We discuss example case reports with the various radiological and scintigraphic findings and outline a protocol for rational investigation. It is concluded that CT and/or MRI should be supported by routine SPECT bone imaging for initial diagnosis of malignant otitis externa.

15805875,Inflammatory proteases in chronic otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVES: Proteases are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Inhibition of these proteases has shown promise in the treatment of these skin conditions. The purpose of this study was to measure the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) activities in chronic otitis externa (COE) and to determine whether administration of protease inhibitors recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin (rAAT) and ilomastat might reduce these protease activities.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective and ex vivo.
METHODS: Twenty-five ear canals with COE and 34 with no pathology (i.e., controls) were debrided and filled with saline. After a tragal pump and 1 to 2 minutes, the washes were collected and analyzed for MMP and HNE activities and the inhibitory activity of rAAT and ilomastat on these proteases, respectively.
RESULTS: MMP and HNE levels were significantly higher (P = .0057 and .0112) in ears with COE than normal ears. MMP activity greater than 3 mAU/minute was observed in 30% of COE and 0% of controls (P = .0270). HNE activity greater than 3 mAU/minute was found in 77% of COE versus 7% of controls (P < .0001). Ilomastat and rAAT inhibited 60% of MMP and 98% of HNE activity, respectively, in COE ears.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of proteases found in COE, MMP, and HNE may be inhibited with ilomastat and rAAT. The therapeutic potential of these protease inhibitors warrants investigation.","['Antonelli PJ', 'Schultz GS', 'Cantwell JS', 'Sundin DJ', 'Pemberton PA', 'Barr PJ']",2005,115,4,Laryngoscope,"Antonelli PJ, et al.

Twenty-two OE isolates were identified as belonging to 12 species, and 42 non-OE isolates were identified as belonging to 13 species. The predominant species found in both OE and non-OE isolates were S. intermedius, and S. epidermidis. Thirty-eight (59.4%) of 64 isolates were resistant to one or more of the 17 antimicrobial agents tested. Resistance to PCG and ABPC was most frequent.

15802495,Evidence for ototopical glucocorticoid-induced decrease in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response and liver function.,"To clarify whether ototopical glucocorticoid treatment is associated with impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activity and altered hepatic metabolism, one commercially available dexamethasone-containing ointment was tested. At present, very little is known about the effects of ototopical glucocorticoid treatment on HPA and liver function. Ten beagle dogs received two daily therapeutic doses of dexamethasone (0.6 mg/ear) in the outer auditory canal for 21 d in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study. Resting cortisol concentrations were assessed before, during, and after treatment using an RIA system. Adrenal function and HPA feedback sensitivity were measured by a standard dose (250 microg) ACTH stimulation test. Serum biochemical and hematological parameters were measured, whether ototopical glucocorticoids affect hepatic function was studied, and blood cell counts were made. Ototopical dexamethasone treatment induced a marked suppression (to about 100%) of resting plasma cortisol concentrations below the placebo effect (P < 0.0001) within the first 11 d, and these remained reduced during the entire treatment period up to d 19. As well, an ACTH stimulation test found a markedly reduced rise in plasma cortisol concentrations (P = 0.0004). Concomitantly, significant increases in serum activities of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase were detected. Moreover, we found a significant reduction in differential leukocyte counts of eosinophils and lymphocytes, whereas neutrophils increased. Although cortisol levels and hematological parameters returned to baseline 7 d after treatment cessation, liver enzyme activities remained elevated. In conclusion, these findings suggest that after ototopical application, dexamethasone is sufficiently absorbed from the auditory canal to suppress HPA function as well as to alter metabolic and hemopoietic profiles. Thus, in long-term treatment of otitis externa or media, the systemic adverse suppression of HPA has to be considered in relation to stress exposure, whereas changes in serum enzyme activities may not be interpreted as hepathopathy.","['Abraham G', 'Gottschalk J', 'Ungemach FR']",2005,146,7,Endocrinology,"Abraham G, et al.

15712498,Acute injury and chronic disability resulting from surfboard riding.,"We undertook a cross-sectional survey of surfers at eight Victorian beaches between February and May 2003 and analysed acute injury and chronic disability sustained while surfing during the preceding 12 months. Significant injuries were defined as requiring medical attention or time off surfing/work. 646 surfers were enrolled (90.2% male, median age 27 years, median years of surfing 10). 145 surfers sustained 168 significant acute injuries in the preceding 12 months (0.26 injuries/surfer/year, 95% CI 0.22-0.30). Most were caused by striking a surfboard or another surfer (45.2%, 95% CI 37.6-53.1), ""wiping out"" (36.3%, 95% CI 29.1-44.1) or striking the seabed (17.9%, 95% CI 12.6-24.7). Injuries included lacerations (46.4%, 95% CI 38.8-54.3), sprains (28.6%, 95% CI 22.0-36.1), dislocations (10.7%, 95% CI 6.7-16.6) and fractures (8.9%, 95% CI 5.3-14.6). Body parts most frequently injured were the lower limb (45.8%, 95% CI 38.2-53.7) and the head/face (26.2%, 95% CI 19.9-33.6). Surfing injuries that were treated in Victorian emergency departments over a six year period revealed a similar pattern, although there was a greater proportion of head/face injuries (42.0%, 95% CI 36.0-48.1, p = 0.001). 20 surfers reported long-term effects from acute injuries, mainly unstable/stiff/painful joints. 136 surfers reported chronic health problems not related to acute injury including chronic/recurrent otitis externa and exostoses, muscle and joint pain/stiffness and pterygium. Significant injury while surfing is not uncommon. Although head injury accounts for a considerable proportion, very few surfers wear protective headgear. Greater use of protective headgear should be considered.","['Taylor DM', 'Bennett D', 'Carter M', 'Garewal D', 'Finch CF']",2004,7,4,J Sci Med Sport,"Taylor DM, et al.

They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.","['Dorko E', 'Jenca A', 'Orencák M', 'Virágová S', 'Pilipcinec E']",2004,49,5,Folia Microbiol (Praha),"Dorko E, et al.

15668811,Drainage of retro-parapharyngeal abscess: an additional indication for endoscopic sinus surgery.,"Deep neck abscesses are life-threatening conditions, in early stages preferably treated by intravenous antibiotic therapy; in advanced stages, surgical drainage is mandatory. We report two cases of retro-parapharyngeal abscess with prevalent retronasopharyngeal extension in two men aged 60 and 82, both of whom underwent transnasal endoscopic drainage. The main surgical steps were incision of the posterior pharyngeal mucosal wall, widening of the incision, drainage of purulent collection and careful dissection and removal of the necrotic tissue. The first patient, with an abscess associated with chronic otitis media and presenting hypoglossal nerve palsy, quickly recovered from pharyngodinia, otalgia and trismus. Twenty-six months after surgery, he is symptom-free, with hemitongue atrophy due to denervation as the only residual sign. The second patient, affected by skull base osteomyelitis secondary to malignant external otitis, after a first successful drainage, underwent a second endoscopic procedure for the reoccurrence of an abscess in the contralateral retroparapharyngeal space. Twelve months after the first surgery, the patient reported an improvement of symptoms, except for persistent dysphonia related to vagal nerve palsy. At follow-up MR, another abscess was detected in the left retro-parapharyngeal space. In selected cases of abscess, transnasal endoscopic drainage may be an effective alternative to external approaches. Minimal morbidity, the absence of cervical or palatal scars and a short hospitalization time can be considered as important advantages in comparison to external approaches. Patients with abscess secondary to skull base osteomyelitis require close imaging surveillance because of the difficulty of definitive control of the disease.","['Nicolai P', 'Lombardi D', 'Berlucchi M', 'Farina D', 'Zanetti D']",2005,262,9,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Nicolai P, et al.

15636297,An outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and bloodstream infection associated with intermittent otitis externa in a healthcare worker.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and bloodstream infection among four neonates, determine risk factors for infection, and implement preventive strategies.
DESIGN: Retrospective case finding; prospective surveillance cultures of patients, personnel, and environmental sites; molecular typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; and a matched case-control study.
PATIENTS AND SETTING: Neonates in the level-III neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary-care pediatric institution.
INTERVENTIONS: Cohorting of patients with positive results for P. aeruginosa, work restrictions for staff with positive results, implementation of an alcohol-based hand product, review of infection control policies and procedures, and closure of the unit until completion of the investigation.
RESULTS: Seven (4%) of 190 environmental cultures and 5 (3%) of 178 cultures of individual healthcare workers' hands grew P. aeruginosa. All four outbreak isolates and one previous bloodstream isolate were genotypically identical, as were the P. aeruginosa isolates from the hands and external auditory canal of a healthcare worker with intermittent otitis externa. Four of 5 case-patients versus 5 of 15 matched control-patients had been cared for by this healthcare worker (P = .05). The healthcare worker was treated and no further cases occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a healthcare worker with intermittent otitis externa may have caused this cluster of fatal P. aeruginosa infections, adding the external ear to the list of colonized body sites that may serve as a source of potentially pathogenic organisms.","['Zawacki A', ""O'Rourke E"", 'Potter-Bynoe G', 'Macone A', 'Harbarth S', 'Goldmann D']",2004,25,12,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,"Zawacki A, et al.

15615311,Management of the draining ear in children.,"There are a variety of causes of otorrhea in children. The most important factor in reaching the proper diagnosis and providing relief of the problem is aural toilet. Once adequate debridement has been performed, the diagnosis is usually clearer, and treatment with ototopicals is significantly more effective. Most cases of otorrhea are due to infection or granulation tissue and can be managed initially with appropriately selected ototopical medication, thereby avoiding the risks and side effects of systemic therapy and the need for referral to a specialist. However, otorrhea in children that is refractory to medical therapy may be due to retained tympanostomy tubes or insidious pathology such as cholesteatoma or malignancy. In such cases, prompt referral to the otolaryngologist can facilitate accurate diagnosis and successful management.","['Schroeder A', 'Darrow DH']",2004,33,12,Pediatr Ann,Schroeder A and Darrow DH.

15606869,"Microbiological features of Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans, isolated from dogs and possible misidentification with other canine coagulase-positive staphylococci.","Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans has only rarely been isolated and identified from the external auditory meatus of dogs suffering from external otitis. Its morphological and basic biochemical characteristics are of relatively little value for identification, as it phenotypically resembles another coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) and, consequently, may be easily misidentified as S. intermedius or even as S. aureus. In the present work, differentiation of S. schleiferi ssp. coagulans was therefore based on specific biochemical and genetic methods. All the strains were evaluated with the following commercial methods: Api Staph System (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoil, France), BBL Crystal Identification Systems (Gram-Positive ID Kit and Rapid Gram-Positive ID Kit; Becton Dickinson), and GEN-PROBE AccuProbe, Staphylococcus aureus identification test (bioMérieux). Gram-Positive ID System/GP database includes the broadest range of staphylococcal species and correctly identifies the majority of strains important in veterinary medicine. Therefore, it is an acceptable alternative to conventional methods for identification of canine staphylococcal isolates. Reliable differentiation of S. aureus from S. schleiferi ssp. coagulans and S. intermedius was feasible with AccuProbe for S. aureus, which gave positive results only for S. aureus; all other CPS tested were negative.","['Zdovc I', 'Ocepek M', 'Pirs T', 'Krt B', 'Pinter L']",2004,51,10,J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,"Zdovc I, et al.

The aim of this study was to investigate correlations among clinical pyotraumatic dermatitis, histopathology of the lesions and possible predisposing causes. The relationship of these with breed, age, sex and location of lesion was assessed statistically. A clinical diagnosis of acute pyotraumatic dermatitis was made in 44 privately owned dogs. Males exceeded females (P = 0.0348) and lesions were more common in dogs aged 4 years or less (P < 0.0001). Lesions were most often seen on the cheek, neck and lateral thigh with a significant correlation between breed and site of lesion (P < 0.0001). In 31 cases a possible underlying cause was found or suspected. In contrast to previous studies, no otitis externa was recorded and the study was conducted in an area without endemic fleas. Fourteen breeds were represented of which Rottweiler, German shepherd dog and golden retriever were most common. There was no significant seasonal incidence and no correlation among site of lesion and cause, time of year, age or sex. Histopathologically, the dogs could be separated into four patterns by the presence or absence of eosinophils and/or folliculitis. Eosinophils have not previously been recorded in pyotraumatic dermatitis but were seen in 29 cases. Acute folliculitis was seen in 20 cases. However, no correlation was seen among age, sex, breed, underlying cause or site of lesion and histopathology.

When it occurs in bones thoracolumbar vertebrae is the usual site of involvement. Other bones are less involved hence seldomly reported. This is true for other organs and parts of the body including larynx, pharynx nose and the middle ear. More importantly, isolated extrapulmonary tuberculosis without pulmonary involvement is uncommon. The case of a 65 year old Nigerian trader who presented with headache, chronic ear ache with otorrhoea, persistent neck pain and found to be diabetic on further evaluation is presented. She was hitherto managed as a case of otitis external malignans without any improvement but rather her clinical condition worsened with evidence of cervical vertebra destruction and multiple cranial nerve palsies without pulmonary tuberculosis. Prompt and effective response to anti tuberculosis drugs informed the diagnosis of tuberculosis of the cervical vertebra and tuberculous otitis media with multiple cranial nerve palsies. This case underscores the value of high index of suspicion, thorough and complete clinical evaluation in any patient with chronic symptoms and signs unresponsive to conventional treatment.","['Aderibigbe A', 'Ologe FE']",2004,81,5,East Afr Med J,Aderibigbe A and Ologe FE.

The potency for the three active ingredients in this suspension was monitored at 25 degrees C and 40 degrees C for up to 3 months. The potencies of triamcinolone and clotrimazole were found unchanged, but the potency of sarafloxacin HCl in the samples stored at 40 degrees C for 1 month varied significantly between samples. However, assay inconsistency for sarafloxacin HCl was not seen in samples stored at 25 degrees C. Under an optical microscope, large crystals were found in the 40 degrees C stability samples but not in the 25 degrees C samples. The large crystals in 40 degrees C samples were identified as sarafloxacin by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This finding suggests that crystal growth of sarafloxacin took place at 40 degrees C during storage, leading to the formation of larger crystals and the consequent sampling nonuniformity and assay inconsistency. The solid-state properties of these crystals were further evaluated using hot-stage microscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The results indicate that the crystal growth of sarafloxacin was most likely attributed to a change in the hydration form of sarafloxacin.","['Toongsuwan S', 'Li LC', 'Chang HC', 'Stephens D', 'Robinson D']",2004,30,7,Drug Dev Ind Pharm,"Toongsuwan S, et al.

It is a procedure which every doctor or nurse should be able to perform proficiently. A study of 622 patients that needed ear syringing was done between December 1999 and June 2001 to determine its trend. There were 341(55%) males and 281(45%) females with age ranged from 3.5months to 89 years: 44.4% were in the first decade of life. Cerumen auris 99% remained the commonest indication for syringing in this study with bilateral cerumen auris constituting 53.1% while right and left cerumen auris constituted 24.4% and 21.5% respectively. Cerumen auris constituted 66% of total 933 Otologic cases seen during the study period. Other indications were otitis externa 0.7% (otomycosis 0.5%; bacterial 0.2%) and foreign body 0.3%. The majority of patients (86%) required between 500mls and 1000mls of fluid for irrigation and 94.9% required not more than one attempt at syringing. The complications recorded were mainly vertigo 0.2% and tympanic membrane perforation 0.2% respectively. Thus ear syringing, though simple and sometimes taken for granted may be fraught with dangers; it is a very safe procedure in trained hands and that after at least three attempts of ear syringing for cerumen auris and if it persists despite effective applications of cerumenolytic agents prior to irrigation, the procedure should be discontinued and other methods of imparted cerumen auris removal should be employed.","['Ogunleye AO', 'Awobem AA']",2004,33,1,Afr J Med Med Sci,"Ogunleye AO and Awobem AA.

Computerized tomography (CT) carried out before resection of the lesion disclosed the absence of a bony connection to the underlying structures. The pathologic findings showed lesions consisting of an osteoma-like bone formation with sparse osteoblastic areas. Mature lamellar bone and bone marrow containing adipose tissue were also noted. There was no evidence of a relationship to the cartilaginous tissue or bony structures of the external auditory canal. Therefore, we present this rare case and review the reported literature in which clinical, CT, surgical, and pathologic findings suggest that this lesion was unlike those previously known, and may be related to ossifying reactions in other parts of the organism.","['Chi HP', 'Ho KY', 'Tsai KB', 'Lee KW', 'Ta CF', 'Wang LF', 'Kuo WR']",2004,20,1,Kaohsiung J Med Sci,"Chi HP, et al.

There were only two significant complications, both post-operative stenosis, requiring further corrective surgery. In conclusion, canalplasty for the exostosis of the external auditory meatus is a safe surgical option.","['Sanna M', 'Russo A', 'Khrais T', 'Jain Y', 'Augurio AM']",2004,118,8,J Laryngol Otol,"Sanna M, et al.

15448765,Otitis externa infection in Jordan. Clinical and microbiological features.,"OBJECTIVE: Aims of this study were to investigate the clinical findings and to identify causative microorganisms and their susceptibility to antibiotics in otitis externa infection.
METHODS: The symptoms and signs, as well as the bacterial and fungal flora from the auditory canal of one hundred and eighty patients (100 males and 80 females), age range from 6 month to 19-years old suffering from acute otitis externa were studied from January 2001 to December 2002. One way ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) were carried out for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Pain was the most common symptom (97.2%) while, itching and difficulty in hearing were the least common (11.7 %). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa) was isolated from (41.7%) which showed the best susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (93.4%), aspergillus species from (19.4%), candida albicans from (10.6%), staphylococcus aureus from (16.1%) which showed the best susceptibility to amikacin and ciprofloxacin (96.5%), proteus mirabilis from (2.8%) which showed the best susceptibility (100%) to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ofloxacin, anaerobic bacteria from (2.2%); and no bacteria growth was observed in (7.2%). There was a significant variation relating signs, symptoms and sex in favor of males (P=0.03). Significant seasonal variation in otitis externa infection was observed (P <0.05).
CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogenic microorganism, which showed the best susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.

15372343,[Otosialorrhoea - diagnostics and therapy of a salivary fistula of the external auditory canal].,"PATIENT: We report the case of a 49 year old female patient who suffered from frequent secretion of the left external canal of the ear after the treatment of a chronic mycotic otitis externa. The secretion was seen in connection with food intake. An operative revision in another hospital remained without success. The diagnostics covered the biochemical verification of saliva-amylase in the secretion, but also a high resolution MRI of the parotid gland. By this diagnostics it was easy to locate the salivary fistula during the operation.
DISCUSSION: Salivary fistulas of the parotid gland to the external ear-canal are very rare. These fistulas develop after injury of the parenchyma or the gland ductus and also after surgery of the head- and neck-region. A otosialorrhoea rarely originates from a chronic inflammatory of the ear canal. These fistulas are assigned to the fissures of Santorini and the foramen of Huschke. The therapy of salivary fistulas to the external ear canal reaches from clossure of the fistula to total parotidectomy. But also a medicamental suppression of salivation, irradiation and a tympanic neurectomy are discussed in the literature.","['Langer J', 'Begall K']",2004,83,9,Laryngorhinootologie,Langer J and Begall K.

15366652,Allergic contact dermatitis prevalence in patients with eczematous external otitis.,"Eczematous external otitis, because of its basic allergic nature, tends to be chronic or recurrent. The purpose of our study was to investigate the association between allergic contact dermatitis and chronic eczematous external otitis. Sixty-six patients with eczematous external otitis and 48 healthy volunteers were included in this study. All the patients were tested with an epicutaneous patch test. In the study group, the average recurrent attack rate was 6.1+/-1.5 (between 4-9 times during the last year) in the patch test positive eczematous external otitis patients, and 4.9+/-1.3 (between 4-8 times during the last year) in the patch test negative patients (p = 0.002). The epicutaneous patch test was positive in 19 (28.8%) out of 66 cases with chronic eczematous external otitis, and in 3 (6.3%) out of 48 cases in the control group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.003). The most common reactions were due to neomycin sulfate and potassium dichromate in this study. These results suggest that, in some cases eczematous external otitis may be considered as a form of delayed type hypersensitivity to allergen stimuli. Patients suffering from eczematous external otitis symptoms should be investigated for allergens.","['Yariktas M', 'Yildirim M', 'Doner F', 'Baysal V', 'Dogru H']",2004,22,1,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,"Yariktas M, et al.

15364501,Aural irrigation using the OtoClear Safe Irrigation System in children.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the OtoClear Safe Irrigation System for removing cerumen from the external auditory canal in children.
METHODS: Eligible subjects were 6 months-17 years of age with cerumen obstructing > or = 50% of the tympanic membrane (TM) from view (by otoscopy). Pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, and audiometry were performed followed by cleansing of the affected ear canal(s) with the OtoClear Safe Irrigation System and warm tap water. Otoscopy was performed after each wash of the canal. A curette or small alligator forceps was used to remove remaining cerumen if necessary. Tympanometry and audiometry were repeated after all procedures were completed. Telephone contact was made 1 week later regarding symptoms of acute otitis externa or any other problems.
RESULTS: Eighteen children (28 ears) ages 1-10/12 to 11-2/12 years were entered. Four had previously had tympanostomy tubes. At entry, there was no visible TM in 19 ears, 5-10% visible TM in 5 ears, 20% in 1 ear, and 30-40% of the TM in 3 ears. The number of washes needed per ear was: 1 wash--16 ears, 2 washes--8 ears, 3 washes--1 ear, 4 washes--2 ears; washing was stopped in 1 ear because of pain. After irrigation, a curette or forceps was used in 6 ears. Following the procedures, > or = 95% of the TM was visible in 24 ears, and > or = 80% was visible in all ears. Six ears (4 children) with flat tympanograms at entry became normal after irrigation. On audiometry, a conductive loss in 2 ears at entry resolved after irrigation. The mean change in pure tone average (PTA) was -2.9 dB. Three subjects were noted to have hearing losses >5 dB at some frequencies which on review by audiologists were deemed non-significant. No perforations of the TM occurred. There were no reports of otitis externa or any other adverse events occurring after leaving the clinic.
CONCLUSION: We found the OtoClear Safe Irrigation System to be safe and effective in our small sample of children. It was well tolerated in most and provided a non-traumatic method for the removal of obstructing cerumen.","['Mandel EM', 'Dohar JE', 'Casselbrant ML']",2004,68,10,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Mandel EM, et al.

15336469,"Efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution once daily for 7 days in the treatment of otitis externa: a multicenter, open-label, phase III trial.","BACKGROUND: Otitis externa (OE) is an infection of the external auditory canal that is typically treated with topically applied broad-spectrum antibiotics. Twice-daily topical treatment with ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution for 10 days has been reported to be as effective and well tolerated as the standard of care, neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone solution administered 4 times daily for 10 days.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of 7 days of a once-daily regimen of ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution in the treatment of OE.
METHODS: This multicenter, open-label, Phase III study was conducted from June 12, 2002, to October 14, 2002. Eligible patients were aged > or = 6 months and had OE of <2 weeks' duration with moderate to severe edema and tenderness involving 1 or both ears and sufficient exudate for microbiologic culture. Ofloxacin otic solution was instilled once daily for 7 days (5 drops for children aged 6 months to <13 years, 10 drops for adolescents/adults aged > or = 13 years). Assessments were conducted at the end-of-treatment visit and 7 to 10 days later (the test-of-cure visit). Medication was supplied free of charge to study participants who incurred no costs for physician visits.
RESULTS: Of 489 patients enrolled at 58 sites in 3 countries, 439 were clinically evaluable (173 children, 266 adolescents/adults; 52 % males, 48% females; 47% Hispanic, 45% white; 5% black, and 3% other). The cure rate among clinically evaluable patients was 91% (95% of children, 88% of adolescents/adults); 68% of patients were cured within 7 days. Forty-three potentially pathogenic strains were isolated from 253 microbiologically evaluable patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 158 (62%) microbiologically evaluable patients and Staphylococcus aureus from 32 (13%). Eradication rates were 96% overall. No serious adverse events were observed. Minor adverse events were experienced by 15 (3%) of 489 patients included in the safety population. The most common adverse events were pruritus (5 patients), increased earache (4 patients), and application-site reactions (3 patients). Overall mean (SD) adherence to therapy was 98% (11.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution administered once daily for 7 days was well tolerated and effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure of OE. The compliance rates in this study suggests that this regimen may be better accepted by patients than longer, more repetitive regimens.","['Torum B', 'Block SL', 'Avila H', 'Montiel F', 'Oliva A', 'Quintanilla W', 'Duncanson F', 'Cantrell HF', 'Riefler J', 'Katz E', 'Lombardy E']",2004,26,7,Clin Ther,"Torum B, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients were randomized to 7 days treatment with either CIP/DEX 3-4 drops twice daily or N/P/H 3-4 drops three times daily.
POPULATION: Patients of either sex and older than 1 year, with a clinical diagnosis of mild, moderate, or severe AOE and intact tympanic membranes were recruited to participate.
OUTCOMES MEASURED: Signs and symptoms of AOE, including ear inflammation, tenderness, edema and discharge (assessed on Days 3, 8 [End-of-Therapy] and 18 [Test-of-Cure]); microbiologic eradication (presumed or documented); and frequency of adverse events.
RESULTS: Patients enrolled numbered 468. In culture-positive patients who met the inclusion criteria (N = 396), clinical cure rates at Day 18 were significantly higher with CIP/DEX than with N/P/H (90.9% vs. 83.9%; p = 0.0375), as were microbiologic eradication rates (94.7% vs. 86.0%; p = 0.0057).

15318488,Poor-quality water in swimming pools associated with a substantial risk of otitis externa due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"There are many large and small public outdoor and indoor swimming pools in Tehran that hundreds of people use, especially on hot summer days. The bacteriological quality of the water of some of these pools was assayed over a period of about one year (2001-2002). To assess if these swimming pools were a health risk to users, eleven public swimming pools, in the east and northeast of the city, were examined, and the exposed people were monitored. Samples of swimming-pool waters were examined for colony counts, Escherichia coli and coliforms. In addition, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from nine (81.8%) of those pools. P. aeruginosa grew in seven (63.6%) of the swimming-pool water samples. In two (18.2%) other samples, in addition to P. aeruginosa, high rates of total bacterial count, total coliforms and faecal coliform counts were also found. At the same time, users of the swimming pools were asked to complete a questionnaire. Ear swabs were collected from 179 users with a history of ear problems during the previous two weeks. An adequate control group was chosen randomly from those who never used the investigated pools. P. aeruginosa was isolated from the ear swabs of 142 (79.3%) of the cases, as well as from 4% of the controls. Results were matched for age, sex, duration of time spent in the pools, place of occurrence and other useful information. Investigation of the contaminated swimming pools revealed that chlorination was often inadequate, especially when high numbers of people led to overuse of the pools.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Body temperature was measured on healthy right and left ear canals with Thermoscan systems. Moreover, it was determined on children with altered otoscopy, companng to normal contralateral ear. To assess its diagnostic fiability, accuracy ratios were calculated in different temperatures.
RESULTS: Temperature measured bilaterally did not offer differences, and intra/interassay variation ratios were always less than 0.34%. Acute otitis externa increased tympanic thermometry a mean of 0.36 degrees C (p < 0.001), and cerumen and previously radical surgery decreased a mean of 0.62 and 0.53 degrees C, respectively (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The conditions mentioned before modify body thermometry if measured by infra-red tympanic thermometer. So, this system must be avoided in these circumstances. Otitis media, fluid in middle ear, tympanic perforation and ventilation tubes did not modify thermometric results.","['García Callejo FJ', 'Platero Zamarreño A', 'Sebastián Gil E', 'Marco Sanz M', 'Alpera Lacruz RJ', 'Martínez Beneyto MP']",2004,55,3,Acta Otorrinolaringol Esp,"García Callejo FJ, et al.

DESIGN: Descriptive study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of ENT, Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar, from May 2002 to April 2003.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients, diagnosed clinically as infectious otitis externa without concomitant suppurative otitis media, perforated tympanic membrane or otomycosis, were selected for the study. Samples of pus from external auditory canal were taken on sterile cotton swabs and were cultured on blood agar and MacConkey Agar for 24 to 48 hours. Sensitivity was tested and interpreted by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method of grading zones of inhibition.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty four subjects were cultured. Sixteen samples showed no growth. One hundred and eight specimens yielded growth of bacteria. No specimen revealed multiple organisms. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 38%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in other 38%. Others included Proteus, Enterococci, Klebsiella, and E. coli. Majority of organisms were resistant to co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin and erythromycin, while 100% were sensitive to imipenem. Sensitivity to enoxacin was 96%, Ninety-two percent were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common bacterial isolates. Both were sensitive to fluoroquinolones.

15180022,Declining susceptibility to neomycin and polymyxin B of pathogens recovered in otitis externa clinical trials.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is usually treated empirically with topical neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone. The predominant pathogens associated with this infection are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
METHODS: Two multicenter clinical trials (one in adults and adolescents, and one in children), conducted between 1995 and 1996, compared neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone with ofloxacin for the treatment of otitis externa; two similar trials were conducted between 1999 and 2000. Assessments included the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each antimicrobial drug for the major pathogens, bacterial eradication, and clinical efficacy.
RESULTS: The MICs of all bacterial isolates (including P. aeruginosa) for neomycin and polymyxin B increased markedly in the 1999 to 2000 studies compared with the 1995 to 1996 studies. In the later studies, mean MICs for all major pathogens tested had increased above the breakpoint for polymyxin B (> or = 4 microg/ml). In contrast, MICs of all isolates for ofloxacin remained similar between the two study periods and were within the susceptible range for this drug.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the bacterial eradication rates for both treatments in each study were equivalent, the clinical cure rate for neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone was lower (87%) than for ofloxacin (93%). Therefore, the organisms most often causing otitis externa appear to be developing resistance to neomycin and polymyxin B but not to ofloxacin.","['Cantrell HF', 'Lombardy EE', 'Duncanson FP', 'Katz E', 'Barone JS']",2004,97,5,South Med J,"Cantrell HF, et al.

15126742,"Acute otitis externa: efficacy and tolerability of N-chlorotaurine, a novel endogenous antiseptic agent.","OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was to test the tolerability and efficacy of the endogenous antiseptic N-chlorotaurine (NCT) in comparison with a standard clinical treatment according to a phase IIb clinical trial protocol.
STUDY DESIGN: The antimicrobial agent NCT was compared with the antibiotic component drops Otosporin (containing neomycin, polymyxin B, and hydrocortisone) for topical treatment of acute otitis externa in a randomized and rater-blinded clinical study.
METHODS: Fifty patients suffering from acute otitis externa were divided into two groups according to a randomized list. The test group was treated with 1 mL of 1% aqueous NCT solution, the reference group with 1 mL of Otosporin. The substances were applied to the external ear canal at one daily session until the signs of infection disappeared. Efficacy and tolerability were evaluated daily by visual analogue scale and a six-step infection score. In addition, smears were analyzed to identify the causative pathogens.
RESULTS: Both medications were equally well tolerated by the patients. The treatment was successful for all patients of the NCT group, whereas in one patient from the reference group, the infection did not disappear. The inflammation score improved more rapidly in the NCT group, which resulted in an earlier termination of the therapy. This difference became highly significant on days 4 to 7 (P <.01 each). Time needed for disappearance of inflammation (score 0) was 5.6 +/- 1.6 (mean +/- SD, range 3-9) days in the NCT group and 7.4 +/- 1.6 (range 4-10) days in the Otosporin group (P <.001). As expected, microbiologic cultures from ear swabs revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa (58%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18%) as the main causative pathogens.
CONCLUSIONS: NCT appears to be well tolerated and more effective than the therapy using antibiotic component drops. Because of its endogenous nature and its higher efficacy, NCT appears to be a good choice for topical treatment of acute otitis externa.","['Neher A', 'Nagl M', 'Appenroth E', 'Gstöttner M', 'Wischatta M', 'Reisigl F', 'Schindler M', 'Ulmer H', 'Stephan K']",2004,114,5,Laryngoscope,"Neher A, et al.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of orbifloxacin against 240 field S. intermedius isolates (69 skin and 171 ear isolates) ranged from 0.016 to 8 mg l(-1), with MIC50 and MIC90 equal to 0.5 and 1 mg l(-1), respectively. Only one strain, a pyoderma isolate was resistant (MIC=8 mg l(-1)). Orbifloxacin was tested at different concentrations for killing rate against five isolates obtained from pyoderma cases and against a reference strain (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213). Orbifloxacin expressed a concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against the S. aureus reference strain, but a time-dependent bactericidal activity against S. intermedius.

Cerumen samples were collected from three groups; group A (n = 20) consisted of patients with recurrent otitis externa, group B (n = 20) consisted of patients with an open cavity and group C (n = 30) consisted of healthy subjects. The mean of the microbial count was 3.4 x 10(4) in group A, 3.08 x 10(4) in group B and 2.48 x 10(4) in group C. The most commonly isolated microorganism from the three groups was Staphylococcus epidermidis. No growth was observed in five cases (25 per cent) in group A and in three cases (10 per cent) in group C. In group B antimicrobial growth was observed in all samples. In 46 (65 per cent) of the cerumen samples, the isolates were monomicrobial and 24 (35 per cent) of the cerumen samples were polymicrobial. The isolates were polymicrobial in 65 per cent of group A, 20 per cent in group B and 23.3 per cent in group C. In the process of investigating the microbial flora of cerumen in all the three groups, microbial growth was observed from all the samples from patients with an open cavity, unlike the other groups, and it was determined that the group with recurrent external otitis had the most abundant microbial flora.","['Pata YS', 'Oztürk C', 'Akbaş Y', 'Unal M', 'Görür K', 'Ozcan C']",2004,118,4,J Laryngol Otol,"Pata YS, et al.

15096420,The bone-anchored hearing aid: quality-of-life assessment.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) on the quality of life (QOL) of adults and to test the hypothesis that a BAHA improves QOL because otorrhea and/or skin irritations decrease.
DESIGN: Prospective postal-based questionnaire study using validated health-related QOL instruments, combined with hearing-aid-related questions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 56 consecutive adult patients with acquired conductive or mixed hearing loss who were scheduled for BAHA implantation at the University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. All 56 patients completed the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and the Hearing Handicap and Disability Inventory (HHDI); 36 patients had been using an air-conduction hearing aid (ACHA) and 20 patients a conventional bone-conduction hearing aid (CBHA). Questionnaires were filled out before surgery and after 6 months of experience with the BAHA.
RESULTS: In the SF-36 group, there was significant improvement in the scores of the mental health domain (P =.02). When the SF-36 patients were classified according to previous hearing aid, there was no statistically significant change in the scores in any of the domains. In the EQ-5D group and in its ACHA and CBHA subgroups, there were no important differences in the results before and after the patients received their BAHAs. In the HHDI group, the handicap and disability scales showed significant improvement (P<.01) irrespective of the type of previously worn hearing aid.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, generic health-related QOL was not influenced significantly by the use of a BAHA according to the SF-36 and the EQ-5D. The more disease-specific scales (HHDI) did show improved QOL with a BAHA.","['Hol MK', 'Spath MA', 'Krabbe PF', 'van der Pouw CT', 'Snik AF', 'Cremers CW', 'Mylanus EA']",2004,130,4,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Hol MK, et al.

15064639,Protective effect of corticosteroid against the cytotoxicity of aminoglycoside otic drops on isolated cochlear outer hair cells.,"OBJECTIVES: Otic drops are commonly used not only for otitis externa but also for otorrhea in the presence of tympanic membrane perforation or tympanostomy tube. Many studies demonstrated the ototoxicity of aminoglycoside. In our previous study, we observed that gentamicin (GM), when activated with liver extract, demonstrated significant cytotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to assess the protective effect of corticosteroid against the cytotoxicity of GM and tobramycin drops using isolated cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) in vitro with liver extract.
METHODS: OHCs from adult chinchilla cochleae were exposed to standard bathing solution, liver extract alone, and aminoglycoside otic drops with and without corticosteroid and liver extract. All experiments were performed at an osmolality of 305 +/- 5 mOsm, at room temperature, and for up to 60 minutes. The images of OHCs were recorded using an inverted microscope and analyzed on the Image Pro-Plus 3.0 program. Time to cell death and change of cell length were measured and analyzed.
RESULTS: The time to cell death and percent change in cell length observed was significantly longer in the GM + liver extract + dexamethasone group than the GM + liver extract group (P <.05). The Tobradex + liver extract group showed an insignificant increase in percent change of cell length (P >.05) and significantly increased time to cell death than the tobramycin + liver extract group (P <.05).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that dexamethasone significantly reduced aminoglycoside cytotoxicity.","['Park SK', 'Choi D', 'Russell P', 'John EO', 'Jung TT']",2004,114,4,Laryngoscope,"Park SK, et al.

The use of a thorough history and general and dermatologic physical examinations often leads the clinician to establish a systematic approach to identify the specific underlying problems. Until this is accomplished, the recurrent nature of the otitis externa will remain as a persistent problem.",['Rosser EJ'],2004,34,2,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,Rosser EJ.

15062616,Otic cytology in health and disease.,"Accurate characterization of the primary cause and perpetuating factors is essential for successful management of ear disease in dogs and cats. Cytology is a simple, rapid, and practical diagnostic test that should be performed routinely on any and all patients presented for clinical signs consistent with otitis externa. In combination with clinical signs, otoscopic evaluation, and diagnostic testing of primary disease, serial cytology enhances the ability of veterinarians to diagnose secondary infections, monitor progression of disease, evaluate response to therapy, and make appropriate management decisions. Cytologic specimens should be evaluated for the presence, numbers, and characteristics of three key features: yeast, bacteria, and leukocytes. More than five yeast organisms or more than 25 bacteria per high-powered field is suggestive of significant microbial activity warranting therapeutic intervention. The presence of leukocytes, particularly with phagocytized bacteria, indicates ""true infection"" rather than overgrowth; if suppurative discharge is present, systemic therapy is needed. Cytology combined with culture and susceptibility is the best method for identification of bacterial overgrowth and infection; however, if only one test can be performed, always choose cytology. Culture results assist in the selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy, but cytology determines whether systemic antibiotics are indicated, which organisms are most significant, and when therapy can be discontinued.",['Angus JC'],2004,34,2,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,Angus JC.

It is important to become familiar with the normal structures of the ear to identify any abnormalities. The video otoscope greatly enhances visualization of these structures as well as aiding in retrieval of foreign bodies, biopsy of masses, and performance of a myringotomy. In some cases, a complete otoscopic examination is not possible on the first visit, and the animal may require anti-inflammatory medications or otic flushing to visualize the entire ear canal as well as the tympanic membrane. The purpose of the otoscopic examination is to address the otitis by evaluating the condition of the ear, looking for any masses or foreign bodies; noting the presence, consistency, and color of any exudate; and evaluating the patency of the tympanic membrane. Once a complete otic evaluation has been performed, additional diagnostics as well as a treatment plan can be formulated.",['Cole LK'],2004,34,2,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,Cole LK.

15054367,The development of antibiotic resistant organisms with the use of ototopical medications.,"OBJECTIVE: There is growing concern over the use of systemic antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance. The question remains as to whether ototopical medications may also promote antibiotic-resistant organisms, either on a local level (in the ear) or in other areas of the aerodigestive tract. We performed an evidence-based review to answer the following clinical question, ""Do antibiotic ototopical medications induce antibiotic resistant organisms?""
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature from 1966 to the present. We used appropriate search terms such as ""ototopical antibiotics,"" ""ototopical drops,"" ""antibiotic resistance,"" ""topical antibiotics and otitis externa,"" ""otitis externa and treatment,"" ""otitis externa and antibiotic drops,"" ""otitis externa and ototopical drops,"" ""otitis media,"" ""otitis media and treatment,"" ""otitis media and antibiotic drops,"" ""chronic suppurative otitis media,"" ""chronic suppurative otitis media and treatment,"" ""chronic suppurative otitis media and antibiotic drops,"" "" otitis externa and resistant organisms,"" ""otitis media and resistant organisms,"" ""chronic suppurative otitis media and resistant organisms,"" ""ophthalmic antibiotic drops,"" ""draining ear,"" ""P.E. tube otorrhea,"" ""pressure equalizing tube otorrhea,"" ""pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and treatment,"" and ""pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and ototopical therapy"" to identify pertinent articles. These articles were reviewed and graded according to the evidence quality.
RESULTS: After an initial screening of over 2,500 articles, 38 articles were analyzed further; of these, 11 were determined to warrant extensive review. Eight articles evaluated chronic suppurative otitis media; 2, otitis externa; and 1, post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea, whereas 3 others studied systemic absorption. Of the 8 chronic suppurative otitis media studies, there were thought to be 5 grade 2B studies, 1 grade 1B study, and 1 grade 2C study. These studies did not demonstrate a propensity for the development of resistant organisms. No study answered the question as to whether resistance to systemic antibiotics might occur in otitis externa.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall grade B evidence seems to indicate that no significant antibiotic resistance develops from the use of ototopical antibiotic treatment.","['Weber PC', 'Roland PS', 'Hannley M', 'Friedman R', 'Manolidis S', 'Matz G', 'Owens F', 'Rybak L', 'Stewart MG']",2004,130,3 Suppl,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Weber PC, et al.

15019103,Pseudomonas aeruginosa from canine otitis externa exhibit a quorum sensing deficiency.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasB elastase gene (lasB) transcription depends on cell density-dependent quorum-sensing mechanisms of gene activation. Previously, we collected several non-mucoid P. aeruginosa veterinary isolates and showed that the total matrix protease phenotype was similar for isolates regardless of host and site of isolation. In contrast, isolates from chronic canine ear infections (otitis externa) were significantly more likely to exhibit less elastase activity as measured by elastin Congo red than from any other site [Clin.

15018735,Potential of atelocollagen-mediated systemic antisense therapeutics for inflammatory disease.,"To study the possibility of using atelocollagen as an oligonucleotide (ODN) delivery carrier in vivo, the activity of formulated antisense ODN targeted against the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA was investigated in an allergic dermatitis model in mice. The allergic dermatitis was elicited in one ear of animals sensitized by treatment with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. Antisense ODN was given to the animals as a single intravenous injection of formulation containing atelocollagen. Antisense activity was determined by measurement of ear thickness, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry 24 hr after the initiation of the dermatitis. Antisense activity was found to increase according to the concentration of atelocollagen in the formulation. The effect mediated by the ODN formulated with 0.05% atelocollagen was more than 50 times greater than that provided by ODN infusion, although the levels of ODN formulated with atelocollagen dropped below that of the 24-hr infusion group within 30 min. The formulated ODN could suppress inflammatory progression by treatment at 8 hr after the ear challenge when inflammation had already commenced at the challenged site. Moreover, antisense activity was noted even when the formulated ODN was injected 3 days before the initiation of inflammation. These data demonstrate that atelocollagen can enhance antisense activity remarkably and that the sustainable antisense activity mediated by the formulation of ODN with atelocollagen could completely change the strategy of antisense therapeutics.","['Hanai K', 'Kurokawa T', 'Minakuchi Y', 'Maeda M', 'Nagahara S', 'Miyata T', 'Ochiya T', 'Sano A']",2004,15,3,Hum Gene Ther,"Hanai K, et al.

15013609,Cotton-tip applicators as a leading cause of otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: Otitis externa (OE), also known as ""swimmer's ear"", is an inflammation or infection of the external auditory canal. Many risk factors have been identified, mainly excessive moisture in the canal from swimming.
STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: To study the leading risk factors of otitis externa. Eighty-seven children aged 3.5-12 years (mean 68+/-6.5 months) who were diagnosed with otitis externa from December 1999 to March 2001 were studied for age, sex, cerumen cleaning habits, signs and symptoms. Findings were compared to an age-matched control group of 90 children without otitis externa.
RESULTS: Sixty-one children (70.1%) in the study group had their ears cleaned with a cotton-tip applicator (Q-tip) during the 10 days preceding the diagnosis of otitis externa. In the control group, only 31 (34%) used applicators routinely during the 10 days prior to diagnosis (P<0.001). Other risk factors for otitis externa were swimming in a pool (34%), wax removal (5.8%) and ventilation tubes (1.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of a cotton-tip applicator to clean the ear seems to be the leading cause of otitis externa in children and should be avoided.","['Nussinovitch M', 'Rimon A', 'Volovitz B', 'Raveh E', 'Prais D', 'Amir J']",2004,68,4,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,"Nussinovitch M, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 27 patients with eczematous external otitis and 16 healthy volunteer were included. The existence of food hypersensitivity was defined by positive epicutaneous prick test and specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.
RESULTS: Food allergy test was positive in 13 (48.1%) out of 27 cases with eczematous external otitis, and it was positive in 2 (12.5%) out of 16 cases in control group. The difference between 2 groups was statistically significant (P =.02). Specific IgE seropositivity (51.9%) was high in the patients with eczematous external otitis compared with the control group (12.5%) (P =.02).

Multiple studies have supported the efficacy of topical quinolones in the management of acute otitis media, acute otitis externa, and CSOM. For the first time, otolaryngologists have a scientific foundation on which to base our treatment protocols for these conditions. We no longer must rely solely on our clinical experience and prejudices. The quinolone drops have a superior safety profile and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, their overall cost is lower than the alternatives, and their convenient dosing schedule is tolerated well by most patients. When one takes all these factors into consideration, it becomes clear that topical quinolone therapy, with or without a steroid additive, is the treatment of choice for otorrhea in patients with a tympanic membrane perforation or ventilating tube.

The outcome measure was complete resolution of the OE after one week. Forty-four patients with refractory, bacterial as well as fungal, OE entered the study, comprising 30 ears in each treatment arm. Eight patients defaulted from follow-up, five ears in each treatment arm. A single instillation of one per cent silver nitrate gel cured 23 (92 per cent) of 25 ears with OE, whereas with 0.1 per cent silver nitrate gel seven (28 per cent) of 25 ears treated were cured (Fisher-exact test, p-exact = 0.00010). In a non-controlled series of 120 ears 93.3 per cent needed only a single instillation of one per cent silver nitrate gel while another five per cent were cured after a second instillation a week later.

14720566,"The changing face of malignant (necrotising) external otitis: clinical, radiological, and anatomic correlations.","Malignant (necrotising) external otitis is an invasive infection of the external auditory canal. Although elderly patients with diabetes remain the population most commonly affected, immunosuppressed individuals (eg, from HIV infection, chemotherapy, etc) are also susceptible to malignant external otitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is isolated from the aural drainage in more than 90% of cases. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood although aural water exposure (eg, irrigation for cerumen impaction) has been reported as a potential iatrogenic factor. The typical patient presents with exquisitely painful otorrhoea. If untreated, cranial neuropathies (most commonly of the facial nerve) can develop due to subtemporal extension of the infection. The diagnosis of malignant external otitis is based on a combination of clinical findings, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and radiographic evidence of soft tissue with or without bone erosion in the external canal and infratemporal fossa. Treatment consists of prolonged administration (6-8 weeks) of an antipseudomonal agent (typically an orally administered quinolone). With the introduction and widespread use of both oral and topical quinolones, there are reports of less severe presentation of malignant external otitis and even the emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance.

14652937,[Chronic recurrent otitis externa. Excessive ear hygienic care can have sequelae].,"Numerous factors may be involved in the development of chronic recurrent otitis externa: altered pH of the cerumen, increased susceptibility to contact allergens (e.g. nickel ear-rings) in atopic patients, the use of instruments for cleaning out the auditory canal, the presence of a foreign body, congential narowing of the auditory canal, or systemic diseases (in particular diabetes mellitus). For diagnostic purposes, the use of the otoscope is mandatory, and swabs to determine the presence of bacteria or fungi are to be recommended. Treatment is dictated by the clinical picture presenting, and may comprise the local application of antibiotic cortisone containing or antimycotic preparations and temponade of the auditory canal (acute inflammatory phase) or pH-stabilizing lotions (chronic dry inflammatory phase) with the aim of ameliorating the frequently highly troublesome pruritus.",['Naumann A'],2003,145,43,MMW Fortschr Med,Naumann A.

14630756,Clinical efficacy of three common treatments in acute otitis externa in primary care: randomised controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of ear drops containing acetic acid, corticosteroid and acetic acid, and steroid and antibiotic in acute otitis externa in primary care.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: 79 general practices, Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: 213 adults with acute otitis externa.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: duration of symptoms (days) according to patient diaries. Secondary outcome: cure rate according to general practitioner completed questionnaires and recurrence of symptoms between days 21 and 42.
RESULTS: Symptoms lasted for a median of 8.0 days (95% confidence interval 7.0 to 9.0) in the acetic acid group, 7.0 days (5.8 to 8.3) in the steroid and acetic acid group, and 6.0 days (5.1 to 6.9) in the steroid and antibiotic group. The overall cure rates at seven, 14, and 21 days were 38%, 68%, and 75%, respectively. Compared with the acetic acid group, significantly more patients were cured in the steroid and acetic acid group and steroid and antibiotic group at day 14 (odds ratio 2.4, 1.1 to 5.3, and 3.5, 1.6 to 7.7, respectively) and day 21 (5.3, 2.0 to 13.7, and 3.9, 1.7 to 9.1, respectively). Recurrence of symptoms between days 21 and 42 occurred in 29% (50/172) of patients and was seen significantly less in the steroid and acetic acid group (0.3, 0.1 to 0.7) and steroid and antibiotic group (0.4, 0.2 to 1.0) than in the acetic acid group.
CONCLUSIONS: Ear drops containing corticosteroids are more effective than acetic acid ear drops in the treatment of acute otitis externa in primary care.

14561963,Temporomandibular joint involvement in malignant external otitis.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present 6 patients with malignant external otitis (MEO) that resulted in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement and to discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, and treatment modalities.
STUDY DESIGN: All patients diagnosed with MEO between 1994 and 2002 were reviewed for cases in which the TMJ was invaded by the infectious process. Only patients in whom TMJ involvement was documented radiographically and in whom the clinical course was well documented were included in this study.
RESULTS: MEO was diagnosed in 42 patients over an 8-year period; TMJ involvement was recorded in 6 patients (14%). The medical history revealed controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in 4 of the 6 patients. All patients reported early ear symptoms, mainly otalgia and otorrhea. Local signs included an ear canal filled with granulation material, edematous overlying skin, and sensitivity to palpation. Cultures taken from the external ear were positive for either Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, or Proteus mirabilis. TMJ symptoms developed between 1 and 5 months after admission and included painful periauricular swelling and trismus. In 3 patients, healing was uneventful; 3 also died of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: TMJ involvement in MEO is associated with a resistant disease process, often with several recurrences. Prolonged administration of antibiotics is the treatment of choice. Surgical debridement of the TMJ is necessary for the positive identification of the pathogenic organism, in cases of abscess formation, or when osteomyelitic bone destruction of the condyle and glenoid fossa develop.","['Mardinger O', 'Rosen D', 'Minkow B', 'Tulzinsky Z', 'Ophir D', 'Hirshberg A']",2003,96,4,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod,"Mardinger O, et al.

14501442,Immunohistochemical investigations on external auditory canal cholesteatomas.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze the biological behavior of external auditory canal cholesteatoma (EACC). The expression and distribution of relevant markers such as transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR), and the proliferation marker MIB 1 were studied in comparison with normal auditory meatal skin.
BACKGROUND: EACC are uncommon and knowledge concerning etiology and pathogenesis is limited. Whether this is a unique entity remains controversially discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical methods were used to study the expression and distribution TGF-alpha, EGFR, and the proliferation marker MIB 1 on 15 tissues samples. Only the spontaneous form of EACC was included in this study.
RESULTS: Positive immunoreactivity for the proliferation marker MIB 1 could be demonstrated in keratinocytes in the basal and suprabasal layers of the epithelium. The number of MIB 1-positive proliferating cells in cholesteatoma was significantly higher than in normal external auditory skin. Cholesteatoma epithelium also showed an enhanced expression of TGF-alpha and EGFR. Inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the perimatrix to various degrees.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that similar to the middle ear cholesteatoma, a chronic inflammatory process underlies the EACC, and the inflammatory stimuli may alter keratinocyte proliferation.","['Adamczyk M', 'Sudhoff H', 'Jahnke K']",2003,24,5,Otol Neurotol,"Adamczyk M, et al.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review at a tertiary care medical center.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients diagnosed with invasive polymicrobial temporal bone infections was performed. Four patients were identified. All patients required surgical therapy for definitive management. All patients were followed for at least 1 year or until death.
RESULTS: Three of four patients had invasive fungi as pathogens. One patient had an occult squamous cell carcinoma. At the time of writing, one patient was free of disease, two were dead of disease, and one was alive with disease.
CONCLUSION: Invasive polymicrobial temporal bone infections can occur in immunocompromised patients and can possibly harbor an occult malignancy.

High numbers of Malassezia isolates were significantly associated with maturity of the animals and with diagnosed otitis. In healthy animals, a particularly low prevalence of the genus was found in Holstein cows, especially in the summer months, a finding perhaps correlating with the open, air-exposed ears of this breed. Pendutlous-eared zebu breeds and hybrids had higher levels of colonization, although this effect was more pronounced in humid regions, and was least in the dry north and west of the state. The most common species seen was M. sympodialis, which accounted for 47.1% of isolates from healthy cattle and 39.1% from cattle with otitis. In cattle with otitis sampled in summer, we found that the relatively thermotolerant M. sympodialis made up 80.8% of isolates. By contrast, during the winter the less thermotolerant M. globosa was the most common species from otitis, making up 56% of the isolates. Humidity and temperature may be the main factors explaining the epidemiology of Malassezia diseases and colonizations in both animals and humans.","['Duarte ER', 'Batista RD', 'Hahn RC', 'Hamdan JS']",2003,41,2,Med Mycol,"Duarte ER, et al.

METHODS: Retrospective review of 306 ears discharging some kind of fluid of 296 patients, who appeared in the ENT Department of our Hospital over a 58-month period.
RESULTS: The most common type of otorrhea was the purulent one: 276 ears among 306 discharging ears (90%). The most common cause of purulent otorrhea was otitis externa: 156 ears among 276 ears discharging purulent fluid (56%). The germ most commonly isolated in the cultures of purulent aural discharge was Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 67 isolations of P. aeruginosa among 256 cultures (26%).

12917118,Central skull base osteomyelitis in patients without otitis externa: imaging findings.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Skull base osteomyelitis typically arises as a complication of ear infection in older diabetic patients, involves the temporal bone, and has Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the usual pathogen. Atypical skull base osteomyelitis arising from the sphenoid or occipital bones without associated external otitis occurs much less frequently and initially may have headache as the only symptom. The purpose of this study was to review the clinical and MR imaging features of central skull base osteomyelitis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR images obtained in six patients with central skull base osteomyelitis. No patient had predisposing external otitis or osteomyelitis of the temporal bone.
RESULTS: All of our patients presented with headache, no external ear pain, and cranial nerve deficits. Five of six patients had a predisposition to infection, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated in the five patients in whom it was checked. In each case, the diagnosis was delayed until MR imaging demonstrated central skull base abnormality, and the diagnosis was then confirmed with tissue sampling. The most consistent imaging findings were clival bone marrow T1 hypointensity and preclival soft tissue infiltration. Five of six patients were cured with no recurrence of skull base infection over a 2-4-year follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: In the setting of headache, cranial neuropathy, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and abnormal clival imaging findings, central skull base osteomyelitis should be considered as the likely diagnosis. Early tissue sampling and appropriate treatment may prevent or limit further complications such as intracranial extension, empyema, or death.","['Chang PC', 'Fischbein NJ', 'Holliday RA']",2003,24,7,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,"Chang PC, et al.

12892351,Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis.,"Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis, an infection involving the temporal and adjacent bones, is a relatively rare complication of external otitis. It occurs primarily in immunocompromised persons, especially older persons with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal. The most frequent pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with necrotizing external otitis complain of severe otalgia that worsens at night, and otorrhea. Clinical findings include granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, especially at the bone-cartilage junction. Facial and other cranial nerve palsies indicate a poor prognosis; intracranial complications are the most frequent cause of death. Diagnosis requires culture of ear secretions and pathologic examination of granulation tissue from the infection site. Imaging studies may include computed tomographic scanning, technetium Tc 99m medronate bone scanning, and gallium citrate Ga 67 scintigraphy. Treatment includes correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy and, in selected patients, surgery. Family physicians and others who provide medical care for immunocompromised patients should be alert to the possibility of necrotizing external otitis in patients who complain of otalgia, particularly if they have diabetes mellitus and external otitis that has been refractory to standard therapy. Susceptible patients should be educated to avoid manipulation of the ear canal (i.e., they should not use cotton swabs to clean their ears) and to minimize exposure of the ear canal to water with a high chloride concentration. Appropriate patients should be referred to an otolaryngologist.","['Handzel O', 'Halperin D']",2003,68,2,Am Fam Physician,Handzel O and Halperin D. Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis.

They shared a number of phenotypic characteristics with these species, but they could be easily differentiated by biochemical reactions. In addition, the canine strains were unusual in their nearly complete failure to grow on sodium azide-containing enterococci-selective media and in their Voges-Proskauer reactions (usually negative). By using 16S rRNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization of representative strains, as well as tDNA interspacer gene PCR and SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins, the group of canine strains was shown to constitute a novel enterococcal species. The name Enterococcus canis sp. nov. is proposed for this species, with LMG 12316T (= CCUG 46666T) as the type strain. Concurrently, the taxonomic situation and nomenclatural position of Enterococcus porcinus were investigated. As no phenotypic or genotypic differences were found between this species and Enterococcus villorum, the name E. porcinus is considered to be a junior synonym of E. villorum.","['De Graef EM', 'Devriese LA', 'Vancanneyt M', 'Baele M', 'Collins MD', 'Lefebvre K', 'Swings J', 'Haesebrouck F']",2003,53,Pt 4,Int J Syst Evol Microbiol,"De Graef EM, et al.

Group A (n = 20) consisted of patients with recurrent otitis externa (2 or more acute otitis externa attack in the current year) and group B (n = 30) consisted of cerumen from a healthy population. We examined the bactericidal activity against the common microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus) that encounter the recurrent otitis externa.
RESULTS: A significant decrease in the count of S epidermidis was observed in group A (P <.05) and B (P <.01) was observed. A comparison of decreases and increases in the percentages of microorganisms between the groups A and B showed that there was a significant difference only in the count of E coli (P <or=.05). The count of E coli decreased in cerumen suspension in group A, but it increased in the normal population.

Drops were accurately weighed before and after use so that both the amount used and the expected amount patients should have used could be calculated.

12871245,External auditory canal pH in chronic otitis externa.,"Several risk factors have been postulated to play a part in the progression of acute into chronic otitis externa, including changes towards alkalinity of the skin pH of the external auditory canal. These changes have been previously reported to occur in the acute stage, and their persistence may predispose to a chronic status of this condition. This prospective control study was designed to look at this possible relationship in more depth, by comparing the external auditory canal pH of individuals with chronic otitis externa, but with no current exacerbation, with an age-/sex-matched control group. Analysis of the data revealed a significantly higher external auditory canal pH in the chronic otitis externa group (P < 0.004) when compared with the controls, with no concomitant difference in body skin pH. Within this chronic otitis externa cohort, a statistically significant correlation was found between external auditory canal pH and the severity of the condition, as assessed using a multiparameter scoring system (r = 0.562; P < 0.02). Importantly, the pH was not related to the length of time since the last exacerbation. There was a significant age relationship present within our sample. Younger patients displayed more severe chronic otitis externa(r = -0.813; P < 0.001), with correspondingly higher external auditory canal pH values (r = -0.550; P < 0.02). The results suggest that alkaline ear canal skin is a local risk factor for the progression into chronic otitis externa, occurring, in this study, with greater severity in younger individuals.","['Martinez Devesa P', 'Willis CM', 'Capper JW']",2003,28,4,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci,"Martinez Devesa P, et al.

During 2001, susceptibility data from bacterial isolates collected from urine, faeces and ear swabs and antimicrobial susceptibility for Streptococcus pyogenes during the first five months in 2002 were recorded in the Health Area of Pamplona (389,489 inhabitants) and compared against data for antibiotic prescriptions. More than 80% of bacteria from urine were susceptible to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, oral cephalosporins, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin. Of the Salmonella Enteritidis isolates, 98.3% were susceptible to trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole and 96.6% of Campylobacter jejuni to erythromycin. Amoxicillin remained susceptible for more than 95.5% of middle ear isolates. Gram-negative bacilli isolates from otitis externa swabs were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and polimyxin B in over 80% of cases. Of the Streptococcus pyogenes isolated, 22.5% were resistant to erythromycin. Antimicrobial consumption in defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants, day (DID) during 2001 was 14.8.

12829383,Mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from canine infections.,"Chronic otitis externa in dogs is often associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Fluoroquinolones are often used for treating such infections. Fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms were characterized in 10 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from chronic canine otitis externa. Nine out of ten strains harbored a mutation in the gyrA gene and presented an overexpression of efflux pump(s). There was a good correlation between the lipophilicity of the fluoroquinolone being tested and the effect of the efflux pump inhibitor in the final MIC. Therefore, both mechanisms, mutation in the gyrA gene and increased efflux pump(s), seem to play an important role in the acquisition of fluoroquinolone resistance in veterinary clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. Levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones suggest that they could not be a good choice for systemic therapy of Pseudomonas otitis.","['Teresa Tejedor M', 'Martín JL', 'Navia M', 'Freixes J', 'Vila J']",2003,94,4,Vet Microbiol,"Teresa Tejedor M, et al.

12784207,Inflammatory polyps of the middle ear in 5 dogs.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe inflammatory polyps of the middle ear in 5 dogs.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series.
ANIMALS: Five dogs with ear disease.
METHODS: Medical records (1995-2001) were reviewed to identify dogs with inflammatory polyps of the middle ear. Signalment, clinical signs, ancillary diagnostic procedures, treatment, postoperative complications, and outcome were recorded. Owners and referring veterinarians were contacted to document outcome.
RESULTS: Dogs with inflammatory polyps of the middle ear were male and aged 4 to 13 years. Two dogs had bilateral polyps, whereas 3 had unilateral polyps. The most common clinical presentation was otitis externa and media, with radiographic evidence of otitis media. Polyps were treated by ventral bulla osteotomy (VBO) in 1 dog and total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy (TECA-LBO) in 4 dogs. Polyps consisted of a fibrovascular stroma infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The overlying epithelium was frequently ulcerated. Immediate postoperative complications included a seroma after VBO (1 dog) and transient unilateral facial nerve paralysis after bilateral TECA-LBO (1 dog). No recurrence occurred within 9 to 69 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral or bilateral, inflammatory polyps can occur in the middle ear of dogs in association with otitis externa and media. No recurrence occurred after surgical removal of the polyps.

The head and neck is the most common site of involvement, occurring in approximately 60% of LCH patients. Head and neck manifestations are diverse and include skull and temporal bone lesions, cervical lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. Diagnosis can be difficult as these lesions mimic other common conditions seen by the otolaryngologist, including otitis externa, acute mastoiditis, and gingivitis. A retrospective study was carried out to study our centre's experience with LCH over the last 10 years. Twenty-one patients were diagnosed between January 1990 and December 1999. Patient's age at time of diagnosis ranged from 6 days to 14 years. Fifty-seven percent of patients had localized bony lesions; the remaining 43% had diffuse multisystem disease. The head and neck was also the most commonly involved site in our study, affecting 67% of our patients. Presentation and diagnosis of these lesions are discussed in detail.

12688832,A benefit-risk assessment of ofloxacin otic solution in ear infection.,"Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with potent bactericidal activities and the topical otological preparation of this drug has been clinically utilised since the late 1980s. The rate of eradication with ofloxacin ranges from 83.3% to 100% for all pathogens commonly isolated from middle ear effusions in cases of otitis media and otitis externa. Despite the significant length of its usage, emergence of resistant pathogens has been rarely encountered in clinical trials; only two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been documented with decreased susceptibility to ofloxacin following the use of the otic solution.Ear infections, including otitis externa, chronic suppurative otitis media and otorrhoea associated with tympanostomy tubes, are common problems in clinical practice. The potential complications associated with ear infection can be otological, extratemporal, or even psychosocial. They are sometimes fatal and the effect can be long-lasting and detrimental. The use of an effective topical antibacterial with high cost-effectiveness is definitely warranted. As regards various clinical aspects, including overall success rate, symptomatic relief of otalgia and otorrhoea, ofloxacin otic solution was found to be more effective than comparator agents, be it a topical antibacterial, a systemic antibacterial or combination drugs. The systemic absorption of fluoroquinolones is minimal after topical application. Ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% has been shown to have a low rate of adverse drug reactions. Adverse reactions to ofloxacin otic solution were generally mild. The lack of ototoxic effect from ofloxacin eardrops, even in the concentration higher than 0.3%, has been demonstrated in animal studies. In the clinical setting, no increase in bone-conduction threshold has been shown after the treatment of topical ofloxacin otic solution. There have not been any reports of ototoxicity with ofloxacin otic solution since its approval. To conclude, ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% is clinically effective in the treatment of otitis externa and chronic suppurative otitis media in particular with respect to the overall cure rate, relief of otalgia and otorrhoea. It is well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. It is not associated with any ototoxicity both experimentally and clinically.","['Wai TK', 'Tong MC']",2003,26,6,Drug Saf,Wai TK and Tong MC.

Results of the Ulm Treatment Concept].","BACKGROUND: Even today, necrotizing otitis externa is still a life-threatening condition. The standard treatment concepts based on antibiotic therapy, topical treatment and--if necessary--surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, remain ineffective in many cases. In advanced stages, necrotizing otitis externa can therefore be expected to result in severe functional impairment or even a fatal outcome.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe our experience with a multimodal treatment concept that we have been using with great success at the Federal Armed Forces Hospital in Ulm since 1987. This treatment is based on four pillars: 1. Surgical debridement, 2. Use of a combination of antibiotics, and 3. Administration of specific immunoglobulins, accompanied by, 4. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
RESULTS: Over a period of more than 5 years 16 of the 22 patients treated on the basis of this multimodal concept remained free of recurrences. In addition, significant reductions in analgesic use and in the insulin doses needed by diabetic patients were possible.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment concept under scrutiny has proved particularly successful.

The child had a history of recurrent bilateral inflammation of the middle ear. Tympanometry revealed a reduced compliance. Due to conductive hearing loss it was impossible to measure otoacustic emissions. Otherwise a normal ENT status was found. Imaging (MRI/CT) demonstrated bitemporal soft-tissue changes with extensive osseous destruction, but no typical imaging signs of an inflammatory, dysplastic or expansive process. The tentative diagnosis of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH) made on the basis of the clinical and imaging findings was confirmed by biopsy. After exclusion of disseminated LCH, chemotherapy was initiated, and the child underwent follow-up imaging after 3 months. CT showed clear signs of bitemporal reossification. The case reported here illustrates the problems encountered in diagnosing LCH which may present with unspecific clinical symptoms despite advanced osseous destruction. ENT specialists should be familiar with this very heterogeneous entity and think of LCH especially in children presenting with therapy-refractory otitis media, otitis externa, or mastoiditis in order to ensure a timely diagnosis and to thus improve the chances of successful therapy.

Causes are classified as predisposing (increase the risk of otitis); primary (directly induce otitis), secondary (contribute to otitis only in an abnormal ear or in conjunction with predisposing factors) and perpetuating (result from inflammation and pathology in ear, prevent resolution of otitis). Common primary causes include foreign bodies, hypersensitivity (particularly atopy and food allergy), keratinisation disorders (most commonly primary idiopathic seborrhoea and hypothyroidism) and earmites, particularly in cats. A systematic diagnostic procedure is required to identify causes and contributing factors. This should include history, clinical examination, otoscopy and cytology in all cases and culture and sensitivity as well as otitis media assessment and biopsy in severe and recurrent cases. Ancillary tests may be required depending on the underlying cause. Treatment consists of identifying and addressing predisposing and primary factors; cleaning the ear canal; topical therapy; systemic therapy where necessary; client education; follow-up; and preventive and maintenance therapy as required.",['Jacobson LS'],2002,73,4,J S Afr Vet Assoc,Jacobson LS.

Diseases and patients are as follows: 1) 11 ears with postoperative mastoid cavity problems, 2) 7 ears with chronic external otitis and chronic eczema of the external ear canal, 3) 7 ears with fungal otitis externa, 4) 6 ears with chronic otitis media with perforation, and 5) 2 ears of chronic granulated myringitis.
METHOD: The solution was dropped into the ear canal once a day for 10 min or cotton balls soaked with the solution were applied to the canal wall. Criteria of efficacy were divided into cured, effective and unchanged.
RESULTS: 8/11 ears with a cavity problem were cured (72.7%) and 3 ears showed treatment to be effective. All 7 ears with chronic external otitis and chronic eczema were cured. All 7 ears with fungal otitis externa were cured. 4/6 ears (66.6%) with chronic perforated otitis media were cured and 1 ear each showed treatment to be effective and 1 unchanged. Two chronic granurated myringitis were cured. Twenty of 25 ears (80%) were cured. Pre- and posttreatment audiometries showed almost the same. The cure appeared within 3 days to 3 weeks. The solution was not effective against mucoid secretion, cholesteatoma, or residual mastoid cells. The day after treatment, serous secretion appears temporarily.
CONCLUSION: Burows's solution is seemed to be very effective and nonototoxic as an otic drop for treating suppurative ear diseases.","['Terayama Y', 'Takizawa M', 'Gotouda H', 'Sutou S', 'Kashiwamura M']",2003,106,1,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho,"Terayama Y, et al.

12625885,Microbial contamination of non-disposable instruments in otolaryngology out-patients.,"Nosocomial infections are an important cause of morbidity and contaminated equipment may contribute to this. There has been little work concerning contamination of non-disposable equipment in Otolaryngology. This study investigates the efficacy of the cleaning regimen for non-disposable instruments in an Otolaryngology out-patients clinic. Instruments were swabbed before each clinic, when they had been autoclaved, then after use on patients, when they had been washed with detergent and chlorhexidine. Swabs of 86 instruments were cultured using standardized microbiological techniques. Fifteen instruments (17 per cent) were contaminated, most with coagulase negative staphylococci. Two specimens of Micrococcus luteus were cultured and one each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Aureobacterium spp. Micrococcus luteus and coagulase negative staphylococci may represent skin contaminants, but Aureobacterium spp. and Acinetobacter lwoffii can be sources of nosocomial infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a potentially serious pathogen and is implicated in the aetiology of otitis externa. These findings question the efficacy of the current cleaning techniques.","['Powell S', 'Perry J', 'Meikle D']",2003,117,2,J Laryngol Otol,"Powell S, et al.

From 1993 to 2000, 128 patients supposed to suffer from otomycosis were included. Mycological examination conducted by direct microscopy and fungal cultures was performed on 139 specimens. Among these, 115 patients suffered from chronic otitis media with persisting tympanum perforation and otorrhea. A further 13 patients had clinical signs of an otitis externa only. Out of 139 samples, fungi were identified in the auditory canal (n = 54), on the tympanic membrane (n = 5), and in the middle ear (n = 5). Two-thirds were as moulds and one-third yeasts. The dominating species were Aspergillus niger and Candida parapsilosis. Samples from 15 patients supposed to have mastoiditis or cholesteatoma were examined histologically. Fungal hyphae were observed in the middle ear cavity and/or between horny lamellae of cholesteatoma in four patients. In the middle ear of immunocompetent patients chronic-hyperplastic (polypoid) inflammation was detected with increased production of mucus, which probably promotes colonization by pathogenic fungi in the middle ear as well as in the auditory canal. Invasive fungal growth into the subepithelial connective tissue was not observed.","['Vennewald I', 'Schönlebe J', 'Klemm E']",2003,46,1-2,Mycoses,"Vennewald I, et al.

An attempt was made to match 11 clinical parameters with both the mycological and bacteriological findings. There was no significant association between the fungal species cultured and the clinical parameters did not vary with the presence or absence of different bacteria; pus was never present in fungal otitis externa (Fisher's test, P < 0.001). Before therapy, a significant number of ears had completely sterile bacterial cultures (p < 0.01, chi2 test); saprophytic Gram-positive bacteria increased after treatment, whilst Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus species, decreased after treatment. Clinical total cure rates 3 days after the end of therapy ranged from 50% in group A, 25% in group B to 22.5% in group C. Mycological cure rates were 80% (group A), 95% (group B) and 72.5% (group C). Two weeks after the end of therapy the clinical cure rates were 60% (group A), 65% (group B) and 80% (group C) and the mycological cure rates was 65% for group A and 75% for both group B and C. Eleven patients relapsed with otitis externa: four (20%) in groups A and C and three (15%) in group B. In four cases the infection was due to bacteria and the remaining seven were due to fungi.

12564664,Comparative efficacy of two anti-bacterial/anti-inflammatory formulations (Auricularum otic powder and Dex-Otic drops) in the medical treatment of otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa (OE) is a common disorder which can cause severe pain and discomfort with discharge and hearing loss. The majority of topical preparations for OE treatment contain a combination of steroids and antibiotics and are administered as ear drops. Otic powder preparations are less common. We found no studies which compared the efficacy of the two dosage forms.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to compare the healing process of the external ear canal when treated locally either with otic powder (Auricularum), a preparation containing antibiotic, steroidal and antimycotic components, or with otic drops (Dex-Otic), a commercial ear drop preparation containing antibiotic and steroidal components.
METHODS: The study was designed as an open, randomised, comparative clinical trial. Ambulatory patients suffering from OE were examined by an ear specialist and randomly divided into an otic powder (Auricularum) treatment group and an ear drop (Dex-Otic) treatment group. Each treatment group was treated in accordance with the daily doses recommended by the manufacturers. Patients were treated for a period of 14 days and examined on days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14. Clinical signs and symptoms recorded were pain, erythema, swelling and discharge.
RESULTS: A total of 67 patients entered the study. The probability of healing within 7 days was 74% in the otic powder group as opposed to 40% in the ear drops group (log rank test, p = 0.0013). The probability of total pain relief after 3 days of treatment was 60% in the otic powder group compared to 53% in the ear drops group (log rank test, p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that treatment with an otic powder (Auricularum) may promote earlier healing and pain relief than does treatment with otic drops (Dex-Otic).","['Yaniv E', 'Shevro J', 'Nageris B', 'Lapidot M', 'Hadar T', 'Cahani B', 'Zegerman C']",2002,18,8,Curr Med Res Opin,"Yaniv E, et al.

12542200,Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in discharging ears.,"OBJECTIVES: Although community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have recently become an increasing problem in various fields of medicine, they have rarely been studied in the ear. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of community-acquired MRSA infections in discharging ears and to compare the epidemiology of MRSA with that of other pathogens.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between August 2000 and February 2002, 248 isolates recovered from 221 discharging ears of patients with 3 disease entities (chronic otitis media, acute otitis externa and granular myringitis) were prospectively analyzed using bacteriology. The isolates analyzed using bacteriology were divided into three groups: MRSA, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and non-SA.
RESULTS: S. aureus was found in 108 (43.5%) isolates and MRSA in 27. Therefore, the percentage of MRSA among the S. aureus isolates was 25.0% (27/108). The prevalence of community-acquired MRSA infections in discharging ears was 12.2% (27/221) and the MRSA strains were highly susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, fusidic acid and minocycline. The MRSA-infected patients were older than those infected with other groups of pathogens. Also, MRSA infections appeared to be more common in chronic otitis media than in acute otitis externa or granular myringitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired MRSA represents an increasing problem. In this study, MRSA strains were highly susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, fusidic acid and minocycline.","['Hwang JH', 'Tsai HY', 'Liu TC']",2002,122,8,Acta Otolaryngol,"Hwang JH, et al.

12458390,Clinical value of somatostatin receptor imaging in patients with suspected head and neck paragangliomas.,"Paragangliomas or glomus tumours of the head and neck region are rare somatostatin receptor-expressing neuroendocrine tumours. Precise preoperative diagnosis is of special importance in order to adequately weigh the potential benefit of the operation against the inherent risks of the procedure. In this study, the clinical value of somatostatin receptor imaging was assessed in 19 patients who underwent somatostatin receptor scintigraphy because of known or suspected paraganglioma of the head and neck region. The results were compared with the results of computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging, histology and clinical follow-up. [(111)In-DTPA- D-Phe(1)]-octreotide scintigraphy was performed 4-6 and 24 h after i.v. injection of 140-220 MBq (111)In-octreotide. Whole-body and planar images as well as single-photon emission tomography images were acquired and lesions were graded according to qualitative tracer uptake. Somatostatin receptor imaging was positive in nine patients, identifying paragangliomas for the first time in three patients and recurrent disease in six patients. In one patient, a second, previously unknown paraganglioma site was identified. Negative results were obtained in ten patients. These patients included one suffering from chronic hyperplastic otitis externa, one with granuloma tissue and an organised haematoma, one with an acoustic neuroma, one with an asymmetric internal carotid artery, two with ectasia of the bulbus venae jugularis and one with a jugular vein thrombosis. In two patients with a strong family history of paraganglioma, individual involvement could be excluded. In only one patient did somatostatin receptor imaging and magnetic resonance imaging yield false negative results in respect of recurrent paraganglioma tissue. It is concluded that somatostatin receptor scintigraphy provides important information in patients with suspected paragangliomas of the head and neck region and has a strong impact on further therapeutic management.","['Schmidt M', 'Fischer E', 'Dietlein M', 'Michel O', 'Weber K', 'Moka D', 'Stennert E', 'Schicha H']",2002,29,12,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,"Schmidt M, et al.

12431178,Idiopathic inflammatory medial meatal fibrotizing otitis.,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic inflammatory medial meatal fibrotizing otitis (IMFO) is rare. Only a few cases with unknown cause have been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To report 3 cases of IMFO as a specific diagnostic entity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two adults and 1 child with bilateral IMFO were observed for several years at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.
RESULTS: Only the osseous part of the external ear canals was affected by IMFO. The skin and skin organs over the lateral cartilage of the ear canals remained rigorously and constantly uninflamed through the active, relentless progression of the disease over several years, resulting in the formation of a fibrous plug of the medial meatal canal. The middle ears and mastoid air cells were not affected during the active inflammatory phase.
CONCLUSION: IMFO has its own specific pathophysiologic characteristics, and perhaps also etiopathologic characteristics, which are still unknown.","['Hopsu E', 'Pitkäranta A']",2002,128,11,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Hopsu E and Pitkäranta A.

12408220,Strategies for decreasing multidrug antibiotic resistance: role of ototopical agents for treatment of middle ear infections.,"Change in the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to antimicrobial agents is constant. The efficacy of a new drug may change as it is used in clinical settings, and resistant bacterial clones result from the encounter of drug and organism. Soon after the introduction of the sulfonamides in the mid-1930s, the first effective agents of the antimicrobial era, resistance of pneumococci and group A streptococci was evident. In each of the following decades, a different problem in multidrug resistance occurred among common bacterial pathogens: beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci in the 1950s; highly resistant gram-negative enteric bacteria in the 1960s; beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis in the 1970s; and multidrug-resistant pneumococci in the 1980s. Antimicrobial resistance among respiratory pathogens is now a common clinical problem throughout the world, and its management is a part of routine office practice. Currently in the United States, about 25% of pneumococci are resistant to penicillin, and 25% of H influenzae and 90% of M catarrhalis produce beta-lactamase and would be inactivated by organisms producing the enzyme. The emergence of penicillin and multidrug-resistant pneumococci and beta-lactamase-producing strains of H influenzae and M catarrhalis have special importance for the management of infections of the middle ear. The widespread use of oral and parenteral antimicrobial drugs for appropriate and inappropriate uses has driven the emergence and spread of resistant organisms. This article discusses current susceptibility patterns of organisms involved in middle ear infections, risk factors associated with development of resistant strains, strategies for limiting the incidence and spread of resistant organisms and, as part of the strategy, use of ototopical rather than systemic antimicrobial drugs for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and acute otitis media (AOM) in children with tympanostomy tubes. Although many ototopical agents are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the indication of otitis externa, only ofloxacin otic is approved for treatment of CSOM in patients older than 12 years of age and AOM in children with tympanostomy tubes who are 1 year of age or older.",['Klein JO'],2002,8,14 Suppl,Am J Manag Care,Klein JO.

12393252,Quantity of aerobic bacteria in the bony portion of the external auditory canal of children.,"OBJECTIVE: the human external auditory canal (EAC) hosts a commensal bacterial flora of mainly non-pathogens, but bacterial pathogens may also be present. The latter are important in the aetiopathogenesis of external otitis and middle ear cholesteatoma with discharge. The purpose of this study was to quantify the bacteria normally harboured in the healthy EAC and on a well-defined region of the cavum conchae (CC) of children.
METHODS: bacterial samples were collected from the CC and bony portion of the EAC of 32 children (18 boys, 14 girls; median age 5 years). Prior to sampling, the EACs were either left untreated, anaesthetized with Bonain's solution, or washed with 70% alcoholic solution. The samples were incubated at 37 degrees C and evaluated regarding bacterial species and number.
RESULTS: the predominant bacterial non-pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococci and coryneforms (diphtheroids) and pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Total bacterial counts of the CC ranged between 2 x 10(3) and 4.6 x 10(4) CFU/cm(2) (median value 7 x 10(3); n = 14). Total bacterial counts from the bony portion of the EAC ranged between 0 and 5.7 x 10(7) CFU/EAC (median value 8 x 10(3); n = 32). Pre-treatment of the EACs with Bonain's solution containing the highly bactericidal substance phenol or with 70% alcoholic solution did not sterilize the EAC.
CONCLUSIONS: small numbers of bacterial non-pathogens (and sometimes pathogens) are found in the EAC of children. Neither phenol nor 70% alcoholic solution can inhibit or eradicate all these microorganisms.","['Stenfors LE', 'Räisänen S']",2002,66,2,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,Stenfors LE and Räisänen S.

12385350,Randomized trial on the treatment of oedematous acute otitis externa using ear wicks or ribbon gauze: clinical outcome and cost.,"Acute otitis externa is a common condition that can be extremely painful. When there is considerable canal oedema, packing is necessary to facilitate the passage of medication. The experience at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital is that ear wicks generally require removal in two to three days by medical staff and can be labour intensive as they often involve serial removals following re-insertions. Alternatively, medicated ribbon gauze is cheap and can be removed by the patient at home. Ear wick and mediated ribbon gauze were investigated by a prospective randomized trial involving 94 patients. Fewer out-patient visits were required for the ribbon gauze group (two vs. three, p<0.0001) with considerably less material and labour costs than the wick group. Similar resolution rates were achieved (70 per cent vs. 64 per cent, p = 0.58). Following development of guidelines, the proportion of otitis externa patient reviews in the accident and emergency department declined from 49 per cent to 36 per cent. Compared with the ear wick, medicated ribbon gauze is a cost-effective method of treating oedematous acute otitis externa.","['Pond F', 'McCarty D', ""O'Leary S""]",2002,116,6,J Laryngol Otol,"Pond F, et al.

12369678,Breed variations in histopathologic features of chronic severe otitis externa in dogs: 80 cases (1995-2001).,"OBJECTIVE: To compare pathologic changes of the horizontal ear canal associated with chronic severe otitis externa between Cocker Spaniels and dogs of other breeds.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
ANIMALS: 80 dogs with severe otitis externa that required total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy.
PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed for breed, sex, and age at time of surgery. Histologic specimens from the horizontal ear canal were evaluated by a single examiner for overall tissue response pattern and scored for sebaceous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, ceruminous gland ectasia, fibrosis, pigment-laden macrophages, and osseous metaplasia.
RESULTS: 48 of 80 (60%) dogs were Cocker Spaniels. Thirty-five of 48 (72.9%) Cocker Spaniels had a predominately ceruminous tissue response pattern; only 9 of 32 (28.1 %) dogs of other breeds had the same pattern. Other breeds most commonly had a pattern dominated by fibrosis (n = 13 [40.6%]); fibrosis was the predominant pattern in only 4 of 48 (8.3%) Cocker Spaniels. Discriminant analysis and K-means clustering of 4 histopathologic criteria correctly classified 75% of the dogs as Cocker Spaniels or all other breeds.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cocker Spaniels are at increased risk for chronic severe otitis externa requiring total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy, indicating that earlier and more aggressive management of the primary otitis externa and secondary inflammation is warranted in this breed. Cocker Spaniels with chronic severe otitis externa have distinct differences in pathologic characteristics of the horizontal ear canal, compared with other breeds.","['Angus JC', 'Lichtensteiger C', 'Campbell KL', 'Schaeffer DJ']",2002,221,7,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Angus JC, et al.

12352675,Evolving resistant pseudomonas to ciprofloxacin in malignant otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there has been an increase in ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas malignant otitis externa, and if this has increased the morbidity of the disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Twenty-eight patients over 13 years.
RESULTS: The records of a total of 28 patients who were admitted between 1988 and 2001 with the diagnosis of malignant otitis externa were reviewed. Seven patients had ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas on their hospital culture and sensitivity test. Five of the 7 resistant cases appeared in the last 3 years, as opposed to 2 of the 7 who appeared in the 10 years before that period. In our series, there is a significant trend developing over time of pseudomonas resistant to treatment with ciprofloxacin. No increased morbidity or mortality was found in the ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas group compared with the remaining patients who were sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, resistance to ciprofloxacin in patients with malignant otitis externa is increasing over time. This may have an impact on the relatively successful outpatient treatment of these patients in the past decade. A return to inpatient or outpatient intravenous treatment with third-generation cephalosporins/antipseudomonal penicillins and more frequent debridement will be required in these patients.","['Berenholz L', 'Katzenell U', 'Harell M']",2002,112,9,Laryngoscope,"Berenholz L, et al.

12232666,Transcription levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a gene and severity of symptoms in patients with otitis externa.,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection and transcription of the gene encoding a potent virulence factor, the exotoxin A, were done on 32 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa belonging to 23 genotypes. These isolates were obtained from 22 patients who were admitted to the emergency room in a medical center during a 5-month period with the diagnosis of either unilateral or bilateral otitis externa. Patients showed symptoms that ranged from mild to severe. PCR amplification of a 396-bp fragment of the gene encoding the exotoxin A was done on extracted DNA. Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on extracted RNA to detect exotoxin A gene mRNA transcripts. Quantitation of RT-PCR amplicons from P. aeruginosa isolates associated with mild and severe symptoms was determined by end-point titration of c-DNA and scanning of amplicons with the Storm Gel and Blot Imaging System. Data have shown that all of the 32 isolates of P. aeruginosa carry the exotoxin A gene, and all isolates with the exception of two had the exotoxin A transcription demonstrated by the production of a 396-bp amplicon from RT-PCR-amplified RNA. The remaining two isolates amplified fragments that were slightly smaller than the expected size. Additional studies are needed to characterize these two mRNA transcripts. Transcription levels of exotoxin A gene associated with severe symptoms were significantly more elevated than those associated with mild to moderate symptoms. Studies are under way to determine expression of P. aeruginosa exotoxin A by detecting quantitatively levels of the translated exotoxin A protein produced by isolates associated with severe and mild to moderate symptoms.","['Matar GM', 'Ramlawi F', 'Hijazi N', 'Khneisser I', 'Abdelnoor AM']",2002,45,5,Curr Microbiol,"Matar GM, et al.

Clinical parameters (pruritus, otitis, and diarrhea) improved in the Maltese x beagle dogs during feeding of a novel diet, and signs were exacerbated by oral allergen provocation. Relative concentrations of serum and fecal wheat-, corn-, and milk-specific IgE were determined by use of an ELISA. The onset of clinical signs of disease was accompanied by an increase in serum allergen-specific IgE concentrations. In contrast, changes in clinical signs of disease or allergen-specific IgE values were not seen in the control group undergoing the same regimen. Total serum IgE concentration was measured by use of the ELISA, and comparison with known quantities of a monoclonal IgE allowed absolute values to be reported. Values were high in the Maltese x beagle colony (7 to 34 microg/ml), compared with those in the control dogs (0.7 to 6 microg/ml). Total serum and total fecal IgE concentrations did not change in either group during the study. Although allergen-specific IgE was detected in the feces of both groups, significant interassay variability made interpretation of the results difficult. The authors concluded that these Maltese x beagle dogs satisfied the currently recognized clinical criteria for the diagnosis of canine food hypersensitivity. Furthermore, the clinical and serologic responses seen in these dogs in response to oral allergen provocation suggest that this may be a useful model for the study of spontaneous food hypersensitivity.","['Jackson HA', 'Hammerberg B']",2002,52,4,Comp Med,Jackson HA and Hammerberg B.

A comparative study of the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment by general practitioners vs ENT specialists.,"The prevalence of ear disease and hearing disability in elderly Thais in 14 urban communities around Siriraj Hospital was studied. The accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of common ear diseases and of screening for hearing loss in the elderly between general practitioners (GP) and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialists was also compared. Elderly people aged 60 years or more who had registered with the health care program had their ear and hearing check-up performed by GPs and ENT specialists from mobile team. Altogether, 980 subjects were included, 332 were males, 648 were females, (male:female ratio 1:2). Their ages ranged from 60-96 years with an average age of 68.5 years. The prevalence of ear disease diagnosed by ENT specialists was 16.3 per cent (95% CI = 14.0-18.6), 12.5 per cent was external ear disease and 2.7 per cent middle ear disease. The most common ear problem was impacted ear wax (8%), the second most common problem was otitis externa (4.3%). Compared with an ENT specialist, the ability of a GP to diagnose ear diseases had a sensitivity of 46.5 per cent and a specificity of 80.3 per cent, the positive predictive value of their diagnoses was 31.5 per cent. The efficacy of the treatment of ear diseases in 51 elderly people by GPs and in 63 elderly people by ENT specialists was statistically significantly different (p = 0.02). Hearing screening by the GP using whisper or the watch test performed in 650 elderly people revealed abnormal findings (could not hear) in 70 cases or 10.8 per cent. Hearing screening using pure tone audiometry in 980 elderly people showed abnormal hearing level in 508 cases (52.4%). 9.5 per cent of them had a bilateral moderate to severe degree of hearing impairment. There was no difference in the level of hearing impairment between males and females or between right and left ears. The prevalence of hearing loss increases with increasing age. Tympanometry performed by an acoustic impedance machine in 980 of the elderly showed a conductive hearing loss in 85 cases (9.1%). The authors conclude that the prevalence of ear disease in elderly people living in the urban community around Siriraj Hospital is quite high. Although the ear diseases commonly encountered were not serious, if left untreated they may lead to complication and decreased hearing. Therefore, the proficiency of GPs in the management of common ear diseases in every community should be regularly maintained. Hearing impairment is very prevalent and increases with age. Thus, screening for hearing loss using an audiometer and/or acoustic impedance is recommended for all senior citizens in their community at least once a year. Early detection of elderly persons who could benefit from a properly fitted hearing aid will certainly improve the quality of life and may prevent psychiatric and functional impairment of the Thai elderly population.","['Bunnag C', 'Prasansuk S', 'Nakorn AN', 'Jareoncharsri P', 'Atipas S', 'Angsuwarangsee T', 'Tansuriyawong P', 'Thongyai ML', 'Polpathapee S', 'Siriyananda C', 'Chongkolwatana C', 'Ungkanon K', 'Chongvisal S', 'Keskool P', 'Tantinikorn W']",2002,85,5,J Med Assoc Thai,"Bunnag C, et al.

12169893,Microbiology of acute otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (AOE) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective core series.
METHODS: Specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. Species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. End point mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommended methods.
RESULTS: In Alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the United States. A total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. Of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). The next 10 species most frequently isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; Staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; Microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; Microbacterium alconae, 2.9%; Staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; Staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; Enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; Enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; Staphylococcus capitis subsp. Ureolyticus,1.4%; and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. Susceptibility profiles of S. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/mL): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. Susceptibility profiles of S. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%, neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. P. aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/mL for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. Likewise, resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. Twenty isolates had neomycin MICs >/=64 mcg/mL and 10 isolates had gentamicin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL. The coryneform isolates identified as Microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin MICs >/=32 mcg/mL and gentamicin MICs >/=8 mcg/mL).
CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by P. aeruginosa. However, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. Because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-P. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.","['Roland PS', 'Stroman DW']",2002,112,7 Pt 1,Laryngoscope,Roland PS and Stroman DW.

12169122,Allergic otitis externa.,"Chronic otitis externa is a common condition, which is usually successfully treated by topical medications and aural toilet. In cases that persist despite conventional treatment, a diagnosis of allergic otitis externa should be considered. Sensitization to otic medications (secondary contact otitis) is not uncommon. Topical aminoglycosides are the most common sensitizers although many components of topical preparations can cause sensitization. Patients who may have developed allergic otitis externa should undergo patch testing. Otolaryngologists should consider using topical antibiotics with a low allergenic potential and avoiding neomycin when treating patients with otitis externa. Primary contact otitis may occur to metals used in earrings and also to hearing aid moulds. Treatment of both primary and secondary contact otitis consists of identifying the allergen, avoiding further contact and use of simple preparations avoiding common sensitizers.","['Sood S', 'Strachan DR', 'Tsikoudas A', 'Stables GI']",2002,27,4,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci,"Sood S, et al.

12165481,Molecular epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a serious opportunistic pathogen in certain compromised hosts, such as those with cystic fibrosis, thermal burns and cancer. It also causes less severe noninvasive disease, such as otitis externa and hot tub folliculitis, in normal hosts. P. aeruginosa is phenotypically very unstable, particularly in patients with chronic infection. Phenotypic typing techniques are useful for understanding the epidemiology of acute infections, but they are limited by their discriminatory power and by their inability to group isolates that are phenotypically unrelated but genetically homologous. Molecular typing techniques, developed over the past decade, are highly discriminatory and are useful for typing strains from patients with chronic infection where the bacterial phenotype is unstable; this is particularly true in cystic fibrosis, where patients often are infected with the same strain for several decades, but the bacteria undergo phenotypic alteration. Molecular typing techniques, which have proven useful in typing P. aeruginosa for epidemiological purposes, include pulsed field gel electrophoresis, restriction fragment length polymorphic DNA analysis, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, repetitive extrapalindromic PCR analysis, and multilocus sequence typing. These methods are generally only available in specialized laboratories, but they should be used when data from phenotypic typing analysis are ambiguous or when phenotypic methods are unreliable, such as in cystic fibrosis.",['Speert DP'],2002,7,,Front Biosci,Speert DP.

12164534,Measurement of body temperature by use of auricular thermometers versus rectal thermometers in dogs with otitis externa.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare measurements of body temperature obtained with auricular thermometers versus rectal thermometers in dogs with otitis externa.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
ANIMALS: 100 client-owned dogs: 50 with and 50 without clinical evidence of otitis externa.
PROCEDURE: Dogs were evaluated for the presence of otitis externa on the basis of clinical signs, otoscopic examination, and cytologic evaluation of ear exudate. Auricular and rectal temperatures were obtained simultaneously in all dogs prior to and following ear examination.
RESULTS: There was a high correlation between auricular and rectal temperatures in dogs with otitis externa both prior to and after ear manipulation. Significant differences were not detected in temperature measurements among dogs with different degrees of otitis externa.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Auricular temperature readings obtained by use of an auricular thermometer in dogs with otitis externa are accurate measurements of body temperature, compared with rectal temperature measurements. Temperature measurements are reliable before and after examination of the ear canal.","['González AM', 'Mann FA', 'Preziosi DE', 'Meadows RL', 'Wagner-Mann CC']",2002,221,3,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"González AM, et al.

12160263,Bilateral squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canals.,"OBJECTIVES: To report a case of bilateral squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canals and to present a management algorithm for this difficult clinical scenario.
STUDY DESIGN: Case report and literature review.
METHODS: The study comprises a case report of a 69-year-old man who initially presented with complaints of bilateral otorrhea, left-sided otalgia, and a left-sided hearing loss. Following attempted treatment of a presumed case of otitis externa, biopsy of both external auditory canals revealed squamous cell carcinoma. A computed tomography scan demonstrated marked abnormal soft tissue in the left external auditory canal with no bony erosion and thickening of the soft tissue in the right external auditory canal.
RESULTS: The left-sided lesion required a lateral temporal bone resection, a partial superficial and deep-lobe parotidectomy, and postoperative irradiation. The right-sided lesion was more limited and was managed with a lateral temporal bone resection and tympanoplasty for hearing preservation.
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canals is an extremely uncommon but aggressive malignancy that may present with symptoms similar to a case of otitis externa, and this can result in delays in proper diagnosis. Early recognition is essential because management and prognosis are determined by the extent of the lesion.","['Wolfe SG', 'Lai SY', 'Bigelow DC']",2002,112,6,Laryngoscope,"Wolfe SG, et al.

12122378,Diagnosis and treatment of the child with a draining ear.,"Treating a child with a draining ear is a common occurrence in the pediatric primary office. The symptoms of otorrhea are broad, and a multitude of factors must be considered in arriving at a diagnosis. The assessment begins with a thorough history of the frequency, duration, and characteristics of the drainage. Physical examination of the affected ear requires cleansing of the external auditory canal before the tympanic membrane can be accurately assessed. The ear must be adequately visualized for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Differential diagnoses include acute suppurative otitis media, otitis externa, granuloma, and bullous myringitis. The acutely draining ear is frequently an uncomplicated suppurative event that will respond well to a regimen of aural hygiene and topical therapy. Patients with a chronically draining ear should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further diagnostics and aggressive therapy. Children with tympanostomy tubes are especially at high risk for suppurative complications. Avoiding the introduction of water into the ear, protecting the ear from water, and prophylactic topical treatment are options that have been suggested for prevention of otorrhea.",['Ramsey AM'],2002,16,4,J Pediatr Health Care,Ramsey AM.

It has been standing in the focus of interest since the early 1990s, mostly because of the frequency of otitis externa and dermatitis caused by this yeast in dogs. This is the only lipid-independent species in the genus Malassezia. It can be found in very large proportion on the skin of healthy animals, but can be isolated in much greater number from diseased dogs. It often causes illness together with other pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus intermedius). Some breeds are predisposed. In addition to the treatment of the accidental concurrent diseases, therapy consists of systemic and/or topical antimicrobial treatment. Ketoconazole is used most frequently. Malassezia pachydermatis plays also a role in the skin disorders of other carnivores. It has little zoonotic potential, it can be dangerous to immunocompromised humans. The other Malassezia species have little veterinary importance, although M. sympodialis and M. globosa were isolated from asymptomatic animals (mostly cats) and from mixed infections.",['Dorogi J'],2002,49,2-3,Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung,Dorogi J.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
ANIMALS: 20 dogs.
PROCEDURE: Dogs were treated with itraconazole orally (n = 10/group), using a pulse administration regimen (5 mg/kg [2.3 mg/lb], PO, q 24 h for 2 consecutive days per week for 3 weeks) or once daily administration (5 mg/kg, PO, q 24 h for 21 days). No other treatment was permitted. On days 0 and 21, clinical severity of cutaneous and otic disease was assessed, and samples were collected for cytologic examination and yeast culture. Cytology (sum of the mean number of yeast organisms per oil immersion field for affected sites) and culture (mean of the score for extent of yeast growth for samples from affected sites) scores were calculated.
RESULTS: For dogs in both treatment groups, clinical severity of cutaneous and otic disease was significantly decreased by day 21, but decrease in severity was not significantly different between groups. Similarly, skin cytology, skin culture, and ear culture scores were significantly decreased on day 21, compared with day 0, for both groups, but decreases were not significantly different between groups except that dogs in the pulse administration group had a significantly greater decrease in ear culture scores than did dogs in the daily administration group. However, when cytology scores only for ear samples were analyzed, day 21 score was not significantly decreased, compared with day 0 score, for either group.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that both pulse administration and once daily administration of itraconazole were efficacious in the treatment of M pachydermatis cutaneous infection in dogs. However, adjunctive treatment may be needed in dogs with M pachydermatis otitis.","['Pinchbeck LR', 'Hillier A', 'Kowalski JJ', 'Kwochka KW']",2002,220,12,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Pinchbeck LR, et al.

Dominating species were Aspergillus niger and Candida parapsilosis. Samples of 15 patients suspected of having mastoiditis or cholesteatoma were examined histologically. Fungal hyphae were observed in the middle ear cavity and/or between horny lamellae of cholesteatoma in 4 patients. In the middle ear of immunocompetent patients chronic-hyperplastic (polypous) inflammation was detected with increased production of mucus, which probably promotes the colonization with pathogenic fungi as in the middle ear just like in the auditory canal.","['Vennewald I', 'Schönlebe J', 'Klemm E']",2002,45 Suppl 1,,Mycoses,"Vennewald I, et al.

12019482,The use of otic powder in the treatment of acute external otitis.,"BACKGROUND: Acute external otitis (AEO) is a painful condition that results as a secondary infection of macerated skin and subcutaneous tissues of the external auditory canal. The most commonly causative microorganisms are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Classic management strategies include moisture prevention, cleansing of the canal and administration of topical antimicrobial agents in drop form, such as aminoglycosides and quinolones, at times in combination with steroid solutions. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of topical otic powder, tobramycin drops and ciprofloxacin drops in patients suffering from AEO. MATERIALS AND MEASURES: A randomized prospective trial was performed to determine the efficacy of Auricularum powder (dexamethasone 10 mg, oxytetracycline HCl 90,000 U, polymyxin B Sulfate 100,000 U, nystatin 1,000,000 U; Trima, Serolam Laboratories, Germany) compared with ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan, Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) and tobramycin (Tobrex, Alcon Laboratories) drops for the treatment of AEO. One hundred twenty patients who presented with signs and symptoms of AEO were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: AEO diagnosed by an otolaryngologist, patient age 18 years, no prior treatment with other drops or systemic antibiotics, no sensitivity to any of the drugs used or their contents, and no perforation of the tympanic membrane. All patients were instructed to avoid moisture and wetness of the ear during the course of their treatment. After we received informed consent, a swab culture was taken, and the patient was randomly assigned topical treatment for 14 days.
RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of those treated with Auricularum powder were cured at day 3-4 after initial treatment. Seventy-seven percent of those treated with ciprofloxacin drops, and fifty-six percent of those treated with tobramycin were cured at that time. All 120 patients were cured by day 14.
CONCLUSION: The results show that topical treatment with Auricularum powder is an effective and rapid method for the treatment of AEO. Ciloxan also was effective in the treatment of AEO and relieved symptoms quickly and efficiently in a short period of time. Tobrex was effective in treating AEO, but our results show that relief of symptoms was slower than with the other drugs.","['Goldenberg D', 'Golz A', 'Netzer A', 'Joachims HZ']",2002,23,3,Am J Otolaryngol,"Goldenberg D, et al.

Many local factors may interfere with the normal defences against infections in the external auditory canal. Removing or dissolving the cerumen by water or other instruments eliminates an important barrier to infections: its acids inhibit the growth of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (Aspergillus). Also skin abrasions or irritation, allergic diseases and many systemic condition like anaemia, vitamin deficiency, endocrine disorders (diabetes) and various forms of dermatitis cause a lower resistance to infections in external auditory canal. Even if the prognosis remains benign in the majority of cases, important complications could appear like: malignant otitis externa, facial nerve paralysis, tympanic bone osteomyelitis, pericondrytis. Successful treatment depends on a proper diagnosis and therapy: the most important factor in the treatment is repeated debridement of the external auditory canal by the physician. The use of Castellani' Tintura rubra, hydroalcoholic solution of phenic fuchsin, can be very effective for bacteria and mycotic eradication. Culturing of ear canal infection could be performed on the second or third visit if the otitis externa is not responding to therapy. Complication are not frequent, but malignant otitis externa can be mortal. Dermatological consultation is often necessary for correct diagnosis.","['Olina M', 'Cametti M', 'Guglielmetti C', 'Gattoni M', 'Leigheb G', 'Pia F']",2002,93,2,Recenti Prog Med,"Olina M, et al.

11845401,"[Current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ENT-infections].","In bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis Streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. S. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. To decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ENT-infections is necessary. The new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. Efficacy of short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. In more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. Both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. In more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime are widely used and effective. Ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while Ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). A dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ENT-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.",['Elies W'],2002,81,1,Laryngorhinootologie,"Elies W.

11845396,[Acquired fibrotic atresia of the external auditory canal].,"BACKGROUND: There are very few communications on this pathologic entity, which is also called ""postinflammatory medial meatal fibrosis"" (PIMMF), its etiology and the adequate therapy. Apparently the cause is a chronic inflammation (or chronic ekzema) of the medial part of the external meatus or also a long-lasting otorrhea in chronic otitis media. The stratified epithelium of the eardrum and of the adjacent bony meatus is destroyed and replaced by fibrotic tissue. The lateral part of the auditory canal remains open and has the form of the finger of a glove, it may contain granulations, but often it is lined with a smooth stratified epithelium. A severe conductive hearing loss is the result of this anomaly.
PATIENTS: During the last 10 years we operated on 46 patients (52 ears) for this pathology: after retroauricular opening, which allows the best control of the anterior tympanomeatal angle, the fibrotic tissue was removed keeping the lamina propria intact. The bony canal was widened, if necessary. The eardrum and the bony canal were covered with split skin graft from the retroauricular region, then the canal filled with an antibiotic package for 3 weeks.
RESULTS: Underneath the fibrotic tissue we detected 3 cholesteatomata of the annular region, so it is important to remember, that the atresia may also cover a dangerous pathology. 6 times a second operation was necessary, besides that, we observed 14 recurrencies. All other patients had a wide epithelialized ear canal, their conductive hearing loss disappeared, and the results were stable over several years. Bacteriological and histological examinations were not helpful to clear up the etiology of this disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is the treatment of choice of the acquired atresia of the external meatus. We suppose that in these patients a individual disposition causes the formation of this excessive fibrosis, which has some similarity with keloid formation.",['Strohm M'],2002,81,1,Laryngorhinootologie,Strohm M.

11802005,Determination of ototoxicity of common otic drops using isolated cochlear outer hair cells.,"OBJECTIVES: Otic drops are commonly used not only for otitis externa, but also for otorrhea in the presence of tympanostomy tubes or tympanic membrane perforations. Many studies have demonstrated the ototoxicity of common otic preparations such as Cortisporin otic drops (Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Bristol, TN). The purpose of this study was to assess the relative ototoxicity of common otic preparations by direct exposure to isolated cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs).
METHODS: OHCs from adult chinchilla cochlea were exposed to standard bathing solution (control), acetic acid, Acetasol HC (Alpharma USPD Inc., Baltimore, MD), Gentacidin (CIBA Vision Ophthalmics, Atlanta, GA), and Tobradex (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX). The cells were observed using an inverted microscope, and the images were recorded in digital still-frame and video, and analyzed on the Image Pro-Plus 3.0 program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: As measured by time to cell death and change in morphology of OHCs, acetic acid with or without hydrocortisone was most toxic to OHCs. Cortisporin was more cytotoxic than gentamicin and Tobradex.","['Jinn TH', 'Kim PD', 'Russell PT', 'Church CA', 'John EO', 'Jung TT']",2001,111,12,Laryngoscope,"Jinn TH, et al.

11793879,A review of techniques for the investigation of otitis externa and otitis media.,"Otitis externa, inflammation of the externa ear canal, is relatively easy to diagnose based on the history and physical examination findings. The diagnosis of otitis media, inflammation of the middle ear cavity, is more challenging, with the work-up being both costly and, at times, invasive. The pathogenesis of otitis externa has been classified into predisposing, primary, and perpetuating factors. It is critical to the management of ear disease that the clinician recognize and investigate which factors are contributing to each individual patient's ear disease. Failure to identify and address the primary and/or predisposing factors is the most common cause of chronic recurrent otitis externa. Chronic inflammation of the ear canal leads to the development of the perpetuating factors, which may be the major reason for treatment failure, regardless of the primary cause of the ear disease. In this article, the predisposing, primary, and perpetuating factors involved in ear disease will be presented, along with a review of the techniques used in the diagnosis of otitis externa and otitis media.",['Murphy KM'],2001,16,4,Clin Tech Small Anim Pract,Murphy KM.

11779301,Outcome of 22 cases of perforated tympanic membrane caused by otomycosis.,"Twenty-two cases of perforated tympanic membrane due to fungal otitis externa were observed over a five-year period. The diagnosis of fungal otitis externa was made on clinical grounds due to the obvious presence of fungal bloom in the external ear canal. Some perforations were noted at the first treatment after the fungal debris had been removed from the external ear canal using a microscope. Other perforations were observed to develop over a few days. Initially, a discrete area of the tympanic membrane appeared white and opaque. As time progressed the white area disintegrated, forming a perforation. Once the otitis externa had resolved most perforations healed spontaneously. Two that were observed to develop during treatment required a myringoplasty. Another one closed significantly but a tiny persistent perforation required cauterization with trichloracetic acid to encourage it to close over completely. The only residual hearing loss was in a case with almost total disintegration of the tympanic membrane requiring a myringoplasty. Treatment of fungal otitis externa for the patients in this series was aural toilet using suction under a microscope and insertion of a gauze wick saturated in a combination of hydrocortisone, clotrimazole, framycetin and gramicidin.",['Hurst WB'],2001,115,11,J Laryngol Otol,Hurst WB.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Thirty-six children and 33 adults presenting to a community family practice clinic who had cerumen occluding at least one external auditory canal were randomly assigned to compare use of 10% aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 2.5% aqueous acetic acid as ceruminolytics in occlusive cerumen.
RESULTS: We were unable to demonstrate a difference between in vivo efficacy of these two ceruminolytic solutions, but both solutions were significantly more efficacious in children than adults.

11735810,Vibrant semi-implantable hearing device with digital sound processing: effective gain and speech perception.,"BACKGROUND: The Vibrant Soundbridge (Symphonix Devices, San Jose, Calif) is a semi-implantable hearing device. The transducer is attached directly to the incus and is linked by telemetry to the externally worn audioprocessor. A major advantage of this semi-implantable setup, especially during its experimental phase, is that the audioprocessor can be updated. Recently, we replaced the previous 2-channel analog audioprocessor in 14 patients with a 3-channel digital device.
DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. Basic functions were measured, including gain as a function of input level and speech perception in quiet.
PATIENTS: Patients (n = 14) had moderate to severe sensorineural hearing impairment (average hearing threshold at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz of 40- to 76-dB hearing level [HL]) and chronic external otitis, which contraindicated use of an ear mold.
RESULTS: Gain of the 3-channel audioprocessor for comfortable listening levels and for conversational levels varied from approximately 15- to 30-dB HL, suggesting that the device is suitable for patients with hearing loss of up to 60- to 70-dB HL. In 5 patients, identical measurements were performed using their conventional hearing aids. The other 9 patients did not use a conventional hearing device because of severe external otitis. On average, results obtained with the Vibrant Soundbridge were not as good as those obtained with the conventional device. Nevertheless, patients were satisfied with the Vibrant Soundbridge because they could use it all day without pain or itching.
CONCLUSIONS: The Vibrant Soundbridge is suitable for patients with hearing loss of up to 70-dB HL. Compared with conventional devices, in audiometric terms, a surplus value of the Vibrant Soundbridge was not found.","['Snik AF', 'Cremers CW']",2001,127,12,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Snik AF and Cremers CW.

This research had the purpose of investigating the prevalence of parasitic otitis in the dry and rainy seasons of Minas Gerais and correlating it with variables age, breed and the presence of horns. The secretion or cerumen of 981 cattle was collected with sterile swabs, placed in test tubes and exposed to sunlight for the identification of clinical infections caused by rhabditiform nematodes. The ear canals of 109 animals were flushed to study the occurrence of mites of the genus Raillietia. Clinical otitis caused by rhabditiform nematodes was observed only in animals of the Gyr breed, affecting 169 (60.1%) of the total (278) of these cattle. The prevalence of otitis in this breed was significantly higher for mature adult cows (P<0.001) and in cows with horns (P<0.001). In a total of nine animals suspected of raillietiosis, the examinations revealed the presence of Raillietia spp. in two Dutch cows.

11583468,A topical steroid without an antibiotic cures external otitis efficiently: a study in an animal model.,"In an animal external otitis model, inflammatory reactions were evoked by mechanical stimulation of the rat ear canal skin. The rats were in four groups: group A treated with a group III steroid, betamethasone dipropionate; group B treated with hydrocortisone combined with oxytetracycline; group C treated with hydrocortisone with oxytetracycline and polymyxin B added; Group D, the controls, treated with saline. All rats were observed otomicroscopically daily during the first 7 days after treatment and then on days 10 and 20. A standardized scoring system was used to evaluate colour, swelling and effusion of the ear canal. Histological specimens were collected on days 3, 7, 10 and 20. The most rapid improvement in the ear canal status occurred in the animals treated with betamethasone dipropionate. The inflammatory reaction of the ear canal skin caused by mechanical stimulation was characterized by oedema of the stroma but few inflammatory cells were present. The surface of the epithelium towards the connective tissue layer was smooth in the group III-treated animals (group A) whereas other groups had irregularities of the basal membrane. From this study it is inferred that the group III steroid betamethasone dipropionate alone heals experimentally induced external otitis more rapidly than hydrocortisone with oxytetracycline, with or without polymyxin B. These findings should be considered in future clinical trials of external otitis.","['Emgård P', 'Hellström S']",2001,258,6,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,Emgård P and Hellström S.

This study uses the validated Glasgow Benefit Inventory to quantify the changes in quality of life.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective questionnaire study.
METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients receiving treatment with BAHA were enrolled in the study. The male/female ratio was 1.26 to 1; mean patient age was 45 years. The most common indication was hearing loss secondary to mastoid disease and surgery followed by congenital atresia and chronic discharge from the ear.
RESULTS: The response rate was 85%, which is high and adds weight to the results. The general benefit score was +34 (range, +27-+48), which is comparable to middle ear surgery but just below benefit from cochlear implantation. The social benefit was +21 (range, +12-+37) with only +10 (range, +2-+26) for the physical score. This pattern mirrors that reported for other ear interventions. Maximum benefit was noted in patients with congenital atresias followed by discharging mastoid cavities.

11504239,Otodectic otoacariasis in free-ranging Eurasian lynx in Sweden.,"An infestation with Otodectes cynotis, the ear mite of cats and dogs, was observed in three free-ranging Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) killed in Sweden. The ear canals were obstructed by waxy secretions and exfoliated epithelium. Histologically, there were hyperkeratosis and acanthosis, and the epithelial surface was overlained by hyperkeratotic and parakeratotic crusts with mites, mite detritus and cerumen. In the subcutis there was a slight to moderate infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. The ceruminous glands were bypertrophic and hyperplastic, and there was also an hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands. The lesions seemed to correlate with the degree of infestation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of otoacariasis in free-ranging lynx.","['Degiorgis MP', 'Segerstad CH', 'Christensson B', 'Mörner T']",2001,37,3,J Wildl Dis,"Degiorgis MP, et al.

11488077,Chronic external otitis.,"Chronic external otitis is probably a disease of mixed etiology; infection and hypersensitivity both play an important role. As such, these two components must be recognized and respected. Steroids are the mainstay of medical management. Antibiotics should be used cautiously and probably on an intermittent basis. The disease appears to be exacerbated by any manipulation of the canal, including aggressive cleansing. Medical therapy will slow the development of fibrosis in some cases, but it does not always prevent it. Once stenosis has progressed to the point that conductive hearing loss develops, surgery will restore hearing and prevent restenosis in at least 80% of cases.",['Roland PS'],2001,80,6 Suppl,Ear Nose Throat J,Roland PS.

11487956,Uses and indications for video-otoscopy in small animal practice.,"Acute and chronic otitis externa and otitis media are common disorders in dogs and cats. In combination with other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, the video-otoscope is a useful and effective tool in the management of clinical cases. The enhanced illumination and magnification provide the practitioner with more detailed information for diagnosis and prognosis, and the configuration of the working channel facilitates sampling, improves efficacy of cleaning procedures, and decreases risks of iatrogenic injury to structures of the middle and inner ear. Photographic documentation of clinical cases enhances the medical record, communication with colleagues, and client education. Although video-otoscopy facilitates diagnosis and therapy, it does not replace other important diagnostic tests such as evaluation for atopy, adverse food reactions, and immune-compromising disease. Failure to identify the underlying primary cause usually results in treatment failure regardless of the technology employed.","['Angus JC', 'Campbell KL']",2001,31,4,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,Angus JC and Campbell KL.

Three hundred and seventy-one (38%) of 979 questionnaires mailed to chairs of primary care groups in England, and general practitioners in research networks, were returned. Service areas: computer transfer of laboratory results was considered of greatest priority. Guidance on antibiotic usage, guidance on infectious diseases and education for general practitioners were ranked two, three and four. Burden of infectious disease in primary care: upper respiratory tract infections, tonsillitis/pharyngitis, otitis media/externa and acute cough were placed one, three, four and seven respectively. Urinary tract infections were ranked second and dyspepsia/Helicobacter pylori fifth. Leg ulcers, diarrhoea, genital chlamydia infection and vaginal discharge were other diseases considered to cause a large burden of ill-health. Genital chlamydia, tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori and meningococci were ranked one, two, three, and five in the NHS opportunity to affect the burden of ill-health. Priorities for improvements to diagnostic tests, evidence on which to base treatment and guidance: chronic fatigue/ME was ranked top in these areas. The other top ten syndromes ranked in order were genital chlamydia infections, antibiotic resistance surveillance, vaginal discharge, leg ulcers, sinusitis, otitis media/externa, dyspepsia/Helicobacter pylori, Creutzfeld Jacob Disease, and tonsillitis. This consultation exercise has highlighted broad areas for future PHLS involvement in primary care. In order to make progress, further consultation is needed with groups of GPs, and other relevant bodies. Particularly for the areas ranked in the top ten, the type of further PHLS involvement needs to be defined. For some syndromes (chronic fatigue and leg ulcers) this may be writing guidance and for others (respiratory tract infections) more treatment trials are required. The purposes and possible methods of communicable disease surveillance in general practice should be the subject of additional consultation.","['McNulty CA', 'Smith GE', 'Graham C', 'PHLS Primary Care Co-ordinators']",2001,4,1,Commun Dis Public Health,"McNulty CA, et al.

11465298,Audiometric evaluation of bilaterally fitted bone-anchored hearing aids.,"Bilateral fittings of bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA) were evaluated in 25 patients with at least 3 months experience with using two BAHAs. For all patients, air conduction hearing aids were contraindicated due to either recurrent otorrhoea or otitis externa (19 cases) or to congenital aural atresia (six cases). Candidacy for bilateral fitting was primarily based on symmetry of bone conduction thresholds. For all patients, measurements comprised sound localisation, speech recognition in quiet and in noise. In addition, in a subgroup of nine patients, release from masking for pure-tone stimuli in noise with interaural phase differences (binaural masking level difference. BMLD) was measured. The percentage of correct localisation judgments with 500-Hz and 2-kHz noise bursts increased significantly (p<0.01) from 22.2 per cent and 24.3 per cent for unilateral fittings to 41.8 per cent and 45.3 per cent for bilateral fittings, respectively. With unilateral fittings sound localisation judgments appeared to be strongly biased to the ipsilateral BAHA side. whereas with bilateral fittings, judgments were far more symmetrical. The speech reception threshold for sentences in quiet was significantly (p<0.01) better for the bilateral fittings compared to the unilateral fittings: 37.5 dBA versus 41.7 dBA. Speech recognition in noise was measured with the speech signal presented in front of the listener and a 65-dBA masking noise at either +90 degrees or -90 degrees azimuth. For noise presented at the ipsilateral side of the first fitted BAHA, the signal-to-noise ratio was significantly reduced (p<0.01) from -0.7 dB for the unilateral fitting to -4.0 dB for the bilateral fitting. The speech reception threshold in noise was not significantly different (p>0.05) for unilateral and bilateral fittings when the noise was presented at the contralateral side of the first fitted BAHA. The results for the six patients with congenital atresia are comparable with those for the other patients. So, directional hearing and speech recognition in noise improve significantly with a second BAHA. The BMLD measurements showed a significant (p<0.01) release from masking of 6.1, 6.0 and 6.6 dB for 125-Hz, 250-Hz and 500-Hz stimuli, respectively. The BMLD effect of 4.1 dB at 1,000 Hz was not significant at the 5 per cent level. The positive results with the bilateral fittings in quiet can be ascribed to increased stimulus levels due to diotic summation of signals from either side. The results for localisation, speech recognition in noise and BMLD measurements indicate that bilaterally fitted BAHAs do indeed (to some extent) result in binaural hearing.","['Bosman AJ', 'Snik AF', 'van der Pouw CT', 'Mylanus EA', 'Cremers CW']",2001,40,3,Audiology,"Bosman AJ, et al.

11462312,Otitis externa in UK general practice: a survey using the UK General Practice Research Database.,"BACKGROUND: Otitis externa is a common clinical problem in general practice and yet there are remarkably few data available on the demographic characteristics of patients with this condition and the approaches used by general practitioners (GPs) in the United Kingdom (UK) to manage it.
AIM: To define the descriptive epidemiology of otitis externa in the general population, to describe the first-line drug treatment used by UK GPs, and to determine factors related to second disease episodes.
DESIGN OF STUDY: Epidemiological data survey.
SETTING: All cases of otitis externa occurring in 1997 in practices contributing data to the UK General Practice Research Database.
METHOD: Data were extracted on age, sex, date of episode of otitis externa, treatment prescribed, co-existing diagnoses of eczema and diabetes, referral to ear, nose, and throat departments and occurrence of subsequent episodes of disease. Arbitrarily a second episode of disease was defined as persistence if it occurred at 28 days or fewer after the first episode and recurrence if it occurred at more than 28 days after the first episode.
RESULTS: A diagnosis of otitis externa was common in all age groups and, except in the elderly, was more common in females than males. There was an increase in disease episodes at the end of the summer in all age groups except the 60 years and over group. In the majority of cases GPs prescribed ear drops (85%), but a significant proportion of patients were also prescribed oral antibiotics (21%). Referral to secondary care was uncommon (3%). Among patients prescribed ear-drop formulations, those containing both steroid and antibiotic or steroid alone were used most commonly and were associated with the lower rates of disease persistence but not recurrence. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, penicillins were prescribed most commonly. Disease persistence rates, and to a lesser extent disease recurrence rates, were higher in patients prescribed oral antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: Otitis externa is a common condition and GPs can expect to see an excess of cases at the end of the summer. Topical ear drops are the most common treatment used in the UK. Patients prescribed steroid or steroid/antibiotic combination ear drops have fewer subsequent consultations for otitis externa over the following 28 days.","['Rowlands S', 'Devalia H', 'Smith C', 'Hubbard R', 'Dean A']",2001,51,468,Br J Gen Pract,"Rowlands S, et al.

11459014,Attachment of Malassezia pachydermatis to the ear dermal cells in canine otitis externa.,"To investigate the predominance of Malassezia pachydermatis (M. pachydermatis) as a causative agent of canine otitis externa, ear cerumen samples were observed for adhesion of M. pachydermatis to the cornified epithelial cells by light and electron microscopes. The yeasts appeared not to adhere to the cornified epithelial cells directly, but they seemed to exist in the proximity of the epithelial cells with an electron opaque halo-like space around them. Polysaccharide and lipid staining techniques were conducted to identify the substances existing in that space. Lipid substances, not saccharides, were observed around the yeasts and the cornified epithelial cells. These results suggested that in the canine ear canal malassezia yeast attachment to the cornified epithelial cells is mediated by lipids.","['Masuda A', 'Sukegawa T', 'Tani H', 'Miyamoto T', 'Sasai K', 'Morikawa Y', 'Baba E']",2001,63,6,J Vet Med Sci,"Masuda A, et al.

11449099,M-meatoplasty: results and patient satisfaction in 125 patients (199 ears).,"OBJECTIVE: Is M-meatoplasty the solution for chronic otitis externa caused by wax retention? This study discusses acceptance of this operation and whether sedation is necessary.
STUDY DESIGN: Between October 1994 and October 1997, 199 successive M-meatoplasties (125 patients) were studied, and 79% of the patients completed a questionnaire in which patient satisfaction with the procedure and outcome was assessed.
SETTING: Local hospital, functioning as a secondary referral center.
PATIENTS: All patients had narrowing of the lateral part of the outer ear canal resulting from anterior displacement of the cavum conchae cartilage.
INTERVENTION: The aim of M-meatoplasty is to increase the lumen of the entrance to the external ear canal by reducing the conchal cartilage on the posterior wall
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction of visits to the outpatient clinic, patient satisfaction on a scale from 1 (very bad) to 10 (excellent).
RESULTS: The number of preoperative visits was 7 (range 1-153). The median number of postoperative visits for the same problems more than 3 months after surgery was 1 (range 0-14). The patient score for the surgery and the final result was a median of 9 (very good).
CONCLUSIONS: Wax obstruction and related external otitis can be cured by M-meatoplasty if the conchal cartilage is too prominent on the posterior wall. It is a simple outpatient operation and is very well tolerated. After the operation, there is an enormous reduction in outpatient visits.","['Rombout J', 'van Rijn PM']",2001,22,4,Otol Neurotol,Rombout J and van Rijn PM.

11437845,A worrying development in the microbiology of otitis externa.,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is causing growing concern in hospitals. There has been a steady increase in the number of cases of nosocomial MRSA infections recently and this will no doubt apply to otitis externa, one of the most common ENT infections. The total number of cases of otitis externa presenting to the Accident and Emergency Department over a 3-month period was recorded and the offending microbes cultured and tested for drug sensitivities. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent organism, 30% of patients grew S. aureus. Of these, 6% (15 patients) were MRSA cultures. The contact histories, antibiotic sensitivities and treatment of these 15 patients were studied. Recommendations as a result of this study include the routine culture and sensitivity in otitis externa and where MRSA is cultured, a full contact history should be elicited and appropriate precautions taken. Specifically, a history of hospital contact should be sought. Treatments used successfully in the treatment of MRSA otitis externa were aural toilet and fucidic acid-betamathasone 0.5% wicks where the organism was gentamycin-resistant (GMRSA), whereas aural toilet with aminoglycoside-steroid drops was sufficient if it was gentamycin-sensitive.","['Walshe P', 'Rowley H', 'Timon C']",2001,26,3,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci,"Walshe P, et al.

11393377,Otitis media in a llama.,"A 7-month-old female llama was examined because of chronic otitis media and externa of 7 months' duration. Radiographically, the tympanic bullae appeared thicker than normal, and the ventral borders were poorly defined; the left external acoustic meatus (ear canal) appeared to be narrower than the right. The llama was treated with penicillin, and the ear canals were lavaged daily. Contrast radiography was performed on day 15 to determine the shape and size of the ear canals and evaluate the integrity of the tympanic membranes. Contrast medium was visible radiographically in the left tympanic bulla, indicating that the left tympanic membrane was ruptured, but the right tympanic membrane appeared to be intact. The left ear canal was narrower than the right, and the bony ear canals had a well-defined sigmoid shape. The right ear improved with medial treatment alone, but the left ear did not. Therefore, lateral ear canal resection was performed. After surgery, however, exudate was still evident in the left ear canal, and the llama became more lethargic and more reluctant to eat. Lateral bulla osteotomy was attempted, but no purulent material was obtained, and curettage of the bulla resulted in hemorrhage. Because of this and because of the llama's poor physical condition, a decision was made to euthanatize the llama. The sigmoid shape of the bony ear canal and the multicompartmental nature of the tympanic bulla make surgical treatment of otitis media and externa in llamas difficult. Further study of surgical treatments for otitis media in llamas is needed.","['Koenig JB', 'Watrous BJ', 'Kaneps AJ', 'Adams JG', 'Parker JE']",2001,218,10,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Koenig JB, et al.

11382105,"[Primary carcinoma of the ear canal. Clinical aspects, intratemporal growth behavior and surgical strategy].","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The symptoms and microscopic findings in carcinoma of the external auditory meatus are often unspecific and misinterpreted as recurrent otitis externa. A definite diagnosis is therefore often delayed, frequently resulting in advanced tumor stages with unfavorable prognosis at the time of diagnosis.
PATIENTS/METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of 11 of our own patients and four cases from the Wittmack collection, the clinical data and course of this disease were examined with particular focus on the intratemporal bone growth pattern and possible surgical strategies.
RESULTS: Histopathologically, all cases consisted of squamous cell carcinoma of variable differentiation, with predomination of higher tumor stages (T2-T4: 93.3%) and little initial lymph node metastases (N+: 14.3%; M+: 0%). Osseous destruction was present (almost obligatory) in 93.3% (determined histopathologically and radiologically with CT). Follow-up (to a maximum of 6 years) after surgical resection and postoperative irradiation shows local recurrence at an average of 10 months in 40% of the cases, with a metastasis rate of 44.4%. Mean overall survival is 29.7 months, and 45.5% of the patients experience an average tumor-free period of 46.4 months. The most important prognostic factor in this context is the initial tumor stage.
CONCLUSION: In regard to prognosis of external auditory meatus carcinoma, early diagnosis is of vital importance. Especially older patients (50-80 years) who previously have had no history of ear disease should undergo early computer tomographical examination and biopsy in cases of recurrent external otitis.","['Ussmüller J', 'Hartwein J', 'Rauchfuss A', 'Sanchez-Hanke M']",2001,49,4,HNO,"Ussmüller J, et al.

11359157,Safety and patient experience with transtympanic electrocochleography.,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Transtympanic electrocochleography (t-ECOG) is a sensitive diagnostic instrument used for Meniere's disease. It is sensitive by virtue of the recording electrode's position on the promontory of the cochlea where the signals are generated. There is concern about the invasive nature of t-ECOG in comparison to extratympanic recording techniques. The purpose of this study was to examine the safety issues, complications, and patient experience with t-ECOG.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study utilizing retrospective chart review and patient survey.
METHODS: The medical records of 205 patients who underwent t-ECOG were reviewed for complications. Complications included persistent tympanic membrane perforation, hearing loss, otitis media, otitis externa, ear canal injury, hemotympanum, and pain. An additional 36 patients undergoing t-ECOG were surveyed on subjective measures such as pain during topical anesthesia of the tympanic membrane, during transtympanic placement of the needle electrode, and during the test procedure and overall experience with t-ECOG.
RESULTS: There was one case of a nonhealed, persistent perforation in the setting of acute otitis media directly as a result of t-ECOG. Two patients developed otitis media, and three patients had ear pain for up to 5 days. All 36 patients felt the procedure to be tolerable with minimal discomfort.

Many studies have demonstrated the ototoxicity of common otic preparations such as Cortisporin otic drops. Recent studies have suggested the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic drops as an alternative owing to their excellent antimicrobial coverage and no ototoxic effect. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative ototoxicity of four common otic preparations by direct exposure to isolated cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs). OHCs from adult chinchilla cochlea were exposed to standard bathing solution (control), Cortisporin, Cipro HC, Ciloxan, and Floxin. The cells were observed using an inverted microscope, and the images recorded in digital still-frame and video, and analyzed on the Image Pro-Plus 3.0 program. As measured by time to cell death and change in morphology of OHCs, Cortisporin was most toxic to OHCs.

11320622,[Treatment of therapy refractory chronic otitis externa by local injection of triamcinolone acetate crystalline suspension. Initial experiences].,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: External otitis is characterized by otalgia, otorrhea, itching, and hearing loss. Treatment usually consists of local application of corticosteroids and antibiotics. Chronic external otitis is accompanied by thickening of the skin in the external auditory channel. This reduces the effect of the applied substances. Local injection of suitable drugs may support the conservative treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of local injection of triamcinolone acetonide in the external auditory channel.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Thirteen patients with external otitis resistant to conservative treatment received an injection of triamcinolone acetonide in the external auditory channel. The improvement achieved was assessed by clinical examination and questionnaires.
RESULTS: The symptoms improved substantially in all patients; most of the patients were cured completely.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that local injection of triamcinolone acetonide is effective in the management of chronic external otitis.","['Stuck BA', 'Riedel F', 'Hörmann K']",2001,49,3,HNO,"Stuck BA, et al.

11307916,Fungal malignant otitis externa due to Scedosporium apiospermum.,"Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is an infection of the external auditory canal that invades the skull base. Aspergillus species fungi were the pathological organism in 21 of 23 reported cases of fungal MOE. We report on a 21-year-old man with end-stage acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and fungal MOE caused by Scedosporium apiospermum. Fungal MOE is most common in patients with end-stage AIDS and hematologic malignancies. Granulation tissue is not a common finding in these patients, and the infectious process often starts in the mastoid air cells or middle ear space, as opposed to the external auditory canal. Surgical debridement and amphotericin B are the mainstays of therapy; resolution of the infection depends greatly on the severity of the underlying disease.","['Yao M', 'Messner AH']",2001,110,4,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,Yao M and Messner AH.

11270653,Comparative analysis between Pseudomonas aeruginosa genotypes and severity of symptoms in patients with unilateral or bilateral otitis externa.,"Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was done on 32 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These isolates were obtained from 22 patients who presented to the emergency room in a major medical center in Beirut, Lebanon, during a 5-month period with the diagnosis of either unilateral or bilateral otitis externa. Patients had yellowish to greenish discharge, moderate to severe external auditory canal swelling, moderate to severe pain, and periauricular cellulitis. None of these patients had intrinsic predisposing factors. An ear swab was obtained from both ears of patients, cultured on trypticase soy agar. P. aeruginosa was identified on the basis of pyocyanine production and API identification kits. RAPD analysis was done by using two primers (10 mer and 21 mer primers) and appropriate PCR conditions on extracted DNA. Our data have shown 23 RAPD patterns (A-W) distributed among the 32 P. aeruginosa isolates. RAPD patterns were reproducible. Twenty of 32 isolates were recovered from 10 patients with bilateral otitis externa. The remaining 12 of 32 isolates were recovered from 12 different patients with unilateral otitis externa. Eleven RAPD patterns (A,B,C,D,E,F,H,I,R,U,V) were associated with severe clinical symptoms, including severe pain, severe external auditory canal swelling, periauricular cellulitis, and a yellowish discharge. The remaining RAPD patterns were not associated with severe infections.

11267757,Factors affecting the frequency of ear canal and face infestation by Otodectes cynotis in the cat.,"Otodectes cynotis is responsible for at least 50% of canker cases diagnosed in cats world-wide. The role of Demodex cati in the pathogenesis of otitis and acne is still obscure. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of O. cynoyis and D. cati infestations in clinically normal cats in northern Greece, to determine the factors that are associated with the probability and severity of infestation in the cat, and to examine the importance of these mites in the pathogenesis of feline acne. Samples from 161 cats were examined by flushing the ear canals and by taking skin scrapings of the chin and lip area. The results were combined with various factors (sex, age, living style, hair coat type and presence of pruritus, of ear discharge, of acne-like lesions) in order to carry out a risk analysis. Two separate logistic regression analyses were performed. One, on the infestation/non-infestation potential with O. cynotis and the other, on the degree of such infestation as mild-to-moderate (< or =5 mites/field) or severe (>5 mites/field). D. cati was not detected in any of the 161 cats. The prevalence of O. cynotis was estimated at 25.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 19-32). The rate of mite infestation was higher with the presence of ear discharge (odds ratio 9, 95% CI 3.3-24.5), periaural pruritus (odds ratio 3.6, 95% CI 1.8-8) and acne-like lesions (odds ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-9). Cats with mild-to-moderate degree of infestation had 18 times higher chance of exhibiting an ear discharge than those with a severe infestation. The log-odds of mild-to-moderate parasitism were linearly related to the age.","['Sotiraki ST', 'Koutinas AF', 'Leontides LS', 'Adamama-Moraitou KK', 'Himonas CA']",2001,96,4,Vet Parasitol,"Sotiraki ST, et al.

11261868,Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention.,"Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.",['Sander R'],2001,63,5,Am Fam Physician,"Sander R.

11176586,In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.,"BACKGROUND: Ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (OE), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (AOM-TT) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection.
METHODS: A survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of quinolone otic products for OE, AOM-TT and CSOM.
RESULTS: OE: Floxin otic and Cortisporin TC otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. CSOM: Ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. AOM-TT: Ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa
CONCLUSIONS: In each of the studies of OE, CSOM and AOM-TT, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to Cortisporin for children with OE; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with AOM-TT who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients with CSOM.",['Klein JO'],2001,20,1,Pediatr Infect Dis J,Klein JO.

11174061,Radical meatoplasty in the treatment of severe chronic external otitis.,"In the beginning, external otitis is an inflammation of the skin of the external ear canal. Partial or total obliteration of the meatus causes cleaning problems, which worsen the obliteration, and hence, the infection. Immunosuppressive medication or illness, certain dermatological problems or frequent infections may lead to irreversible changes and to the malignant form of external otitis with life-threatening sequelae. Conservative treatments in the beginning are aimed at regaining the normal skin functions by helping the cleaning process and curing the acute infection with repeated irrigation, proper antibacterial medication and corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory analgesics. In rare prolonged cases, surgical procedures are needed to help the cleaning process by removing the irreversibly thickened skin and bone affections, and using grafts. On the basis of our experience, even the removal of the diseased skin and enlarging of the external ear canal are insufficient procedures in the most difficult cases. In the present paper, we describe a new surgical method that we have performed to treat chronic bilateral obliterative external otitis in 2 patients, with favorable results.","['Haapaniemi J', 'Laurikainen E', 'Suonpää J']",2001,63,1,ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,"Haapaniemi J, et al.

Seventeen patients (25 ears) with external otitis were studied. We took 18 samples from each ear at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 hours and measured the concentration of gentamicin on the wick and in the ear canal. We found that the concentration of gentamicin began to decrease only after 12 hours and a more significant decrease was detected after 14 hours of treatment. We have shown that the antibiotic used on the wick is effective for 12 hours. In conclusion, we recommend using ear drops twice a day on a wick as routine therapy for external otitis.","['Rakover Y', 'Smuskovitz A', 'Colodner R', 'Keness Y', 'Rosen G']",2000,114,11,J Laryngol Otol,"Rakover Y, et al.

Eighty-five cases (12.6%) in 672 dogs with pendulous ears and 35 cases (5.0%) in 698 dogs with erect ears had otitis externa, and the difference between them was significant (P<0.05). Ninety-five auditory cerumen specimens were cultured for Malassezia pachydermatis (M. pachydermatis) and analyzed for concentrations of major fatty acids. Although rates of cases positive for M. pachydermatis in both ear pinna shapes were almost the same, i.e. 55.2% in the pendulous group and 53.6% in the erect group, the average total fatty acid level of the pendulous ear group was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that in the erect ear group after dismissing extraordinary levels in the Siberian husky. Isolated M. pachydermatis strains were examined for the effects of fatty acid supplementation on their growth. The majority of the strains utilized fatty acids and grew faster in fatty acid supplemented broth. These results suggest that M. pachydermatis, the predominant causative agent of canine otitis externa, prefers the auditory canal of dogs with lipid-rich earwax and grows fast, but growth strongly depends upon the canine breed.","['Masuda A', 'Sukegawa T', 'Mizumoto N', 'Tani H', 'Miyamoto T', 'Sasai K', 'Baba E']",2000,62,11,J Vet Med Sci,"Masuda A, et al.

11074838,Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: pediatric otitis.,"BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a potentially lethal organism in pediatric patients. MRSA is an uncommon otologic pathogen that requires special diagnostic and therapeutic intervention.
METHODS: Three pediatric patients with community-acquired MRSA otologic infections were identified during 1999.
SETTING: Tertiary care ear institution.
RESULTS: All patients required intravenous antibiotic therapy to achieve resolution of the infections.
CONCLUSIONS: MRSA in children can be community acquired and can cause otitis externa, otitis media with otorrhea, or acute mastoiditis; intravenous therapy that includes vancomycin is necessary for resolution.","['Santos F', 'Mankarious LA', 'Eavey RD']",2000,126,11,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Santos F, et al.

11057842,Topical fluoroquinolones for eye and ear.,"Topical fluoroquinolones are now available for use in the eye and ear. Their broad spectrum of activity includes the common eye and ear pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the treatment of acute otitis externa, these agents are as effective as previously available otic preparations. For the treatment of otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation, topical fluoroquinolones are effective and safe. These preparations are approved for use in children, and lack of ototoxicity permits prolonged administration when necessary. Topical fluoroquinolones are not appropriate for the treatment of uncomplicated conjunctivitis where narrower spectrum agents suffice; they represent a simplified regimen for the treatment of bacterial keratitis (corneal ulcers). When administered topically, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated and offer convenient dosing schedules. Currently, bacterial resistance appears limited.","['Morden NE', 'Berke EM']",2000,62,8,Am Fam Physician,Morden NE and Berke EM. Topical fluoroquinolones for eye and ear.

His early post-transplant course was complicated by a series of massive intracerebral bleeds and by sepsis related to a malignant otitis externa. The microbial pathogen isolated from ear swabs was found to be Absidia corymbifera, but CT scan at the time showed no intracerebral extension. Despite neutrophil engraftment and aggressive antifungal management he succumbed. Autopsy revealed invasion of Absidia into the brain from the ear.

A 2-year-old female Persian cat weighing 2.25 kg was referred to an animal hospital with a chief complaint of otitis externa of the left ear. Microscopic examination of specimen from the left ear disclosed yeast cells. The colony of the clinical isolate was cream-colored, rough, raised and wrinkled. The microscopic examination of the clinical isolate revealed abundant branched and septated mycelia with small ramified chains of oval blastoconidia, variable in size, and arranged alongside the hyphae. Amplification of the isolate DNA with LSU rDNA primers yielded a fragment of about 570 bp, whose nucleotide sequence of the isolate showed 100% similarity to that of Stephanoascus ciferrii in the GenBank database. Therefore, the isolate was identified as Stephanoascus ciferrii, confirming the result of mycological examination by molecular analysis.","['Kano R', 'Makimura K', 'Kushida T', 'Nomura M', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Hasegawa A']",2000,44,8,Microbiol Immunol,"Kano R, et al.

In vitro activity of two topical products against these organisms isolated from canine referral patients were evaluated. Organisms were grown and diluted to a concentration equivalent to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) per mL and exposed to either a 0 or 1/5 dilution of Hexadene Flush with Spherulites (Virbac Animal Health Inc, Fort Worth, TX) or a 1/5 or 1/25 dilution of ResiCHLOR Lotion with Spherulites (Virbac Animal Health Inc, Fort Worth, TX) at time intervals from 1 to 30 minutes. Results showed that all three organisms were killed within 1 minute of contact time at 0 and 1/5 dilution of the flush. The lotion diluted to 1/5 also killed all three organisms. At 1/25 dilution, this lotion killed S. intermedius and P. aeruginosa within 1 minute of contact time, whereas M. pachydermatis was killed after 1 minute. The findings suggest that the two topical products exhibit efficacy against these common skin pathogens in vitro and can be useful in their clinical management.","['Okwumabua O', 'Goodman F', 'Elfassy O']",2000,1,4,Vet Ther,"Okwumabua O, et al.

The infection was probably of endogenous origin. 7 days before ABMT otolarygological examination including otoscopy and external ear lavage was performed. Slight inflammatory reaction of external ear was accompanied by the massive involvement of middle ear followed by infiltration of petrous pyramid and mastoid process and finally facial and vestibulocochlear nerve paralysis. Initially the symptoms indicated subarachnoid haemorrhage. Mononuclear cells detected in cerebrospinal fluid as well as CT scan were suggestive of leukaemic infiltration. The latter was negated by immunophenotyping of cerebrospinal fluid cells and MR imaging. Antibiotic therapy resulted in clinical improvement. Life-threatening complications are not frequent after ABMT (transplant related mortality--14/310 (4.5%) in our center). We have met m.e.o. for the first time. At present--13 months after ABMT the patient shows slight symptoms of nerve VII and VIII paresis and remains in complete remission of acute leukaemia.

10935426,Treatment of otitis externa in children.,"Inflammation of the external auditory canal can be localised or diffuse, and acute or chronic. Predisposing conditions include external trauma, loss of the canal's protective coating, maceration of the skin from water or humidity, and glandular obstruction. Acute otitis externa is generally caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. Management of patients with otitis externa includes debridement, topical therapy with acidifying and antimicrobial agents, and systemic antimicrobial therapy when indicated. The management of patients with chronic otitis externa includes cleansing and debridement accompanied by topical acidifying and drying agents. This is followed by topical antibiotics and corticosteroid preparations. Surgery is mainly used to allow cleansing and aeration and/or removal of the scarred tissue. Patients with acute localised otitis externa (furunculosis) are treated with local heat and systemic antibiotics in the inflammatory stage, and drainage in the abscess state. Mycotic external otitis is managed with topical acidifying and antifungal agents, while viral (herpes) infection is treated with topical and systemic aciclovir (acyclovir). Patients with necrotising (malignant) external otitis, which is mainly caused by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, are treated with systemic antibiotics and, rarely, by surgical debridement. Therapy for eczematous otitis externa is first directed at the secondary infection, and thereafter at the primary dermatological condition. Prevention of recurrent external otitis is aimed at minimising ear canal trauma and the avoidance of exposure to water. Preventative use of topical acidifying agents or 70% alcohol is also advocated.",['Brook I'],1999,1,4,Paediatr Drugs,Brook I. Treatment of otitis externa in children.

10912688,Granular myringitis: is it a surgical problem?,"OBJECTIVE: An attempt to settle the controversies associated with granular myringitis (GM) including incidence, etiology, pathology, presentation, relation to chronic otitis media, and treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center and private otology practice.
PATIENTS: 94 patients presenting with GM over 28 years.
INTERVENTION: Diagnosis by otoscopy, audiometry, radiology, and bacteriology; long-term follow-up (6 months to 12 years); assessment of treatment results.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The pathologic states of the affected tympanic membranes were studied in both active and quiescent stages. The results of conservative versus surgical management were evaluated.
RESULTS: The disease presents with chronic painless otorrhea, normal hearing and mastoid pneumatization, and granular areas, which may be patchy, diffuse, or segmental. The latter is the most frequent and is most commonly posterosuperior. The infecting organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pathologic process affects all drum layers and can cause a perforation. The most important predisposing factor is disturbed epithelial migration, which may be exaggerated by eustachian tube dysfunction. Of 26 cases treated conservatively, none healed without recurrence. Of 48 cases treated surgically, there were 2 recurrences.
CONCLUSIONS: Pathologically, the disease affects all drum layers. It presents with an active stage, which may be misdiagnosed as chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma, and a quiescent stage when it may be overlooked. Although distinct from chronic otitis media, it can cause a perforation. The disease responds readily to medical treatment, but recurrence is common. Radical surgery offers a curative measure in refractory cases.","['El-Seifi A', 'Fouad B']",2000,21,4,Am J Otol,El-Seifi A and Fouad B. Granular myringitis: is it a surgical problem?.

This followed a protracted episode of uncomplicated otitis externa with no evidence of bone involvement on computed tomography (CT) scanning. Cyclosporin-induced hypertrichosis (excess hair growth) in his external auditory canal contributed greatly to the initial difficulty in managing his otitis externa.

10892679,An animal model for external ear canal inflammation.,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an animal model for testing efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs designed to treat external ear canal (EAC) disease.
METHODS: Histological and morphometric methods were used to characterize EAC inflammation produced by topical application of tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) in mice. The effects of both single and repeated TPA applications were studied. A treatment trial was performed to evaluate the effects of a ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone suspension on TPA-induced EAC inflammation. In 10 animals, two bilateral applications of TPA were made, spaced 24 hours apart. Immediately after the second TPA application, otic suspension was applied unilaterally four times over a 48-hour period. The contralateral EACs were left untreated to provide TPA-only controls.
RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single TPA application, EAC skin showed polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte infiltration, vascular dilation, and thickening of the dermis and epidermis. Dermal and epidermal thickening were more pronounced after two TPA applications and PMN leukocyte infiltration remained high 48 hours after a second TPA placement. After treatment with the otic suspension, PMN leukocyte counts were reduced by an average of 76% relative to EACs that received TPA only. There was also statistically significant reduction of dermal swelling and a trend toward reduced epidermal thickness. Vascular dilation was clearly reduced as well EACs that received four applications of the suspension alone showed no adverse effects compared with those that received saline.
CONCLUSION: TPA-induced inflammation of the mouse EAC provides a suitable model for testing the therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents being considered for clinical use.","['Wright CG', 'Pawlowski KS', 'Roland PS', 'Meyerhoff WL']",2000,110,7,Laryngoscope,"Wright CG, et al.

Forty-four isolates were obtained, which represents 67.7% of samples. Coagulase-negative species were most commonly found, and the most frequently isolated staphylococcus species were Staph. epidermidis and Staph. aureus. Other species, such as Staph. simulans, Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. saprophyticus and Staph. intermedius were also isolated. Resistance to antibiotics was frequently observed, with 90.9% of the isolates showing resistance to at least one drug. The most active antimicrobial agents against staphylococci isolated from otitis externa of dogs were rifampin and oxacillin. Multidrug resistance was a common finding, and one strain of Staph. haemolyticus species, was resistant to all tested antimicrobial agents. Resistance to three or more different drugs was a common finding, observed in 16 strains (36.4%) of both coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci. This study highlights the emergence of cases of otitis externa determined by coagulase-negative staphylococcus strains and once more emphasizes the need for bacterial culture with species identification and susceptibility testing of swab specimens from the ear canal in order to choose appropriate antimicrobial agents.","['Lilenbaum W', 'Veras M', 'Blum E', 'Souza GN']",2000,31,1,Lett Appl Microbiol,"Lilenbaum W, et al.

10850873,Canalographic evaluation of the external ear canal in dogs.,Canalography was performed to measure the diameter of the horizontal ear canal and to assess the clinical relevance of the measurements in identifying abnormalities of the ear canal. The diameter of the proximal and distal end of the annular cartilage in the horizontal ear canal was measured using canalography in 222 ears. The tympanic membrane could not be visualized with otoscopic examination in 70 ears even after ear cleansing. These canals were classified as being stenotic. The diameter of the proximal annular cartilage in the stenotic canals ranged from 0.8 to 3.1 mm (mean = 2.6 +/- 0.8 mm). The proximal annular cartilage was consistently smaller in diameter than the distal annular cartilage. The ratio between the diameter of the proximal and distal annular cartilage varied between dogs. In stenotic ear canals (70 ears) the ratio was less than 0.65. Total ear canal ablations and histopathological analysis were performed in 70 ear canals classified as stenotic after canalography. Hyperplasia of the epidermal layer was found in 56 stenotic canals. Stenosis of the canal due to otitis externa was found in the other 14 canals. Three canals with severe otitis externa were also diagnosed with canalography as having a ruptured tympanic membrane.

The Panel concluded that in the absence of systemic infection or serious underlying disease, topical antibiotics alone constitute first-line treatment for most patients with these conditions, finding no evidence that systemic antibiotics alone or in combination with topical preparations improve treatment outcomes compared with topical antibiotics alone. Topical preparations should be selected on the basis of expected bacteriology and informed knowledge of the risk-benefit of each available preparation. The use of nonototoxic preparations in treating acute otitis externa (when the tympanic membrane is perforated or its status is unknown), chronic suppurative otitis media, and tympanostomy tube otorrhea should be considered.","['Hannley MT', 'Denneny JC', 'Holzer SS']",2000,122,6,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Hannley MT, et al.

Results of the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics and the German Contact Allergy Group].,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) centrally collects patch tests results in cooperation with the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG). Data of patients, who underwent patch testing to evaluate otitis externa were analyzed.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Data of 145 patients that had been recorded between 1992 and 1997 were evaluated. The evaluation included data yielded by standardized patch testing as well as by patch testing of products that the patients had used.
RESULTS: Allergic contact dermatitis was diagnosed in one third of patients suffering from otitis externa. Topical drugs were shown to be the most important allergens. In comparison to the entire IVDK collective, the population-adjusted frequency of sensitization (PAFS) of neomycin sulfate was higher in the study population whereas that of nickel sulfate was lower. That shows that in a very specific topographic area, different allergens may be of clinical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Whereas nickel sulfate represents an important allergen in the contact dermatitis of the external ear, topical therapeutical agents, especially neomycin sulfate and, as evaluation of the patch tests of the patient's own products revealed, probably polymyxin B are the dominating allergens in otitis externa.","['Hillen U', 'Geier J', 'Goos M']",2000,51,4,Hautarzt,"Hillen U, et al.

METHODS: We observed and studied 14 cases of PF after shower/bath exposure, an underestimated pathogenic event. Cutaneous and environmental microbiological evaluations were performed.
RESULTS: In our cases, the clinical expression of dermatitis was constant, PF being a clinically well recognizable skin infection, presenting with follicular, macular, and papulopustular lesions located on the lateral aspect of the trunk, axillary folds, hips, buttocks, and suprapubic area. In all cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from lesional skin; seven cases were serotyped revealing, in three cases, serotype 0 : 1, in two cases 0 : 8, in one case 0 : 10, and in one case 0 : 11. In three families, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in the well water. In a further three families, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from bathroom and kitchen components.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we suggest that shower/bath exposure should be definitively included amongst the possible pathogenic events causing PF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for a number of clinical pictures, e.g. otitis externa, conjunctivitis, toe web intertrigo, green nail syndrome, infection of burns and wounds, and folliculitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis (PF) has been reported to develop as a consequence of exposure to contaminated water in heated swimming pools, whirlpools, and hot-tubes, or related to diving suits and leg waxing.1-4 We observed 14 cases of PF after shower/bath exposure. This is probably an underestimated pathogenic event; to our knowledge, only one case has been reported to date.5 In our patients, the clinical expression of dermatitis was constant, PF being a clinically well recognizable skin condition.","['Zichichi L', 'Asta G', 'Noto G']",2000,39,4,Int J Dermatol,"Zichichi L, et al.

During the months of June, July, and August 1996, 179 patients were evaluated in the emergency room of the Alicante General University Hospital, Spain. Average patient age at presentation was 30.52 (+/- 20.08) years and 56% were men. The most frequent disease was diffuse otitis externa (78%) followed by acute-on-chronic otitis media (12%), otomycosis (8%), and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity (2%). The most frequently involved microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in diffuse otitis externa, Aspergillus niger and Candida in otomycosis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus in acute-on-chronic otitis media.

10789406,Accuracy of patient self-medication with topical eardrops.,"Topical eardrops are commonly prescribed by otolaryngologists and general practitioners and many believe that patient compliance is poor, although this has not been studied in a properly controlled manner. Thirty-nine patients with otitis externa were reviewed four times during a two-week course of topical eardrops and their treatment compliance studied. The patients tended to undermedicate themselves, and this tendency increased over the two-week period. Patients were administering significantly fewer drops by the end of day 11 than by the end of day 3 (p = 0.2). Compliance patterns were extremely poor, in that only 40 per cent of patients were managing to self-medicate within a 25 per cent error margin by the end of day 3. These findings may have future implications in the ongoing debate on eardrop use.","['England RJ', 'Homer JJ', 'Jasser P', 'Wilde AD']",2000,114,1,J Laryngol Otol,"England RJ, et al.

We report the identification of Staphylococcus intermedius from the patient and a possible route of transmission. Analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms indicated that the dominant species present was S. intermedius. A pet dog owned by the patient also was tested and found to harbor S. intermedius. In humans, the disease is rare and considered a zoonosis.

10720822,A study of tea tree oil ototoxicity.,"Tea tree oil shows promise as an effective treatment for a number of micro-organisms commonly associated with otitis externa and otitis media, but its possible ototoxicity has not been previously assessed. The ototoxicity of tea tree oil was examined in the guinea pig by measuring the thresholds of the compound auditory nerve action potential (CAP) to tone bursts before and after instillation of the oil into the middle ear. After 30 min of instillation, 100% tea tree oil caused a partial CAP threshold elevation at 20 kHz. A lower concentration of oil [2% tea tree oil dissolved in saline using 0.5% detergent (Tween-80)] did not cause any significant lasting threshold change after middle ear instillation for the same period of time. The latter concentration of oil is greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration reported for most micro-organisms in the effective spectrum of the oil and this suggests that this concentration may be safe and effective provided only short exposures (about 30 min) are used. The results suggest that high concentrations of tea tree oil applied to the round window for a relatively short time are to some extent ototoxic to the high-frequency region of the cochlea. Hence further study is needed to establish whether tea tree oil can be used with safety in the treatment of external and middle ear infections.","['Zhang SY', 'Robertson D']",2000,5,2,Audiol Neurootol,Zhang SY and Robertson D.

10663060,[Results and extraordinary complications of surgery for exostoses of the external auditory canal].,"We present a retrospective study on 22 operations of exostosis of the external auditory canal in 20 patients. 8 patients were passionated by water sports. The most frequent indication for surgery (13 operations) was recurrent external otitis or ceruminal obstruction. In 7 cases the need for a wider access to the middle ear indicated surgery. Surgery was usually performed as an outpatient procedure, maximum hospitalization was 3 days. The mean healing period was 6 (3-10) weeks. Mean follow up was 43 (3-110) months. There were no severe intraoperative complications such as facial paresis, lesions of the ossicles or of the inner ear. As intraoperative complications we found 2 perforations of the tympanic membrane, 2 expositions of the capsule of the mandibular joint, one of which was followed by chronic pain. As postoperative complications we found an early soft tissue stenosis of the external auditory canal and one late soft tissue stenosis which recurred after revision surgery. No recurrence of exostosis was seen. We describe an up to now unknown complication: the appearance of bilateral petrositis caused by staphylococcus epidermidis after bilateral surgery in an otherwise healthy patient. This study confirms that severe complications are rare, minor ones however relatively common. And that also minor complications may have a troublesome follow. Therefore and because of the potential of severe complications indication for surgery must be made cautiously and risks of the operation must not be underestimated.","['Reber M', 'Mudry A']",2000,48,2,HNO,Reber M and Mudry A.

It may occur as a result of acute otitis externa, otitis media or a foreign body. Animate foreign body in the ear canal or in the middle ear usually results in otalgia and hearing loss. We present a rare case of a living mature termite in the middle ear of a 9-year-old girl complaining of intermittent attacks of otalgia associated with a loud cracking sound in the left ear. In this case, a small perforation of the tympanic membrane without a history of previous trauma, infection, or evidence of a foreign body in the external ear raises a suspicion. A careful, time-consumed microscopic examination could show the living creature in the middle ear. Immediate immobilization and removal of the living foreign body are imperative. In conclusion, tympanic membrane perforation and intermittent severe otalgia without history of otitis may lead to a suspicion of any insects in the middle ear.","['Supiyaphun P', 'Sukumanpaiboon P']",2000,27,1,Auris Nasus Larynx,Supiyaphun P and Sukumanpaiboon P.

10553446,Use of infrared thermography to detect inflammation caused by contaminated growth promotant ear implants in cattle.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the infrared thermographic appearance of bovine ears that had received contaminated growth promotant implants with ears that had received clean implants and ears without implants.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
ANIMALS: 32 yearling crossbred beef steers with a mean weight of 322 kg (708 lbs).
PROCEDURE: Contaminated (n = 16) and clean (16) implants were placed in the ears of feedlot cattle. Nonimplanted (n = 32) ears served as a within-animal control for thermographic comparisons. Images of rostral and caudal surfaces were obtained during a 21-day period, using an infrared thermal imaging radiometer. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the relationship between mean temperature in a zone on the rostral surface of the ear and at 3 locations (proximal, middle, distal) on the caudal surface of the ear (response variables) with treatment (ears with contaminated implants or clean implants vs control ears with no implants), time (repeated day of measurement), and interactions among these variables.
RESULTS: Significant temperature differences existed between ears with contaminated implants and control ears. Temperatures for ears with clean implants were significantly higher than control ears on day 2. At low ambient temperatures when the ears became wet, a greater temperature contrast was detected between ears with contaminated implants and control ears.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Thermal imaging of the ears of feedlot cattle is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that can be used to identify cattle with abscesses caused by contaminated growth-promotant implants.","['Spire MF', 'Drouillard JS', 'Galland JC', 'Sargeant JM']",1999,215,9,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Spire MF, et al.

10595337,[Surgical treatment of auditory canal exostoses].,"BACKGROUND: Although complications of surgical removal of external auditory canal exostoses are rare, reported surgical complications include tympanic membrane perforation, postoperative hearing loss, canal stenosis, and facial nerve injuries.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on our experience in exostosis surgery, consisting of 59 procedures in 48 patients. Preoperative and postoperative complaints and findings, intraoperative complications, and audiologic results are described and discussed. There has been a minimum of one year of follow-up in every case.
RESULTS: Postoperative canal stenosis was seen in 2 cases of preoperative severe persistent external otitis. Temporary threshold shift was recorded in 6 patients. Persistent sensorineural hearing loss occurred in 4 patients. Six of the 10 patients with temporary or persistent hearing loss had already shown preoperative sensorineural hearing loss. Intraoperatively tympanic membrane perforation occurred in 3 cases, accidental opening of the mastoid in 1 case.
CONCLUSIONS: Exostosis surgery should be reserved for uninfected ear canals. Meatal skin preservation without circular meatal flap incision is recommended to avoid postoperative canal stenosis. Especially in cases of preexisting sensorineural hearing loss, attention should be focused on the intraoperative noise reduction by tympanic membrane protection and pauses of noise exposition.","['Frese KA', 'Rudert H', 'Maune S']",1999,78,10,Laryngorhinootologie,"Frese KA, et al.

The patient is an otherwise healthy, nondiabetic 58-year-old white man. Contributory history began in 1994 after surgery for bilateral exostoses of the external auditory canals. Between April 1994 and May 1998 persistent otalgia occurred, with progressive mixed hearing losses, purulent discharge from both ears, spontaneous perforations of the tympanic membranes and ulceration of canal wall skin. From the beginning, Staph. epidermidis was isolated in all but one culture, but was not recognized as the pathological agent because of the presence of other more frequently involved bacteria and fungi. After multiple intravenous and oral antibiotics and antifungal treatments failed, further management involved frequent debridement of both external auditory canals and tympanic membranes, right tympanoplasty, bilateral mastoidectomy, revision tympanomastoidectomies and left modified radical mastoidectomy. Antistaphylococcal therapy including ceftazidime, vancomycin, teicoplanin, clindamycin and rifampicin was tried. Following the modified radical radical mastoidectomy, normalization of the status of his ears took approximately 2 months and has since remained stable to date. His left ear is deaf because of vancomycin administration, while magnetic resonance imaging and gallium scintigraphy have shown persistent inflammation of the skull base.","['Soldati D', 'Mudry A', 'Monnier P']",1999,256,9,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Soldati D, et al.

10498444,Prevalence of Malassezia spp. in the ears of asymptomatic cattle and cattle with otitis in Brazil.,"Yeasts of the genus Malassezia are lipophilic microorganisms that are saprophytes that can act as opportunistic pathogens in animals. Malassezia pachydermatis is commonly isolated from the ear canal and skin of healthy dogs, or in association with seborrheic dermatitis and otitis externa conditions. The objective of the present study was to determine the occurrence of Malassezia spp. in the ears of healthy bovines and bovines with otitis. Specimens (secretion or cerumen) were collected with sterile swabs, inoculated onto Mycosel medium, supplemented with olive oil, and incubated at 35 degrees C for 1 week. Yeasts were identified according to morphological characteristics, growth in Dixon medium at 32 degrees C and Sabouraud glucose medium modified by the addition of Tween 20, 40 or 80. The results showed that 54.7% of the cultures were positive in bovines with otitis (75) and 34.6% were positive in healthy bovines (378). Analysis of the positive cultures (41) from animals with otitis allowed presumptive identification of 24 strains corresponding to M. globosa (12), M. slooffiae (5), M. furfur (5) and M. sympodialis (2). Further studies on a larger number of animals may confirm the trend verified thus far, i.e. a higher frequency of isolation of Malassezia spp. from animals with otitis than from healthy animals (P<0.01) and a predominance of the species M. globosa.","['Duarte EP', 'Melo MM', 'Hahn RC', 'Hamdan JS']",1999,37,3,Med Mycol,"Duarte EP, et al.

10493278,Ofloxacin otic solution: a review of its use in the management of ear infections.,"UNLABELLED: Ofloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent that inhibits the supercoiling activity of bacterial DNA gyrase, halting DNA replication. Ofloxacin has been formulated as a 0.3% otic solution for the treatment of ear infections. Topical administration of ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% produces very high concentrations of drug in the ear, thus broadening the spectrum of activity of ofloxacin greatly, to cover most common ear pathogens. Results of clinical trials indicate that ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% is as effective as topical neomycin/polymixin B/hydrocortisone preparations in the treatment of otitis externa (clinical cure rate >80% in adults and >95% in children for both treatments) and oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the treatment of otitis media in the presence of tympanostomy tubes in children (clinical cure rates 76 and 69% for ofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, respectively). It is also effective in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media in adolescents and adults with perforated tympanic membranes (75 to 91% clinical cure rate). Because of the limited systemic absorption after topical administration, ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% is well tolerated. Adverse events were usually classed as mild to moderate, with < or =2% considered severe. The most frequent adverse events were bitter taste (5%), primarily in patients with non-intact tympanic membranes, and pruritus (2%). The incidence of adverse events with ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% was similar to that with other ototopical preparations and significantly less than that with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Unlike comparative ototopical antibacterials, ofloxacin was not ototoxic or chondrotoxic in animal studies. In addition, no ototoxicity was detected in clinical studies in humans.
CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% is clinically effective in the treatment of otitis externa and otitis media in patients with tympanic membrane perforations or tympanostomy tubes. The high concentrations achieved with this ototopical solution render it active against a broad spectrum of organisms. It is well tolerated, avoiding many systemic adverse events, and is not associated with ototoxicity. As the first ototopical agent approved for use in patients with non-intact tympanic membranes, ofloxacin otic solution 0.3% provides a valuable advantage over current treatment alternatives.","['Simpson KL', 'Markham A']",1999,58,3,Drugs,Simpson KL and Markham A.

Compared to the general hospital population Yorkshire terriers, Chinese Shar-Peis and cocker spaniels showed a strong predilection. No such predilection was found regarding the sex of the animals. The age of the dogs at the onset of the clinical signs ranged from 2 months to 8 years (median: 2.5 years). Moderate to severe pruritus, noticed in all the 91 dogs, was either localized (29/91) or generalized (64/91) and non-seasonal (43/91), seasonal (19/91) or of unknown seasonality (29/91). The most common cutaneous lesions included erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypotrichosis and crusts; their body distribution was generalized (64%) or localized (36%) with the feet as the most common site of involvement. Five dogs that had unlesional skin were significantly younger and had been pruritic for a shorter period of time compared to the majority of our study population. Otitis externa (43/91) and bacterial pyoderma (30/91) were the most common conditions associated with atopic dermatitis, while the prevalence of Malassezia dermatitis was very low (2/91). Of the other allergic skin diseases flea allergic dermatitis was the most common (29/91) followed by food hypersensitivity (2 out of the 15 dogs tested). The majority of the dogs demonstrated multiple sensitivities to the 50 aeroallergens tested, while domestic mites (77/91), and particularly Dermatophagoides farinae (64/91), were the most commonly implicated. The total number of the positive intradermal test reactions was increasing parallel to the age of the dogs but it was negatively associated with the presence of skin lesions on the carpal and tarsal joints.","['Saridomichelakis MN', 'Koutinas AF', 'Gioulekas D', 'Leontidis L']",1999,69,1,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,"Saridomichelakis MN, et al.

ANIMALS: 650 dogs without clinical signs of ear disease.
PROCEDURE: Dogs were assigned to 5 groups on the basis of auricular conformation and amount of hair in the external ear canal and 4 groups on the basis of body weight or age. External ear canal temperatures (EECT) were measured, using an infrared thermometer. Mean EECT determined for each group were compared to evaluate effects of ear type, age, weight, and sex, and EECT measured at different ambient temperatures and humidities were compared to determine climatic effects.
RESULTS: Dogs with hirsute ear canals had significantly lower EECT than dogs with hairless ear canals, whereas significant differences were not detected between dogs with erect and pendulous auricles. Dogs < 6 years old had higher EECT than older dogs, and dogs that weighed < 6 kg had lower EECT than larger dogs. External ear canal temperatures measured when ambient temperatures were < 25 C were less than those measured at warmer temperatures. Sex and relative humidity did not affect EECT CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: EECT of dogs without ear disease were affected by weight and age, amount of hair in the external ear canal, and ambient temperature. However, hirsute ears had lower, not higher, EECT than hairless ears, suggesting that EECT may play less of a role in the development of otitis externa than believed.","['Huang HP', 'Huang HM']",1999,60,9,Am J Vet Res,"Huang HP and Huang HM.

34644924,The use of fluoroquinolones in veterinary dermatology.,"The fluoroquinolones are a group of antibiotics with considerable application for use in veterinary dermatology. They are rapidly bactericidal against a wide variety of clinically important organisms including Staphylococcus intermedius and gram-negative enteric bacilli by virtue of interference with the supercoiling of bacterial chromosomal material. Their favourable pharmacokinetic features make them applicable in many animal species, and in a range of dose formulations. The only major clinical contraindication is that fluoroquinolones should not be given to young, rapidly growing dogs as they can induce a noninflammatory, erosive arthropathy. For many years the only veterinary-labelled fluoroquinolone available was enrofloxacin. The selection of a fluoroquinolone has become more complex now that there are more choices available. Orbifloxacin, difloxacin and marbofloxacin now join enrofloxacin on the veterinary market, although not all of these are licensed in every country. The use of fluoroquinolones in dermatology remains controversial. The authors recommend that fluoroquinolones be considered in circumstances where canine pyoderma has been refractory to appropriate 'first line' antibiotics. They are most useful in the management of recurrent pyoderma and in chronic, deep pyoderma with extensive scar tissue. In addition, fluouroquinolones frequently are the drugs of choice for canine ear infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","['Ihrke PJ', 'Papich MG', 'DeManuelle TC']",1999,10,3,Vet Dermatol,"Ihrke PJ, et al.

10440629,The relation of patient satisfaction with treatment of otitis externa to clinical outcomes: development of an instrument.,"This survey was undertaken to develop a short, comprehensive measure of patient satisfaction with pharmacologic treatment for otitis externa and to assess the relationships between satisfaction, disease symptoms, and medication side effects. Otitis externa was diagnosed in 41 patients recruited from 6 sites; 34 patients completed and returned the study instruments and were included in the study. Patients or their caregivers administered polymyxin/neomycin/hydrocortisone ear drops prescribed by a physician and completed a daily diary for 10 days and a satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the treatment period. The main outcome measures were the subscale scores for patient satisfaction and their relation to medication side effects, symptoms of ear infection, activity limitations, pain, and adherence to prescription regimens. The questionnaire and its subscales demonstrated good psychometric properties (ie, reliability coefficients >0.75, except for 1 subscale). Overall satisfaction was found to be significantly correlated with relief of symptoms, ability to return to normal activities, ease of administration, and medication side effects. Satisfaction subscale scores were correlated with patient-reported severity of medication side effects and disease symptoms. More than half the patients took drops for more than the prescribed number of days, and one third took more than the prescribed number of drops per administration (ie, overadherence). The relation between satisfaction and adherence was weak, perhaps due to the high rates of overadherence. Our results demonstrate that patient satisfaction with otic medication can be assessed across various aspects of satisfaction and that it is correlated with reported disease symptoms and medication side effects. This type of multifaceted assessment may help physicians select between medications with different side-effect profiles and administration schedules. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between satisfaction with an otic medication and adherence to a medication regimen.","['Shikiar R', 'Halpern MT', 'McGann M', 'Palmer CS', 'Seidlin M']",1999,21,6,Clin Ther,"Shikiar R, et al.

METHODS: From 1990 to 1997, all patients with malignant otitis externa at the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei were reviewed retrospectively. The clinical features and the strategy of diagnosis and treatment are discussed.
RESULTS: Twelve patients with an average age of 65.3 years were included. Eleven of these patients were diabetic. All had the presenting symptoms of otalgia and otorrhea at diagnosis. Bacterial cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa in eight patients and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in four patients. The mean duration of admission was 82 days. Appropriate antibiotics were given according to the results of bacterial culture and sensitivity test. 99Technetium scans and 67gallium scans were performed to evaluate the extent of involvement and monitor the effects of treatment. Eventually, four patients died due to renal failure, meningitis, pneumonia and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Malignant otitis externa is a life-threatening infection arising from the external auditory canal. A high degree of suspicion for malignant otitis externa is mandatory. Vigorous local and systemic antimicrobial treatment should be initiated early in the course of the disease to achieve a satisfactory outcome. 99Technetium and 67gallium scans are important for the diagnosis and evaluation of the treatment results.","['Yu LH', 'Shu CH', 'Tu TY', 'Shiao AS', 'Lien CF']",1999,62,6,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),"Yu LH, et al.

DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.
ANIMALS: 13 dogs.
PROCEDURE: Dogs were treated surgically for otitis externa and media via total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy. Specimens for aerobic bacterial culture were obtained from SC tissue immediately following skin incision, tissues excised from the osseous bulla (after transection of the horizontal ear canal and lateral bulla osteotomy), and from SC tissue prior to skin closure. Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates to various antibiotics was determined by use of a broth dilution assay.
RESULTS: There was a significant association between isolation of Streptococcus canis and Escherichia coli from specimens from the osseous bulla and specimens from the SC tissues prior to skin closure, indicating contamination of the SC tissues during surgery. Seventy percent of bacterial isolates were susceptible to cefazolin.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Measures to limit bacterial contamination resulting from tissue handling during total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy are necessary. Bacteriologic culture of tissue of the osseous bulla and determination of antimicrobial susceptibility are recommended.

10077251,Less radical drilling in surgery for exostoses of the external auditory canal.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the anatomical and functional long-term result of surgery for ear canal exostosis.
METHODS: Case rapport review with extraction of data concerning pre- and postoperative anatomical conditions, symptoms and audiology and a clinical and audiological re-evaluation. In the 20-year-period from 1 January 1976 to 1 January 1996, 26 patients were operated on primarily for ear canal exostosis. 19 patients with in total 24 ears were re-evaluated. Control-period 7.2 years. Pre-operatively were found occluding ear-canal exostosis in all patients as well as hearing loss, otitis externa and pain.
RESULTS: At the re-evaluation all patient were completely free of their symptoms. 19 out of 24 ears still had some remnants of exostosis, but the ear canal was covered with completely normal skin and had normal migration properties. No signs of re-growth were found in this material. Postoperatively one patient had a sensorineural hearing loss of 85 dB at 6 kHz, one had a dehiscence of the temporomandibular joint and one patient had an anterior ear drum perforation.
CONCLUSION: To avoid the complications a less radical drilling of exostoses is proposed, in particular along the superior wall and near the short process of the malleus handle and along the anterior tympanomeatal angle. Removal of the bone from the posterior, inferior and anterior walls with preservation of the canal skin, creates enough lumen providing permanent cure.","['Stougaard M', 'Tos M']",1999,26,1,Auris Nasus Larynx,Stougaard M and Tos M.

10050637,Treatment patterns for otitis externa.,"BACKGROUND: Although otitis externa is a common and painful infection of the outer ear canal, there is little specific information available regarding current treatment patterns in the United States. We wanted to examine treatment patterns for otitis externa.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 1993 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the 1993 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) for adults and children treated for otitis externa. Data analyses included the reasons for physician visits, concomitant diagnoses, types of physicians seen, sources of payment, medical procedures administered, drugs prescribed, and patient disposition following a physician visit.
RESULTS: Study results suggested that treatment patterns differ substantially for adults and children, as well as by physician specialty. Although otitis externa is frequently painful, few cases are classified as severe, and the data indicated that less than 20 percent of patients have concomitant diagnoses treatable by medication. Nevertheless, 40 percent of patients received both topical and systemic medication, and many of the oral antibiotics prescribed are not active against Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common bacterial pathogens in otitis externa.
CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate treatment of localized otitis externa with topical antibiotics should eliminate the need for systemic medications. Addition of systemic medications can unnecessarily increase treatment costs and the likelihood of side effects, and could reduce the likelihood of patient compliance.","['Halpern MT', 'Palmer CS', 'Seidlin M']",1999,12,1,J Am Board Fam Pract,"Halpern MT, et al.

9989644,Value of different methods for the characterisation of Aspergillus terreus strains.,"To evaluate different methods for strain differentiation, 10 isolates of Aspergillus terreus from Germany and two epidemiologically unrelated strains were investigated. The sources of the isolates were patients with cystic fibrosis (4), immunosuppression (2), otitis externa (2), sinusitis (1) and endocarditis (1). Environmental isolates were obtained from a contaminated cell culture and from soil. The isolates did not differ in their macroscopic and microscopic morphology, in their protein patterns analysed by SDS-PAGE and in their susceptibility to amphotericin B and itraconazole. The RFLP analysis of total genomic DNA digested by EcoRI resulted in patterns that were too faint for interpretation. However, after hybridisation of the digested DNA with a short DNA probe of repetitive sequence, six different patterns were found. Based on the patterns of the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with three primers, nine different genotypes were discriminate. RAPD patterns discriminated the epidemiologically unrelated reference strains (endocarditis isolate from Thailand, soil isolate from the USA) and the isolates from Germany. It is concluded that, in contrast to the phenotypic methods, the analysis of RAPD patterns is useful for strain differentiation of A. terreus.","['Rath PM', 'Kamphoff S', 'Ansorg R']",1999,48,2,J Med Microbiol,"Rath PM, et al.

The results are summarized as follows: 1. No annual changes were seen for MIC50 of OFLX, but MIC80 and MIC90 of that rose against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 1993 to 1996. It appears that resistance to OFLX is increasing among these bacteria. Detection frequency of highly resistant strains to OFLX (MIC > 100 micrograms/ml) was lower than to other control drugs. 2. No annual changes were seen of MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 of OFLX against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus spp., Proteus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. OFLX showed strong antimicrobial activities against these bacteria. 3. Since there was no large annual changes in the antimicrobial activity of OFLX against clinical isolates that were obtained from patients with otitis media and otitis externa, OFLX otic solution was considered as one of the clinically useful drugs even now.","['Matsumoto Y', 'Suzuki Y', 'Ishii Y', 'Ishihara R', 'Nakazawa A', 'Nakane Y', 'Nishinari C', 'Deguchi K']",1998,51,9,Jpn J Antibiot,"Matsumoto Y, et al.

9831146,Long-term results with the titanium bone-anchored hearing aid: the U.S. experience.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the titanium bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA).
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of 24 patients implanted with the BAHA between 1984 and 1987 in a multiinstitutional study designed to evaluate the device in the United States was performed, including detailed clinical and audiologic evaluations of the 10 patients implanted at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. The data were collected from patients' charts, questionnaires, and the Nobel Biocare patient contact and repair records.
PATIENTS: Candidates for the BAHA are unable to use a conventional air conduction hearing aid because of congenital aural atresia, draining mastoid cavities, or recurrent otitis externa. The audiologic indications are a conductive or a mixed hearing loss with a bone conduction average of 45 db or better and a speech discrimination score of 60% or better.
INTERVENTION: A BAHA was implanted in a two-stage procedure under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' satisfaction with the device, hearing improvement, and complication rates were reviewed.
RESULTS: The majority of the patients analyzed (78%) are still using the device an average of 15.6 hours/day 10 to 13 years after implantation. The overall satisfaction score was 4.5 (1, worst; 5, best). In sound field testing, the mean speech reception threshold improved from 52 db to 27 db (p < 0.05). There were no major complications.
CONCLUSION: The BAHA is a safe and effective bone conduction hearing aid with wide applications for patients with bone conduction hearing levels of 45 db and discrimination scores of 60% or better.","['Wazen JJ', 'Caruso M', 'Tjellstrom A']",1998,19,6,Am J Otol,"Wazen JJ, et al.

We tested 46 bacterial strains (S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium spp., and gram-negative bacilli) with 20 different antibiotics. We observed increased resistance to antibiotics of bacteria isolated from canine otitis externa as compared to the resistance reported earlier. This may be due to the indiscriminate use of some antibiotics in the last years and indicates the importance of sensitivity testing for the effective treatment of chronic otitis externa, especially that caused by gram-negative bacilli. The clinician may initiate empiric treatment with antibiotics before obtaining the sensitivity test results; the best results may be expected from a topical application of Bacitracin or Chloramphenicol, and from a systemic therapy with Cephalosporines.

9816382,Identification of infectious Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in an occupational saturation diving environment.,"OBJECTIVES: Occupational saturation divers have various skin disorders, of which skin infections are the most serious and frequent. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the microbe most often isolated from skin infections in divers. The purpose of the present work was (a) to report the occurrence of P aeruginosa in skin infections in operational saturation diving in the North Sea from 1987 to 1995; (b) to report the environmental occurrence of P aeruginosa in saturation diving systems, and finally (c) to identify possible relations between infection related to strains of P aeruginosa and environmental isolates of the microbe.
RESULTS: During the period 1987-95, P aeruginosa was isolated from 257 skin infections in operational saturation divers. Most of the isolates related to infection by P aeruginosa show a unique growth inhibition pattern towards the normal skin flora, and the serotype pattern of P aeruginosa from skin infections is limited compared with similar infections in non-divers. In a mini-epidemiological study on board one diving vessel during one operational diving period, five significantly different DNA fragment profiles were found among the 12 isolates related to infection by P aeruginosa obtained from the saturation system. In two cases the infectious genotypes were detected in the fresh water for the saturation chambers weeks before the arrival of the infected diver.
CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly used epidemiological marker for P aeruginosa world wide, also used in earlier studies, is serotyping, but with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) miniepidemiology it was shown to be insufficient for epidemiological purposes in saturation environments. PFGE analyses were shown to be superior both to antibacterial factor and to serotyping in epidemiological analyses of P aeruginosa infections in saturation diving.","['Ahlén C', 'Mandal LH', 'Iversen OJ']",1998,55,7,Occup Environ Med,"Ahlén C, et al.

9661749,The use of vascular flaps in middle ear surgery.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate improved surgical outcomes from middle and external ear surgery using local vascular flaps to enhance tissue healing.
STUDY DESIGN: The study design was a review of the design and clinical trials of three soft tissue flaps: the middle temporal flap (MTF), the middle temporal canal flap (MTCF), and the wing flap. All derive axial vascular supply from the middle temporal vessels.
SETTING: The study was performed at a single surgeon's private otologic practice.
PATIENTS: A total of 319 patients were treated from 1991-1996: MTF in 223, MTCF in 38, and wing flap in 58. The average case maturity was 2.25 years. Most cases were mastoidectomy reconstruction or intact canal wall mastoidectomy.
INTERVENTION: The flaps are used to introduce an improved blood supply to key repair sites in the middle and external ear.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Canal skin breakdown, chronic myringitis, and chronic otitis externa were measured.
RESULTS: Dehiscence rates fell from 15-5% and myringitis rates fell from 15-4%. Thicker, vascular canal skin was the usual result.

9656262,Primary care management of otitis externa.,"Otitis externa (OE) is an acute, painful inflammatory condition of the external auditory canal that affects all age groups and accounts for about half of all patients presenting with ear pain. Common causes are gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, fungi, and dermatologic conditions such as eczema, seborrhea, and psoriasis. Risk increases with prolonged exposure to heat and moisture, especially in those who swim frequently or live in a tropical climate. Treatment involves cleaning the canal thoroughly and instilling ototopical broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although OE is relatively benign and easy to treat in the primary care setting, it can have life-threatening complications, especially in diabetic and immunocompromised patients. This article reviews the differential diagnosis, outlines treatment, and discusses preventive measures. A patient-education sheet is provided.",['La Rosa S'],1998,23,6,Nurse Pract,"La Rosa S.

DESIGN: Prospective study.
ANIMALS: 650 dogs without history or clinical signs of otitis externa and 85 dogs with recurrent or chronic otitis externa.
PROCEDURE: Rectal temperature was measured, using a mercury thermometer. External ear canal temperature was measured, using an infrared tympanic thermometer.
RESULTS: Measurements of body temperature at the 2 sites did not agree. Sensitivity and specificity of infrared thermometry in detecting fever, as determined by rectal thermometry, were 69.7 and 84.6%, respectively. Use of methods to predict rectal temperature from EECT did not improve the accuracy of infrared thermometry. Otitis externa significantly influenced EECT.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Use of infrared thermometry as a replacement for rectal thermometry in assessing core body temperature in dogs was unsatisfactory. The 2 methods for measuring body temperature were not interchangeable in dogs.","['Huang HP', 'Shih HM']",1998,213,1,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Huang HP and Shih HM.

Primary and late results after operative treatment of this condition in 53 ears over 27 years are presented. Perioperative findings are described, and an outline of applied surgical technique is given. Six patients had bilateral involvement. The male-to-female ratio was 1:2, median age at surgery was 46 years, and the median follow-up period was 5 years (range, 4 mo to 13 y). In 11% of the cases, recurrent atresia developed. Early operation is recommended, because cholesteatoma behind the atresia was found in 9%. Hearing improvement has been considerable after removal of the atresia with primary closure of airbone gap within 20 dB in 90% of the cases.","['Becker BC', 'Tos M']",1998,108,6,Laryngoscope,Becker BC and Tos M.

STUDY DESIGN: This clinical study is a retrospective case report combined with a literature review.
SETTING: The patient was treated at the University Erasmus Hospital.
INTERVENTION: Diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomographic scan and histologic analysis. The treatment was surgical.
RESULTS: The patient underwent surgical treatment, and a locoregional relapse developed. The clinical evolution was in accordance with previous reports of extragonadal endodermal sinus tumor sites. The family refused chemotherapy, and the patient died 3 months after admission.
CONCLUSIONS: An endodermal sinus tumor is a malignant germ cell tumor that usually involves the gonadal tissue. Extragonadal sites are rare, and different hypotheses have been evoked to explain these locations. Treatment options include surgical removal and chemotherapy.

Its mortality rate was reported to be 53% when there is associated facial nerve paralysis. It usually affects elderly diabetic patients, who present with deep-seated pain and other features of non-resolving otitis externa. It is mostly caused by Pseudomonas (P) aeruginosa and the treatment of choice is anti-Pseudomonas antibiotic. A 64-year-old diabetic male patient is described who presented with left ear pain and discharge for two months and did not respond to ordinary treatment. The patient also noticed a progressive facial weakness on the same side. The clinical presentation, investigations, treatment and follow-up of the OEM are discussed on the basis of our case and the review of the literature. The diagnosis of OEM is based on high index of suspicion and confirmed by histopathologic changes and radionuclide studies.

9494146,An epidemic of Malassezia pachydermatis in an intensive care nursery associated with colonization of health care workers' pet dogs.,"BACKGROUND: Malassezia species are lipophilic yeasts that are emerging as nosocomial pathogens, particularly in low-birth-weight neonates who receive lipid emulsions. When a cluster of patients with Malassezia pachydermatis infection was identified in an intensive care nursery, we initiated an investigation.
METHODS: A case patient was defined as any infant in the intensive care nursery who had a positive culture for M. pachydermatis between October 17, 1993, and January 18, 1995. We conducted a cohort study to identify risk factors for colonization and infection with M. pachydermatis. We collected cultures from the infants and the health care workers and from the health care workers' pets, since this organism has been associated with otitis externa in dogs.
RESULTS: Fifteen infants met the case definition: eight with bloodstream infections, two with urinary tract infections, one with meningitis, and four with asymptomatic colonization. The case patients were significantly more likely than the other infants to weigh 1300 g or less (15 of 65 vs. 0 of 419, P<0.001). In a multivariate analysis of infants weighing 1300 g or less, the independent risk factors for colonization or infection with M. pachydermatis were a greater severity of concomitant illness (odds ratio, 19.7; P=0.001), arterial catheterization for nine or more days (odds ratio, 29.5; P=0.027), and exposure to Nurse A (odds ratio, 74.7; P=0.004). In a point-prevalence survey, 9 additional infants, 1 health care worker, and 12 of the health care workers' pet dogs had positive cultures for M. pachydermatis. The isolates from all 15 case patients, the 9 additional colonized infants, 1 health care worker, and 3 of the 12 dogs had identical patterns of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: In this outbreak, it is likely that M. pachydermatis was introduced into the intensive care nursery on health care workers' hands after being colonized from pet dogs at home. The organism persisted in the nursery through patient-to-patient transmission.","['Chang HJ', 'Miller HL', 'Watkins N', 'Arduino MJ', 'Ashford DA', 'Midgley G', 'Aguero SM', 'Pinto-Powell R', 'von Reyn CF', 'Edwards W', 'McNeil MM', 'Jarvis WR']",1998,338,11,N Engl J Med,"Chang HJ, et al.

9491161,Microbial flora and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolated pathogens from the horizontal ear canal and middle ear in dogs with otitis media.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare microbial flora and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolated pathogens from the horizontal ear canal and middle ear in dogs with otitis media.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
ANIMALS: 23 dogs with chronic bilateral otitis externa.
PROCEDURES: Swab specimens of the horizontal ear canal and middle ear were obtained for cytologic analysis, bacterial culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Integrity of the tympanic membrane was observed. If the tympanic membrane was intact, myringotomy was performed to collect specimens.
RESULTS: Otitis media was diagnosed in 38 of 46 (82.6%) ears evaluated. The tympanic membrane was intact in 71.1% of the ears with otitis media. The 3 most common organisms isolated from the horizontal ear canal and middle ear were Staphylococcus intermedius, yeast, and Pseudomonas spp. A difference in total isolates or susceptibility patterns between the horizontal ear canal and middle ear was found in 34 (89.5%) ears. Compared with results of bacterial culture, cytologic examination of swab specimens was not as effective for detection of rods and cocci from the middle ear.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In dogs with chronic otitis externa, otitis media often exists even when there is an intact tympanic membrane. In our study, the same isolates were rarely found in the horizontal ear canal and middle ear. Therefore, to choose appropriate antimicrobial agents, in addition to cytologic examination, bacterial culture and susceptibility testing of swab specimens from the horizontal ear canal and middle ear should be performed.","['Cole LK', 'Kwochka KW', 'Kowalski JJ', 'Hillier A']",1998,212,4,J Am Vet Med Assoc,"Cole LK, et al.

9371879,The value of quantitative gallium-67 single-photon emission tomography in the clinical management of malignant external otitis.,"Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a severe infectious disorder usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which most frequently affects diabetic patients. Due to its rarity, the diagnosis of MEO is often not made promptly. Extension into deeper structures or chronic osteomyelitis may occur without signs of infection on local clinical examination. Of the imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging provides a fairly adequate picture of the spread of the disease, but, as with computed tomography (CT) scanning and bone scintigraphy, the images remain unchanged for a long time after disease regression. The objective of this study was to establish whether quantitative gallium-67 single-photon emission tomography (SPET) represents an accurate method for the assessment of infection and, moreover, for the monitoring of therapeutic effect. Eight patients (five males, three females) with the clinical diagnosis of MEO were studied. In three patients antibiotic treatment was prolonged for several weeks because visual analysis of gallium scintigraphy still showed slightly increased uptake in the affected area on the first follow-up scan. In one patient, it was decided to stop antibiotic treatment despite a slight increase in uptake on the second follow-up scan. Lesion to non-lesion (L/NL) ratios obtained from 67Ga SPET images at initial diagnosis and during follow-up were assessed in correlation with clinical and biochemical data and with the results of CT scans. In addition to a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), all patients showed increased uptake on the affected side, with L/NL ratios ranging from 1.4 to 3.6 at the time of diagnosis. CT scans failed to demonstrate abnormalities in four patients. Including four scans demonstrating slightly increased uptake in the affected area, L/NL ratios after 6-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment were 1.0+/-0.1. Despite a persistently elevated ESR in the majority of patients, none of them demonstrated local recurrence or complications during follow-up. In all patients, leucocyte count was within the normal range throughout the course. No relation was found between the slightly increased uptake on the follow-up scans and surgical treatment. It is concluded that in addition to the visual analysis of 67Ga SPET imaging, L/NL ratios should be calculated for a more accurate assessment of disease activity in MEO. Despite visually slightly increased uptake, L/NL ratios of 1.0+/-0.1 during follow-up are highly indicative of complete recovery, regardless of ESR values or leucocytosis.

The mean thresholds were 0 to 10 dB for air-conducted stimuli and 50 to 60 dB for bone-conducted stimuli. The wave forms and inter-peak latencies of the waves of the auditory evoked responses elicited by air-conducted and bone-conducted stimuli were similar. This indicated that the signals had the same origin and thus both the air-conducted and the bone-conducted responses could be considered to be auditory responses. Measurement of air-conducted and bone-conducted brain stem-evoked responses in five dogs with bilateral chronic obstructive ear disease revealed thresholds of 50 to 60 dB for air-conducted stimuli and 60 to 70 dB for bone-conducted stimuli. By comparison of these results with those in the 11 young dogs, it could be concluded that there was hearing loss other than that caused by obstruction of the ear canals.","['Wolschrijn CF', 'Venker-van Haagen AJ', 'van den Brom WE']",1997,19,4,Vet Q,"Wolschrijn CF, et al.

DESIGN: Two randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter trials, 1 each in children and adults.
SETTING: Twenty-three primary care and referral ambulatory care sites per trial.
PATIENTS: A total of 314 adults (12 years and older) and 287 children (younger than 12 years). Of the total, data for 247 adults and 227 children were considered clinically evaluable (CE), and those for 98 children and 98 adults were microbiologically evaluable (ME).
INTERVENTIONS: Ofloxacin (adults, 0.5 mL; children, 0.25 mL) twice daily or Cortisporin (adults, 0.2 mL; children, 0.15 mL) 4 times daily for 10 days.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CE subjects were cured if all signs and symptoms resolved at posttherapy (days 11-13) and test-of-cure (days 17-20) visits. The ME subjects had microbiological and clinical successes if they were cured and had microbiological eradication or presumed eradication.
RESULTS: Cure was observed in 82% and 97% of CE adults and children treated with ofloxacin and 84% and 95% of CE adults and children treated with Cortisporin, respectively. The most common pathogens at the pretherapy visit were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacilli. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical or microbiological and clinical cure or in the rates of adverse events between treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin given twice daily is as safe and effective as Cortisporin given 4 times daily for otitis externa.

9322176,Effects of otitis on hearing in dogs characterised by brainstem auditory evoked response testing.,"Hearing function was measured in normal dogs and in dogs with otitis using brainstem auditory evoked response testing. Data were obtained from 86 normal ears and from 105 ears with otitis, categorised into four degrees of severity. The data were analysed to illustrate the differences between the hearing function in the normal and abnormal ears and to estimate the degree of impairment associated with differing degrees of pathology. While severe hearing loss seemed to be present in the dogs with more severe otitis, only two individuals were identified as being totally deaf in the affected ears and no dogs were identified in which the cleaning and examination processes had caused damage to hearing function. Cleaning the ear canal produced measurable improvements in hearing in several dogs, indicating the profound effect of physical obstruction of the external ear canal by debris. It is concluded that most dogs with chronic otitis externa are not totally deaf and that the hearing impairment that does occur has the characteristics of conductive hearing loss.","['Eger CE', 'Lindsay P']",1997,38,9,J Small Anim Pract,Eger CE and Lindsay P.

In this study the sensitivity patterns in bacteria and yeasts isolated as aetiological agents from otitis externa were analysed. Antifungal and antibacterial activity tests were done using the automated system ATB Fungus and the classic diffusion test respectively. The azole compounds had the greatest antifungal properties, while beta-lactams had the strongest antibiotic activity. This study reflects the increasing importance of sensitivity tests in chronic otitis externa due to the increasing antimicrobial resistances in bacteria and yeasts. If it is necessary to initiate an empiric treatment before the results of the antimicrobial test, the application of miconazole or econazole for yeasts and oxacillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against bacteria is recommended.","['Guedeja-Marron J', 'Blanco JL', 'Garcia ME']",1997,44,6,Zentralbl Veterinarmed B,"Guedeja-Marron J, et al.

We recount a case of pityriasis rubra pilaris in an HIV-seropositive man. A 36-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis and recurrent otitis externa had diffuse psoriaform erythroderma. He was treated initially with methotrexate and isoretinoin without clinical improvement. Skin examination showed large, erythematous, orange, scaly patches on the upper extremities and thickening of the nail beds. The palms and soles were hyperkeratotic. Skin biopsy revealed changes that were consistent with pityriasis rubra pilaris. Six months before the onset of symptoms, results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western Blot assay for HIV were negative. Six months after symptoms, results of repeat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blots for HIV were positive (CD4+ T-cell count = 200 cells/ mm3). Clinical course had been complicated by episodes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and development of localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The increased severity of pityriasis rubra pilaris should prompt clinicians to consider coinfection with HIV in patients who have disease that is refractory to treatment. Clinicians also should remain vigilant for the development of squamous cell carcinoma.","['Bonomo RA', 'Korman N', 'Nagashima-Whalen L', 'Briggs J', 'Graham R', 'Salata RA']",1997,314,2,Am J Med Sci,"Bonomo RA, et al.

Data were collected in a retrospective case-control study from June to October in 1993 and over the same period in 1994. Patients who had OE diagnosed by a general practitioner were included. In 1993 controls were 134 guests from 27 holiday houses where nobody got o.e. during their stay. The number of cases was 35. In 1994 the design was changed so that controls were the 95 healthy inhabitants from the same houses as the 23 cases. The amounts of time spent in the pools and the total bacteria count in the water were significant risk factors for developing OE.

It can be isolated in 20-50% from normal ear cerumen specimen from dogs or cats and has an even higher prevalence in non-suppurative otitis externa in animal species such as these. The genus Malassezia contains the two species M. furfur, a mainly anthropophilic fungus which physiologically occurs on human skin, and M. pachydermatis. We performed Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)-testings of 40 clinical isolates of M. pachydermatis against climbazole (CLIM), clotrimazole (CLOT) and silver-sulphadiazine (SILV). While CLOT and CLIM are broad-spectrum antimycotics of the azole-type, SILV is a sulphonamide compound with antibacterial and antimycotic properties used topically in veterinary medicine. For CLIM, the range of MICs was between < 0.06 and 1 micrograms/ml with an empirical median mean of 0.06 microgram/ml; for CLOT the range was between < 0.06 and 32 micrograms/ml (mean = 4 micrograms/ml), respectively. The MICs for SILV ranged between 0.25 and > 64 micrograms/ml (mean = 16 micrograms/ml) against all tested strains. In conclusion, the two azole-antimycotics CLIM and CLOT showed good in vitro activity against M. pachydermatis. The activity of CLIM was even higher than that of CLOT, which might be due to the better water solubility of CLIM.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study of variations in treating acute external otitis by otolaryngologists and primary care practitioners.
SETTING: Community-based independent otolaryngology practices.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with external otitis treated by otolaryngologists in Project Solo, a nonprofit, grassroots organization of independent physicians united for quality, patient advocacy, and cost containment.
METHODS: Confidential (bar-coded), disease-specific outcomes questionnaires completed by patients (12 items) and by participating physicians (15 items). Response to treatment was measured with a follow-up patient questionnaire (3 items).
RESULTS: Nine patients were recruited from 5 of 29 enrolled otolaryngologists. Primary care practitioners were more likely to prescribe oral antimicrobials than otolaryngologists (100% vs. 44%, p = 0.03), but less likely to insert a wick in the external auditory canal (11% vs. 78%, p = 0.02). Poor recruitment was caused by an overly long and complex survey, data collection at multiple time points, lack of time during office hours, cumbersome data collection requirements, inadequate ongoing communication, and a lack of enthusiasm for the project.
CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts at implementing a multisite outcomes study will require shorter questionnaires, smoother integration of the survey process with regular office flow, simplified procedures for data exchange, frequent communication with data collection sites, and motivational programs for participating physicians and their office staff.","['Isenberg SF', 'Rosenfeld RM']",1997,116,6 Pt 1,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Isenberg SF and Rosenfeld RM.

Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 26 of 59 dogs and included ipsilateral facial palsy, incision swelling, vestibular signs, premature drain removal, and one dog died of aspiration pneumonia. Long-term (> 6 months) complications were identified in 12 of 50 dogs and included dermatitis of the medial aspect of the pinna, chronic fistula formation, and permanent facial paralysis. No association between immediate or long term complications and method of closure was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary closure is an acceptable alternative in dogs undergoing TECA-LBO when surgical wound dead space can be managed with meticulous hemostasis, complete debridement of devitalized tissue, and accurate apposition of tissue planes.","['Devitt CM', 'Seim HB', 'Willer R', 'McPherron M', 'Neely M']",1997,26,3,Vet Surg,"Devitt CM, et al.

9149820,Postinflammatory medial canal fibrosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe the diagnosis and treatment of postinflammatory medial canal fibrosis by reviewing a large series.
STUDY DESIGN: This study was conducted via retrospective chart review.
SETTING: This study was conducted at a tertiary otologic referral center.
PATIENTS: The 24 patients had a clinical diagnosis of postinflammatory medial canal stenosis. Only one of the 16 females and eight males was under 18 years of age, and the mean age for the group was 50.5 years (range 5-78). fourteen patients had bilateral diseases.
INTERVENTION: Surgical therapy was performed in 14 ears (11 patients), and medical therapy was performed in nine.
RESULTS: For patients undergoing surgical treatment, mean pure-tone average hearing threshold improved from 37 dB preoperatively to 26 dB postoperatively. The air-bone gap improved from 24 dB to 15 dB. There were three recurrences of disease in the surgery group.
CONCLUSION: Postinflammatory medial canal stenosis is a rare disorder resulting from chronic external otitis that required surgical intervention to correct the resulting conductive hearing loss.","['Slattery WH', 'Saadat P']",1997,18,3,Am J Otol,Slattery WH and Saadat P.

9138241,Efficacy of hyposensitization in feline allergic diseases based upon results of in vitro testing for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E.,"A survey was undertaken to evaluate the responses to hyposensitization in cats for which a diagnosis of allergic disease was made by assessment of clinical signs and evaluation of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) using the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). Eighty-one cases were available for analysis. In 39 cases, a dietary change resulted in some subjective improvement, which usually was minimal; however, some cases had significant improvement. In 75.3% of cases, an improvement of at least 50% was noted and ascribed to a combination of immunotherapy and dietary change, when implemented. The response of the 42 cases in which immunotherapy alone was used or where there was no response to dietary change was broadly similar. Response of the specific dermatological conditions ranged from 93.6% in the case of linear granuloma to 60% in cases where self-induced hair loss was evident. Response also was good in cases of presumed allergic asthma (86.1% improvement) and suspected allergic otitis externa (62.6% improvement). In nine patients, the hyposensitization was discontinued due to lack of response. The results suggest that confirmation of a suspected diagnosis of allergic disease in cats by means of in vitro tests and subsequent therapy with hyposensitization should be a major consideration in feline practice.",['Halliwell RE'],1997,33,3,J Am Anim Hosp Assoc,Halliwell RE.

The patient population was significantly younger and nondiabetic. Granulation tissue was usually absent from the external auditory canal and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not the predominant pathologic organism. Also, outcome was found to be significantly worse. Thus a high index of suspicion must be entertained and vigorous local and systemic treatment initiated early in the course of disease to achieve a satisfactory outcome.","['Ress BD', 'Luntz M', 'Telischi FF', 'Balkany TJ', 'Whiteman ML']",1997,107,4,Laryngoscope,"Ress BD, et al.

9065883,New combination for the therapy of canine otitis externa. II. Efficacy in vitro and in vivo.,"A new, effective drug combination was developed for the therapy of canine otitis externa (OE) by taking into consideration the microorganisms most frequently isolated from dogs affected with OE, their combination, their drug sensitivity and the type and incidence of ear canal inflammation. The antimycotic active ingredient of the combination is ketoconazole, its antibacterial component is gentamicin sulphate, while its antiphlogistic constituent is mazipredone hydrochloride. Based upon the results of in vitro pharmacodynamic tests, the antifungal activity of the combination is superior to that of ketoconazole used alone at the same concentration. A total of 210 dogs affected with OE were treated with the combination: 94.2 per cent of them became clinically symptomless and microbiologically negative in an average of 8.5 days. No adverse reactions were observed in connection with the use of the drug combination. The therapeutic results can be attributed to the high antifungal efficacy of the combination demonstrated in vitro and to the favourable properties of the solvent mixture.","['Kiss G', 'Radványi S', 'Szigeti G', 'Lukáts B', 'Nagy G']",1997,38,2,J Small Anim Pract,"Kiss G, et al.

OE was erythematous-ceruminous in 83 per cent and suppurative in 17 per cent of the patient material. Erythematous-ceruminous inflammations were characterised by severe pruritus and accumulation of brownish, greasy cerumen in the auditory canal. The yeast Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from the ears of 76 per cent of the dogs, often in combination with Staphylococcus intermedius bacteria. M pachydermatis showed the most sensitivity, in decreasing order of efficacy, to ketoconazole, econazole, clotrimazole, miconazole and nystatin. S intermedius isolates were most sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalexin and gentamicin. The microorganism most frequently isolated from dogs with suppurative OE was Pseudomonas aeruginosa; in some cases Proteus, Streptococcus and Pasteurella were also isolated.

9494627,Acupuncture enhances the efficacy of antibiotics treatment for canine otitis crises.,"External bacterial otitis is a very frequent dog's recurrent complaint and should be useful for studying acupuncture effects in infectious disease. Conventional treatment based on antibiotics, washes and bactericidal ointments, solves most cases within 1 to 6 weeks. To establish if the well known effect of this conventional treatment could be modified by acupuncture as additional treatment, a comparative randomized placebo controlled study was performed. From a sample of 25 dogs, two groups were selected at random. In addition to a conventional treatment, each group also received real acupuncture or placebo acupuncture. A veterinarian M.D. and the animal's owner evaluated at blind, through a Visual Analogous Scale, (VAS) the clinical signs and symptoms of otitis. The results show a significant difference in the complete recovery time (p < 0.01); in the disappearance period of the pain (p < 0.01) in the disappearance period of the secretion (p < 0.001) and in the animal's owner evaluation of symptoms (p < 0.001) by 6th. day of treatment. These results suggest that acupuncture stimulates animal defensive systems increasing the conventional treatment effect, which seems to work mainly against the invading agent while acupuncture seems to act by reinforcing the host's defensive barriers. Combination of both shows a synergistic effect capable of empowering the anti-infectious therapy. A three months follow-up revealed all animals were without symptoms. Further evaluation of both groups after a one year follow up will allow us to establish if relapse incidence is also modified by acupuncture, and the potential usefulness of this complementary treatment on recurrent infectious pathology.","['Sánchez-Araujo M', 'Puchi A']",1997,22,3-4,Acupunct Electrother Res,Sánchez-Araujo M and Puchi A.

The diversity of M pachydermatis isolates obtained from a wide range of hosts was investigated by the partial sequencing of the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA. Among 100 isolates examined, seven types (Ia-Ig) were discriminated on the basis of nucleotide sequence diversity. The seven types differed by one to five mutations, all of them corresponding to transitions. The predominant sequence, type Ia, appeared to be ubiquitous since it was observed in isolates recovered from domestic and wild carnivora, from a monkey and from man. In contrast the sequence types Ic, Id and Ig seemed to be more host-specific; they included isolates recovered exclusively from rhinoceros, dogs and ferrets, respectively. None of the seven sequence types correlated with isolation from healthy skin or a particular lesion (otitis externa or other dermatitis).

The EAC was later evaluated regarding the color of the skin, swelling and the presence of fluid. Within 1 day all rats developed an external otitis that was characterized by a red, swollen ear canal containing an opalescent fluid. The tympanic membrane and middle ear cavity appeared to be normal. No healed EACs were seen within the initial 10 days of follow-up and 4 of 6 rats still exhibited external otitis at day 21. Light microscopy of biopsy specimens revealed pronounced edema of the dermis of the ear canal. Mast cells were more numerous in the early phase of the otitis present, although very few inflammatory cells were found in tissues despite the marked inflammatory reaction produced. Findings show that this animal model for external otitis can be used to investigate pathogenesis as well as to test various treatment strategies.","['Emgård P', 'Hellström S']",1997,254,3,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,Emgård P and Hellström S.

Canalplasty is an eclectic collection of techniques designed to recreate a patent and trouble-free external canal. Despite the large number of etiologies, the principles of canalplasty are the same. The goal is the creation of a widely patent and physiologically intact canal wall. Both the bony and cartilaginous portions must be addressed surgically. Care should be taken to preserve the normal skin and adnexa for lining the canal, but if this is not adequate, skin grafts should be used to prevent healing by secondary intent.

8879762,Microbiology and laboratory diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections.,"In the article that follows, Carroll and Reimer address a number of issues related to the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections. These syndromes occur with great frequency in both adults and children and have tremendous economic impact, related not only to lost productivity in the workplace but also to the frequent prescription by physicians of antibiotics, even when the etiologic agents of infection almost certainly are not bacteria. Most of these infections are diagnosed clinically, and specimens for microbiological identification are not obtained. Indeed, the difficulty in obtaining microbiological specimens that are not contaminated by resident colonizing flora often results in laboratory culture reports of dubious clinical value. As the authors note, the most standardized procedures are for the diagnosis of pharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes. The preferred culture methods are reviewed as are the sensitivities, specificities, and limitations of rapid direct tests for group A streptococcal antigens. Currently, as the authors emphasize, a negative direct test mandates a conventional culture for S. pyogenes. More problematic are requests for isolation of other streptococci, Haemophilus species, corynebacteria, and gram-negative bacteria. Given limited resources, cost-containment imperatives, and the absence of clear evidence that these organisms are pharyngeal pathogens associated with important sequelae, my laboratory does not attempt to isolate these bacteria unless the ordering physician has directly consulted with me (the laboratory director). Carroll and Reimer emphasize that nasopharyngeal cultures have no place in the microbiological diagnosis of otitis media and that diagnostic tympanocentesis is the only procedure for obtaining specimens that yield reliable microbiological findings. They also point out the futility of using swabs to obtain material for the diagnosis of otitis externa, since the external auditory canal cannot be decontaminated sufficiently to obtain a meaningful culture result. Finally, the authors address the available methods for obtaining specimens to establish the etiology of sinusitis. For microbiological diagnosis, direct antral puncture has been the method of choice for many years. However, otorhinolaryngologists now obtain many specimens endoscopically. It probably is not possible to obtain specimens by this method without contamination by normal upper respiratory flora. Thus, results of cultures of endoscopic specimens are more difficult to interpret. For patients with complicated illnesses, use of the diagnostic ""gold standard"" of antral puncture, as well as biopsy with histopathologic correlation, should be encouraged.","['Carroll K', 'Reimer L']",1996,23,3,Clin Infect Dis,Carroll K and Reimer L.

8879109,Comparison of three methods for relief of pain after ear canal ablation in dogs.,"This study compared three methods of pain relief in dogs that had total ear canal ablation with lateral bulla osteotomy. The hypothesis was that systemic opioids with preoperative local nerve blocks would provide superior pain relief. Thirty-one dogs with chronic otitis externa were included in the study. Dogs were randomly assigned to one of three protocols: systemic opioids alone (10 dogs, group 1), systemic opioids with bupivacaine splash block (11 dogs, group 2), and systemic opioids with preoperative local bupivacaine nerve blocks (10 dogs, group 3). Twenty-one dogs had bilateral ear ablation and 10 had unilateral ablation. Pain was assessed preoperatively, at extubation, 2 hours postextubation, and 1 day postoperatively by a single observer blinded to the analgesic protocol used. Pain scores were not significantly different within or between groups, nor did unilateral versus bilateral ablation have a significant effect on the score. Mean scores were less than 3 (scale 1 to 5) for all groups at all observation times. Rough recoveries were noted in 30% of group 1 dogs, 0% of group 2, and 20% of group 3 dogs. Ninety-four percent of dogs were moderately to heavily sedated at extubation. Sixty percent of group 3 dogs remained moderately to heavily sedated 2 hours postextubation. Rectal temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and postoperative change in serum cortisol levels were not significantly different between groups. Postoperative increase in blood glucose was significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 compared with preoperative levels. Twenty-three percent of the dogs required additional analgesia or tranquilization after surgery, as determined by the anesthetist; 1 dog in group 1, 2 in group 2, and 4 in group 3. Each of the three analgesic protocols provided similar pain relief in dogs undergoing total ear canal ablation.","['Buback JL', 'Boothe HW', 'Carroll GL', 'Green RW']",1996,25,5,Vet Surg,"Buback JL, et al.

8870934,Exostoses of the external auditory canal in Oregon surfers.,"PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to determine the cold water exposure necessary to produce exostoses of the external auditory canal in individuals who predominantly surf along the Oregon and/or the northern California coastline and to ascertain from surfers' otologic histories symptoms attributable to exostoses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Free ear examinations were provided at two surf shops in northern Oregon. The ear canals were examined with an otoscope, and each surfer was given a summary score indicating the percentage of both canals that was obstructed by exostoses. Surfers were then categorized according to the number of years surfing and the number of sessions surfing per year.
RESULTS: Twenty-one surfers met our criteria for analysis. The degree of ear canal obstruction significantly increased with increasing number of years surfing (P < .001) and with increasing number of sessions surfing per year (P < .01). The median summary scores were 7.5, 63.0, and 93.0 for individuals who respectively surfed between 1 and 5 years, between 6 and 15 years, and greater than 15 years. The median summary scores were 10.0 for individuals who surfed 50 sessions or less per year versus 87.5 for individuals who surfed greater than 50 sessions per year. Most surfers with exostoses had minimal complaints. Only one patient had a history of surgical treatment.
CONCLUSION: Individuals who surf 5 years or less are unlikely to develop exostoses unless they are surfing greater than 50 sessions per year. Exostoses are typically a benign malady that do not require surgical therapy.","['Deleyiannis FW', 'Cockcroft BD', 'Pinczower EF']",1996,17,5,Am J Otolaryngol,"Deleyiannis FW, et al.

Lesions of the external ear and the external auditory canal (external acoustic meatus) are significant and common. Patients with such a history should have a thorough basic examination, which can be done with simple tools. Symptoms of hearing loss, otalgia, otorrhea, tinnitus, aural fullness, vertigo, and facial weakness may warrant referral of the patient to an otolaryngologist. The crux of preventing worsening otologic sequelae is early detection and treatment.","['Ostrowski VB', 'Wiet RJ']",1996,100,3,Postgrad Med,"Ostrowski VB and Wiet RJ.

8869614,Malignant otitis externa in HIV and AIDS.,"Malignant otitis externa is a necrotising infection of the external ear canal which may spread to include the mastoid and petrous parts of the temporal bone, leading to skull base osteomyelitis. It is almost exclusively caused by infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and usually occurs in elderly non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. However isolated cases have been reported in a small number of non-diabetic patients, particularly in children who are immunocompromised due to malignancy, malnutrition and severe anaemia. In 1984 a case of malignant otitis externa was reported in a child with an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-like illness, prior to identification of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since that time further sporadic cases of this invasive infection have been reported in HIV and AIDS. We present two further cases and also a review of the current literature.","['Hern JD', 'Almeyda J', 'Thomas DM', 'Main J', 'Patel KS']",1996,110,8,J Laryngol Otol,"Hern JD, et al.

8703384,Pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa. A particular variety of the bacteria?,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa rarely affects the epithelium in healthy persons except for the external ear canal, raising the possibility that P aeruginosa in otitis externa is a specific variety that displays particular characteristics.
DESIGN: A cohort study was designed to outline distinct characteristics of P aeruginosa in otitis externa compared with P aeruginosa in other infections. The study period was October 1, 1994, to March 27, 1995.
PATIENTS: Isolates of P aeruginosa from nonhospitalized patients were collected at the bacteriological laboratory at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; there were 53 strains of P aeruginosa isolated from otitis externa and 59 strains of P aeruginosa from varicose ulcers and urinary tract infections.
METHODS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was characterized by pigmentation, growth habits, production of mucoid, and biochemical characteristics.
RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa produced less pyocyanin and less urease and exhibited no mucoid-producing strains.
CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa displayed fewer of the usual biochemical features of the species than did the strains isolated from other infections. Some of these features, such as the production of pyocyanin, are influenced by nutritional factors; strains found in otitis externa probably represent the type of strains present in the natural habitat in water, as opposed to the strains that have adapted to the environment of other human infections. Increased knowledge of the characteristics of the strains found in otitis externa is important in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and why P aeruginosa is the dominant infectious agent in otitis externa.","['Sundström J', 'Jacobson K', 'Munck-Wikland E', 'Ringertz S']",1996,122,8,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Sundström J, et al.

Microscopically, the strains could be subdivided into two phenotypes. All M. pachydermatis strains grew well on Sabouraud glucose, yeast morphology and modified malt extract agar, but formed two distinct colony types. All strains were characterized by no fermentation. Assimilation of glucose, mannitol (42 strains), sorbitol (40 strains) and peptone was observed, but no ethanol assimilation. Urease and catalase tests were positive, while indole and acetoin production was not detected. All strains showed proteinase, caseinase, lecithinase and peroxidase positivity but to varying extents. Esterase activity was observed for all Malassezia strains when using Tween 20, 40 and 60, whereas Tween 80 was hydrolysed by only 42 strains. No coagulase or haemagglutinating activities were detected. When compared for satellite phenomenon and vitamin requirements, some Malassezia strains could not grow in the absence of nicotinic acid but grew well in the presence of staphylococci. In susceptibility tests, all strains showed the highest susceptibility to ketoconazole. On the basis of the biochemical differences, M. pachydermatis seems to be a heterogeneous species and can be divided into two groups.","['Kiss G', 'Radványi S', 'Szigeti G']",1996,39,7-8,Mycoses,"Kiss G, et al.

All ear swabs from 1992-1994 in our unit were reviewed to ascertain the prevalence of the commonly isolated organisms. Fresh isolates of these organisms were collected and plated onto agar with wells of glycerol, ichthammol and a combination of both as used in clinical practice. The diameters of the zones of inhibition observed after incubation were measured in millimetres. Common isolates were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabalis, Streptococcus pyogenes in descending order of frequency. Pure glycerol showed no significant zones of inhibition against any of the organisms tested. The average zones of inhibition for G & I and ichthammol alone were for Staphylococcus aureus 15 mm and 18 mm and for Streptococcus pyogenes: 16 mm and 23 mm. Ichthammol alone was significantly more effective than G & I (p < 0.001). There was no significant activity against Proteus mirabalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic benefit of G & I is due in part to the inherent anti-bacterial activity of ichthammol against the Gram positive organisms as well as its anti-inflammatory action and the dehydrating effect of the glycerol.","['Nilssen E', 'Wormald PJ', 'Oliver S']",1996,110,4,J Laryngol Otol,"Nilssen E, et al.

We describe the treatment of 15 patients with VREF infection with quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500), a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic. Primary infections treated were bacteremia (4), urinary tract (4), intraabdominal (5), otitis externa (1), and meningitis (1). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for quinupristin/dalfopristin ranged from 0.5 microgram/ml or less to 2 micrograms/ml, and minimum bactericidal concentrations were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for all VREF isolates tested. Peak serum inhibitory titers following infusion of quinupristin/dalfopristin ranged from 1:8 to 1:64; all bactericidal titers were less than 1:2. Development of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin during therapy was not observed.

8929671,Malignant external otitis: review and personal experience.,"Malignant external otitis (MEO) is an infrequent but severe infective disorder, generally due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which most often affects elderly diabetics patients. The clinical features rarely permit exact diagnosis of MEO to be made promptly, and initially at least they are difficult to distinguish from those of external otitis. This explains the frequent delay in diagnosis with respect to the onset of symptoms. Physical examination almost always reveals the presence of aspecific granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, while the most common laboratory finding is raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Imaging has great diagnostic relevance: CT and MRI are very useful for spatial resolution, while radionuclide scanning and, in our experience, SPECT are superior for detecting early osteitis and monitoring response to therapy. We present an extensive review of the literature and our personal experience. In particular, we stress the relevance of immunological study of MEO patients: all our 4 patients had defective immune defences. As regards therapy, like other authors we underline the fundamental importance of long-term antibiotic treatment. The availability of quinolones and latest generation cephalosporins has greatly simplified the choice of antibiotic treatment, although clinicians should be aware of the possibility of drug-resistant bacterial strains.","['Amorosa L', 'Modugno GC', 'Pirodda A']",1996,521,,Acta Otolaryngol Suppl,"Amorosa L, et al.

8694118,The use of the temporoparietal fascial flap in temporal bone reconstruction.,"After routine canal wall down mastoidectomy, local muscle flaps with and without bone paté, cartilage and fascia are the standard techniques available to otologists wishing to obliterate the mastoid and reconstruct the external auditory canal. Reconstructive options for temporal bone defects after extirpative surgery for cancer, osteoradionecrosis, and revision surgery for chronic granulomatous otitis media, however, are few. Although the neighboring temporoparietal fascia flap (TPFF), based on the superficial temporal vessels, has been frequently employed for auricular reconstruction, its versatility in temporal bone reconstruction has not been widely explored. The TPFF has recently been employed at our institution in 11 patients who presented with a variety of reconstructive problems, including defects after temporal bone resection, surgery for malignant otitis externa, and revision mastoid surgery. Follow-up in these patients ranged from 1 to 43 months (average 18.4 months) and surgical objectives of achieving a dry mastoid bowl, fully epithelialized canal, and/or reduction of mastoid cavity volume was attained in 100% of cases. The TPFF offers many advantages to the otologic surgeon when faced with reconstruction dilemmas that center around a poorly vascularized mastoid cavity and temporal bone. The TPFF is a reliable source of local well-vascularized tissue that is extremely pliable and facilitates both hearing and nonhearing preservation temporal bone reconstruction.","['Cheney ML', 'Megerian CA', 'Brown MT', 'McKenna MJ', 'Nadol JB']",1996,17,1,Am J Otol,"Cheney ML, et al.

8634862,"Aetiology, prevalence and diagnosis of deafness in dogs and cats.","Peripheral deafness may be inherited or acquired, congenital or later-onset, and sensorineural or conductive. The most commonly observed forms are inherited congenital sensorineural, acquired later-onset sensorineural (ototoxicity, presbycusis) and acquired later-onset conductive (chronic otitis externa/media). In most dog and cat breeds inherited congenital sensorineural deafness results from perinatal degeneration of the stria vascularis, the vascular bed of the outer wall of the cochlear duct, which leads to hair cell degeneration. The strial degeneration appears to result from the absence of melanocytes, but their function in this structure is unknown. Ototoxicity may result from any of a large number of drugs and chemicals that directly or indirectly destroy cochlear hair cells. The effects are dose-dependent and in rare cases reversible. The most commonly recognized ototoxic drugs are the aminoglycoside antibiotics. Presbycusis, the ageing-related progressive hearing loss unattributable to other causes, is sensorineural but may also include mechanical changes in the tympanum and ossicles. Hearing aids may be accepted by some dogs as long as some residual function remains. Breeds reported to have been affected by congenital sensorineural deafness are listed and those with the highest prevalence are noted.

8520277,Risk of otitis externa after swimming in recreational fresh water lakes containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an outbreak of otitis externa was due to bathing in recreational fresh water lakes and to establish whether the outbreak was caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the water.
DESIGN: Matched case-control study.
SETTING: The Achterhoek area, the Netherlands.
SUBJECTS: 98 cases with otitis externa and 149 controls matched for age, sex, and place of residence.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios for type of swimming water and frequency of swimming; presence of P aeruginosa in ear swabs and fresh water lakes.
RESULTS: Otitis externa was strongly associated with swimming in recreational fresh water lakes in the previous two weeks (odds ratio 15.5 (95% confidence interval) 4.9 to 49.2) compared with non-swimming). The risk increased with the number of days of swimming, and subjects with recurrent ear disease had a greatly increased risk. The lakes met the Dutch bathing water standards and those set by the European Commission for faecal pollution in the summer of 1994, but P aeruginosa was isolated from all of them, as well as from the ear swabs of 78 (83%) of the cases and 3 (4%) of the controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Even when current bathing water standards are met, swimming can be associated with a substantial risk of otitis externa because of exposure to P aeruginosa. People with recurrent ear disease should take special care when swimming in waters containing P aeruginosa.","['van Asperen IA', 'de Rover CM', 'Schijven JF', 'Oetomo SB', 'Schellekens JF', 'van Leeuwen NJ', 'Collé C', 'Havelaar AH', 'Kromhout D', 'Sprenger MW']",1995,311,7017,BMJ,"van Asperen IA, et al.

To study the physiological roles of the individual isoforms, we have disrupted the mouse Ptgs1 gene encoding COX-1. Homozygous Ptgs1 mutant mice survive well, have no gastric pathology, and show less indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration than wild-type mice, even though their gastric prostaglandin E2 levels are about 1% of wild type. The homozygous mutant mice have reduced platelet aggregation and a decreased inflammatory response to arachidonic acid, but not to tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate.

Treatment consists of careful and frequent cleaning and application of topical medication to the outer ear canal and prescription of medication against pain. Systemic antibiotics are only rarely necessary and are indicated if perichondritis or lymphadenitis are present. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by eczema of the outer ear canal. Allergies, systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, and manipulation by the patient must be ruled out. Therapy includes the application of topical steroid solutions. The natural pH of the skin can be reestablished by use of diluted acetic acid solutions.

Aspergillus flavus was identified from a nonhealing surgical wound of the ear undergoing cartilaginous necrosis in an immunocompetent host.
OBJECTIVE: We wish to alert clinicians that Aspergillus may infect surgical wounds of the ear causing significant morbidity.
METHOD: A healthy man underwent Mohs micrographic surgery for invasive Bowen's disease of the ear. Due to the size and location of the defect it was allowed to heal by secondary intent. The patient developed inflammation and subsequent destruction of the ear cartilage. Aspergillus was demonstrated by touch preps and cultured from swabs and tissue from the necrotic wound.
RESULTS: In spite of aggressive topical and oral antifungal therapy severe distortion of the pinna occurred, resulting in surgical removal of the upper two-thirds of the ear.
CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of cartilage necrosis following surgery on the ear, Aspergillus infection should be considered. Early aggressive management with surgical debridement, and topical and oral antifungal therapy may prevent destruction of the cartilage and a significant cosmetic defect.","['Anderson LL', 'Giandoni MB', 'Keller RA', 'Grabski WJ']",1995,21,9,Dermatol Surg,"Anderson LL, et al.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: The outpatient department at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (Pa), a tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Ambulatory children younger than 18 years from whose ears P aeruginosa was isolated.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The in vitro susceptibility of aural isolates of P aeruginosa to ampicillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, sulfisoxazole, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, cefazolin, tetracycline, piperacillin, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin hydrochloride, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime axetil, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: No changes were found in the trends of the susceptibility patterns over the 4-year study period, with the exception of the semisynthetic penicillins, ticarcillin and mezlocillin. These two agents were found to be relatively ineffective against the strains of P aeruginosa isolated in 1989 (59% and 18% susceptibility, respectively). This finding is in contrast to their effectiveness over the remainder of the study period (96% and 90% susceptibility, respectively), which was excellent. These observations likely reflect a change in the breakpoints for the minimal inhibitory concentrations between these periods. The intravenous agent with the best susceptibility profile was piperacillin (96%). Of the aminoglycosides tested, 94% of the isolates were sensitive to tobramycin, as opposed to only 79% for gentamicin. This finding may have significance when one is empirically selecting ototopical therapy, since both tobramycin and gentamicin are available as topical preparations. Of the oral agents, the combination of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was most effective (46%).","['Dohar JE', 'Kenna MA', 'Wadowsky RM']",1995,121,9,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Dohar JE, et al.

7490440,Fluoroquinolones.,"Since the introduction of the floroquinolones for clinical use in the late 1980s, they have been used successfully for a large number of clinical situations. As experience accumulates, the indications and optimal use of these agents gradually become more clear. Unfortunately, two of the pathogens for which these agents were most promising--methicillin-resistant S. aureus and P. aeruginosa--have developed resistance. Currently, the quinolones are excellent agents for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including those caused by P. aeruginosa. In addition, they should be considered as initial therapy for the treatment of severe bacterial gastroenteritis. The quinolones should also be considered when attempting to eradicate the chronic stool carriage of S. typhi. These agents also offer significant advantages in the treatment of osteomyelitis and prostatitis caused by gram-negative bacilli that frequently require prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Treatment of STDs, especially gonorrhea, is another clear indication for their use. Ciprofloxacin should be considered as initial therapy in patients with malignant otitis externa and in cystic fibrosis patients with exacerbations secondary to P. aeruginosa in the sputum. The role of the quinolones for soft tissue and respiratory tract infections is less clear and their use probably should be limited to certain situations in which there is a clear advantage over beta-lactams, macrolides, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The new quinolones, fleroxacin, perfloxacin, sparfloxacin, and tosufloxacin, which are being developed and tested for clinical use, will offer advantages in once-a-day dosing and better gram-positive antimicrobial activity. Because the inappropriate or heavy use of the fluoroquinoles has resulted in considerable development of resistance, it is imperative that they be used only when there is a distinct advantage over conventional therapy in terms of efficacy, safety, or cost. Otherwise, the rapid development of resistance will jeopardize the potentially bright future for this entire class of compounds.",['Hendershot EF'],1995,9,3,Infect Dis Clin North Am,Hendershot EF.

8548964,Allergy due to topical medications in chronic otitis externa and chronic otitis media.,"Thirty-four patients suffering from chronic otorrhoea were tested for delayed type contact allergy. Patch testing showed a relevant positive reaction in 19 patients (56%). The most frequent allergens were aminoglycosides with neomycin and framycetin as major offenders. Other antimicrobial agents (clioquinol, polymyxin B), cream bases (lanolin) and corticosteroids (tixocortol) were less common allergens encountered. These results indicate that it is almost obligatory to perform patch testing in any patient with long-standing otitis which does not respond to local therapy. Scoring of the patch tests has to be extended to 7 days, as notably the aminoglycosides and corticosteroids only become positive after such a long interval. Because of the high risk of sensitization, topical preparations containing neomycin and framycetin should not be used routinely. We recommend the use of either a topical antiseptic or a topical antibiotic with low allergenic potential for the initial treatment of otorrhoea.","['Van Ginkel CJ', 'Bruintjes TD', 'Huizing EH']",1995,20,4,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci,"Van Ginkel CJ, et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT and MR imaging were performed in seven patients at diagnosis and at 6 and 12 months after initiation of therapy. Imaging findings were compared and correlated with the clinical course of the disease.
RESULTS: Cortical bone erosion was best seen on CT scans (n = 5 vs n = 0 on MR images) and failed to normalize with cure. Subtemporal soft-tissue abnormalities (n = 7 with both modalities) were better appreciated with MR imaging and had low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Soft-tissue changes improved but did not disappear completely with treatment.
CONCLUSION: CT is preferred at initial diagnosis, as small cortical erosions are better seen. Either modality can be used to follow up soft-tissue evolution. MR imaging may be better for evaluation and follow-up of meningeal enhancement and changes within the osseous medullary cavity.","['Grandis JR', 'Curtin HD', 'Yu VL']",1995,196,2,Radiology,"Grandis JR, et al.

A representative sample of 974 schoolboys ages six to 12 years were subjected to both audiometric and otoscopic examinations. Audiometric examination identified 43 children with HL (40 conductive and three sensorineural), making a prevalence of 4.4% (1.7% mild, 2% moderate and 0.7% severe HL). Otoscopic examination revealed ear problems among 26.9% of schoolboys with the following prevalences: wax (21.3%), acute otitis media (1.9%), chronic otitis media (1.0%), foreign body (0.7%), otitis externa (0.7%), and congenital anomaly of the auricle (0.4%). Impacted wax accounted for reversible HL among a quarter (25.6%) of the hearing impaired children, whereas chronic otitis media accounted for 11.6%; acute otitis media 9.3%; otitis media with effusion, foreign body and congenital anomaly of the auricle each accounted for 2.3%. A significantly higher frequency of HL was detected among children with otitis media than among children without ear conditions (29.4% vs. 2.8%, P<0.01). The prevalence of HL among Abha schoolboys was comparable to that in developed countries, but was lower than that in developing countries. Such prevalence was mostly caused by impacted wax and otitis media. Thus, attention should be given to regular screening for early detection and removal of the impacted wax for correcting the high prevalence of reversible HL due to such conditions.

7669139,[A rare case of malignant otitis external in a non-diabetic patient].,"One case of malignant external otitis in a non-diabetic patient is presented. Malignant external otitis is a rare but severe bacterial infection, caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, predominantly in elderly diabetic patients. The process starts in the external auditory canal and after crossing the cartilaginous-osseus junction invades the connective tissue, cartilage, bone, and nerves of the temporal bone and the surrounding parts of the base of the skull. The clinical syndrome is a severe, painful inflammation of the external auditory canal with edematous obstruction of the external canal and typical granulation tissue in the canal wall. Diagnostic criteria are pain, edema, exudate, granulations, microabscess, diabetes, old age, identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and even cranial nerve involvement. Further important criteria are failure of local treatment and a positive Tc-99 scan demonstrating osteomyelitis of the temporal bone as a sign of connective tissue, cartilage, and bone invasion. In most cases there is also a positive radiograph or HR-CT of the base of the skull. Except for sequestrations, surgical treatment in malignant external otitis is impractical because of the deep penetration into the base of the skull and the lack of demarcation lines in this diffuse pathological process. Nowadays long term i.v. antibiotic therapy is preferred. In our case we applied Ceftazidim (Fortum) 2 g for 12 weeks twice a day. After this period the patient was completely cured. Our case demonstrates that malignant external otitis should be considered even in non-diabetic patients.","['Anderhuber W', 'Walch C', 'Köle W']",1995,74,7,Laryngorhinootologie,"Anderhuber W, et al.

7603719,Evaluation of temporal and facial osteomyelitis by simultaneous In-WBC/Tc-99m-MDP bone SPECT scintigraphy and computed tomography scan.,"A reliable imaging technique is needed for follow-up of patients with temporal and facial osteomyelitis. Clinical outcome in 20 patients with suspected osteomyelitis of the temporal/mastoid, calvarium, and mandible facial bones was evaluated with 30 combined In-WBC/Tc-99m MDP bone single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scans and 27 computed tomographic scans. Simultaneous dual-tracer 25-minute SPECT scans were acquired 18 to 20 hours after radiotracer injection by use of a three-detector system. Diagnosis of the 20 patients (age range, 3 to 74 years) included 8 with facial osteomyelitis, 6 with malignant otitis externa, 3 with mandibular osteomyelitis, and 3 with calvarial osteomyelitis. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy/culture results in 18 patients and by endoscopic and clinical evaluation in 2 patients with initial negative scans. Of the 30 In-WBC/MDP scans, 15 were true-positive, 13 true-negative, 1 false-negative, and 1 equivocal. Of a total of 27 CT scans, 9 were true-positive, 5 false-negative, and 1 equivocal in patients with biopsy-proven osteomyelitis. Three computed tomographic scans were false-positive and 1 was equivocal in patients without osteomyelitis, because of concurrent postoperative bone abnormalities. Additionally, 8 computed tomographic scans were true-negative. These results suggest that dual In-WBC/Tc-99m MDP bone SPECT scintigraphy provides an accurate imaging modality for diagnosis and follow-up of temporal and facial osteomyelitis when existing clinical or postoperative bone changes make it difficult to detect active osteomyelitis by computed tomographic scan.","['Weber PC', 'Seabold JE', 'Graham SM', 'Hoffmann HH', 'Simonson TM', 'Thompson BH']",1995,113,1,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Weber PC, et al.

The prevalence of otitis media with effusion was twice as high in white children as in black children, resulting in a much higher prevalence of hearing loss in the first group. The black children had 7 times more dry perforations of the tympanic membrane and 11 times more wet perforations.

Its antimicrobial activity, if any, against the common organisms in otitis externa is not well known. A study of the antibacterial property of glycerine-ichthammol as measured by a growth inhibition test and a modified cidal assay, showed inhibition of selected gram positive organisms (Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) by ichthammol and glycerine-ichthammol combination, but only negligible antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Candida albicans was also weakly inhibited. As the activity against gram negative organisms is minimal, incorporation of an anti-gram negative antibiotic such as gentamicin in the glycerine-ichthammol compound to enhance its antibacterial spectrum is suggested.","['Ahmed K', 'Roberts ML', 'Mannion PT']",1995,20,3,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci,"Ahmed K, et al.

8562877,Suppressive effects of central opioids on delayed type hypersensitivity to trinitrochlorobenzene: comparative study with morphine and electroacupuncture.,"We reported previously that electroacupuncture (Acu) applied to the acu-point equivalent to GV4 in the mouse just before the 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB) challenge suppressed the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) through endogenous opioidergic systems in the brain, and the pituitary was pivotal in this immunosuppression. The purpose of the present study was to compare the suppressive effects of Acu with those of single, acute doses of morphine on TNCB-DTH in intact and hypophysectomized (HPX) mice. Subcutaneous morphine 10 mg/kg in ddY mice, 30 mg/kg in BALB/c mice or intracisternal morphine 40 micrograms/mouse in BALB/c mice given just before TNCB challenge suppressed (40-53%) the maximal extent of ear swelling at 24 hrs after challenge in intact mice. In HPX mice, the suppressive effects of intracisternal morphine 10 and 100 micrograms/mouse were less pronounced than those observed in intact mice and there was no significant difference between intact and HPX groups. In addition, suppressive effects observed with Acu or subcutaneous morphine (30 mg/kg) were effectively antagonized by pretreatment with intracisternal naloxone at a dose of as low as 2 micrograms/mouse. Naloxone alone had no effect of its own. These results suggest that 1) the activation of opioid receptor-mediated pathways in the brain, which occurs when opioids are endogenously released (Acu) or exogenously given (morphine), is important in the suppression of TNCB-induced DTH, a cell-mediated immune response, and 2) the pituitary is less pivotal in the suppressive effects of acute morphine than in those of Acu.","['Kasahara T', 'Sakurai Y', 'Amemiya M', 'Oguchi K', 'Hisamitsu T']",1995,9,3,In Vivo,"Kasahara T, et al.

7782207,Langerhans' cell histiocytosis: head and neck manifestations in children.,"BACKGROUND: Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an uncommon, poorly understood granulomatous disease, characterized by the idiopathic proliferation of Langerhan's cells or their marrow precursors. In 1985, the Philadelphia Work-shop adopted the term ""Langerhans' cell histiocytosis"" (LCH) to differentiate it from reactive and neoplastic causes of histiocytosis.
METHODS: This study includes 73 pediatric patients diagnosed with this condition in Dublin, Ireland, and Nottingham, England, during a 34-year period (1959 to 1993). These patients are reviewed with respect to clinical presentation, difficulty with making a histological diagnosis, their management, and outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (67%) had head and neck involvement. Bony involvement was the most frequent sign, most frequently located in the skull. There were 11 deaths (15%) in this series, all associated with multisystem disease, and nine of these deaths were in children younger than 2 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: The role of otolaryngologists is important in the early and accurate evaluation, staging, and diagnosis of LCH. It may mimic more common diseases, such as otitis externa, acute mastoiditis, skin rash, gingivitis, or cervical lymphadenopathy. Patients with multisystem disease may be so ill at presentation that the head and neck lesions may be overlooked. The current management of LCH has become increasingly conservative, and in the 1990s, fewer cases are given chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The prognosis is very good for single-system disease and poor for multisystem disseminated disease with early onset.","['Quraishi MS', 'Blayney AW', 'Walker D', 'Breatnach FB', 'Bradley PJ']",1995,17,3,Head Neck,"Quraishi MS, et al.

In a recent prospective phase II study we demonstrated that lectin-mediated bacterial adhesion can be blocked by receptor-analogue carbohydrates in patients suffering from Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced acute otitis externa. In this investigation, human ABO blood group antigens were analysed on outer ear canal epithelial cells with standard routine histological procedures by monoclonal antibodies for the blood groups A and B, and with Ulex europaeus I lectin for the blood group O, respectively. In all cases (n = 20) the blood groups could be shown immunohistologically. P. aeruginosa-specific adhesion and inhibition assays were performed in the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), D-mannose and A-like substance. Outer ear canal tissue sections were incubated with P. aeruginosa (strain PA 60), presenting lectin-specificity for GalNAc. Sections from patients presenting with blood group A were closely settled with bacteria in the presence of non-specific GlcNAc, D-mannose and PBS however, GalNAc and A-like substance inhibited the microbial adhesion. Amongst others, P. aeruginosa present adhesion molecules (lectins) with specificity for GalNAc. Thus, the correlation between blood group A phenotype and P. aeruginosa-induced acute diffuse otitis externa was investigated. Statistical evaluation proved a highly significant association. These data support the hypothesis that P. aeruginosa lectins with GalNAc specificity apparently adhere to GalNAc moieties, representing the terminal blood group A-determinant and further indicate that patients presenting with blood group A may have a genetic disposition for this form of otitis externa.","['Steuer MK', 'Beuth J', 'Hofstädter F', 'Pröbster L', 'Ko HL', 'Pulverer G', 'Strutz J']",1995,282,3,Zentralbl Bakteriol,"Steuer MK, et al.

Speech recognition measured objectively (with tests) and subjectively (with a questionnaire) was comparable or better than with conventional bone-conduction hearing aids. Two patients were using their BAHA all day, whereas the third patient was only using it for a few hours per day.

A comparative analysis of the results revealed trends described below. 1. The MIC90 of FOM against Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus increased 4 times by 1993 as compared to those measured for strains isolated in 1984 and 1985, when FOM for otic use was under development. This was thought to be due to the recent increase in the detection frequency of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) which is also resistant to FOM. 2. No annual changes were seen for MIC distribution of FOM against Proteus group and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 3. Since there was no large annual change in the antibacterial activity of FOM against recent clinical isolates obtained from patients with otitis media and/or otitis externa, FOM may be considered as one of the useful drugs even now, in the mid-1990's.","['Deguchi K', 'Yokota N', 'Koguchi M', 'Suzuki Y', 'Fukayama S', 'Ishihara R', 'Oda S']",1995,48,2,Jpn J Antibiot,"Deguchi K, et al.

Our results shows that there was no significant difference between the two treatment regimens with regard to the resolution of either of the conditions studied or the improvement in the symptom status of the patients. On the basis of this it would seem that a single aural toilet and instillation of medicated ointment is a valid treatment option, cuts down hospital attendance and could be performed in the community by general medical practitioners or trained practice nurses.","['Wilde AD', 'England J', 'Jones AS']",1995,109,2,J Laryngol Otol,"Wilde AD, et al.

8677366,[Malignant otitis externa: apropos of 19 cases].,"In the Anglo-Saxon literature, necrotizing otitis in the diabetic patient, known as malignant otitis externa (MOE), represents a specific and in many ways serious entity. We report on our personal experience with 19 cases of MOE with hospitalization and a 9-year follow-up. Our diagnostic criteria are as follows: all our patients are diabetic (with diabetes revealed twice by the MOE). Otalgia is a predominant feature of the clinical picture, with facial palsy being recorded in practically all our patients. A pyocyanic germ was responsible in 16 cases. The use of CT instead of Tc99 scintigraphy enabled the assessment of the extent of the complaint. Surgical treatment (mastoidectomy), recommended for our first patients, is now considered pointless due to its lack of efficacy against an already extensive process, and with the arrival on the market of new families of ATB's, in particular the quinolones. It would appear that this general treatment, combined with local treatment, provides a better control of the evolution of the MOE, which nonetheless carries a high mortality rate estimated at 18%. On the basis of this series, we present the data in the literature, recalling the diagnostic criteria, the value of skull base imaging and the criteria of recovery.","['Rachidi-Alaoui F', 'Benchekroun L', 'Lazrak A', 'Kzadri M']",1995,116,5,Rev Laryngol Otol Rhinol (Bord),"Rachidi-Alaoui F, et al.

8579183,Non-osteitic complications of therapeutic radiation to the temporal bone.,"The temporal bone often falls within the field of radiation for head and neck tumors. Whereas osteoradionecrosis is well recognized as the end-stage complication of radiation to the temporal bone, serious non-osteitic complications can also occur, and these are important because the ear is an organ of special sense. Radiation causes changes in the specialized tissues of the ear that can impair function and influence therapeutic decisions. The purpose of this article is to review the non-osteitic effects of radiation on the ear. A series of cases is presented that illustrate the spectrum of non-osteitic complications of radiation therapy. External canal stenosis, otitis media with effusion, chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma, sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular impairment, and facial nerve paralysis are described. Management should be guided by an understanding of the pathogenesis of these complications. The authors believe that non-osteitic complications of therapeutic radiation to the temporal bone are relatively common and warrant increased recognition.","['Smouha EE', 'Karmody CS']",1995,16,1,Am J Otol,Smouha EE and Karmody CS.

Although there are certain antibacterial and antifungal agents available, they usually are very caustic, potentially ototoxic and cannot be used if the ear drum is perforated. Garlic is utilized as a folk medicine in many countries for its antimicrobial and other beneficial properties. In response to a lack of otic preparations, the authors studied the efficacy of garlic extracts against the fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus which are the most common cause of this infection. Aqueous garlic extract (AGE) and concentrated garlic oil (CGO) along with various commercial garlic supplements and pharmaceutical prescriptions were used in an in-vitro study. AGE and especially CGO were found to have antifungal activity. These agents showed similar or better inhibitory effects than the pharmaceutical preparations and demonstrated similar minimum inhibitory concentrations.","['Pai ST', 'Platt MW']",1995,20,1,Lett Appl Microbiol,Pai ST and Platt MW.

7502950,Antimicrobial susceptibility and rRNA gene restriction patterns among Staphylococcus intermedius from healthy dogs and from dogs suffering from pyoderma or otitis externa.,"A total of 60 Staphylococcus intermedius strains from dogs were investigated by their sensitivity to various antibiotics (50 strains) and by their rRNA gene restriction patterns (ribotyping) (60 strains). Fifteen isolates were from healthy dogs, 9 with otitis externa, and 36 with pyoderma, including 10 strains from a previous study. Sixty per cent of the 50 strains tested for antibiotic susceptibility demonstrated resistance to penicillin, 24% to spiramycin, 20% to tetracycline, 16% to chloramphenicol, and 2% to fucidic acid. All isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin with clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, and sulphonamides with trimethoprim. There were no significant differences in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns observed among isolates from pyoderma, otitis externa or healthy dogs. Among the 60 strains studied by ribotyping, 10 different ribotypes were identified: 6 different ribotypes among isolates from otitis externa, 8 among isolates from pyoderma, and 5 among isolates from healthy dogs. One ribotype (profile C) was dominant among the isolates from healthy dogs while another ribotype (profile A) was dominant among strains from dogs suffering from pyoderma. This profile was not demonstrated in any of the strains from healthy dogs. From 5 different dogs suffering from pyoderma, 2 different clones were demonstrated based on their plasmid profile and antibiogram. In these dogs 1 of the clones always belonged to ribotype A. The results concerning strains of S. intermedius isolated from furunculosis suggest the existence of distinct subpopulations with different pathogenicity to dogs.","['Pedersen K', 'Wegener HC']",1995,36,3,Acta Vet Scand,Pedersen K and Wegener HC.

The most common symptoms were unilateral otalgia and otorrhea. All had edema of the external auditory channel and nine, proliferation of granulation tissue. Four had cranial nerve palsy. In ten patients Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered. All had axial computed tomographic scans and six sequential radionuclide scanning performed at diagnosis and follow-up. Eleven patients received combined therapy with an aminoglucoside and an anti-pseudonomas beta-lactam antibiotic; in four ambulatory treatment was continued with a quinolone. Only one patient received a quinolone as only treatment due to unavailability of other drugs in the mexican market.

8579150,Otitis externa: management of the recalcitrant case.,"Most cases of otitis externa respond to routine treatment, however, there is a subset of patients who frequently develop otitis externa that is usually severe and recalcitrant to routine therapy. These patients include the immunocompromised, those with AIDS, transplant recipients, severe diabetics, patients treated with high dose steroids or chemotherapeutic agents, and those who are malnourished or are chronically ill. Local factors that lead to worsening of otitis externa include dermatitides and prior local irradiation. Patients who find topical therapy painful may be noncompliant with medications, and they too, may develop recalcitrant otitis externa. For successful treatment, a broad understanding of external auditory canal anatomy, the microbiology and pathophysiology of otitis externa, and available treatment options, including topical and systemic medications, must be attained.

24233290,Laser-induced autofluorescence for medical diagnosis.,"The naturally occurring autofluorescence of cells and tissues is based on biomolecules containing intrinsic fluorophores, such as porphyrins, the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine, and the coenzymes NADH, NADPH, and flavins. Coenzymes fluoresce in the blue/green spectral region (fluorecence lifetimes: 0.5-6 ns) and are highly sensitive indicators of metabolic function. Steadystate and time-resolved blue-green autofluorescence is, therefore, an appropriate measure of the function of the respiratory chain as well as of cellular and tissue damage. Autofluorescence in the yellow/red spectral region is based mainly on endogenous porphyrins and metalloporphyrins, such as coproporphyrin, protoporphyrin (fluorescence lifetime of porphyrin monomers: >10 ns), and Zn-protoporphyrin (2 ns). Various pathological microorganisms such asPropionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae are able to synthesize large amounts of these fluorophores and can therefore be located. This permits fluorescence-based detection of a variety of diseases, including early-stage dental caries, dental plaque, acne vulgaris, otitis externa, and squamous cell carcinoma. The sensitivity of noninvasive autofluorescence diagnostics can be enhanced by time-gated fluorescence measurements using an appropriate time delay between ultrashort laser excitation and detection. For example, videocameras with ultrafast shutters, in the nanosecond region, can be used to create ""caries images"" of the teeth. Alternatively, autofluorescence can be enhanced by stimulating protoporphyrin biosynthesis with the exogenously administered porphyrin precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). The fluorophore protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) is photolabile and photodynamically active. Irradiation of PP IX-containing tissue results in cytotoxic reactions which correlate with modifications in fluorescence due to photobleaching and singlet oxygen-dependent photoproduct formation. Therefore, on-line autofluorescence measurements during the phototreatment can yield information on the efficiency of ALA-based photodynamic therapy.","['Koenig K', 'Schneckenburger H']",1994,4,1,J Fluoresc,Koenig K and Schneckenburger H.

8313286,Ciprofloxacin: an oral quinolone for the treatment of infections with gram-negative pathogens. Committee on Antimicrobial Agents. Canadian Infectious Disease Society.,"OBJECTIVE: To optimize the use of ciprofloxacin, a synthetic fluoroquinolone, in community and hospital practice, and to minimize overprescribing by providing an overview of the literature and recommendations for appropriate use.
OPTIONS: First-line treatment for infections in which ciprofloxacin is shown to be effective, treatment with oral ciprofloxacin rather than parenteral therapy with another drug, and step-down therapy with oral ciprofloxacin after initial parenteral treatment.
OUTCOMES: In order of importance: efficacy, side effects and cost.
EVIDENCE: A MEDLINE search of articles concerning ciprofloxacin, including in-vitro and pharmacokinetic studies using recognized standard methods with appropriate controls and published in recognized peer-reviewed journals, and randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials.
VALUES: The Committee on Antimicrobial Agents of the Canadian Infectious Disease Society (CIDS) and a recognized expert (T.J.L.) recommended use of ciprofloxacin to treat infections against which it has proved effective both in vitro and in randomized controlled trials. They took into account its value as an oral replacement for other drugs given parenterally and development of resistance.
BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: With more appropriate use of ciprofloxacin there will be less development of resistant pathogens. For certain infections patients who would otherwise require admission to hospital could be treated at home and patients initially admitted for parenteral therapy could be discharged sooner on oral therapy with ciprofloxacin.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Ciprofloxacin may be considered as first-line treatment for a number of infections in which gram-negative pathogens are proven or strongly suspected, including complicated urinary tract infections, bacterial prostatitis, bacterial diarrhea, selected bone and joint infections, malignant otitis externa, bronchopulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and selected pneumonia cases.
VALIDATION: The paper was prepared, reviewed and revised by the Committee on Antimicrobial Agents of the CIDS. It was then reviewed and revised further by the Council of the CIDS.

8193421,Otic administration of amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water.,"OBJECTIVE: To report otic administration of parenteral amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water.
CASE SUMMARY: A 44-year-old HIV+ man was diagnosed with otitis externa. The patient's past medical history was remarkable for positive Coccidioides immitis serology for more than five months, essential hypertension, and Barrett's esophagitis. Culture results from an ear swab revealed 4+ Aspergillus fumigatus and 3+ Staphylococcus, coagulase negative. Antiinfective therapy for the otitis externa included oral and topical antibacterial and antifungal medications. Amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water was prepared by the pharmacy for topical otic administration. The otic amphotericin B was dispensed with instructions to refrigerate and assigned a one-week expiration date. The prescription called for instillation of 1-2 drops in each ear three times a day. The patient's signs and symptoms of otitis externa resolved during several weeks of antiinfective therapy. Topical administration of amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water was not associated with any local adverse effects in this patient.
DISCUSSION: The rationale for use of the parenteral amphotericin B formulation to prepare an otic dosage form, and the rationale for the specific concentration and expiration date chosen are discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: This patient tolerated topical otic administration of amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water when administered three times daily.","['Kintzel PE', 'Trausch DE', 'Copfer AL']",1994,28,3,Ann Pharmacother,"Kintzel PE, et al.

8113885,Semiquantitative skull planar and SPECT bone scintigraphy in diabetic patients: differentiation of necrotizing (malignant) external otitis from severe external otitis.,"UNLABELLED: Early diagnosis of necrotizing external otitis (NEO) includes the use of bone scintigraphy since clinical assessment alone cannot differentiate the necrotizing type of otitis from the severe type of external otitis in which there is no extension to the adjacent bone. Four-hour planar bone scintigraphy may reflect soft-tissue infection, and therefore may not be useful in distinguishing NEO from severe external otitis (SEO). Twenty-four-hour bone scintigraphy using planar or SPECT imaging may better reflect bone uptake and increase the accuracy of the test.
METHODS: Twenty-six diabetic patients (12 diagnosed NEO; 14 SEO) and 10 nondiabetic (ND) patients were studied. Lesion-to-nonlesion (L/N) count ratios obtained from planar and SPECT imaging at 4 hr, 24 hr and 24 hr/4 hr (24/4) were assessed.
RESULTS: Count ratios obtained from the 4- and 24-hr planar and SPECT images were significantly higher in the NEO patients compared to SEO patients for both planar and SPECT studies (p < 0.001, 0.005). The 24/4 count ratio was also significantly higher in the NEO patients on the planar (p < 0.01) and the SPECT studies (p < 0.001). The ND patients were not different from SEO patients on 4-hr planar, 4- and 24-hr SPECT as well as 24/4-hr planar and SPECT studies. The L/N count ratio threshold yielding the best sensitivity for detecting NEO was 1.05 for the 24/4 SPECT study.
CONCLUSION: In diabetic patients, an early distinction between NEO and SEO patients can be reliably made by using L/N count ratios on 24/4 or 24-hr SPECT bone scintigraphy.","['Hardoff R', 'Gips S', 'Uri N', 'Front A', 'Tamir A']",1994,35,3,J Nucl Med,"Hardoff R, et al.

7805430,Ciprofloxacin in the treatment of malignant external otitis.,"Malignant external otitis is a serious infection most frequently caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because of its antipseudomonal activity and good tissue penetration, ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic which should, in theory, be effective in the treatment of this type of infection. Publications on the use of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of malignant external otitis are analysed below. This paper analyses 84 clinical case studies collected from 13 publications: ciprofloxacin, administered for the most part orally, was given in a dosage of 750 mg twice daily, apart from three studies where a lower dosage of 500 mg twice daily was used. When the drug was administered parenterally, the dosage was 200 mg b.i.d. In one publication, ciprofloxacin was used in combination with rifampicin. The average duration of treatment was 3 months. Ps. aeruginosa was isolated in 82 patients and sensitivity tests were carried out on 47 strains, none of which was resistant to ciprofloxacin. The clinical cure rate was 96.4% (84 patients). The rate of bacteriological eradication was close to 100% in the 76 evaluable patients. Long-term follow-up (between 2 and 44 months) showed that clinical and bacteriological cure was maintained in all but two patients. Ciprofloxacin thus seems to be a particularly useful antibiotic for the treatment of malignant external otitis, both because of its clinical and bacteriological efficacy and because it is well tolerated.",['Gehanno P'],1994,40 Suppl 1,,Chemotherapy,Gehanno P.

8305556,[Analysis of 40 cases of otomycosis].,"AIM: Otomycosis is a rare clinical process, with peculiar characteristics concerning its etiology and presentation, depending on the geographic area. In order to determine the most common agents, the clinical and epidemiological aspects in mycotic external otitis, 40 episodes detected during one year period were analyzed.
METHODS: Forty patients with otomycosis diagnosed (positive microbiological culture) were studied. Fungi were identified in accordance with morphological and biochemical criteria.
RESULTS: Candida parapsilosis (42.9%) and Aspergillus niger (35.7%) were the commonest agents. In three episodes were found associated bacterial flora. The patients were males (60.0%), between the ages of 31-40 (35.0%) and over 50 years old (37.5%). The symptoms were the usual for these processes: serous fluid, otalgia and itching. The majority of the episodes occurred in the summer (57.5%) and autumn (30.0%), due to sea bathing (90.0%), trauma (27.5%) and prior antimicrobial treatment (40.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Candida parapsilosis is as an important pathogen of otomycosis in our environment, though the participation of Aspergillus niger is also remarkable, as it happens in other geographic areas. The contact with seawater and the antimicrobial treatment are the main factors which favor the infection; climatical conditions could cooperate to it in great extent. The observed symptoms are similar to the bacterial otitis, but of lesser intensity.","['García-Martos P', 'Delgado D', 'Marín P', 'Mira J']",1993,11,9,Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,"García-Martos P, et al.

Thirty patients with a diagnosis of malignant external otitis were treated and followed up at the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Beilinson Medical Center, between 1987 and 1991. Nine of these patients did not have clinical or laboratory evidence of diabetes. This study analyzes this group and concludes that the diagnosis of malignant external otitis should be considered by the treating physician in nondiabetic patients presenting with a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the external ear canal. Severe pain and edematous closure of the canal, together with typical granulation tissue and failure to respond to medical treatment, are specific characteristics of this group.","['Shpitzer T', 'Stern Y', 'Cohen O', 'Levy R', 'Segal K', 'Feinmesser R']",1993,102,11,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"Shpitzer T, et al.

Recently bone scintigraphy, carried out above all employing SPECT, has been considered an important tool in diagnosis and follow-up of NEO. Many Authors confirm the role taken by Technetium99m-methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) and Gallium67-citrate bone scanning. Benecke suggested that response to therapy could be monitored with Ga67 or In111 scans. Two cases of NEO in which diagnosis and follow-up were made using Tc99m-nanocolloid (NC) SPECT are presented in this paper. The Authors discuss the advantages of this latter radiotracer, compared to those obtained with Ga67-citrate, in the follow-up evaluation of therapy efficacy. Tc99m-NC, in fact, is a better inflammation index in that its fixation on bone tissue is determined by the permeability of the basal membrane of vessels. Furthermore, with Tc99m-NC antibiotic therapy may be continued as long as necessary. Bone scintigraphy with other radiotracers may infact result positive for a long period after disease remission in that their fixation is linked to the one remodelling process.","['Comacchio F', ""D'Eredità R"", 'Bison E', 'Chierichetti F', 'Ferlin G', 'Marchiori C']",1993,13,6,Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,"Comacchio F, et al.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between diabetes and infections. However, few conclusive studies exist and considerable debate continues regarding evidence for this predisposition. Despite this lack of documented proof, many health care practitioners acknowledge that a number of infections are overrepresented in patients with diabetes. Some of these infections appear to occur exclusively in patients with diabetes, especially patients who are poorly controlled. The presenting clinical features, causative organisms, and preferred treatment approaches will be discussed in this article for a variety of common and uncommon infections observed in patients with diabetes.

8113036,An audit of the E.N.T. casualty service at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital.,"The only specialised Accident and Emergency unit for ENT in Ireland is at The Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin. This provides a service for the entire Republic, operating on a 9 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday, basis. The aim of the present study was to define the role of this specialised unit. A prospective study of the service over a one month period was conducted. During this time 779 patients were seen of which 350 (45%) were new patients and 429 (55%) were return patients. Fifty two per cent were self referred, 35% were referred by their General Practitioners, 8% by other hospitals and 5% from other sources. The most common diagnosis was otitis externa (21% of new patients and 63% of returns), followed by ear wax (15% of new patients), and epistaxis (9% of new patients). Five per cent of patients required removal of foreign bodies from their ear, nose or oesophagus, and 3% received treatment for trauma to these regions. Of note during this period six new cases of head and neck cancer were detected. From these figures it is the authors' opinion that many of the problems seen could have been dealt with by General Practitioners or as non-emergency referrals to the out-patient department. This indicates the need for further training for primary care physicians and expansion of the present outpatients services. The specialised casualty service should continue to exist to provide a genuine emergency service and valuable training in the speciality.","[""O'Driscoll K"", 'Donnelly MJ', 'McShane DP', 'Burns H']",1993,162,11,Ir J Med Sci,"O'Driscoll K, et al.

8407392,Final results of a study of escalating doses of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in brain stem tumors in children: a Pediatric Oncology Group study.,"PURPOSE: In September 1984, the Pediatric Oncology Group began accrual to a Phase I/II study designed to assess the efficacy and toxicity of sequentially escalated doses of hyperfractionated (twice daily) radiotherapy in children with poor-prognosis brain stem tumors. Pediatric Oncology Group Study #8495 closed in June 1990 with a total of 136 patients on study. We report here the outcome of patients treated at the third and final dose level (75.6 Gy), and compare the results to those obtained at the 66 and 70.2 Gy dose levels.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients eligible for study were those between 3 and 21 years of age with previously untreated tumors arising in the midbrain, pons or medulla. Histological confirmation of diagnosis was not mandatory provided that the clinical and radiological findings were typical for brain stem glioma. Treatment consisted of radiotherapy delivered to local fields. At the third dose level, fraction sizes of 1.26 Gy were given twice daily, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hr to a dose of 75.6 Gy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks. Between 5/89 and 6/90, 41 patients were accrued to the study. Two were excluded from analysis leaving 39 evaluable patients, 21 male and 19 female, whose ages ranged from 3 to 15 years (median 7.5 years).
RESULTS: Following treatment, neurological improvement was reported in 30/39 (77%) of the patients. On central review of imaging studies in 29 patients, one patient was found to have had a complete response to radiotherapy, five a partial (> 50% response), and only three had non-responding or progressive disease. The median time to disease progression was 7 months; median survival time was 10 months; survival at 1 year was 39.9% (SE 8.3%) and at 2 years, 7% (SE 4.8%). The pattern of failure was local in all patients; in addition six had evidence of leptomeningeal seeding. Morbidity of treatment included an enhanced skin reaction (21%), otitis media and/or externa (26%), and steroid use > 3 months (62%). Intralesional necrosis was a frequent finding (45%) on imaging studies performed at a median time of 6 weeks post treatment.
CONCLUSION: The results of treatment in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival are not significantly different (at p = .55 and p = .46, respectively) from those obtained at the two previous dose levels. There is no evidence that higher doses of hyperfractionated radiotherapy given as in this study improve the outlook of patients with poor-risk brain stem gliomas.","['Freeman CR', 'Krischer JP', 'Sanford RA', 'Cohen ME', 'Burger PC', 'del Carpio R', 'Halperin EC', 'Munoz L', 'Friedman HS', 'Kun LE']",1993,27,2,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"Freeman CR, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 147 cases of head and neck cellulitis seen over a 15-year period at a community Hawaiian hospital.
RESULTS: Otologic cellulitis was mainly related to otitis externa, caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although some cases had infected pierced ears or ear cysts. Cervical cellulitis was associated with malignancy, dental infection, or lymphadenitis; these patients often had positive blood cultures. Facial cellulitis was almost always caused by Staphylococci and Streptococci, usually preceded by dental infections, traumatic abscesses, or sinusitis. All study patients recovered completely, except for one patient who developed cavernous vein thrombosis and oculomotor palsy. Seventy-five percent of the patients recovered with parenteral antibiotics alone; the other patients required abscess drainage and/or other surgical procedures, especially if neck infection was present.
CONCLUSION: Although head and neck cellulitis cases have grave potential consequences, most patients do very well with proper antibiotics and appropriate surgical drainage.","['Kimura AC', 'Pien FD']",1993,14,5,Am J Otolaryngol,Kimura AC and Pien FD.

It encompasses the diseases previously associated with histiocytosis X-eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schuller-Christian syndrome and Letterer-Siwe syndrome. A series of 54 patients were diagnosed with this condition in Dublin over a 33-year-period (1959-1992). Twenty-seven patients had aural symptoms, of whom 15 had no other lesions at the time of presentation. Otorrhoea was the most frequent otological symptom, followed by lesions in the temporal bone. LCH may mimic common aural conditions such as otitis externa, otitis media or acute mastoiditis and a high index of suspicion is required to recognize it on clinical presentation. The clinical presentation of multi-focal disease may be so dramatic that the otologic findings may be initially overlooked. The mortality rate was 14.8%. Therapeutic regimes included no treatment, curettage, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or multi-modality treatment.","['Quraishi MS', 'Blayney AW', 'Breatnach F']",1993,18,4,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci,"Quraishi MS, et al.

8378605,Effects of fatty acids on the growth and composition of Malassezia pachydermatis and their relevance to canine otitis externa.,"Malassezia pachydermatis is one of the many infective agents involved in canine otitis externa. Two major phenotypes (large and small colony types), which had different fatty acid compositions, were found among strains of M pachydermatis isolated from canine ears or skin. The large-colony type contained palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids, whereas the small-colony type contained myristic, palmitic, stearic, linoleic acids and five other unidentified fatty acids. Exogenous saturated fatty acids in the medium had no effect on the growth of a large colony strain but oleic and linoleic acids were mycostatic. Adding fatty acids to the medium changed the fatty acid composition of the strain. Saturated fatty acids were incorporated as such into the cell, but the unsaturated fatty acids caused complex changes in composition, including the appearance of a new fatty acid. It is suggested that these changes in the fatty acid composition of M pachydermatis could explain the mycostatic effect of unsaturated fatty acids like oleic and linoleic acids at least in vitro.","['Huang HP', 'Little CJ', 'Fixter LM']",1993,55,1,Res Vet Sci,"Huang HP, et al.

While some of the signs and symptoms of these two diseases are similar (otalgia, otorrhea, bone destruction on computed tomographic scan), they have rarely been reported in the same patient. We present an unusual case of temporal bone cancer and malignant external otitis presenting concurrently in an elderly, nondiabetic host. Precipitating factors and diagnostic criteria are discussed. This case illustrates the importance of an adequate biopsy specimen in all patients presenting with presumed ""classic"" malignant external otitis. Consideration must also be given for the existence of malignant external otitis in the presence of carcinoma. Finally, evolution of malignant external otitis in this patient following aural irrigation supports previous suggestions that this disease may be induced iatrogenically.","['Grandis JR', 'Hirsch BE', 'Yu VL']",1993,119,6,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Grandis JR, et al.

8339734,Preliminary results on scintigraphic evaluation of malignant external otitis.,"Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a potentially fatal otitis occurring in diabetic and immunosuppressed patients, which may cause cranial nerve palsies and massive thrombophlebitis of the brain. We studied five diabetic patients with the clinical diagnosis of external otitis who were suspected of having MEO and one diabetic patient presumed cured from MEO. All of them underwent methylene diphosphonate, nanocolloid and gallium single-photon emission tomography studies with quantitative analysis on the basis of regions of interest and count profile curves. This combined assessment helped us to diagnose and follow-up soft tissue and temporal bone infection, especially in the case of transsphenoidal extension of the disease, since conventional radiology and computed tomography were of no particular help. On the basis of these results, we consider scintigraphic demonstration of skull base infection as a fourth criterion of MEO given that the classical Chandler's triad (diabetes, granuloma, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) is not always present.","['Malamitsi J', 'Maragoudakis P', 'Papafragou K', 'Koukouliou V', 'Kalatzis Y', 'Adamopoulos G', 'Proukakis C']",1993,20,6,Eur J Nucl Med,"Malamitsi J, et al.

7683742,The efficacy of oral cotrimoxazole in the treatment of otitis externa in general practice.,"AIM: A double-blind, randomised clinical trial was conducted in Queensland general practices to evaluate the efficacy of oral doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) as an adjunct to Kenacomb ointment in the treatment of acute diffuse otitis externa.
METHOD: One hundred and five patients with otitis externa agreed to enter the trial; 13 of these had bilateral otitis externa. Six symptoms and signs of otitis externa were rated on a scale of 1 (none) to 5 (severe) and then the scores were averaged to give an index of severity. Swabs from all infected ears were cultured and then the patients were treated with Kenacomb ointment. Patients were randomly assigned to take a five-day course of either oral cotrimoxazole or an oral placebo and were reassessed on Days 2-4 and Days 5-6 after presentation.
RESULTS: The mean duration (+/- standard deviation) of ear pain from the first visit for the cotrimoxazole and placebo groups was 3.1 (+/- 1.5) days and 3.1 (+/- 1.7) days respectively. The mean severity indices (+/- standard deviation) for these groups on presentation were 2.33 (+/- 0.59) and 2.37 (+/- 0.57). The respective reductions in these scores by the second visit were 0.72 and 0.69 and by the third visit 1.10 and 1.05. The principle pathogen isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
CONCLUSION: This suggests that oral cotrimoxazole is unlikely to be useful as an adjunct to Kenacomb ointment in the treatment of mild to moderate otitis externa.",['Yelland MJ'],1993,158,10,Med J Aust,Yelland MJ.

1492891,[Chronic otitis externa from the dermatologic viewpoint].,"Chronic external otitis may be divided into several diagnostic categories. Disposition for psoriasis, seborrhoeic and atopic eczema are main endogenous reasons. Exogenous pathogens for external otitis are microbes and allergens. There are numerous interrelations by coincidence of dispositional diseases, e.g. psoriasis and atopic eczema and by combination of exogenous and endogenous pathogens. This holds good for the yeast Pityrosporum ovale vs. orbiculare in seborrhoeic eczema and for the susceptibility to contact (type IV) and respiratory (type I) allergy in atopic individuals as well. Mycotic and bacterial, especially gram negative external otitis are linked to predisposing factors like eczema, long-term microbicidal therapy, hot and humid environment. Contact allergic external otitis may occur during long lasting local therapy with various substances including vehicles, the most common allergen being neomycin. Mucosal allergic reactions (Type I) in the upper respiratory tract may impair ventilation of the Eustachian tube and middle ear and therefore epithelial migration, as a drainage mechanism of the auditory canal. Examination should include functional assessment of the Eustachian tube and middle ear and allergy testing (patch, prick test).

1457667,Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of external otitis.,"Microbiological and clinical data from 46 patients with external otitis were retrospectively evaluated. Specimens were processed for isolation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 42 aerobic bacteria, 22 anaerobic bacteria, and 3 Candida albicans organisms were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 31 patients (67%), anaerobic bacteria only were isolated from 8 (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 4 (9%). C. albicans alone was recovered from two patients (4%), and the organism was mixed with aerobic bacteria in one case (2%). The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19 instances), Peptostreptococcus species (11), Staphylococcus aureus (7), and Bacteroides species (5). One isolate was recovered from 30 patients (65%), 2 isolates were recovered from 11 (24%), and 3 isolates were recovered from 5 (11%). beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 32 isolates recovered from 27 specimens (59%). These data illustrate the polymicrobial nature of external otitis in one-third of the patients and the role of anaerobic bacteria in one-quarter of them. Further prospective studies are warranted for evaluating the role of anaerobic bacteria in this infection and the therapeutic implications of these findings.","['Brook I', 'Frazier EH', 'Thompson DH']",1992,15,6,Clin Infect Dis,"Brook I, et al.

1304673,Description and evaluation of a simple method for microbiological studies on otitis externa.,"A simple cultural method for identification of the bacteria and yeasts likely to cause external otitis in divers is described. The method employs a commercial dip-slide system (Urotube) in which ear swabs are rolled onto the three agar surfaces, spread by a loop, and then incubated for a period of 18 h or more at 37 degrees C. The method was compared with traditional culture methodology on agar plates. Use of reference strains of bacteria and stored clinical isolates of bacteria and yeasts from ear infections showed stable patterns of growth for each species. Semiquantitative investigation of growth showed that there was a constant relationship between amount of growth on agar plates as compared to the dip-slide. Results were reproducible and were not affected by prolonged incubation. Directly inoculated swabs from normal ear canals and clinically infected ear canals showed identical findings by the traditional culture and Urotube methods. The Urotube method has also been evaluated in practical situations offshore with favorable experience. The Urotube method thus provides a rapid and simple way of identifying the causes of external otitis in divers in isolated areas where laboratory facilities are not readily available. This can have consequences for speed and choice of therapy in isolated environments.",['Dibb WL'],1992,19,6,Undersea Biomed Res,Dibb WL.

Three or 4 days after the inoculation, the animals showed the symptoms of otitis externa. All ear canals were erythematous and the dogs were shaking their heads. A large number of M. pachydermatis was noticed in exudate taken from every ear canal.

These 237 swine from eight selected farms were slaughtered due to unfavorable prognosis associated with clinical signs of illness. One hundred sixty-three (68.8%) of the 237 swine were found to be affected with otitis, though only a few swine showed clinical signs characteristic of the disease. One hundred fifty-one (63.7%), 53 (22.4%), and 39 (16.5%) had lesions in the middle, external, and internal ear, respectively. Of the 151 cases with otitis media, bilateral and unilateral infection accounted for 114 (75.5%) and 37 (24.5%), respectively. Only 5/53 swine with otitis externa and 6/39 swine with otitis interna failed to show otitis media. All swine with infection in the tympanic cavity had inflammatory lesions in the auditory tube. Examination of the swine grouped by age revealed that, regardless of age, incidence of otitis media was 50-70%. In swine younger than 1 month old, otitis media tended to center on the auditory tube, where a mild infiltration of neutrophils into the mucous membrane was frequent.

However, relatively few reports have described infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adults who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Seven cases of serious P. aeruginosa infection in HIV-infected patients occurred during 12 months in two hospitals in Houston, often in the absence of other host factors that are generally thought to predispose to this condition. One patient had no prior illness or antibody test results that were suggestive of HIV infection; for two other patients who were known to have antibody to HIV, an AIDS-defining diagnosis had never been made. Three patients had pneumonia (two with bacteremia and one with empyema), one had malignant otitis externa, and three had bacteremia that either resulted from or caused secondarily a soft-tissue focus of infection. Two patients died, and two others experienced one or more relapses after an initial course of treatment. Compromised host defense mechanisms, including loss of mucosal integrity, defects in humoral and cellular immunities, and qualitative or quantitative leukocyte abnormalities, may predispose HIV-infected patients to P. aeruginosa infections.","['Kielhofner M', 'Atmar RL', 'Hamill RJ', 'Musher DM']",1992,14,2,Clin Infect Dis,"Kielhofner M, et al.

1372220,Optimum management of the discharging ear.,"Discharge from the ear can be the result of many disease processes. The ear may discharge blood, pus, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or wax. Keratosis obturans, stenosis of the external meatus and benign tumours of the external meatus all lead to wax build-up, which may cause recurrent attacks of otitis externa. Malignant tumours, such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and tumours of ceruminous gland origin may also present with discharge. Tumours should be excluded by submitting all material removed from the external canal for histological examination. Single or multiple abscesses (known as furuncles) may occur in the hair follicles in the skin of the external acoustic meatus (EAM). Compulsive scratching, hearing aids and foreign bodies placed in the ear predispose to otitis externa, which is also often associated with infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and faecal organisms. Management may be with aluminium acetate 14%, topical antibiotic/steroid drops, a gauze wick soaked with icthammol 10% in glycerin or polymyxin B sulphate--neomycin sulphate--hydrocortisone acetate cream placed into the EAM and replaced every 24 to 48 hours, or systemic antibiotics according to severity. Malignant (necrotising) otitis externa causes progressive destruction of the temporal bone, and cranial nerve palsies (usually facial first). Treatment is limited debridement of infected bone, accompanied by intravenous aminoglycosides, and local antibiotic treatment and aural cleanout or oral ciprofloxacin. Middle ear conditions causing discharge include acute otitis media, infected grommets, traumatic perforations and chronic suppurative otitis media, as well as tumours of the ear canal skin and middle ear, radiation-induced otitis externa and osteoradionecrosis of the temporal bone, tuberculosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, spontaneous or post-traumatic CSF leaks, Wegeners granulomatosis and immune deficiency states. Topical application of aminoglycoside antibiotics to the middle ear of laboratory animals such as rats, guinea pigs and chinchillas causes sensorineural hearing loss, an effect rarely seen clinically in humans. If the external acoustic meatus and tympanic membrane are obscured by discharge cotton buds, microsuction equipment or syringing are used to remove it. It is often useful to initiate treatment (usually with topical drops, wicks or an oral antibiotic) with a provisional diagnosis. A full examination and adequate visualisation of the tympanic membrane must eventually be performed, if necessary under anaesthesia, or else serious progressive conditions may be neglected. The most useful initial investigation is a swab sent for bacteriological assessment; other investigations are usually indicated by clinical findings and the provisional diagnosis.","['Ruddy J', 'Bickerton RC']",1992,43,2,Drugs,Ruddy J and Bickerton RC.

1728284,Adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen in malignant external otitis.,"Necrotizing invasive pseudomonal infection of the external auditory canal (malignant external otitis) is an uncommon but important disorder in the elderly. The high morbidity, and even mortality, of this disorder has been reduced by the early and intensive use of combination antipseudomonal antibiotics. However, in severely immunocompromised patients or in infection involving the base of the skull, multiple cranial nerves, or the meninges, conventional therapy has been prolonged, intensive, and relatively ineffective. We treated 16 patients with malignant external otitis with adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In six patients, infection was in advanced stages, infections were recurrences after previous treatment, and repeated treatment with antipseudomonal antibiotics had failed. All 16 cases responded promptly when a 30-day course of hyperbaric oxygen was added to the antibiotic regimen, and all patients remained free of infection or neurologic deficit during 1 to 4 years of follow-up. No complications of this treatment modality were noted. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy reverses tissue hypoxia, which enhances phagocytic killing of aerobic microorganisms, and stimulates neomicroangiogenesis. In addition, hyperbaric oxygen augments the action of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy should be considered in advanced or recurrent cases of malignant external otitis.","['Davis JC', 'Gates GA', 'Lerner C', 'Davis MG', 'Mader JT', 'Dinesman A']",1992,118,1,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Davis JC, et al.

1728285,Necrotizing 'malignant' external otitis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis.,"Necrotizing ""malignant"" external otitis is a life-threatening skull base infection that originates in the external auditory canal and is characterized by otalgia and purulent aural discharge with external auditory canal cellulitis and granulation. Necrotizing external otitis, seen almost exclusively in elderly diabetics, is almost always caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To our knowledge, there have been only six nonpseudomonal cases reported to date. We describe a 70-year-old diabetic man with necrotizing external otitis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, confirmed by serial cultures. This case was characterized by otalgia, purulent otorrhea, preauricular swelling, bony external auditory canal erosion, and a conductive hearing loss. Despite prolonged intravenous antistaphylococcal antibiotic therapy and frequent local débridement, the patient's symptoms never completely resolved. As demonstrated by the treatment failure, S epidermidis necrotizing external otitis, may represent a more refractory form of this already virulent disease process. We believe this to be the first reported case of necrotizing external malignant otitis caused by S epidermidis.","['Barrow HN', 'Levenson MJ']",1992,118,1,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Barrow HN and Levenson MJ.

1788892,[Treatment of acute diffuse otitis externa by low-frequency magnetic field].,"Patients with acute diffuse external otitis were treated using an alternating and pulsatile low-frequency magnetic field synchronized with the pulse wave propagation across the pathological focus. It was shown that the magnetic exposure should be 30-40 min longer because the beneficial effect of the magnetic field develops as a function of time and because there should be a feedback between the acting magnetic field and hydrostatic pressure in focal capillaries which varies during inflammation. This therapeutic method was applied to 27 patients. The mean time on this method was 4 days shorter when compared to that on UHF and SHF therapy or 3 days shorter when compared to that on continuous magnetic field therapy, the difference being statistically significant.",['Suntsov VV'],1991,,6,Vestn Otorinolaringol,Suntsov VV.

Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). Serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. Serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml) and N.D. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. FMOX was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected, and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. In 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. The bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of Escherichia coli, and 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as ""eradicated"". Moreover, the drug, administered with or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. No side effects were observed in any of the patients. Concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in GOT were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. The results suggest that FMOX is useful and safe also in neonates.","['Iwai N', 'Nakamura H', 'Miyazu M', 'Kasai K', 'Watanabe Y', 'Taneda Y', 'Ozaki T', 'Matsui S', 'Maki T', 'Tauchi N']",1991,44,11,Jpn J Antibiot,"Iwai N, et al.

1875833,Frequent hospital admissions for bacterial infections among aboriginal people with diabetes in central Australia.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine hospital-based morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections among Aboriginal people with diabetes in central Australia.
DESIGN: Examination of medical records on diabetic inpatients between January 1984 and December 1986.
SETTING: Alice Springs Hospital in central Australia, covering an Aboriginal population of about 12,500 people.
PATIENTS: Subjects admitted with a bacterial infection (n = 165) were selected from the database of all Aboriginal people known to have diabetes in the region (n = 374; all had non-insulin dependent diabetes).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of admissions, type and site of infections, causative organisms, duration of hospital stay and cause of death.
RESULTS: The 281 admissions for infections accounted for 4.6% of adult Aboriginal admissions to hospital. Thirteen patients died. Eleven patients required amputation of a digit or limb. In 1986, 13/200 patients admitted with diabetes had bacteraemia compared with 14/1885 patients who did not have diabetes. One patient had Fournier's gangrene, one had malignant otitis externa, one community acquired Acinetobacter pneumonia, one pneumonia with Succinivibrio spp. found in blood cultures, and one meningitis and transverse myelopathy with Streptococcus milleri found in blood cultures.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency, type and severity of infections in the relatively young patients result in high personal costs to the community and financial costs to the health care system. Standard preventive measures must be implemented to control severe bacterial infections among subjects with diabetes in this socially and economically marginalised population group.","['Patel MS', 'Phillips CB', 'Cabaron Y']",1991,155,4,Med J Aust,"Patel MS, et al.

2065266,Hyperfractionated radiation therapy in brain stem tumors. Results of treatment at the 7020 cGy dose level of Pediatric Oncology Group study #8495.,"Between May 1986 and February 1988, 57 patients were accrued to the second dose level of a Phase I/II Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) study exploring the use of hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HRT) in children with high-risk brain stem tumors. Local fields were treated with fraction sizes of 117 cGy given twice daily, with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours, to a total dose of 7020 cGy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks. Information regarding clinical status during HRT was available for 55 patients (44 [80%] improved, 6 remained stable, and 5 deteriorated). Results of initial and follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were available for review for 52 patients. One patient had a complete response (CR) to treatment, 3 had a partial response (PR) (more than 50% response), and 40 remained stable, for a total response rate (CR + PR + stable) of 77%. Median time to disease progression was 6 months. Median survival time was 10 months. Survival rate was 39.6% (standard error [SE] = 6.6%) at 1 year and 23% (SE = 5.8%) at 2 years. Complications of treatment included an enhanced skin reaction in six patients and otitis media and/or externa in nine. One patient bled into tumor shortly after completion of HRT, and three had intralesional necrosis. Five patients continued taking steroids for protracted periods in the face of improved clinical and/or radiologic findings. Complications related to the use of steroids included opportunistic infections, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, osteoporosis, and significant mood changes. In no patient was there evidence of any late injury attributable to HRT. When compared with results of treatment with HRT at a lower dose level (6600 cGy), there appears to be a trend toward improved survival at 7020 cGy despite a less favorable patient population at the higher dose level. A second dose escalation to 7560 cGy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks has been implemented as planned.","['Freeman CR', 'Krischer J', 'Sanford RA', 'Cohen ME', 'Burger PC', 'Kun L', 'Halperin EC', 'Crocker I', 'Wharam M']",1991,68,3,Cancer,"Freeman CR, et al.

The patients were divided into two groups: group A, (n = 9) suffering from a mild form of IEO, and group B (n = 15), suffering from a more severe form of the disease. Diabetes mellitus was the main underlying disease in these patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the only pathogen in 18 infected ears and part of the polymicrobial flora in an additional 6. Cure was observed in 83.3% of the patients. Two of the cured patients required more than one course of ofloxacin treatment. Development of P aeruginosa resistant to ofloxacin (n = 3) and severe allergic reaction (n = 1) required the discontinuation of ofloxacin therapy. Other side effects such as nausea, arthralgia, and vaginal itching were minimal.

They were, however, claimed to be nonspecific. Quantitative Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy and gallium 67 scintigraphy were performed in eight patients with NEO and in 20 patients with severe external otitis, in order to prove usefulness of scintigraphy in the diagnosis of NEO. Ratios of lesion to nonlesion for bone scintigraphy were 1.67 +/- 0.16 in patients with NEO and 1.08 +/- 0.09 in patients with severe external otitis, and for gallium 67 scintigraphy they were 1.35 +/- 0.24 in NEO patients and 1.05 +/- 0.03 in patients with severe external otitis. There was no difference in uptake between diabetic patients with severe external otitis and nondiabetic patients. The scintigraphic studies were also evaluated using a qualitative scoring method (scores 0 to +4), according to the intensity of the radiopharmaceutical uptake. This method was found to be inferior in the diagnosis of NEO compared with the quantitative method. We conclude that lesion-to-nonlesion ratios greater than 1.5 and 1.3 on bone and gallium 67 scintigraphy, respectively, are indicative of NEO. Quantitative bone scintigraphy, which is quicker to perform, may be used as a single imaging modality for the diagnosis of NEO.","['Uri N', 'Gips S', 'Front A', 'Meyer SW', 'Hardoff R']",1991,117,6,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Uri N, et al.

Combining one of the above procedures with an operative procedure of the external ear canal is frequently indicated because otitis media commonly accompanies chronic otitis externa. The selection of a surgical procedure to treat otitis media should be based on duration of clinical signs, response to previous treatment, the condition of the external ear canal (vertical and horizontal parts), and the familiarity of the surgeon with the different approaches and techniques. Nasopharyngeal polyps may be removed by excising them from the pharynx, external ear, or middle ear. Because of their frequent involvement of the middle ear cavity, nasopharyngeal polyps are best excised by using a bulla osteotomy technique in combination with other excision techniques.",['Boothe HW'],1991,3,2,Probl Vet Med,Boothe HW.

The modified Zepp procedure or lateral wall resection should be considered early in the course of the disease. Performing this procedure in advanced cases of otitis externa, which involve both the medial and lateral walls of the ear canal, is responsible for 34-47% of these cases showing no improvement. Vertical ear canal ablation is the procedure of choice when the entire vertical canal is involved but the horizontal canal is free of disease. If the disease involves both the vertical and horizontal canals, a total ear canal ablation, along with removal of the lateral aspect of the bony bulla should be performed. By removing this portion of the bulla, improved drainage is achieved, and the complication rate following total ear canal ablations is decreased.",['Elkins AD'],1991,3,2,Probl Vet Med,Elkins AD.

2026934,Biocompatible implantable antimicrobial release for necrotizing external otitis.,"The efficacy of a biocompatible, surgically implantable, antimicrobial release system (IARS) as the exclusive antimicrobial therapy of necrotizing external otitis (NEO) was evaluated in six NEO patients. Gentamicin incorporated polymethyl-methacrylate beads were implanted, following surgical debridement and were removed two months later. Post-implantation alleviation of clinical symptoms: pain, periauricular tissue swelling, otorrhoea, eradication of pseudomonal infection (100 per cent) and substantially shortened hospitalization (4-15 days) were the salient results of this therapeutic modality. Three patients recovered. Two patients who died, one of sudden cardiac arrest and the other of paralytic ileus, 15 and 60 days post-operatively while the beads were still implanted, were symptomless. Recurrence was seen in one patient with early bead extrusion. Ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss (one patient) and external meatal stenosis were the main complications. IARS appears to offer an effective alternative to long-term systemic antibiotic administration for the eradication of NEO-pseudomonal infection in patients who are sensitive, develop resistance, or when quinolone medical treatment has failed or is contra-indicated.","['Ostfeld EJ', 'Kupferberg A']",1991,105,4,J Laryngol Otol,Ostfeld EJ and Kupferberg A.

1864290,Use of quinolones for treatment of ear and eye infections.,"Malignant otitis externa is a severe, necrotizing infection of the external auditory canal which is sometimes fatal. The traditional antimicrobial treatment has usually been the combination of an antipseudomonal beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside, given intravenously for 4 to 8 weeks. Over 100 patients have been treated with a fluoroquinolone alone, most commonly ciprofloxacin given by mouth in a dosage of 750 mg b.i.d. for 6 to 12 weeks. About 90% of patients have been cured. Treatment with a quinolone has the advantage over older treatments that it can be given orally and has a low rate of side-effects. The ocular penetration of the fluoroquinolones has been studied in patients with unifected eyes. After the administration of a single dose of ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, ofloxacin or norfloxacin, penetration into the aqueous humor, expressed as the ratio of the peak concentration in the aqueous humor to that in the serum, is about 20%. The penetration of ciprofloxacin into the vitreous humor, based primarily on the data from one report, is about 20%. The concentrations are likely to be higher after repeated doses or in the inflamed eye. Whether the concentrations achieved will be adequate for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes has not been determined.",['Barza M'],1991,10,4,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,Barza M.

CPR was administered to 15 cases (3 tonsillitis, 3 bronchitis, 5 bronchopneumonia, 1 acute cystitis, 1 coxoiliatitis, 1 otitis media, 1 otitis externa). The efficacy rate was 86.7%. Seven strains of bacteria were isolated and identified 4 Haemophilus influenzae, 3 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Pseudomonas sp. from these cases. These bacteria in children were followed after administration of CPR. Six strains were eradicated and one was reduced in number. No adverse effects of CPR were observed except in 2 cases, one of which showed transient eosinophilia and the other showed a transient increase of transaminase. These results suggest that CPR may be an effective and safe drug to use on children clinically.","['Ihara T', 'Kamiya H', 'Ito M', 'Sakurai M']",1991,44,2,Jpn J Antibiot,"Ihara T, et al.

Mortality remains high (20%) in spite of an early general antibiotic treatment. This infection of the soft tissue of the EAC causes cellulitis, chondritis and osteomyelitis, and there are risks of diffusion into the base of the skull. Our work is aimed at placing computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging into the context of exploration of this infection, in relation to radionuclide scanning, owing to our experience with 10 patients. Imaging appreciates the anatomical extension of the infection beyond the EAC and towards the base of the skull and the infratemporal fossa, this being a key element for prognosis. It assesses the efficiency and duration of treatment, although the criteria of healing are still difficult to appreciate and late recurrence is frequent. Exceptionally, it is useful for diagnosis in some particular clinical forms.","['Marsot-Dupuch K', 'Tiyriboz A', 'Meyer B', 'Hagege E', 'Achouche J', 'Guillausseau PD', 'Chouard CH']",1991,108,6,Ann Otolaryngol Chir Cervicofac,"Marsot-Dupuch K, et al.

This incidence is less than the 40% and the 58% found in other previous studies. We did not find any specific difference in sex and age between the allergic and non-allergic groups. In the allergic group, topical drugs were the commonest sensitizing agents, followed by chemicals and resins found in the ear prosthesis. Twenty-one patients with negative patch tests were classified as seborrheic dermatitis and 11 as atopic dermatitis. The other 19 patients, who were discharged before patch testing, were diagnosed as having psoriasis (8) or chronic bacterial (6) or fungal infections (5), without true blister reaction.

2121879,Typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ear infections related to outcome of treatment.,"Of 142 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) ear infections, 88 (62 per cent) had chronic otitis media and 54 (38 per cent) external otitis. Following serotyping and pyocin typing of their bacteria, and relating the type to outcome, patients could be divided into three groups: (1) 120 patients who had no recurrence with isolation of only one PSA strain, (2) 13 patients who had recurrent infections and in whom the same PSA strain was isolated in repeated cultures, and (3) nine patients who had recurrent disease, but who had a change in their PSA strains. Most of the PSA strains isolated from patients in groups (1) and (2) were stable to pyocin, and resistent to gentamicin. Patients in the first group were all cured initially by medical management. Of the nine patients in group (3) who had a different serotype on repeated cultures, medical treatment was successful in eight (89 per cent), but of the 13 patients in group (2) who had the same Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype cultured, medical therapy failed in six (46 per cent) and mastoid surgery was required.

2288752,[Otitis externa maligna and cranial neuropathy].,"Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a disease of the external auditive channel (EAC) due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa which usually involves individuals with diabetes mellitus. It may result in the invasion of the cranial base with cranial neuropathy and a high mortality rate despite therapy. We report the clinical features, diagnostic procedures, evolution and therapy of 8 patients with MEO, seven of which had cranial neuropathy. All patients have diabetes except one who had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. All had otalgia, otorrhea and headache lasting for several months. Six patients had homolateral (as related to the MEO) facial palsy. One patient with bilateral MEO developed bilateral facial palsy and lesion of the cranial nerves VI (unilaterally) and IX through XII (bilaterally). In all patients P. aeruginosa was cultured from the EAC exudate scintigraphy with 99Tc showed uptake at medium ear and mastoid level in all 8 patients, suggesting a possible osteomyelitis. Scintigraphy with 67Ga was positive in the 6 cases where it was carried out, showing uptake in the soft tissues of the cranial base. Computed tomography was carried out in 6 patients, and it was useful to define the anatomical extent of the disease. The patients received different therapeutic schedules, particularly the combination of a betalactamic and aminoglucoside antibiotics. Follow up was characterized by common recurrences, and one patient died. The importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent the extension and recurrence of MEO are discussed. Cranial neuropathy is considered as a poor prognostic finding.","['Reñé R', 'Mas A', 'Villabona CM', 'Ricart MC', 'Bassa A', 'Tolosa F']",1990,5,7,Neurologia,"Reñé R, et al.

Staphylococcus epidermidis (48.5%), Pseudomonas sp. (18.8%), and Flavobacterium sp. (16.8%) were the prominent isolates from ear samples, and Gram-negative organisms which rarely existed in normal canal, were found to be markedly increased (59.4%). Moreover, about half of all non-sterile ear canals were found to have more than one Gram-negative flora.

2389897,Morphologic measurements of the external horizontal ear canal of dogs.,"Microscopic anatomy of the horizontal part of the external ear canal was evaluated in 24 dogs. Sixteen dogs were from breeds known to have a predisposition to otitis externa. The remaining 8 dogs were from breeds that do not have a predisposition to otitis externa. Dogs were separated into groups according to predisposition to otitis externa: group 1-predisposed dogs without otic inflammation, group 2-predisposed dogs with otic inflammation, and group 3-nonpredisposed dogs without otic inflammation. Qualitative microscopic evaluation of distribution of hair follicles revealed hair within proximal, middle, and distal regions of the horizontal ear canal in all breeds. The degree of keratinization was directly proportional to the presence of otic inflammation and was excessive in group-2 dogs. Quality of sebaceous glands within the horizontal ear canal was similar among dogs with and without otitis externa, whereas the quantity of apocrine tubular glands was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in dogs with otitis. Quantity of apocrine tubular glands was also greater in group-1 dogs than in group-3 dogs. Thickness of the soft tissue in the external ear canal increased in direct proportion to the progression of disease and was greatest in the proximal region of the affected ear canal. Soft tissue located caudally between nonopposing ends of the annular cartilage, within the proximal region of the horizontal ear canal, contained few glands and hair follicles in dogs without otitis externa. In dogs with otitis externa, this region was infiltrated by distended apocrine tubular glands.","['Stout-Graham M', 'Kainer RA', 'Whalen LR', 'Macy DW']",1990,51,7,Am J Vet Res,"Stout-Graham M, et al.

As a result, in 90 patients (37.8%) otomycosis was diagnosed. Mycosis of the external acoustic meatus was identified in 43 patients (55 mycotic ears or 52.4%), fungal otitis media was found in 21 patients (22 ears or 20.9%), and mycosis of the postoperative cavity was detected in 26 patients (28 mycotic cavities or 26.7%). The following fungi occurred most frequently: Aspergillus niger (75.2%), Candida albicans (6.7%), and Penicillium flavum March (3.8%). In the presence of fungi the bacterial growth was less significant, thus indicating the predominant role of fungi during otomycosis. Nitrofungin and clotrimazol in combination with 1% decamine ointment were effectively used in the treatment. A good antipruritic drug was 7% chloracetophose ointment.

In the case of granular myringitis it is important to differentiate between this disease and chronic suppurative otitis media complicated with polyps or granulations. The granular tissue on the walls of the external acoustic meatus can develop due to inflammation of the skin alone without periosteum or bone involved. It may also occur as a result of suppurative osteoperiostitis of the external acoustic meatus.

Two patients underwent bilateral surgery making a total of 9 ear cases. Two patients developed early restenosis within 6 months of permeatal excision of the fibrous core and skin grafting, and one patient had late stenosis 4 years following postaural excision, meatoplasty and skin grafting. Two of these patients opted for revision surgery and a total of 6 patients (8 ear cases) underwent postaural excision with Körner flap canalplasty, enlargement of the bony ear canal and skin grafting. The average hearing gain was 25 dB in the speech frequencies and only one restenosis was seen at 3 years. This was successfully revised. Radical excisional surgery with a wide bony canalplasty is recommended in this condition.","['Herdman RC', 'Wright JL']",1990,15,1,Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci,Herdman RC and Wright JL.

Tap water irrigation of the ears by a physician preceded the onset of symptoms in 61.5% (8/13) of cases of malignant external otitis. Two control subjects with known diabetes mellitus were matched for each patient by sex and age. Both groups were questioned on the nature and degree of aural water exposure, as well as history of ear disease. There were no significant differences between 13 patients and 26 control subjects for presence of ear disease (hearing loss, chronic infection, prior operations), swimming, showering, bathing, frequency of ear cleaning, or method of ear cleaning (washcloth, cotton applicator). Patients with malignant external otitis had a statistically significant higher incidence of aural irrigation with tap water when compared with control subjects.

2180022,Common cutaneous disorders in athletes.,"Athletic activity may cause or aggravate skin disorders, which in turn may diminish athletic performance. Since many sporting activities necessitate prolonged exposure to the sun, athletes must avoid painful sunburn which will adversely affect their performance. Drugs and chemicals also may cause photoallergic and/or phototoxic reactions, including polymorphous light eruption and athletes should thus avoid photosensitising drugs and chemicals. The effects of chronic ultraviolet exposure include ageing, pigmentation and skin cancers. The most effective protection against excessive exposure to sunlight is the use of sunscreens, although inadequate application and poor protection in the UVA spectrum may diminish their effectiveness and contact allergies may create other problems. Viral, bacterial and fungal infections are common in athletes due to heat, friction and contact with others. Herpes simplex may be treated with any drying agents (e.g. alcohol) as they are as effective as more expensive topical agents such as acyclovir. Molluscum contagiosum may be spread by close contact or water contact and is treated by superficial incision, cryotherapy or standard wart varnishes. Plantar wart infection is transmitted by swimming pool decks, changing rooms and hand-to-hand from weights in gymnasiums. Plantar warts presenting with pain may be aggressively treated, by blunt dissection, but painless ones are best treated conservatively. Impetigo and folliculitis often develop after trauma. Antibiotics are effective against mild infections while abrasions and lacerations should be cleansed and dressed with occlusive dressings. Diphtheroid bacteria in moist footwear may produce pitted keratolysis and erythrasma. Tinea pedis is common in athletes and probably originates in swimming pools, gymnasium floors and locker rooms. Interdigital, dry-moccasin and pustular-midsole forms can be distinguished. The latter two forms respond to topical antifungal agents, while the interdigital form, a mixed fungal/bacterial infection, is treated with debridement, antibiotics and drying routine similar to the therapy of otitis externa. Nail infections by a variety of organisms may appear as onycholysis with or without paronychia and should be treated with the appropriate antibiotics. Tinea versicolor occurs in heat and humidity. Since Pityrosporum orbiculare is part of the normal flora it often recurs, necessitating regular treatment. Acute trauma injuries include contusions, black heel or petichiae of the heel, black toe (bleeding under the nail), 'jogger's nipple' caused by chafing, and foot blisters. Chronic trauma may result in calluses, corns and paronychia. Plantar corns can be disabling and may be caused by overly tight shoes or abnormalities in biomechanics; treatment includes restoring normal foot function and minimal surgical procedures. Paronychia is treated best by wedge resection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['Conklin RJ'],1990,9,2,Sports Med,Conklin RJ. Common cutaneous disorders in athletes.

2104989,Malignant external otitis: utility of CT in diagnosis and follow-up.,"Malignant external otitis is a severe bacterial infection of the bone and soft tissues of the base of the skull that is frequently difficult to diagnose. The effectiveness of antibiotic therapy is likewise difficult to assess. Serial computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained in 11 consecutive patients with malignant external otitis at time of diagnosis and periodically after conclusion of antibiotic therapy. All patients demonstrated abnormalities of the external auditory canal, with or without bone destruction. Soft tissue or fluid in the middle ear and mastoid, around the eustachian tube, and in the parapharyngeal space (both pre- and poststyloid) was seen in greater than 50% of the cases. While remineralization of bone was not seen, soft-tissue disease improved dramatically, and recurrence or persistence could be corroborated by detection of more extensive soft-tissue changes. By delineating the extra- and intracranial extent of disease, serial CT scans enable one to make the diagnosis, determine the extent of infection, document recurrence, exclude progression, and confirm resolution of malignant external otitis.","['Rubin J', 'Curtin HD', 'Yu VL', 'Kamerer DB']",1990,174,2,Radiology,"Rubin J, et al.

As a result of having treated 13 patients with skull base osteomyelitis over a 4-year period, we have developed a method of staging and monitoring this malady using gallium and technetium scanning techniques. Stage I is localized to soft tissues, stage II is limited osteomyelitis, and stage III represents extensive skull base osteomyelitis. All stages are treated with appropriate antipseudomonal antibiotics. The duration of therapy depends upon the clearing of inflammation as shown on the gallium scan.

2589357,Ciprofloxacin treatment of malignant external otitis.,"The Ear, Nose, and Throat department of the Meir Hospital treated 91 patients with malignant external otitis during the past 16 years. The last 23 patients with malignant external otitis were treated with ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily, combined with local excision of the aural lesion. The records of 61 of our previous 68 patients who underwent surgery and were hospitalized and treated with an intravenous extended-spectrum penicillin and gentamicin for six to eight weeks, were analyzed. Twenty-one of 23 patients treated with ciprofloxacin were cured; therapy failed in two patients. Treatment averaged 16.8 days of hospitalization, and bacteriologic eradication was achieved after an average of 7.04 days, as compared with 49 and 15.3 days, respectively, in the group of patients with the intravenous treatment. The mean peak concentrations of ciprofloxacin in serum varied between 2.5 and 3.7 micrograms/ml, and the drug concentrations in different ear tissues were 0.2 to 13 micrograms/g. The treatment with ciprofloxacin was well tolerated with no significant side effects, whereas serious side effects were noted in 45.9 percent of the previous intravenously treated group. The concentrations of the drug in serum and ear tissues were higher than the average minimal inhibitory concentration for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Use of ciprofloxacin treatment, combined with local excision of the aural lesion, will bring about healing of malignant external otitis in the majority of cases. Ciprofloxacin can be given on an ambulatory basis after a relatively short period of hospitalization.","['Sadé J', 'Lang R', 'Goshen S', 'Kitzes-Cohen R']",1989,87,5A,Am J Med,"Sadé J, et al.

2504254,Efficacy of oral ciprofloxacin plus rifampin for treatment of malignant external otitis.,"Malignant external otitis is an invasive pseudomonal infection characteristically afflicting the elderly patient with diabetes mellitus. Therapy has traditionally consisted of the long-term administration of combination parenteral antibiotics, but morbidity and mortality remain substantial despite this therapy. We treated 11 consecutive patients with the oral combination of ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) and rifampin (600 mg twice daily) for 6 to 12 weeks (mean, 8 weeks). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from ear canal or mastoid, and bone destruction was documented by computed tomography in all patients. Seven patients (64%) had ear irrigation before onset of the infection. Ten patients fulfilled the criteria of both clinical and bacteriologic cure. No serious adverse reaction to either antibiotic was observed. Otalgia and otorrhea responded at a mean of 6 and 4 days, respectively, following the initiation of therapy. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate fell from a mean pretherapy value of 81 mm/h (range, 41 to 138 mm/h) to 18 mm/h (range, 3 to 45 mm/h) after the completion of antibiotic therapy. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations established that all organisms were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Time-kill curve and checkerboard assays failed to demonstrate either synergy or antagonism between ciprofloxacin and rifampin. Serum inhibitory and bactericidal titers showed minimal increase in inhibition and killing of the bacteria with the addition of rifampin. Rifampin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin. The successful use of oral antibiotics for this difficult infection may be a major advance. Reduction in antibiotic costs and hospitalization and convenience of oral administration were of notable benefit.","['Rubin J', 'Stoehr G', 'Yu VL', 'Muder RR', 'Matador A', 'Kamerer DB']",1989,115,9,Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Rubin J, et al.

Lesser degrees of perforation usually experience significantly fewer problems if such guidelines are followed.

2505500,Preliminary clinical results with low flip angle spin-echo MR imaging of the head and neck.,"A new approach for producing primarily T2- and proton-density-weighted MR images in less time than the conventional long TR, long TE imaging is to reduce the TR of a double spin-echo pulse sequence and to also reduce the RF excitation flip angle to minimize the resulting T1 sensitivity. In preliminary studies with a human volunteer and five patients with various diseases of the head and neck, conventional long TR, long TE and short TR, short TE images were compared with short TR, long TE images with reduced flip angles (45 degrees, 30 degrees), which required only 40% of the imaging time of the long TR images. The latter images showed a similar contrast pattern to the conventional T2-weighted image, and contrast-to-noise measurements indicated an increase in contrast between the lesion and nearby tissue when the flip angle was reduced. Furthermore, the maximum contrast/noise per unit imaging time on the short TR, long TE image was comparable to that on the long TR, long TE image. Optimization of the flip angle with short TR allows a substantial reduction in imaging time but with a reduction in multislice capability. This technique will be most useful in areas of complex anatomy where two or more orthogonal imaging planes are required, such as the head and neck.","['Chisin R', 'Buxton RB', 'Ragozzino MW', 'Beaulieu PA', 'Fabian RL', 'Brady TJ']",1989,10,4,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,"Chisin R, et al.

Unremitting headache is the only early symptom of the latter and may occur in the absence of any signs of local ear disease. A conductive hearing loss is the most common additional symptom and is caused by fluid in the middle ear. If not diagnosed and treated adequately and properly, the infectious process in the bone marrow involves the soft tissues at the skull base and results in a progressive paralysis of the lower cranial nerves.

Tympanometry, an objective technique, was shown to be very accurate for the evaluation of the integrity of the ear drum. Otoscopic examination by experienced personnel was shown to be moderately accurate under controlled conditions when the external ear canal was not inflammed. However, under field conditions when otitis externa was present, visual inspection of the tympanic membrane was seldom possible even after lavage of the ear. Palpation of the tympanic membrane with a blunt probe was shown to be very inaccurate and led to rupture of the tympanic membrane in a high proportion of cases. These results imply that two widely used techniques for the examination of the canine tympanic membrane are unsatisfactory. Furthermore, they suggest that previous reports of the prevalence of ear drum perforations in dogs may need reappraisal. Tympanometry is a non-invasive, objective and practical technique for the assessment of ear drum integrity which is worthy of further evaluation.","['Little CJ', 'Lane JG']",1989,124,1,Vet Rec,"Little CJ and Lane JG.

3142986,Malignant external otitis in children.,"Malignant external otitis in the pediatric population is primarily a disease of children with chronic illness or immunosuppression. The presence of severe, unrelenting otalgia, otorrhea with isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and evidence of bone destruction on computed tomography scan should alert the clinician to the diagnosis. Unlike adults, children have a higher incidence of seventh nerve paralysis earlier in the course of the infection. They also manifest more frequent involvement of the middle ear with tympanic membrane destruction. The short interval between the onset of symptoms and facial nerve dysfunction highlights the necessity of prompt diagnosis and institution of anti-Pseudomonas therapy. Our review suggests that this destructive bacterial infection is an emerging clinical entity in children; 73% of the cases have been reported since 1980. Pediatricians should therefore be familiar with the clinical presentation of this treatable infection. Substantial morbidity could be alleviated by prompt diagnosis and early antibiotic treatment.","['Rubin J', 'Yu VL', 'Stool SE']",1988,113,6,J Pediatr,"Rubin J, et al.

Iatrogenic causes such as administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and aural irrigation may play a predisposing role in high-risk populations. The disease can result in cranial polyneuropathies (with facial nerve [VII] paralysis being the most common) and death. The mainstay of treatment is administration of antipseudomonal antibiotics for four to eight weeks. Recurrence is common, and mortality remains at about 20 percent despite antibiotic therapy. Given the increasing longevity of diabetic patients, the frequency of this disease is increasing. Internists, family practitioners, and ambulatory care physicians must now be cognizant of the presenting symptoms, while infectious disease specialists and otolaryngologists need to be appraised of strides in diagnosis and therapy. The role of surgery should be minimized. Use of new diagnostic radiologic modalities and new antipseudomonal antibiotics discussed in this review should lead to improved outcome.","['Rubin J', 'Yu VL']",1988,85,3,Am J Med,"Rubin J and Yu VL.

2841262,Hyperfractionated radiotherapy in brain stem tumors: results of a Pediatric Oncology Group study.,"Between September 1984 and January 1986, 38 patients were entered onto the first phase of a Pediatric Oncology Group study designed to test the feasibility of treating children with brain stem tumors with hyperfractioned (twice daily) radiotherapy, to assess the early and late morbidity and efficacy of such treatment, and to test the feasibility of dose escalation in this group of patients. Of the 34 patients considered eligible after neuroradiology review, two did not complete planned radiotherapy because of progressive disease; both died of disease at 4 weeks and 9 months following initiation of treatment. The remainder were treated with 1.1 Gy twice daily, with an interval of 4 to 6 hours, to a total dose of 66 Gy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks. The majority of patients (24/34, 71%) improved clinically during the course of treatment; two remained stable, seven deteriorated, and for one the clinical response was unknown. By CT scan and/or MRI, no patient showed complete regression of disease; five showed a partial response to treatment, twenty fell into a stable disease category, eight patients developed progressive disease by the time of their first follow-up radiologic examination, and one patient was not evaluable for response, having been lost to follow-up immediately after completion of treatment. All five patients who achieved partial response and 17/20 patients in the stable, disease category subsequently progressed, after a median interval of 6.5 months. The median survival time was 11 months and survival at 1 year was 48% (SE 0.08). Morbidity of treatment consisted of an enhanced skin reaction in three patients, otitis media and/or externa in nine, and complications related to steroid intake in four, including diabetic ketoacidosis (two patients), Pneumocystis pneumonia (one patient), and disseminated varicella (one patient). Protracted use of steroids in 13 patients was associated in all instances with non responding or progressive disease. No patient developed signs or symptoms suggestive of CNS damage, and tissue obtained by biopsy at the time of progression in three patients and at autopsy in five failed to demonstrate any evidence of injury attributable to the radiotherapy. A dose escalation to 70.2 Gy in 60 fractions over 6 weeks was implemented as planned.","['Freeman CR', 'Krischer J', 'Sanford RA', 'Burger PC', 'Cohen M', 'Norris D']",1988,15,2,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"Freeman CR, et al.

3411213,Necrotizing external otitis treated with ciprofloxacin. A case report.,"Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis is a severe infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa which occurs mainly in elderly diabetics or in immuno-depressed patients (Chandler, 1968). The management of this condition requires the association between an aminoglycoside antibiotic and an antipseudomonal beta-lactamic, given parenterally during a 4 to 6 week period. Sometimes it is necessary to continue the therapy for months until there is no evidence of residual disease (Strauss et al., 1982). Ciprofloxacin is a quinolone with antipseudomonal activity which can be taken orally, and it is a useful alternative to the current treatment. The authors report a case of necrotizing external otitis which was successfully treated with ciprofloxacin.","['Sabater F', 'Mensa J', 'Doménech J', 'Loncá M', 'Carulla M']",1988,102,7,J Laryngol Otol,"Sabater F, et al.

Because otitis media frequently accompanies chronic nonresponsive otitis externa, one of the above procedures may be combined with operative procedures of the external ear canal. Also, gentle selective curettage of the tympanic cavity may be combined with either lateral or ventral bulla osteotomy in the treatment of otitis media and interna. The choice of surgical procedure(s) should be based on the condition of the external ear canal (vertical and horizontal parts), the duration of clinical signs, response to previous surgery, and the familiarity of the surgeon with the different approaches and techniques. With the increased reporting of long-term results following surgical management of otitis externa, media, and interna, more meaningful conclusions concerning selection of surgical procedure may be made in the future.",['Boothe HW'],1988,18,4,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,Boothe HW.

3264961,Diseases of the pinna.,"Many diseases can affect the pinna of the dog and cat. These diseases represent most categories of cutaneous disease, from infectious to neoplastic. Although some diseases affect primarily the pinna, most pinnal dermatoses occur in conjunction with other integumentary disorders. One should approach the diagnostic work-up of pinnal disease in an organized manner, obtaining first a thorough history and physical examination. A systematic approach is required in the diagnostic evaluation in order to arrive at a tentative or definitive diagnosis. Skin scrapings, cytologic examination, and culture for dermatophytes provide the minimum database. A variety of diagnostic tests, including hematology, serum biochemical profiles, urinalysis, serology, intradermal skin testing, hypoallergenic diet trials, histopathology, and direct immunofluorescence, may be necessary in some cases before a definitive diagnosis is reached. The ears are somewhat difficult to biopsy, although in many instances histopathologic examination is essential to the diagnosis. In this author's opinion, it is preferable to use a no. 15 scalpel blade rather than a punch biopsy when obtaining a pinnal biopsy. This allows the veterinarian to obtain an elliptical or wedge biopsy, which can frequently be sutured. In some instances, biopsies are required from the ear margin and a full ear thickness biopsy is obtained. Sutures may not hold in this situation, and cautery may be necessary for hemostasis. As in other situations in which the ear is bleeding (aural hematomas, vasculitis, fly bite dermatitis, and so on), bandaging and immobilization of the ear may be necessary to prevent further trauma. Although symptomatic therapy is sometimes helpful when treating pinnal diseases, a definitive diagnosis is preferred. This is especially important following the second or third presentation of an animal for ear disease. Although ear diseases are frequently viewed as a nuisance rather than a serious condition, anyone who has owned or worked closely with an animal suffering from chronic otitis externa should appreciate the animal's discomfort and the owner's frustration. All too frequently, the chronic otitis externa is the result of a hypersensitivity (either inhalant or food) that has been overlooked in the attempt to treat the subsequent infectious otitis. Thus, in animals with recurrent otitis externa, every attempt should be made to identify and treat the underlying etiology.",['Angarano DW'],1988,18,4,Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract,Angarano DW.

Destruction of the bony meatus and mastoid and obliteration of normal soft-tissue planes at the skull base were documented by computed tomographic scans. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from the external meatus and deep tissue specimens. Fungal invasion of bone and soft tissue was confirmed histopathologically. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was never isolated. This case is unusual from both the standpoint of etiology and host susceptibility in that the patient had no apparent underlying disease.

3049472,[Otologic aspects of diving].,"Ear diseases are the most common of all occupational diseases of diving. Otitis externa is the most frequent and troublesome infection in divers especially when the environment is humid. During compression, failure to equalize the pressure of the air-filled cavities surrounded by bone (middle ear, sinus) deprives the middle ear (or sinus) of aeration. Middle ear barotrauma is the most common barotrauma encountered in divers while external ear barotrauma (reversed ear) and inner ear barotrauma (with rupture of the round or oval window) are less common. Decompression sickness (Caisson disease) is primarily the result of inert gas bubbles; deafness and vertigo may result if the inner ear is involved. The most dramatic cause of disorientation under water is that due to vertigo. This vertigo is commonly a transient effect due to unequal caloric stimulation of the two labyrinths. The physical examination of the ear and nose necessary for assessment of diving fitness are discussed.

3348895,Conchomeatoplasty for chronic otitis externa.,"Chronic moisture is a major cause of chronic otitis externa (COE). Moisture combined with inadequate lubrication of the stratum corneum and retention of keratin debris promote bacterial and fungal growth. In most cases of COE, creating a well-aerated, dry, self-cleaning external auditory canal prevents further infection. This can usually be accomplished by medical treatment that includes suction and swabbing. Antibiotic-steroid ear drops control infection and inflammation. Alcohol flush and warm-air ventilation dry the canal, and a hydrophobic cream lubricates and seals the stratum corneum from moisture, fungus, and bacteria. An anatomic variation, a narrow external auditory meatus leading to poor ventilation, is frequently associated with COE, which does not respond to conventional therapy. A previously unreported simple lateral conchomeatoplasty is presented. No other described meatoplasty corrects both the conchal cartilage projection and inadequate meatal skin circumference which, together, cause the small meatus.

2966158,Mafenide-induced pseudochondritis.,"Wound infections following burns of the ear can result in the devastating complication of chondritis, requiring resection of cartilage. To prevent this, it has become common practice to dress the burned ear with mafenide acetate. We have observed six hypersensitivity reactions to the mafenide that occurred following several weeks of continuous use of the drug. The reaction mimics chondritis, causing edematous, erythematous, pruritic ears with a profuse serous exudate. There is no associated fever, systemic signs, or pain on motion of the cartilage. Treatment consists of stopping the mafenide. Recovery occurs within 72 hours. Differentiating between chondritis, with its required surgical and antibiotic treatment, and a hypersensitivity reaction is necessary to avoid further iatrogenic injury.","['Perry AW', 'Gottlieb LJ', 'Krizek TJ', 'Parsons RW', 'Goodwin CW', 'Finkelstein JL', 'Madden MR']",1988,9,2,J Burn Care Rehabil,"Perry AW, et al.

This long established easy microbiological method was compared with culture and sensitivity tests. For this purpose 549 Gram's stains were performed on 384 patients. In 88.8% of the cases Gram's stains gave reliable information in a few minutes so that a correct and effective antimicrobial treatment could be started. In 5.7% no pathogen could be found using a Gram's stain, probably because the concentration was too low (10(5)/ml) whereas a pathogen could be cultured in these cases. However culture revealed microbiological information in 11.5% of the cases that was unreliable or even misleading in deciding treatment. In conclusion, Gram's stain is a very cheap, quick and easy method which has been forgotten by many clinicians but which is sufficient as the only microbiological method in uncomplicated ENT infections and is of great importance for a correct interpretation of the results of culture in severe infections. In life-threatening cases it may even be of a crucial value.","['Feidt H', 'Koch A', 'Federspil P']",1987,35,11,HNO,"Feidt H, et al.

Comparison of monotherapy vs combination therapy.,"Twenty patients with adult-onset diabetes mellitus and malignant external otitis (MEO) were treated at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, over a seven-year period (August 1976 to October 1983). A retrospective analysis compared patients who received an antipseudomonal cephalosporin as monotherapy (group A) with those who received conventional antipseudomonal therapy (group B). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in all patients. Differences (group B less than group A) included insulin dependence, underlying vascular disease, total number of cranial nerve palsies or paresis, and surgical procedures. The overall clinical outcome was similar in both groups; 64% of patients in group A (7/11) and 70% in group B (7/10) were cured at a follow-up period of five to 57 months. A more favorable outcome was found in patients with less extensive infection in both groups.

3664417,Otitis externa associated with aquatic activities (swimmer's ear).,"Infections of the ear canal may vary in terms of severity. Their frequency and morbidity qualify them as significant aquatic problems. The aquatic environment adds the conditional variable of moisture to the ear canal. Usually bacteria are introduced with the moisture and in the warm environment of the canal multiply, generate debris, invade the canal lining, and generate the symptoms of otitis externa. Fortunately, the incidence of this condition can be minimized by eliminating moisture in the canal. In situations where excessive moisture is likely to be introduced such as in swimmers, scuba divers, and deep sea divers the prophylactic measures of desiccation and acidification of the canal should be used. They are very effective. In the saturation diver, ear canal infections are not likely to resolve without interruption of diving activities. Individuals who have recurring ear canal infections require evaluation by an ear specialist to identify possible remedial problems that can trigger infection. Correction of anatomical problems or underlying dermatoses can prevent recurrences of OE.","['Strauss MB', 'Dierker RL']",1987,5,3,Clin Dermatol,Strauss MB and Dierker RL.

Of these, thirty five were regarded as being of probable pathogenetic significance. These included seven isolates associated with chromoblastomycosis, and seven isolates thought to be causing phaeohyphomycosis. There were six strains of Phaeoannellomyces werneckii and five strains of Sporothrix schenckii. Seven isolates, all strains of Aureobasidium pullulans, were associated with fungal peritonitis in patients on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Two Bipolaris isolates were associated with paranasal sinus fungus ball, a condition in which no evidence of tissue invasion by fungi could be found, even though pressure necrosis of bone could lead to very serious consequences. A further seven dematiaceous hyphomycetes, isolated from cases of paranasal fungus ball, keratitis and otitis externa, were thought to be of possible pathogenetic significance. Of the remaining 514 isolates thought to be of no pathogenetic significance, two thirds were made up of strains of Aureobasidium pullulans, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Epicoccum purpurascens and Phoma species.

3106547,The diagnostic criteria of malignant external otitis.,"The diagnostic criteria of malignant external otitis (MEO) have been reviewed. They were divided into two categories: obligatory and occasional. The obligatory criteria are: pain, edema, exudate, granulations, microabscess (when operated), positive bone scan or failure of local treatment often more than 1 week, and possibly pseudomonas in culture. The occasional criteria are diabetes, cranial nerve involvement, positive radiograph, debilitating condition and old age. All of the obligatory criteria must be present in order to establish the diagnosis. The presence of occasional criteria alone does not establish it. The importance of Tc99 scan in detecting osteomyelitis is stressed. When bone scan is not available, a trial of 1-3 weeks of local treatment is suggested. Failure to respond to such treatment may assist in making the diagnosis of MEO.","['Cohen D', 'Friedman P']",1987,101,3,J Laryngol Otol,Cohen D and Friedman P.

3106545,Malignant external otitis.,"During the years 1972-1985, 50 patients with malignant external otitis (MEO) were seen in our department. All our patients complained of severe earache; they presented initially with an apparently simple external otitis, but failed to improve when the usual measures were adopted. They all presented with granulation tissue in the external ear canal, and five of our patients had multiple cranial nerve involvement. MEO is in effect a severe external otitis which, if untreated, proceeds towards an osteomyelitis of the skull base. MEO is more prevalent in the summer, when external otitis is rampant. In some years, a relatively large number of these patients appear; in others there are none. The reason for this is unknown. In Israel, the disease is more prevalent in Jews than in Arabs. Diabetes was present in 68 per cent of our patients-severe diabetes in 42 per cent, mild diabetes in 26 per cent but 32 per cent of our patients were diabetes-free. The only otological past history in our patients was of a recent traumatic insult to the external ear canal; this was the case in about 8 per cent of them. Today, the treatment of choice of this important disease is local debridement supplemented by appropriate antibiotic treatment for 6-8 weeks. This should include some semi-synthetic penicillin to which pseudomonas aeruginosa is sensitive, combined with an appropriate aminoglycoside. During the earlier years of our encounter with MEO, two of our 10 patients died of it; later on, when we learned better how to treat it, the mortality rate decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Babiatzki A', 'Sadé J']",1987,101,3,J Laryngol Otol,Babiatzki A and Sadé J.

However, to our knowledge, no formal studies have actually compared bone scans of otherwise young, healthy patients with severe external otitis to scans of patients with clinical presentation of malignant external otitis. Twelve patients with only severe external otitis were studied with Technetium99 Diphosphate and were compared to known cases of malignant otitis. All scans were evaluated by two neuroradiologists with no prior knowledge of the clinical status of the patients. Nine of the 12 patients had positive bone scans with many scans resembling those reported with ""malignant"" external otitis. Interestingly, there was no consistent correlation between the severity of clinical presentation and the amount of Technetium uptake.

3782787,Bacterial and mycotic otological infections in Singapore.,"This paper describes a microbiological study of 84 young adult men with clinical otitic infections. Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were frequently isolated from these patients diagnosed as having otitis externa or chronic suppurative otitis media, of which Pseudomonas species predominated. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and aerobic Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids) were also found. About 40% of ear infections were attributed to otomycoses, chiefly from Aspergillus species and Candida parapsilosis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolates revealed that Pseudomonas species were generally resistant to antibiotics commonly employed in general practice: ampicillin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and cephaloridine. However, polymyxin B, gentamicin and neomycin were active against some Pseudomonas isolates. Other Gram-negative bacilli were also mainly sensitive to gentamicin, neomycin as well as co-trimoxazole. Disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration studies demonstrated good activity of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, tobramycin and carbenicillin against strains of Pseudomonas species and other Gram-negative rods. Cefotaxime and cefoxitin were active against Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas species. Beta-lactamase production did not appear to be the main mechanism of resistance in these community-acquired Gram-negative bacillary isolates. The antimicrobial therapy of otological infections is reviewed.","['Chow VT', 'Ho B', 'Hong GS', 'Liu TC']",1986,97,2,J Hyg (Lond),"Chow VT, et al.

Structural changes were observed for up to five months from the time of anesthetic application. The most protracted changes affect the lamina propria, which exhibits a pronounced thickening. The extent of the changes, however, differs according to the agent used; for example, phenol applied to discrete areas exhibited the least widespread changes. In the tympanic portion of the lamina propria, the connective tissue was loosely packed with less regularly arranged collagen fibers, while a tightly packed fiber bundle existed on the meatal side. It is inferred that the submucosal connective tissue layer is the portion of the connective tissue layer where the remodeling and reconstruction of the fibrous layer occur.","['Schmidt SH', 'Hellström S']",1986,7,5,Am J Otolaryngol,Schmidt SH and Hellström S.

Infections included sepsis in 14, nonbacteremic urinary infections in nine, pneumonia in five, intra-abdominal infection in five, fasciitis in one, and malignant otitis externa in one. The average age of this group was 64.3 years, 25 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases, and their average serum creatinine level was 5.2 mg/dl. Infections were caused by Enterobacteriaceae in 23 patients, Streptococcus faecalis in five, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in four, Staphylococcus aureus in four, Hemophilus influenzae in three, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridium sordelli in one each. Overall, 32 patients had clinical and microbiologic cures, two had improvement, and one had failure. Hypoprothrombinemia occurred in 18 of 28 patients not given vitamin K for prophylaxis and occurred more often in those with serum albumin concentrations below 3.5 g/dl. Prothrombin times returned to normal within 36 hours of treatment with vitamin K, although two patients experienced mild hematemesis. In anicteric patients with liver function abnormalities, 2 g every 12 hours produced peak and trough serum concentrations that averaged 254 and 125 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared with 179.5 and 19.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, in five with normal liver function test results. In jaundiced patients treated with 1 g every 12 hours, trough concentrations were comparably elevated. Serum concentrations did not correlate with hypoprothrombinemia, but high levels throughout the dosing interval may have contributed to the excellent cure rate in this study.","['Sattler FR', 'Colao DJ', 'Caputo GM', 'Schoolwerth AC']",1986,81,2,Am J Med,"Sattler FR, et al.

They were suffering from septicaemia (9), obstructed UTI (8), non-obstructed urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (6), infected burns (4) or malignant otitis externa (3). Many patients had important aggravating factors such as renal transplantation, peritoneal or haemodialysis, leukaemia, extensive burns, renal stones, tracheostomy and diabetes. Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21), Escherichia coli (7), and other Enterobacteriaceae (6). Twenty-four pathogens (13 P. aeruginosa) were ticarcillin-resistant. Thirty-six patients were clinically cured including all cases of malignant otitis externa, infected burns and non-obstructed urinary tract infection. Three patients improved and one patient with obstructed urinary tract infection failed. In 32 patients the pathogen was eradicated, in one patient it persisted and in seven it reappeared. In particular, 11 of 13 patients with infections due to ticarcillin-resistant P. aeruginosa were cured and two improved. There was, however, bacteriological relapse in five. There were no side-effects or evidence of toxicity in any of the patients. In an in-vitro study a synergistic effect between ticarcillin and clavulanate was noted against Enterobacteriaceae but only a slight synergistic effect against P. aeruginosa.

Forty-eight patients received an oral dose of 500 mg or 750 mg b.i.d. and five patients an i.v. dose of 200 mg b.i.d., while 19 patients were given both oral and parenteral doses. The duration of therapy ranged from seven days to more than four months. The MICs of ciprofloxacin for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated were in the range less than 0.06-2 mg/l; 36% of the strains were resistant to all other available antibiotics. At follow-up after a minimum of six months the clinical success rate was 75% and the infecting organism was permanently eradicated in 49% of the patients. In nine patients the organism developed resistance, particularly when the initial MIC was higher than 0.5 mg/l. No significant adverse reactions were observed. Ciprofloxacin is the first antipseudomonal antimicrobial agent which can be administered orally and therefore fulfills a need in chemotherapy.","['Giamarellou H', 'Galanakis N', 'Dendrinos C', 'Stefanou J', 'Daphnis E', 'Daikos GK']",1986,5,2,Eur J Clin Microbiol,"Giamarellou H, et al.

Drugs were administered orally and topically either 30 min prior to AA or 30 min after TPA, except for steroids which were administered 2.5-3 hr prior to AA. Several cyclooxygenase (CO) inhibitors including indomethacin, aspirin, piroxicam and timegadine were without effect when administered orally against either irritant; the same drugs inhibited TPA edema when they were administered topically. Mixed CO/lipoxygenase (LO) inhibitors, phenidone and BW755C, were active orally against AA edema (ED50S of 84 and 65 mg/kg, respectively) and against TPA edema (ED50S of 235 and 88 mg/kg, respectively). Phenidone was more active topically against AA edema (ED50, 0.1 mg/ear) than BW755C (ED50, 2.8 mg/ear); however, BW755C was more active topically against TPA edema (ED50, 0.2 mg/ear) than phenidone (ED50, 0.6 mg/ear).

MK-447 was topically and orally effective only in the TPA model. Not surprisingly, drugs were more effective topically than orally in both mouse ear edema assays. The models were somewhat selective for CO and CO/LO inhibitors; however, dapsone was orally effective in the ear models, and a number of mediator antagonists and CNS drugs, especially anti-psychotics, were topically active primarily against TPA edema.

To date, we have examined over 500 patients with this modality and have found it also to be effective in the evaluation of other osseous and soft tissue abnormalities. An overview of temporomandibular joint pathology is presented, including the range of osteoarthritic changes from spur formation to complete fusion. Anterior dislocation, with and without reduction, and closed lock are demonstrated. A heretofore unreported phenomenon--posterior dislocation of the meniscus with open lock--is presented.

3851782,Pool-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa dermatitis and other bathing-associated infections.,"The growing popularity of heated pools, especially whirlpools and hot tubs, has been accompanied by increasingly frequent outbreaks of an illness produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The illness usually includes folliculitis, pruritic skin rash, and/or otitis externa and occasionally mastitis and systemic symptoms. Although usually self-limited, rare severe cases have been described. Motel and hotel whirlpools are most often implicated as the source of outbreaks. The relative importance of pool conditions and the bacteriology of P. aeruginosa in the pathogenesis of this illness remain to be elucidated. Implementing CDC Guidelines for public spas and hot tubs seem the most reasonable way of reducing the risk of large outbreaks. Prevention of cases arising from home hot tubs or whirlpools will be very difficult and may depend on extensive public education or the development of simple, inexpensive and effective disinfection systems.",['Jacobson JA'],1985,6,10,Infect Control,Jacobson JA.

Often the disease is self-inflicted; insertion of an object into the canal in an attempt to clean the ear interferes with the ear's own cleansing mechanism and causes inflammation and infection. Swimmers, persons who wear a hearing aid, and persons who have had an ear disorder are especially prone to infection and may need to take special precautions. Appropriate treatment, including instillation of drops, cleansing of the canal, and drug therapy, usually prevents recurrence.

Four strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 reference strain and 3 clinical isolates from cases of external otitis were employed. Two of the clinical isolates were from saturation divers who were using Otic Domeboro. Otic Domeboro solution was bactericidal even when diluted 1:2 in serum or broth. There were no significant differences between strains. There was no measurable inoculum effect. Survival kinetic analysis showed 60% killing at 5 min and 99.9% killing at about 2 h. Otic Domeboro is an effective anti-P. aeruginosa agent. There was no evidence of increased resistance among strains isolated from divers. The rate of killing in relation to usual prophylactic recommendations suggests that frequent dripping may be more effective. The therapeutic use of Otic Domeboro in saturation diving should be evaluated to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotic drops.",['Dibb WL'],1985,12,3,Undersea Biomed Res,Dibb WL.

We studied the histopathology of the external auditory canal in 13 temporal bones from 10 patients who had undergone irradiation for head and neck tumors. The pathologic changes noted could be divided into: bony changes, and soft tissue changes. Bony changes manifested were those of resorption, fibrosis, empty lacunae, and sequestration. There were five soft tissue changes: the formation of a secondary cholesteatoma, ulceration of the lining epithelium with resorption of the underlying bone, thickened epithelium in the canal as well as in the tympanic membrane, subepithelial fibrosis, and atrophic ceruminous glands. Clinically these changes can be manifested as a persistent otitis externa, with otorrhea and otalgia.","['Adler M', 'Hawke M', 'Berger G', 'Harwood A']",1985,14,4,J Otolaryngol,"Adler M, et al.

4025537,Prognostic implications of therapy for necrotizing external otitis.,"Necrotizing external otitis is a slowly progressive infection of the ear canal and basal skull caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment with aminoglycoside and antipseudomonal penicillin antibiotics significantly reduces extension of infection, decreases the severity of the associated cranial nerve injury, and limits disease-related mortality. Combined antimicrobial and surgical treatment appears to be more efficacious than antibiotics alone when evaluated for comparable stages of the disease. However, invasive surgical procedures may promote the spread of infection, particularly in the absence of appropriate antibiotic therapy. A high index of suspicion for the syndrome should be aroused when external otitis is present for longer than two weeks, especially after local debridement and topical antibiotic treatment. Aggressive use of systemic antibiotic therapy in diabetic patients, who are at greatest risk, should reduce disease extension and lessen the need for multiple surgical procedures.","['Corey JP', 'Levandowski RA', 'Panwalker AP']",1985,6,4,Am J Otol,"Corey JP, et al.

The indications for computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone have been significantly expanded with the inclusion of soft-tissue abnormalities of the external ear and the auditory canal. Soft-tissue abnormalities of the EAC that can be evaluated with CT include atresia, edema, hemorrhage, fracture, posttraumatic or infection-caused keloid, malignant external otitis, hemangioma, lymphangioma, papilloma, keratosis obturans, acquired cholesteatoma, adenoma, ceruminoma, fibroma, mixed tumor, sarcoma, and basal cell, squamous cell, or adenocystic carcinoma. CT scans of 25 patients who had soft-tissue abnormalities of the EAC were reviewed. The clinical data were correlated with the radiographic findings. We conclude that CT is the best overall radiographic modality for evaluating the extent and character of soft-tissue abnormalities of the EAC.

3906166,[Study of clinical bacteriological efficacy in a cefmenoxime ototopical solution].,"One percent cefmenoxime (CMX) ototopical solution was administered to 302 patients with purulent otitis media and acute diffuse external otitis in open study fashion, and to 216 patients with purulent otitis media in double blind condition. From among the total of 518 cases various bacteria were detected, except 22 of negative detection after incubation and 3 of impossible determination. The main bacteria detected from the above 493 cases were S. aureus (242 strains = 49.1%), P. aeruginosa (105 strains = 21.3%), S. epidermidis (67 strains = 13.6%), Proteus spp. (indole positive) (31 strains = 6.3%) and P. mirabilis (24 strains = 4.9%) as well as anaerobic bacteria (26 strains = 5.3%). MIC of CMX against those bacteria detected was evaluated at 10(8) CFU/ml and 10(6) CFU/ml, respectively, up to the concentration of 800 micrograms/ml, with MIC of cefazolin (CEZ), chloramphenicol (CP) and fradiomycin (FRM) as the references. With respect to the antibacterial action of CMX against S. aureus, MIC50 of CMX was inferior to that of CEZ by 4-fold, but its MIC80 and MIC90 are almost equivalent to those of CEZ. These results were obtained because there existed relatively few CMX highly resistant strains, while more than 20% strains are said to resist cephem antibiotics. As far as MIC of CMX against P. aeruginosa was concerned, the MIC reached its peak with 100 micrograms/ml at the concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml and with 25 micrograms/ml at 10(6) CFU/ml, respectively, which indicated the real antibacterial value of CMX against P. aeruginosa. However, the strains which showed higher MIC of greater than 800 micrograms/ml were rather few, that is, only 8 out of 105 (7.6%). Antibacterial action of CMX against Streptococcus (except Enterococcus), GNR from intestinal bacteria and anaerobic bacteria was favorable, and the stable and strong antibacterial action was shown against C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens and Proteus spp. (indole positive) which produce chromosome mediated beta-lactamase. On the other hand, the antibacterial action of CMX against GNF-GNR except P. aeruginosa was unfavorable for P. cepacia, P. putida and A. xylosoxidans, but relatively favorable for A. calcoaceticus. As a result of MIC evaluation of reference drugs, S. aureus was resistant to CEZ, and Proteus spp. (indole-positive) was resistant to CP, while FRM was highly resisted by almost all strains of bacteria. However, the resistance rate of S. aureus to CP was relatively low, that is, as low as 16.1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Deguchi K', 'Fukayama S', 'Nishimura Y', 'Nishike A', 'Oda S', 'Sato S', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Ikegami R', 'Yokota N', 'Tanaka S']",1985,38,7,Jpn J Antibiot,"Deguchi K, et al.

The outer, middle and inner ears made up 64.6% with a surprising 23.9% being related to the lower jaw, its teeth, attached muscles and the temporo-mandibular joint. Of the remaining, 3.1% were related to the nose, 6.6% to the sinuses and there was a miscellaneous group of 1.8%. Most outer ear infections seemed to be self-inflicted whilst the middle ear conditions were due to dysfunction of the Eustachian tube. The middle ear conditions were prevented by reducing nasal congestion as by cauterising the inferior turbinates of the nose, or by giving counselling in the technique of clearing the ears. Apart from Eustachian tube dysfunction in some, there is no clear lead as to causation of the inner ear complaints. Nasal treatment also relieves blockage of the ostia of the sinuses and thus sinus barotrauma. Overall the commonest preventable cause appears to be nasal congestion due to a variable mixture of infective or vasomotor rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, unilateral hypertrophy and a deviated nasal septum.",['Roydhouse N'],1985,10,2,Can J Appl Sport Sci,"Roydhouse N. 1001 disorders of the ear, nose and sinuses in scuba divers. 1001 disorders of the ear, nose and sinuses in scuba divers. 1985; 10:99-103.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4017159/

Under normal atmospheric conditions (1 ATA), this adhesion increased significantly when the temperature rose from 22 to 37 degrees C. Under hyperbaric atmosphere (= air, 7 ATA) conditions, a similar, significant enhancement of bacterial adhesion to the cells was noted when the temperature rose. If the temperature was kept stable at 22 or 37 degrees C and the pressure was increased from 1 to 7 ATA, a pressure-induced enhancement was observed. This was statistically significant, at both temperature levels. Temperature-induced or -stimulated adhesion may help to explain some outbreaks of P. aeruginosa infections, for instance in whirlpools. The enhancement of this phenomenon under hyperbaric atmosphere conditions could have some relevance to recurrent P. aeruginosa otitis externa, a most common nuisance among professional divers.","['Berdal BP', 'Bjøro K', 'Bukholm G', 'Ogaard AR']",1985,93,2,Acta Pathol Microbiol Immunol Scand B,"Berdal BP, et al.

2983156,Immunologic aspects of otologic disease: an overview.,"The immunologic explosion has now reached the field of otology. By having better techniques to measure the changes at cellular and molecular levels, it is now possible to devise experiments to show morphologic anatomic changes as well as functional changes. The demonstration in 1980 (M.S.) that tympanosclerosis could be induced immunologically represents a concrete advancement in immunologic thinking in conceptualization of otologic disease. In 1974, one of the authors (M.S.) published work dealing with the treatment of vasculitis of immunologic origin for sudden hearing loss. This was aimed at inhibiting the complement cascade from starting its destructive action. Recently, the immunologic challenge in animals demonstrated by changes in the inner ear was shown by one of the authors (T.J.Y.). Such changes were compatible with labyrinthine hydrops, or Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, and sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.","['Schiff M', 'Yoo TJ']",1985,95,3,Laryngoscope,Schiff M and Yoo TJ.

Twelve cases that illustrate the problems associated with the clinical recognition and successful outcome of the condition were reviewed. The patients' average age was 62.5 years, and they had been ill for an average of 1.8 months before admission to hospital. Predisposing factors included diabetes, swimming in a warm climate and the use of a hearing aid. Radionuclide bone scanning and surgical exploration revealed pathognomonic findings. Initial therapy was often suboptimal: one or more relapses occurred in seven of the patients. All of the patients were cured without relapse after a minimum of 4 weeks of therapy with tobramycin plus an anti-Pseudomonas penicillin. The average duration of the illness was 3.9 months. The outcome in invasive external otitis should be excellent if the condition is diagnosed early and appropriate therapy is instituted.","['Salit IE', 'McNeely DJ', 'Chait G']",1985,132,4,Can Med Assoc J,"Salit IE, et al.

They were suffering from upper urinary tract infection (15), abscesses (hepatic 1, intra-abdominal 5, retroperitoneal 1, soft tissue, deep soft tissue infection (9), chronic otitis media in exacerbation (3), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (3), bronchopneumonia (3) and otitis externa (1). Pathogens included P. aeruginosa (29), E. cloacae (7), P. mirabilis, E. coli (3) and S. marcescens (1), with MICs for ciprofloxacin ranging from 0.003-2 micrograms/ml. Over half of the isolates were multiresistant, also to amikacin, with almost all the Pseudomonas strains resistant to carbenicillin and the ureidopenicillins. In 21 patients ciprofloxacin was given orally at a dose of 500 mg or 750 mg 12-hourly, in 5 patients i.v. at a dose of 200 mg 12-hourly; while in 16 patients treatment was started i.v. and was continued by the oral route. Seventeen patients were given ciprofloxacin for 7-14 days, 5 for 15-22 days, 4 for 23-28 days, 8 for 29-42 days, and 8 for greater than 42 days. Treatment response was considered clinically as cure in 30 (71.5%) patients, improvement in 8 (19%) and failed in 4 (9.5%). Pathogens were eradicated during treatment in 34 (81%), persisted in 8 (19%) and recurred in 11 (26.2%) patients. Development of resistance was observed in one patient only.

The peak incidence occurs in the summer and early fall months of the year. Exposure to water, previous use of ear drops, and cotton-tipped applicators predisposed to both acute and chronic otitis externa. Hearing aid ear molds appear to be a predisposing factor in the development of chronic otitis externa. Pain, itching, discharge, and hearing loss were the most common presenting complaints in both acute and chronic otitis externa. The discharge in chronic otitis externa is more commonly purulent, whereas in acute otitis externa it is more commonly mucoid. The tympanic membrane is not frequently involved in acute otitis externa; however, in chronic otitis externa changes in the tympanic membrane were more often encountered. Most infections were of a pure bacterial origin, primarily Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Fungi were the causative organisms more commonly in chronic otitis externa than in acute otitis externa (Figure 7). It was found that previous usage of ear drops was more often associated with otomycosis in acute otitis externa and yet was not related to a higher frequency of otomycosis in chronic otitis externa. The presence of a foreign material, such as an ear mold, was associated with a greater frequency of mixed infections (bacteria and fungi) in the group with chronic otitis externa. The presence of a greenish discharge or foul odor was not related to any particular organism.","['Hawke M', 'Wong J', 'Krajden S']",1984,13,5,J Otolaryngol,"Hawke M, et al.

These principles then are applied to an analysis of tympanometric shape (conductance, susceptance, and admittance tympanograms) as a function of probe frequency in subjects with normal middle ear transmission systems. The final section presents tympanometric data from patients with confirmed middle ear pathologies that produce an increase in resonant frequency (e.g., middle ear effusion, otosclerosis, ossicular adhesions, and tympanic membrane retraction) or a decrease in resonant frequency (e.g., otitis externa, serous otitis media, tympanic membrane pathology, and ossicular discontinuity). The advantages and disadvantages of a particular probe frequency and/or admittance component are illustrated with individual cases. The cases further demonstrate that the same tympanometric pattern can be recorded from ears with different pathologies (e.g., tympanic membrane perforation with cholesteatoma, tympanic membrane retraction, ossicular adhesions, and middle ear effusion), and conversely, that the same pathology can result in different tympanometric shapes (e.g., tympanic membrane perforation, middle ear effusion, and otosclerosis).

The protective effect of 2% acetic acid was tested by instilling it in the left ear of all participants. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci were the predominant isolates from the ear samples. After hoods were worn, there was a substantial increase in the number of these organisms in 7 (36.8%) of the external ears. However, an increase in the bacterial counts in the external ear canals occurred in only 2 (10.5%) of the individuals treated prophylactically with acetic acid drops (P less than 0.02).","['Brook I', 'Coolbaugh JC']",1984,94,7,Laryngoscope,Brook I and Coolbaugh JC.

6738082,Pharmacological study of cantharidin-induced ear inflammation in mice.,"Cantharidin applied to the Swiss mouse ear induced a clearly observable inflammatory reaction after 6 hr, maximal after 24 hr, and persisting several days. Desonide and hydrocortisone strongly inhibited the acute (6 hr) and delayed (24 hr) phases after their local application, while, after oral treatment, a reduction in the acute edema was obtained only when using high doses. The cutaneous application of high doses of mepyramine, disodium cromoglycate, methysergide, and (at a quite lower level) cimetidine reduced the 6-hr inflammation. Phenylbutazone and acetylsalicylic acid showed little activity on the same phase after their cutaneous administration. All the nonsteroid compounds produced little or no effect on the 24-hr inflammation after their cutaneous application and were quite inactive on both phases after their systemic treatment. The cantharidin-induced inflammatory reaction in Swiss mouse seems thus to be characterized by two phases. The chronic delayed phase is an example of chronic inflammation without the involvement of immunological processes. Histamine and serotonin might be involved in the acute inflammation.","['Tarayre JP', 'Aliaga M', 'Barbara M', 'Villanova G', 'Caillol V', 'Lauressergues H']",1984,11,4,J Pharmacol Methods,"Tarayre JP, et al.

Epidemiologically, it is worth mentioning that the majority of these infections was not of nosocomial origin: 56 children were infected outside the hospital and 26 during their stay in hospital; 3 neonates were referred directly from the Maternity Unit. Most strains of Ps. aeruginosa, with various serotypes, were sensitive to azlocillin. Twenty-four children received a systemic treatment required by their local or general condition. Azlocillin was used in 24 cases on the basis of positive sensitivity tests and was occasionally combined with topical treatment using antiseptics or the antibiotic itself. Or the 3 failures observed, 2 were due to acquired resistance to azlocillin and 1 to chronic otitis. An incomplete result was obtained in a case of otitis externa caused by a strain of intermediate sensitivity. The remaining 19 cases were cured, including 3 neonates with otitis externa or media, 1 child with otitis externa, 1 with combined otitis externa and media, 10 with otitis media, usually protracted, 2 with mastoiditis medically cured and 1 with superinfection following mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma. Secretions dried up within 3 to 4 days and treatment was discontinued after clinical cure was obtained in 9 to 19 days. Fever, which was present in 7 cases, abated within 2 to 8 days.

Early diagnosis is necessary for successful treatment. This study compares the findings of initial radiographs, thin-section tomography of temporal bone, CT scans of head and neck, technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) and gallium-67 citrate scintigraphy, and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of temporal bone osteomyelitis in ten patients fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria of malignant external otitis. Skull radiographs were negative in all of the eight patients studied. Thin-section tomography was positive in one of the seven patients studied using this modality. CT scanning suggested osteomyelitis in three of nine patients. Both Tc-99m and Ga-67 citrate scintigraphy were positive in 10 of 10 patients. Three patients who were considered to be in clinical remission had positive Tc-99m scans and normal Ga-67 scans.

Most patients had complicating factors such as major surgery, cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease, catheters or anatomical abnormalities. Eighty-seven infectious episodes in 77 patients could be assessed for efficacy. Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 26% of these episodes. Seventy-five per cent of infections were due to Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most frequent. The major sites of infections were the lower respiratory tract (30), the urinary tract (28), the soft tissues (9), the biliary tract (4), bones (4) and the ears (4). Overall, 67% of the patients were cured, 20% improved, 7% relapsed and 6% failed to respond. Among the 27 infections due to Ps aeruginosa, only two failures (in the same patient) and four relapses were recorded. However, in the two failures and in three other cases with persistent Ps. aeruginosa colonisation, the organism had become resistant to ceftazidime. Three failures were recorded in the seven Staphylococcus aureus infections included in this study. Superinfection occurred in four patients. Adverse events included rash (6), Clostridium difficile toxin-induced diarrhoea (3), transaminase elevation (3), weakly positive Coombs test (10). Ceftazidime appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of severe Gram-negative infections, including those caused by Ps. aeruginosa.","['Francioli P', 'Clément M', 'Geroulanos S', 'von Graevenitz A', 'Luthy R', 'Regamey C', 'Stalder H', 'Vogt M', 'Waldvogel FA']",1983,12 Suppl A,,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Francioli P, et al.

The inflammation can spread to surrounding bones (temporal bone, skull base - to the foramen magnum), as well as to neighbouring tissue, such as the parotid gland, the temporo-mandibular joint and soft tissue near the skull base. Most patients are elderly, latent or manifest diabetics. The causative organism was always proved to be Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The disease is called ""malignant"" because of its high mortality rate.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rapidly lysed in this solution. Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris grew in the presence of EDTA-Tris, but to a lesser extent than the controls without these compounds. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for 8 antimicrobial agents with and without EDTA-Tris were determined for E. coli and P. vulgaris. A potentiation effect on E. coli (greater than 50% decrease MIC) was observed when EDTA-Tris was combined with penicillin, oxytetracycline or chloramphenicol. A similar effect was observed with P. vulgaris when combinations of EDTA-Tris plus gentamicin, oxytetracycline, polymyxin-B or triple sulfa were used.

For congenital lesions, appropriate treatment and correction of hearing loss are important concerns. The most common traumatic lesions, subperichondral hematomas and keloids, require accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment to prevent development of further problems. Inflammatory lesions are usually easy to diagnose from the patient's complaints of recent onset of pain, erythema, and edema. Neoplasms, especially squamous cell carcinoma, should be considered in differential diagnosis of a sore that does not heal. When treatment of a periauricular abnormality involves surgery, biopsy, or incision and drainage, care should be taken not to jeopardize the facial nerve.","['Johnson JT', 'Rood SR', 'Newman RK']",1982,72,4,Postgrad Med,"Johnson JT, et al.

In the latest generation of CT scanners, spacial resolution has been reduced to 0.1 cu mm and slice thickness to 1.5 mm. The main advantages of computerized tomography in comparison to multidirectional tomography are the improved contrast of the images and above all the clear demonstration of soft tissue structures and masses within or adjacent to the temporal bone. The following three applications of computerized tomography will be discussed: 1. Evaluation of intratemporal soft tissue masses. Computerized tomography allows differentiation of fluid filled from solid masses and vascular tumors. 2. Assessment of lesions extending outside the temporal bone or into the temporal bone from adjacent structures. In these cases CT will demonstrate the temporal bone involvement and the presence and extension of the intra or extra cranial component of the lesion. 3. Study of the cerebellopontine angle. Computerized tomography with infusion and combined with pneumocisternography comprise the procedure of choice for the diagnosis of acoustic neuromas and other lesions occurring in this area.","['Valvassori GE', 'Mafee MF', 'Dobben GD']",1982,92,5,Laryngoscope,"Valvassori GE, et al.

7077728,Osteomas and exostoses of the external auditory canal - medical and surgical management.,"Osteomas and exostoses have distinct clinical and histopathologic features. Osteomas are usually solitary, pedunculated, bony growths attached to the tympanosquamous or tympanomastoid suture line, characterized histologically by an internal structure of abundant discrete fibrovascular channels surrounded by irregularly oriented lamellated bone. Exostoses are usually multiple, bilaterally symmetrical, broad based elevations of bone involving the tympanic bone. They are histologically characterized by parallel, concentric layers of subperiosteal bone. The infrequent symptoms resulting from these lesions can usually be managed medically; however, on occasion surgical removal is indicated. While surgical removal of the osteoma is usually possible via the external auditory meatus, we recommend that an exostosis be removed utilizing a postauricular approach.","['Kemink JL', 'Graham MD']",1982,11,2,J Otolaryngol,Kemink JL and Graham MD.

6461806,Malignant external otitis: long-term (months) antimicrobial therapy.,"Since Chandler's initial report in 1968 on ""malignant external otitis"" (MEO), this entity has been recognized in its earlier stages with increasing frequency. As a result of this, the availability of new antimicrobial agents, and the judicious use of surgery, there has been an improvement in the results of therapy. There remains, however, a subgroup of patients who continue to experience a significant mortality from this infection. A review and selected discussion of our experience with MEO from 1976 to 1979 is presented. Six patients have been diagnosed and successfully treated for MEO. They presented with problems ranging from severe otalgia to multiple cranial neuropathy. For the most part, therapy consisted of the now standard aminoglycoside and carbenicillin combination. Two of the patients were in the high mortality risk group. One of these patients developed an osteomyelitis which extended across the skull base resulting in bilateral cranial neuropathies. His therapy included surgery as well as long-term (months) outpatient treatment with tobramycin and carbenicillin with an excellent result. The second patient was treated similarly.

Improvement with ascorbic acid.,"Malignant external otitis (MEO) is a rare disease due to a Pseudomonas infection of the external ear occurring in an elderly patient with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Its high mortality raises the question of an alteration of the defense mechanisms of the body. A 58-year-old man was affected with MEO, and after several months of unsuccessful treatment, a study of the function of his polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes (PMNs) revealed a defect of the migration capability. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was proved in vitro to be able to improve the results of the migration test. The patient was treated for one month with ascorbic acid and, parallel to the normalization of the chemotaxis test results, the ear lesions healed. The mechanism of such an alteration of the PMN function, implying several factors (the active infection, old age, and diabetes mellitus), is still unclear. Nevertheless, it is certainly important to test the PMN function in patients with MEO and treat them with immunomodulators.","['Corberand J', 'Nguyen F', 'Fraysse B', 'Enjalbert L']",1982,108,2,Arch Otolaryngol,"Corberand J, et al.

7099575,Otitis externa - bacteriological survey.,"Otitis externa is one of the most common problems faced by the otolaryngologist, and in some clinics constitutes up to 40% of patients. Although not lethal, it may be a most debilitating disease. The external ear is an epithelium-lined cul-de-sac with many sweat and cerumeniferous glands whose secretions are an excellent medium for bacterial growth. Bacterial surveys done in the USA and in Israel 30 years ago proved Staphylococcus aureus to be the major pathogen. During the years the major pathogen changed, and in recent surveys Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be the dominant pathogenic bacterium. The purpose of this article is to present the results of a bacteriological survey done in Israel on patients suffering from otitis externa in the years 1979-1980. A discussion is presented with regard to the meaning of the review. We tried to establish whether a certain factor could be considered to be the cause of otitis externa.","['Feinmesser R', 'Wiesel YM', 'Argaman M', 'Gay I']",1982,44,3,ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,"Feinmesser R, et al.

Fifty-five patients (mean age 36.6 +/- 22.1 years) with sixty infected ears with otorrhoea complicating otitis externa, recurrent otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation, or infected mastoid cavities and post-operative tympanoplasties, were treated for 14 days with either an aqueous solution of gentamicin 0.3% or an aqueous suspension of colistin 0.3%, neomycin 0.33% and hydrocortisone 1.0%. The two possible treatments were assigned randomly and the results were assessed double-blind using usual ordinal scales for monitoring the severity of symptoms. Both otic preparations were found to be equally safe in the treatment of otorrhoea due to infection. No side-effects were observed and hearing status was either unchanged or improved. The antibiotic-steroid combination appeared to be more effective in relieving inflammation in a shorter period of time while gentamicin was observed to be more effective in eradicating the infecting organisms.","['Gydé MC', 'Norris D', 'Kavalec EC']",1982,10,5,J Int Med Res,"Gydé MC, et al.

7282749,Invasive external otitis. Report of 21 cases and review of the literature.,"We report 21 cases of invasive external otitis and review 130 cases from the English literature. Invasive external otitis is the term that most appropriately describes the locally invasive Pseudomonas infections that begins in the external ear canal, breaches the epithelial barrier and results in signs of local subcutaneous tissue invasion. Nineteen patients were diabetic. FIfteen of these 19 had preexistent, long-standing diabetes (average 15.8 years) and 10 had microvascular disease. Studies of the skin of the temporal bone in two patients provided evidence of diabetic microangiopathy of the dermal capillaries. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the involved area in all cases. All patients without neurologic deficits survived, compared with six of nine with deficits of the central nervous system. All 13 patients in whom initial therapy was successful received a combination of an aminoglycoside and a semisynthetic penicillin, whereas all six episodes of recurrent disease occurred when only one antibiotic was used. The overall mortality was 15 percent (three of 20 in whom the long-term outcome is known). We propose that diabetic microangiopathy of the skin of the temporal bone results in poor local perfusion and creates an environment well suited for invasion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There is a good correlation between the extent of disease clinically and prognosis. Effective treatment requires early diagnosis and combination therapy with an aminoglycoside and a semisynthetic penicillin.","['Doroghazi RM', 'Nadol JB', 'Hyslop NE', 'Baker AS', 'Axelrod L']",1981,71,4,Am J Med,"Doroghazi RM, et al.

The specimens were obtained by an en bloc excision of the diseased tissue of the external ear canal through a retroauricular approach. The most prominent histologic features of the early stage of MEO consist of a thick layer of almost acellular, partly degenerated, collagen extending from the cartilage into the dermis, which most likely existed prior to the penetration of the microorganism. This finding supports our concept that MEO is a disease which develops as a results of invasion of opportunistic organisms into tissue previously devitalized, probably due to vascular compromise and that these latter features constitute the basic mechanism of the entire disease process.","['Ostfeld E', 'Segal M', 'Czernobilsky B']",1981,91,6,Laryngoscope,"Ostfeld E, et al.

This group of swimmers trained twice daily in the pool, in the early morning and late afternoon. In contrast swabbing of the ears of a similar group of 54 competitive swimmers who used the pool only in the afternoon revealed only one swimmer with P. aeruginosa. Investigation of the swimming pool revealed that chlorination was often inadequate when the first group of swimmers were training in the early morning. Strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from various sites around the pool and from the bag of a vacuum used to clean the pool. Pyocin typing, serotyping and phage typing were performed on all isolates. The dominant strain recovered from the swimmers' ears was found to be almost identical to that from the vacuum bag and belonged to serotype 0--11 which has been particularly associated with outbreaks of P. aeruginosa infection in whirlpools in the United States. These results support the hypothesis that there is a direct correlation between the development of otitis externa and swimming in water contaminated with P. aeruginosa.","['Reid TM', 'Porter IA']",1981,86,3,J Hyg (Lond),Reid TM and Porter IA.

7457757,Histopathology of Pseudomonas osteomyelitis of the temporal bone starting as malignant external otitis.,"Although the natural history and treatment of ""malignant external otitis"" have been well described, available histopathologic data are limited to three case reports. The histopathology in two additional cases, in which the disease process was advanced and uncontrolled, is presented to illustrate the unique progression of temporal bone osteomyelitis due to the Pseudomonas organism. In both cases the bony labyrinthine capsule demonstrated remarkable resistance to the osteomyelitic process even though the infection seemed to pass around the inner ear from all sides. The most active area of osteomyelitis was at the skull base along the sigmoid sulcus, posterior fossa surface of the temporal bone, and petrous apex. Spread to the opposite petrous apex occurred anterior to the foramen magnum via the basisphenoid, cavernous sinus, and peritubal areas. The clinical and histopathologic data demonstrated that the disease process had a similar progression in both cases, starting in the external auditory canal with spread to the stylomastoid and jugular foramina. This resulted in septic thrombosis of the lateral venous sinus and subsequent extension to the petrous apex from both posterior and middle fossa surfaces of the petrous bone. The infection spread along vascular and fascial planes rather than through pneumatized tracts of the temporal bone. The treatment of this disease is discussed in the light of the histopathologic findings.",['Nadol JB'],1980,1,5,Am J Otolaryngol,Nadol JB.

Recently, four patients with this condition were treated at the University of California, San Francisco, who did not respond to conventional therapy. In each case, appropriate intravenous antibiotics, diabetic management, and extensive excision of involved tissue failed to eradicate the infection.

Other signs or symptoms of active infection for more than two weeks after institution of therapy. Any one of these criteria was considered an indication for more radical surgical intervention. In three patients, the operative procedure consisted of a subtotal temporal bone resection to gain access to the primary focus of infection and provide adequate drainage.

Pyocine type p1 was predominant in all groups except that of experimental minks and samples from the room in which they were kept. This type, plus type p3, made up more than half the typed strains of Ps. aeruginosa. The sources of infection comprised: (1) Carriers among the blue foxes and their winter watering troughs. During periods without frost the troughs were not cleaned, but were left containing more or less water contaminated with urine, faeces, hairs, and dust--a well-suited habitat for Ps. aeruginosa. (2) In the case of the experimental minks the infection may have been derived from a dog with pseudomoniasis in the hospital, brought to the experimental room in the course of feeding and cleaning. (3) The infection in the Small Animal Clinic seems to be maintained by frequent admission of patients for treatment, especially of chronic otitis externa/media caused by widely resistant strains of Ps. aeruginosa.",['Gierløff B'],1980,32,3-4,Nord Vet Med,"Gierløff B.

7469923,Electron microscope study of bone lesion in cholesteatoma otitis.,"Biopsy specimens were obtained at ear surgery of patients with cholesteatoma otitis and were studied by electron microscopy. The osseous tissue decalcified in EDTA demonstrated degradation of collagen matrix as well as extensive degeneration of bone cells. The surface of the eroded bone was found to be in direct contact with the subepithelial connective tissue or the granulation, but not with the keratinizing squamous epithelium of matrix. These results indicate that the bone destruction by cholesteatoma is of non-osteoclastic type and lend support to the view that the keratinizing squamous epithelium do not participate in bone destruction. One the ultrastructural basis, the inflammatory process in the soft tissue adjacent to bone and extensive degeneration of bone cells are considered as cardinal factors for bone destruction in this disease.","['Tanaka K', 'Terayama Y', 'Hirai T']",1980,226,1-2,Arch Otorhinolaryngol,"Tanaka K, et al.

6996964,Infection and diabetes mellitus.,"Most physicians believe that diabetic individuals are predisposed to infections and that infection complicates the control of the diabetes. However, only bacteriuria can be documented to occur with increased frequency in diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients. Although most bacteriuric diabetic patients are asymptomatic, severe infections such as emphysematous pyelonephritis, papillary necrosis, perinephric abscess, and candida pyelonephritis may occur. Tuberculosis, once a proven threat to diabetic individuals, is a less serious problem now that effective screening and chemoprophylaxis programs have been initiated. Several unusual infections such as malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, and emphysematous cholecystitis occur also exclusively in diabetics. Foot infections are very important in diabetic patients; successful treatment requires accurate assessment of the extent and etiology of the infections and often involves surgery as well as broad antibiotic coverage. The important problem of infection in diabetic patients deserves careful evaluation. Questions such as do diabetic individuals have a higher incidence of infection, why are diabetic patients predisposed to infection, why is necrosis common in several of the infections, what is the course of asymptomatic bacteriuria, who do diabetic patients develop foot infections, and how should foot infections be prevented and treated should be topics of clinical investigation.",['Wheat LJ'],1980,3,1,Diabetes Care,Wheat LJ.

315504,Histiocytosis X of the ear and temporal bone: review of 22 cases.,"Histiocytosis X encompasses three syndromes characterized by the idiopathic proliferation of histiocytes: eosinophilic granuloma, Hand-Schuller-Christian syndrome, and Letterer-Siwe disease. At the Mayo Clinic between 1926 and 1978, 22 patients with histiocytosis X had involvement of the ear or temporal bone. These patients comprised 15% of all patients with histiocytosis X seen during that period. The ages at onset of the disease ranged from 2 months to 49 years. The most frequent otologic symptom was aural discharge (15 patients), followed in frequency by swelling in the temporal region (11 patients), vertigo (6 patients), and deafness (5 patients). Clinical findings included otitis media (13 patients), otitis externa with or without granulation tissue (10 patients), and osteolytic lesions of the temporal bone (9 patients). A high index of suspicion is required to recognize the otologic manifestations of histiocytosis X for two reasons: the systemic manifestations of the disease are often so dramatic that the ear findings are overlooked, and the otologic findings of histiocytosis X can mimic more common diseases, including simple otitis externa, aural polyps, acute mastoiditis, chronic otitis media, and metastatic lesions.","['McCaffrey TV', 'McDonald TJ']",1979,89,11,Laryngoscope,McCaffrey TV and McDonald TJ.

The mechanism of invasion of the ear canal appears to be due to local bone necrosis. This in turn extends to the submucosal vasculature of the pneumatic spaces. The infective process extends submucosally, establishing one or several sites of bone destruction. The lumen of the pneumatic space is not involved. In this process, the periphery of the fibrous inflammatory tissue formation is the site of active bone destruction. In pneumococcal petrositis, the peripheral fibrous elements are protective. The process in malignant external otitis may extend directly to adjacent central nervous system structures inoculating the structure with Pseudomonas. Development of Pseudomonas brain abscesses can be slow, allowing for new bone closure of the site from which the infection spreads as demonstrated in this specimen. Therefore, apparent local control of the disease can be established while a central infective process progresses.","['Kohut RI', 'Lindsay JR']",1979,88,5 Pt 1,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"Kohut RI and Lindsay JR.

In response to this lack of otic preparations, we have surveyed in vitro a variety of available preparations to determine the general spectrum of activity against appropriate bacterial and fungal species. An agar-disc diffusion system was used testing the drugs against (1.) bacteria common in external otitis, and (2.) a variety of yeast and filamentous fungi. Aqueous Merthiolate and Cresylate demonstrated good non-specific antimicrobial activity, while nystatin and clotrimazole demonstrated specific antifungal activity.

It is uniformly caused by the Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa organism and mainly affects elderly diabetics. It spreads to the soft tissues beneath the temporal bone and, if not properly treated leads to facial nerve palsy, mastoiditis, sepsis, osteomyelitis of the base of the skull, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, multiple cranial nerve palsies and death. Experience with 72 patients in varying stages of the disease is summarized. Stressed are the diagnostic criteria of nonresponsiveness to the usual methods of treatment, continued suppuration, and the continuing reformation of granulation tissue in the floor of the external auditory canal. Medical treatment is recommended with hospitalization and intravenous carbenicillin and gentamicin. Minor surgical debridement is helpful. All patients should be treated medically for as long as improvement continues, reserving surgical intervention only in the event a plateau is reached or symptoms and signs become worse under treatment. With or without a major surgical procedure, it is imperative to continue treatment for at least seven days after apparent cure in order to avoid recurrent disease possibly at a site distant from the canal.",['Chandler JR'],1977,86,4 Pt 1,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,Chandler JR.

863269,How aging affects the ear.,"With aging, a different variety of ear diseases becomes more common. External ear disease is often a local reflection of generalized skin problems aggravated by retained water or local manipulation. Hearing loss may be the result of long-standing middle ear disease rather than aging. In this situation, the inconveniences and possible dangers of a chronically infected ear may be resolved with surgical intervention. Nasopharyngeal or lymphomatous disease must be suspected in any geriatric patient manifesting middle ear disease for the first time. Like presbyopia, presbycusis is a normal consequence of aging. It may be severe, but it does not lead to total deafness and equally involves both ears. Early discovery of the condition and institution of hearing rehabilitation methods will minimize the individual's communicative handicap and tendency to withdraw from society. Unilateral or asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss should be thoroughly evaluated for the purpose of identifying a curable and potentially life-threatening disease.",['Keim RJ'],1977,32,6,Geriatrics,Keim RJ.

During 1974-5 two saturation dives in the North Sea were terminated because of outbreaks of incapacitating otitis externa, and others were disrupted. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was consistently isolated from the ears of affected divers. Because complex work schedules were threatened seven subsequent dives were subjected to microbiological monitoring and control. Colonization of ear canal with P. aeruginosa or with other gram-negative bacilli occurred in 39 (67%) of the 58 divers studied, usually within 7 days of starting the dive. Data obtained by serotyping this isolations of P. aeruginosa suggested that a single infected diver may be the source of organisms which rapidly spread to his colleagues and throughout the living chambers, that the living chambers may constitute a reservoir of infection during and between dives, and that certain serotypes of P. aeruginosa are more likely than others to colonize the ear canal in the conditions of a saturation dive.

821345,Malignant external otitis: a severe form of otitis in diabetic patients.,"Two cases of malignant external otitis are presented and the literature is reviewed. The disease seems to occur exclusively in elderly diabetic patients. Diagnosis is mostly a clinical one, and requires a high index of suspicion. The characteristic clinical manifestations are pain and severe tenderness of the tissues around the ear and mastoid, persistent drainage and the presence of granulation tissue at the junction of the osseus and cartilagenous portions of the external ear. Roentgenographic findings are not helpful in the early stages. The pathogenesis of this disease depends on the presence of clefts in the cartilage forming the floor of the external auditory canal at its junction with the osseus portion through which infection can spread from the external ear to the deep soft tissues. Serious and often fatal complications may ensue. The most common and earliest symptom to appear if facial nerve palsy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been isolated uniformly, in pure or mixed cultures. This entity, therefore, should be borne in mind whenever an elderly diabetic patient presents with external otitis not amenable to the usual methods of therapy. Ps. aeruginosa should be strongly suspected, and its isolation should prompt vigorous systemic treatment with gentamicin and carbenicillin before extensive necrosis of cartilage and bone takes place. Any delay in diagnosis and management will lead to a serious and often fatal complications.","['Zaky DA', 'Bentley DW', 'Lowy K', 'Betts RF', 'Douglas RG']",1976,61,2,Am J Med,"Zaky DA, et al.

The clinical perilymph fistula (PF) syndrome can consist of any combination of the following: tinnitus, deafness, phonophobia, vertigo, ataxia, otalgia, facial palsy, headache, diplopia, blackouts, psychological distress. The following testable hypotheses are proposed: otitis media is due to perilymph in the middle ear, with secondary changes resulting from infection or inflammation: otosclerosis results from a slow leak in the presence of enzymes promoting bone growth: Meniere's syndrome follows reduced perilymph support for the endolymphatic system: Bell's palsy results from a perilymph provoked oedema in the bony facial nerve canal: PFs may be responsible for progressive rubella deafness, and for some cases of migraine, epilepsy, anxiety neurosis and hysteria: psychiatric sequelae of the PF syndrome predominate in the post-concussional syndrome and infantile autism: organisms can pass from the throat into the spinal fluid, causing meningitis or encephalitis.

Ninety percent DMSO was used alone and in conjunction with alkaloids and antibiotics to test the clinical properties attributed to this drug. Although DMSO was found not to be ototoxic, laboratory and clinical testing which included double blind studies on patients with otological infections demonstrated that DMSO had no antibacterial, anesthetic or anti-inflammatory properties when applied within the external auditory canal.

51078,[To the differential diagnosis of cranial nerve lesions: the progressive necrotising external otitis (author's transl)].,"A review of necrotising external otitis, a relatively unknown and dangerous disease, brings out that, initially, it has three characteristics: a granulating necrotising ostitis of the external meatus, extreme pain and a yellowish green secretion. It is always caused by a pseudomonas infection and in almost all cases the patients suffer from diabetes mellitus. If the condition is not recognized in good time and an extensive debridement of the bone involved not performed promptly, ostomyelitis of the base of the skull may follow with involvement of cranial nerves. Severe chronic osteomyelitis of cervical vertebrae occurred in one of our cases. The neurologist must bear this disease in mind in the differential diagnosis when cranial nerves are affected because the nerve disturbances may become evident only after the local condition has subsided or the nerve deficits may be more prominent than and obscure the local ear condition. The most commonly involved nerve is the facial although there may be multiple cranial nerves involved including the third through the twelfth. If the cervical vertebrae become affected there may be nerve root lesions. A torpid meningoencephalitis may also occur. Close cooperation between otologists and neurologists is necessary to recognize and treat these conditions properly.","['Draf W', 'Regli F']",1975,210,3,J Neurol,Draf W and Regli F.

The following results were obtained from the clinical and laboratory studies. 1) The therapeutic results were excellent in 18 cases, good in 5 cases, fair in 3 cases and poor in 3 cases. The effect was observed in 79.3% of the patients treated. 2) The causative bacteria were: 3 strains of beta-Streptococcus hemolyticus, 4 strains of Hemophilus, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, one strain of Diplococcus pneumoniae, one strain of Gram-positive Diplococcus and Gram-negative Bacillus. Clinically good results were obtained in patients infected with beta-Streptococcus hemolyticus, Hemophilus and Diplococcus pneumoniae. 3) No side effect was observed with amoxicillin, except slight diarrhea in one case. This side effect disappeared by cessation of the administration. 4) No unfavourable influence was noticed on peripheral blood, liver function nor renal function by administration of amoxicillin. 5) From the results of this series, amoxicillin seems to be useful in the treatment of acute infections of the ear, nose and throat.","['Hommura Y', 'Sakamoto Y', 'Matsukawa J', 'Shinkawa A']",1975,28,3,Jpn J Antibiot,"Hommura Y, et al.

807907,Otitis externa in the dog -- a clinical and microbiological study.,"The effect on canine otitis externa of a topical preparation composed of Fucidin, Framycetin, Nystatin, and Prednisolone was evaluated in a clinical trial comprising 235 dog ears. Cases caused by parasites or foreign bodies and cases requiring systemic therapy were excluded. Swabs from these and an additional 434 affected ears were examined bacteriologically and the sensitivity to antibiotics of the bacteria isolated determined. The infection most frequently diagnosed was staphylococci plus yeasts (29 % of total material) followed by pure yeast-infections (19 %) and pure staphylococcus infections (16 %). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Proteus mirabilis were found in 7 % of the ears, while no organisms could be isolated from 22 %. Sensitivity tests showed a satisfactory in vitro effect of Neomycin (Framycetin) on most of the bacteria commonly isolated, and a very good effect of Fucidin on the staphylococci. Approximately 91 % of the ears treated were clinically cured or improved very considerably; the relation between clinical response and type of infection is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. It was confirmed that infections with Ps. aeruginosa represent a special problem; the results of post-treatment sensitivity tests seem to suggest, however, that a longer or more intense course of treatment than the one used in the trial (two weeks) would provide the answer to this.","['Krogh HV', 'Linnet A', 'Knudsen PB']",1975,27,5,Nord Vet Med,"Krogh HV, et al.

External otitis.,"Simple treatment usually suffices for the control of acute external otitis, This consists of meticulous cleaning of the ear canal and application of antibiotic-corticosteroid drops. Good local care of the ear can prevent both the chronic and the acute forms of external otitis. Malignant external otitis is an uncommon but lethal type that most often accompanies diabetes. If this condition is diagnosed, hospitalization and aggressive treatment are then a necessity.","['McDonald TJ', 'Neel HB']",1975,57,6,Postgrad Med,McDonald TJ and Neel HB. Symposium.

1120014,Rerouting the external auditory canal. A method of correcting congenital stenosis.,"An hourglass or funnel-shaped, stenosed, external auditory meatus with a normal tympanic membrane, middle and inner ear is one of the congenital anomalies that occasionally occurs. Such abnormality was present in both ears of a woman and caused chromic otitis externa and deafness. A routine meatoplasty on the right ear failed because of an unusual cephalad position of the drumhead in relation to a ""downhill"" position of the stenosed outer meatus. Rerouting the ear canal to a horizontal position by removing bone of the canal superiorly, posteriorly, and inferiorly, and grafting the now horizontal canal with skin taken from the postauricular fold produced a good result. This is a satisfactory procedure for a woman, but would be cosmetically unacceptable for a man.",['Baron SH'],1975,101,4,Arch Otolaryngol,Baron SH. Rerouting the external auditory canal.
