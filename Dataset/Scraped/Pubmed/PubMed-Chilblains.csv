37853787,"Cutaneous manifestations, viral load, and prognosis among hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a cohort study.","INTRODUCTION: Various cutaneous manifestations have been reported as symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which may facilitate early clinical diagnosis and management. This study explored the incidence of cutaneous manifestations among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and investigated its relationships with viral load, co-morbidities, and outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study included adult patients admitted to a tertiary hospital for COVID-19 from July to September 2020. Clinical information, co-morbidities, viral load (cycle threshold [Ct] value), and outcomes were analysed.
RESULTS: In total, 219 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Twenty patients presented with new onset of rash. The incidence of new rash was 9.1% (95% confidence interval=6.25%-14.4%). The most common manifestations were maculopapular exanthem (n=6, 42.9%, median Ct value: 24.8), followed by livedo reticularis (n=4, 28.6%, median Ct value: 21.3), varicella-like lesions (n=2, 14.3%, median Ct value: 19.3), urticaria (n=1, 7.1%, median Ct value: 14.4), and acral chilblain and petechiae (n=1, 7.1%, median Ct value: 33.1). The median Ct values for patients with and without rash were 22.9 and 24.1, respectively (P=0.58). There were no significant differences in mortality or hospital stay between patients with and without rash. Patients with rash were more likely to display fever on admission (P<0.01). Regardless of cutaneous manifestations, patients with older age, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease stage ≥3 had significantly higher viral load and mortality (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed no associations between cutaneous manifestation and viral load or clinical outcomes. Older patients with multiple co-morbidities have risks of high viral load and mortality; they should be closely monitored.","['Wong CSM', 'Hung IFN', 'Kwan MYW', 'Chung MMH', 'Chan MWM', 'Cheng AKC', 'Lau YM', 'Yeung CK', 'Chan HHL', 'Lau CS']",2023,,,Hong Kong Med J,"Wong CSM, et al.

37828538,Tocilizumab reduces the unmanageable inflammatory reaction of a patient with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome type 7 during treatment with ruxolitinib.,"BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare hereditary early-onset encephalopathy characterized by upregulation of the type I interferon pathway, poorly responsive to conventional immunosuppression.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 7-year-old Chinese boy who developed symptoms at the age of 6 months. He presented with a chilblain-like rash, leukopenia, neutropenia, elevated liver enzymesgrowth retardation, microcephaly, elevated acute phase reactants, intracranial calcification and leukodystrophy. At the age of 3 years old, whole-exome sequencing confirmed a de novo heterozygous gain-of-function mutation, c.1016 C > A (p.Ala339Asp), in the IFIH1 gene, and he was diagnosed with AGS7. He was treated with ruxolitinib accompanied by steroids and thalidomide for about four years. The rash, hematological manifestations, and the liver function were all improved, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate remained consistently elevated until the addition of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6.
CONCLUSIONS: Ruxolitinib was not successful in suppressing the inflammatory process, and tocilizumab produced highly encouraging results in reducing the inflammatory reaction of AGS. The study makes a significant contribution to the literature because we may found a potential alternative therapeutic option for AGS.","['Wang W', 'Wang W', 'Peng S', 'Gao S', 'Quan M', 'Gou L', 'Wang C', 'Sun Z', 'Li Z', 'Lian D', 'Song H']",2023,21,1,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,"Wang W, et al.

37703321,Chilblain-Like Eruption Unveiling Cutaneous Aleukemic Relapse of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Leukemia cutis corresponds to skin infiltration by malignant hematopoietic cells. It is most commonly reported in acute myeloid leukemia, particularly in subtypes with a monocytic component. Its clinical manifestations are extremely variable, and histopathologic diagnosis of cutaneous leukemic infiltrates may be challenging. We report the first case of cutaneous, that is, extramedullary, aleukemic relapse of acute myeloid leukemia within an unusual chilblain-like eruption that imposed a challenging clinical and histopathologic diagnosis. Primary chilblains are uncommon in the elderly, and a systemic underlying cause should be thoroughly investigated. In patients presenting with atypical chilblains (ie, persistent chilblains developing even without exposure to cold temperatures and/or refractory to therapy) and with a history of hematologic disorders such as leukemias, histopathologic examination is crucial to identify leukemic or aleukemic phases of relapse of underlying leukemia and initiate timely treatment.","['Brazão C', 'Mancha D', 'Antunes-Duarte S', 'Kempf W', 'Soares-de-Almeida L']",2023,,,Am J Dermatopathol,"Brazão C, et al.

37647424,Targetoid-like lesions and chilblain-like erythema manifested on hands and feet: A case of Rowell syndrome from China.,"BACKGROUND: Rowell syndrome (RS) is an uncommon condition characterized by erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions and lupus erythematosus. It is more common in females, and EM may be the first manifestation of the disease with positive autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibody (ANA), SSA, SSB and rheumatoid factor. The pathogenesis of RS is unknown and is likely caused by drug induction, ultraviolet exposure and infection.
METHOD: We describe a case of RS from China which presented as characteristic targetoid-like lesions and chilblain-like erythema on hands and feet. This is a case of RS in a female patient from the inpatient department of dermatology.
RESULTS: A 41-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus exhibited chilblain-like erythema and characteristic EM lesions on her extremities. She tested positive for serum ANA (1:320) and anti-double-stranded DNA, as well as other autoantibodies. Systemic glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine worked effectively for her.
CONCLUSION: The present case met diagnostic criteria of RS. Notably, there was a co-occurrence of facial butterfly erythema, chilblain-like erythema and EM lesions distributed on the limbs in this case.","['Li Y', 'Cheng S', 'Ying C', 'Li L', 'Wang G', 'Chen X']",2023,11,8,Immun Inflamm Dis,"Li Y, et al.

37640411,Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma presenting with secondary chilblains of the toes.,"Cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders include cutaneous manifestations of systemic B-cell or T-cell lymphoma and primary cutaneous lymphomas. Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas are subcategorised into four groups: primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL), primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma, primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg-type and EBV-positive mucocutaneous tumour. Each of these cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders has unique clinical and pathological features necessitating biopsy and staging to establish proper treatment. We present a case of PCMZL manifesting as secondary chilblains of the toes that was diagnosed with punch skin biopsy. The patient's chilblains resolved with rituximab. This case underscores the importance of considering PCMZL and other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with dermatological manifestations and wounds refractory to first-line treatment.","['Nasir AZ', 'Burmeister RS']",2023,16,8,BMJ Case Rep,Nasir AZ and Burmeister RS.

37371788,"Juvenile Dermatomyositis and Infantile Cerebral Palsy: Aicardi-Gouteres Syndrome, Type 5, with a Novel Mutation in SAMHD1-A Case Report.","INTRODUCTION: Aicardi-Gouteres syndrome (AGS) is a monogenic interferonopathy characterized by early onset, dysregulation of skin (chilblain lesions), brain, and immune systems (fever, hepatomegaly, glaucoma, arthritis, myositis, and autoimmune activity). The disease looks like TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Others, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes) infection with early-onset encephalopathy resulting in severe neuropsychological disability.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A six-year-old girl has been suffering from generalized seizures, fever episodes, severe psychomotor development delay, and spastic tetraparesis since the first year of her life. Her two elder brothers died at a young age from suspected infantile cerebral palsy (ICP). Other siblings (younger brother and two elder sisters) are as healthy as their parents. The girl was diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis at 5.5 years. Basal ganglia, periventricular, and cerebellum calcifications; hypoplasia of the corpus callosum; and leukodystrophy were detected on CT. The IFN-I score was 12 times higher than normal. The previously not described nucleotide variant c.434G > C (chr 20:36935104C > G; NM_015474) was detected in exon 4 of the SAMHD1 gene in the homozygous state, leading to amino acid substitution p.R145P. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome 5 was diagnosed. Her treatment included corticosteroids, methotrexate, and tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day and it contributed to health improvements. The following brain CT depicted the previously discovered changes without the sign of calcification spreading.
CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis of AGS is highly important as it allows starting treatment in a timely manner. Timely treatment, in return, can help avoid the development/progression of end-organ damage, including severe neurological complications and early death. It is necessary to spread information about AGS among neurologists, neonatologists, infectious disease specialists, and pediatricians. A multidisciplinary team approach is required.","['Sorokina LS', 'Raupov RK', 'Kostik MM']",2023,11,6,Biomedicines,"Sorokina LS, et al.

37340564,Chilblain-Like Lesions (CLL) Coinciding With the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Children: A Systematic Review.,"Chilblain-like lesions (CLL) coinciding with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been described in the literature. Available reviews of the literature suggest that CLL are associated with younger age, an equal sex ratio, negative testing for SARS-CoV-2, and mild to no extracutaneous manifestations (ECM) associated with COVID-19 infection. This systematic review aims to provide a summary of reports of CLL associated with the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in children to clarify the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and resolution outcomes of these skin findings. Sixty-nine studies, published between May 2020 and January 2022, met inclusion criteria and were summarized in this review, representing 1,119 cases of CLL. Available data showed a slight male predominance (591/1002, 59%). Mean age was 13 years, ranging from 0 to 18 years. Most cases had no ECM (682/978, 70%). Overall, 70/507 (14%) of patients tested positive for COVID-19 using PCR and/or serology. In the majority the clinical course was benign with 355/415 (86%) of cases resolving, and 97/269 (36%) resolving without any treatment. This comprehensive summary of pediatric CLL suggests these lesions are rarely associated with COVID-19 symptoms or test positivity.","['Starkey SY', 'Kashetsky N', 'Lam JM', 'Dutz J', 'Mukovozov IM']",2023,27,3,J Cutan Med Surg,"Starkey SY, et al.

37335086,Vincristine-Induced Acrocyanosis and Erythema Pernio.,"INTRODUCTION: Acrocyanosis and erythema pernio are 2 dermatologic manifestations of vasospastic changes. Primary care providers should consider that these conditions can occur as primary or idiopathic conditions and as secondary conditions related to another disease or medication. Herein we describe a case of acrocyanosis and erythema pernio attributed to vincristine therapy.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 22-year-old man was evaluated for discomfort and red lesions involving the toes of both feet for several weeks. He had completed chemotherapy 1 month earlier for Ewing sarcoma in the right femur. Local control for the primary tumor included wide local excision and reconstruction with a vascularized fibular allograft from the right fibula. On examination, his right foot was dark blue and cool. Toes on both feet had nonpainful erythematous papules. After the case was discussed with the patient's oncology team, the diagnosis was medication-induced acrocyanosis of the right foot and bilateral erythema pernio. Treatment consisted of supportive care to keep the feet warm and promote circulation to the feet. At 2-week follow-up, the patient's symptoms and the appearance of his feet had markedly improved.
DISCUSSION: Primary care clinicians should be able to recognize dermatologic manifestations of vasospastic changes, including acrocyanosis and erythema pernio, and rule out possible secondary causes, such as pharmacologic agents. This patient's history of therapy for Ewing sarcoma prompted consideration of medication-induced vasospastic changes most likely related to the adverse vasospastic effects of vincristine. Symptoms should improve with cessation of the offending medication.","['Middleton HT', 'Boswell CL', 'Houwink EJ', 'Allen-Rhoades WA', 'Kuhn AK', 'Wright JA']",2023,14,,J Prim Care Community Health,"Middleton HT, et al.

37250910,Skin Manifestations Among Patients Admitted with COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study at a University-Based Tertiary Hospital in Jordan.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic hit the entire world with severe health and economic consequences. Although the infection primarily affected the respiratory system, it was soon recognized that COVID-19 has a multi-systemic component with various manifestations including cutaneous involvement.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to assess the incidence and patterns of cutaneous manifestations among moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization and whether there was a prognostic indication for cutaneous involvement and the outcome in terms of recovery or death.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study that included inpatients who were diagnosed with a moderate or severe COVID-19 infection. The demographic and clinical data of patients were assessed including age, sex, smoking, and comorbidities. All patients were examined clinically for the presence of skin manifestations. Patients were followed for the outcome of COVID-19 infection.
RESULTS: A total of 821 patients (356 females and 465 males) aged 4-95 years were included. More than half of patients (54.6%) aged >60 years. A total of 678 patients (82.6%) had at least one comorbid condition, mostly hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Sixty-two patients (7.55%) developed rashes; 5.24% cutaneous and 2.31% oral. The rashes were then grouped into five major types: group A, Exanthema: morbilliform, papulovesicular, varicella-like. Group B, Vascular: Chilblain-like lesions, purpuric/petechial, livedoid lesions. Group C, Reactive erythemas: Urticaria, Erythema multiforme. Group D, other skin rashes including flare-up of pre-existing disease, and O for oral involvement. Most patients (70%) developed rash after admission. The most frequent skin rashes were reactive erythema (23.3%), followed by vascular (20.9%), exanthema (16.3%), and other rashes with flare-ups of pre-existing diseases (39.5%). Smoking and loss of taste were associated with the appearance of various skin rashes. However, no prognostic implications were found between cutaneous manifestations and outcome.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection may present with various skin manifestations including worsening of pre-existing skin diseases.","['Alshiyab DM', 'Al-Qarqaz FA', 'Alhaje E', 'Mayou JA', 'Jaradat S', 'Asaad A', 'Muhaidat JM', 'Khader Y', 'Alsheyab SM', 'Oweis AO', 'Khassawneh BY', 'Momany SM', 'Samrah SM', 'Al-Ali M']",2023,16,,Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol,"Alshiyab DM, et al.

37161741,Type I Interferonopathies in Childhood.,"Type 1 interferonopathy is a novel context reflecting a group of inborn disorders sharing common pathway disturbances. This group of diseases is characterized by autoimmunity and autoinflammation caused by an upregulation of type 1 interferons (IFN)s due to certain genetic mutations. Several features are common in most of the diseases in this group, such as vasculitic skin changes, including chilblains, panniculitis, interstitial lung disease, basal ganglion calcifications, neuromotor impairments, epilepsy, stroke, and recurrent fever. Family history and consanguineous marriage are also common. IFN signature is a useful diagnostic tool and is positive in almost all patients with type 1 interferonopathies. Although IFN signature is a sensitive test, its specificity is relatively low. It can also be positive in viral infections and several connective tissue diseases. Therefore, next-generation sequence methods, whole exome sequencing (WES) in particular, are required for the ultimate diagnosis. The optimal treatment regime is still under debate due to a lack of clinical trials. Although high-dose steroids, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 treatments, and reverse transcriptase inhibitors are used, JAK inhibitors are highly promising. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies against IFN-alpha and interferon-α receptor (IFNAR) are currently underway.","['Haşlak F', 'Kılıç Könte E', 'Aslan E', 'Şahin S', 'Kasapçopur Ö']",2023,40,3,Balkan Med J,"Haşlak F, et al.

37153946,"COVID 19-associated chilblain-like acral lesions among children and adolescents: an Italian retrospective, multicenter study.","BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, great interest has been given to this disease, especially to its possible clinical presentations. Besides classical respiratory symptoms, dermatological manifestations occur quite often among infected and non-infected patients, particularly in children. A prominent IFN-I response, that is generally higher in children compared to adults, may not only cause chilblain lesions, but it could also prevent infection and viral replication, thus justifying the negative swab results, as well as the absence of relevant systemic symptoms in positive cases. Indeed, reports have emerged describing chilblain-like acral lesions in children and adolescents with either proven or suspected infection.
METHODS: Patients aged from 1 to 18 years old were enrolled in this study from 23 Italian dermatological units and were observed for an overall period of 6 months. Clinical pictures were collected along with data on the location and duration of skin lesions, their association with concomitant local and systemic symptoms, presence of nail and/or mucosal involvement, as well as histological, laboratory and imaging findings.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients were included, of whom 56.9% were females. Mean age was 11.97±3.66 years. The most commonly affected sites were the feet (77 patients, 56.2%). Lesions (48.5%) featured cyanosis, chilblains, blisters, ecchymosis, bullae, erythema, edema, and papules. Concomitant skin manifestations included maculo-papular rashes (30%), unspecified rashes (25%), vesicular rashes (20%), erythema multiforme (10%), urticaria (10%) and erythema with desquamation (5%). Forty-one patients (29.9%) reported pruritus as the main symptom associated with chilblains, and 56 out of 137 patients also reported systemic symptoms such as respiratory symptoms (33.9%), fever (28%), intestinal (27%), headache (5.5%), asthenia (3.5%), and joint pain (2%). Associated comorbid conditions were observed in 9 patients presenting with skin lesions. Nasopharyngeal swabs turned out positive in 11 patients (8%), whereas the remainder were either negative (101, 73%) or unspecified (25, 18%).
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has been credited as the etiology of the recent increase in acro-ischemic lesions. The present study provides a description of pediatric cutaneous manifestations deemed to be potentially associated with COVID-19, revealing a possible association between acral cyanosis and nasopharyngeal swab positivity in children and teenagers.

37141353,Innate virus-sensing pathways in B cell systemic autoimmunity.,"Although all multicellular organisms have germ line-encoded innate receptors to sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, vertebrates also evolved adaptive immunity based on somatically generated antigen receptors on B and T cells. Because randomly generated antigen receptors may also react with self-antigens, tolerance checkpoints operate to limit but not completely prevent autoimmunity. These two systems are intricately linked, with innate immunity playing an instrumental role in the induction of adaptive antiviral immunity. In this work, we review how inborn errors of innate immunity can instigate B cell autoimmunity. Increased nucleic acid sensing, often resulting from defects in metabolizing pathways or retroelement control, can break B cell tolerance and converge into TLR7-, cGAS-STING-, or MAVS-dominant signaling pathways. The resulting syndromes span a spectrum that ranges from chilblain and systemic lupus to severe interferonopathies.","['Vinuesa CG', 'Grenov A', 'Kassiotis G']",2023,380,6644,Science,"Vinuesa CG, et al.

37039852,Prevalence of phalangeal bone marrow edema on MRI before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and correlation with chilblain skin lesions.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to establish the prevalence bone marrow edema of the phalanges of the feet and hands before and during the COVID-19 pandemic on MRI studies and correlate with clinically chilblain skin lesions and epidemiological data.
METHODS: This observational retrospective study. In patients with confirmed bone marrow edema of the phalanges, epidemiological data and clinical findings were collected, including the history of current or remote COVID-19 infection and vaccination status. The two-proportion test was used to compare the frequency of bone marrow edema in the phalanges before and during the pandemic, and the comparison between the categories variables was performed using the one-proportion test.
RESULTS: Of the total of 7215 patients, only 20 presented isolated bone marrow edema of the digits in MRI studies; 2 (0.05%) were found two years before the pandemic's beginning, and 18 (0.64%) after the pandemic's onset, demonstrating an increase of 13-fold in this period. 16 were women with a mean age of 40.3 years and 4 were men with a mean age of 53.5 years. The most frequently reported clinical symptoms by the patients were pain (85.0%), and erythema of the skin (45.0%). Of the 18 patients found after the pandemic's onset, only 27.8% had COVID-19 infections confirmed by RT-PCR before the imaging study, and all cases were mild.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a significant increase in the prevalence of bone marrow edema of the phalanges after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in middle-aged and younger women.","['da Silva LNM', 'Guimarães JB', 'Link TM', 'da Cruz IAN', 'Silva FD', 'Nico MAC', 'Filho AGO']",2023,52,9,Skeletal Radiol,"da Silva LNM, et al.

One less-commonly-reported presentation of COVID-19 infection is chilblain-like lesions. We conducted an ecological analysis of chilblain presentations in comparison with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in a primary care setting to establish that a relationship exists between the two. Our study collated data from three Primary Health Networks across Victoria, Australia, from 2017-2021, to understand patterns of chilblain presentations prior to and throughout the pandemic. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis, we estimated the relationship between local minimum temperature, COVID-19 infections and the frequency of chilblain presentations. We found a 5.72 risk ratio of chilblain incidence in relation to COVID-19 infections and a 3.23 risk ratio associated with suspected COVID-19 infections. COVID-19 infections were also more strongly associated with chilblain presentations in 0-16-year-olds throughout the pandemic in Victoria. Our study statistically suggests that chilblains are significantly associated with COVID-19 infections in a primary care setting. This has major implications for clinicians aiming to diagnose COVID-19 infections or determine the cause of a presentation of chilblains. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of large-scale primary care data in identifying an uncommon manifestation of COVID-19 infections, which will be significantly beneficial to treating physicians.","['Sawires R', 'Pearce C', 'Fahey M', 'Clothier H', 'Gardner K', 'Buttery J']",2022,2,10,PLOS Glob Public Health,"Sawires R, et al.

36944572,Rapid efficacy of anifrolumab across multiple subtypes of recalcitrant cutaneous lupus erythematosus parallels changes in discrete subsets of blood transcriptomic and cellular biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Observations with rituximab suggest B-cell independent mechanisms of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Type-I interferon receptor blockade with anifrolumab shows efficacy in SLE, but efficacy for cutaneous disease of specific morphologies has not been studied. Interferon has pleotropic immune effects and it is unknown which of these are critical to therapeutic response.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated clinical efficacy and quality-of-life impact of type-I interferon-blockade in: (i) rituximab-refractory CLE; (ii) DLE and other morphologies and (iii) transcriptomic and flow cytometric biomarkers.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective single-centre study of anifrolumab in refractory mucocutaneous SLE. CLE Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) activity score, health-related quality of life, 96-probe TaqMan® gene expression analysis capturing key SLE blood transcriptome signatures, and eight-colour flow cytometry were undertaken at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months.
RESULTS: Seven patients [DLE (n = 5), chilblain lupus erythematosus (n = 1), subacute CLE (n = 1)] were evaluated. The median number of prior therapies was six (range 3-15), including rituximab in six of seven patients. Median CLASI-A showed rapid and sustained improvement from 17 at baseline to 6 (P = 0.016) at 1 month and 0 (P < 0.001) by 3 months. The median percentage reduction in CLASI-A at 3 months was 60%. Significant improvements were observed in Dermatology Life Quality Index scores (P < 0.001), EuroQol 5D visual analogue scale (P = 0.002) and LupusQoL fatigue, image and planning domains (P ≤ 0.05). One patient discontinued treatment owing to severe herpes zoster. Clinical responses paralleled discrete suppression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) from SLE blood transcriptome module M1.2 with more varied downregulation in other interferon modules. Myeloid and inflammation-annotated genes remained upregulated throughout treatment. Intermediate monocytes (CD14++CD16+) reduced to normal levels during therapy (P = 0.014), while other flow subsets showed no substantive changes.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate rapid efficacy of anifrolumab in DLE and rituximab-resistant CLE. Response is associated with suppression of a subset of ISGs and decline in intermediate monocytes. Suppression of all ISGs or the wider SLE blood transcriptome is not required for response.","['Carter LM', 'Wigston Z', 'Laws P', 'Vital EM']",2023,189,2,Br J Dermatol,"Carter LM, et al.

36941021,Panoramic view of clinical features of lupus erythematosus: a cross-sectional multicentre study from China.,"OBJECTIVE: Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a complicated disease with highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Previous studies have rarely included all subgroups of patients with lupus and have overlooked the importance of the cutaneous manifestations thereof. We aimed to compare the demographic and clinical differences among patients with different subtypes of lupus.
METHODS: This is the first real-world study with a relatively large sample size that simultaneously includes patients with isolated cutaneous lupus erythematosus (iCLE) and SLE. All samples were obtained from the Lupus Erythematosus Multicenter Case-control Study in Chinese populations (LEMCSC) (registration number: ChiCTR2100048939). Comparative analyses between different LE subgroups were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 2097 patients with lupus were included, with 1865 patients with SLE, 1648 with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), and 232 with iCLE. Among the patients with CLE, 1330 had acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ACLE); 160 had subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE); and 546 had chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE). The study included a relatively large number of patients with CCLE subtypes, including 311 with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), 262 with chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE) and 45 with lupus erythematosus profundus (LEP). Demographic characteristics, systemic involvement, mucocutaneous manifestations and autoantibodies were significantly different among the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: CLE and iCLE are two distinct disease states, and the selection of broad or narrow CLE definitions should be emphasised in scientific reports. LE-non-specific cutaneous lesions imply more severity, while self-reported photosensitivity and LE-specific cutaneous manifestations imply milder severity. Generalised ACLE appears to be a more severe state than localised ACLE, and CHLE appears to be more severe than DLE. Anti-Sjögren's syndrome-related antigen B (SSB) antibodies have higher specific directivity than anti-Sjögren's syndrome-related antigen A (SSA) antibodies for SCLE lesions. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies have a higher co-occurrence with ACLE and a lower co-occurrence with SCLE and CCLE. Compared with DLE, CHLE has significantly higher positive rates of anti-SSA/Ro60 (71%) and anti-SSA/Ro52 (42.4%) antibodies, whereas LEP is associated with a higher positive rate of antinucleosome antibodies (31.1%).","['Jin H', 'Zhou S', 'Yu Y', 'Zhao M', 'Wu H', 'Long H', 'Fu S', 'Wu R', 'Yin H', 'Liao J', 'Luo S', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang P', 'Tan Y', 'Luo S', 'Huang X', 'Li F', 'Ling G', 'Lu Q']",2023,10,1,Lupus Sci Med,"Jin H, et al.

36650407,Clinical spectrum and currently available treatment of type I interferonopathy Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a genetically determined disorder with a variable phenotype. Since the original description of AGS, advances in gene sequencing techniques have resulted in a significant broadening of the phenotypic spectrum associated with AGS genes, and new clinical pictures have emerged beyond the classic presentation. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the clinical spectrum of AGS and report currently available treatments and new immunosuppressive strategies.
DATA SOURCES: Literature reviews and original research articles were collected from databases, including PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. Relevant articles about AGS were included.
RESULTS: The involvement of the nervous system certainly represents the major cause of mortality and morbidity in AGS patients. However, other clinical manifestations, such as chilblains, hepatosplenomegaly, and hematological disturbances, may lead to the diagnosis and considerably impact the prognosis and overall quality of life of these patients. Therapeutic approaches of AGS are limited to interventions aimed at specific symptoms and the management of multiple comorbidities. However, advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AGS could open new and more effective therapies.
CONCLUSIONS: The over-activation of innate immunity due to upregulated interferon production plays a critical role in AGS, leading to multi-organ damage with the main involvement of the central nervous system. To date, there is no specific and effective treatment for AGS. New drugs specifically targeting the interferon pathway may bring new hope to AGS patients.","[""Dell'Isola GB"", 'Dini G', 'Culpepper KL', 'Portwood KE', 'Ferrara P', 'Di Cara G', 'Verrotti A', 'Lodolo M']",2023,19,7,World J Pediatr,"Dell'Isola GB, et al.

36636825,Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination.,"In December 2019, a new infectious pathogen named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China. Transmitted through respiratory droplets, SARS-CoV-2 is the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although this new COVID-19 infection is known to cause primarily interstitial pneumonia and respiratory failure, it is often associated with cutaneous manifestations as well. These manifestations with COVID-19 can be classified into seven categories: (i) chilblain-like skin eruption (e.g., COVID toes), (ii) urticaria-like skin eruption, (iii) maculopapular lesions, (iv) vesicular eruptions, (v) purpura, (vi) livedo reticularis and necrotic lesions, (vii) urticarial vasculitis, and others such as alopecia and herpes zoster. The pathogenesis of skin eruptions can be broadly divided into vasculitic and inflammatory skin eruptions. Various cutaneous adverse reactions have also been observed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. The major cutaneous adverse reactions are type I hypersensitivity (urticaria and anaphylaxis) and type IV hypersensitivity (COVID arm and erythema multiform). Autoimmune-mediated reactions including bullous pemphigus, vasculitis, vitiligo, and alopecia areata have also been reported. Several cases with chilblain-like lesions and herpes zoster after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination have been published. Various skin diseases associated with COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination have been reported, and the mechanism has been partly elucidated. In the process, for example, some papers have reported that it is not related to COVID-19 infection, although it was initially called COVID-toe and considered a COVID-19-associated cutaneous eruption. In fact, some COVID-19-associated skin reactions are indistinguishable from drug eruptions. In the future, the mechanisms of COVID-19- or COVID-19 vaccine-associated skin reactions need to be elucidated and verification of causal relationships is required.","['Nakashima C', 'Kato M', 'Otsuka A']",2023,50,3,J Dermatol,"Nakashima C, et al.

The most common cutaneous association of CD is dermatitis herpetiformis, although recent reports have sought to link CD with other dermatological and autoimmune diseases. Chilblain, also called pernio, is usually a benign, superficial and localized inflammatory skin disorder that results from a maladaptive vascular response to non-freezing cold. We present a patient with pernio (chilblains) and newly diagnosed CD, with a significant intestinal lesion-total villous atrophy, as there are only two known cases of this feature associated with CD published in the literature. In the workup of chilblains (pernio) in children, an active case finding for coeliac disease should be conducted with coeliac-specific serology testing.","['Mašić M', 'Močić Pavić A', 'Gagro A', 'Balažin Vučetić A', 'Ožanić Bulić S', 'Mišak Z']",2022,9,12,Children (Basel),"Mašić M, et al.

36534559,SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination and Chilblain-like Lesions: What Do We Know so Far?,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus pandemic has caused massive damage to global health care and the economy. The vaccination program has been paced around the globe to return as soon as possible to pre-COVID time. Although all the vaccines have been approved after the rigorous clinical and safety trials, some adverse effects have surfaced and are being reported from different parts of the world. One such side effect is chilblain-like lesions following the COVID vaccination. Chilblain lesions, also known as pernio, are an inflammatory condition usually affecting the acral regions of the body. It is mostly reported from cold and damp areas and has multiple causes associated with it.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the publicly available data and to provide concise and comprehensive information as well as evaluate the potential pathology, clinical approach, and management of CLL post-vaccination.
METHODS: An extensive literature search over PubMed, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and Clinicaltrails. gov from inception till 5th October 2021, without any restriction of language was carried out. All the recruited articles were reviewed, and their bibliographies were also screened for any relevant information.
RESULTS: 12 studies (10 case reports and 2 case series) were retrieved reporting the incidence of CLL post-vaccination. 8 studies reported incidence in female patients while 5 reported in males, with one study mentioning no gender. Moreover, most of them were either from Europe or the United States of America, except for two cases, reported from Turkey.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall incidence of Chilblains following COVID-19 vaccination is low, there is still a strong need to find out the exact mechanism behind this to redefine the safety and administration criteria of the vaccines and to formulate a proper management protocol.","['Shaikh TG', 'Waseem S', 'Ahmed SH', 'Qadir NA', 'Piccolo V']",2022,12,4,Dermatol Pract Concept,"Shaikh TG, et al.

36467982,Cutaneous Manifestations of Autoinflammatory Diseases.,"Autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders in which recurrent or continuous aseptic inflammation arises primarily through antigen-independent hyperactivation of the innate immune system. The skin is frequently involved with a wide variety of cutaneous manifestations, most of which are non-specific. Recognition of skin lesions in AIDs may sometimes provide clues for a correct diagnosis. In this review, the cutaneous involvements of >20 selected AIDs were summarized and organized into different categories based on their characteristic manifestations, such as urticarial dermatosis, neutrophilic dermatosis, granulomatosis, chilblain, lipodystrophy, and hyperkeratosis. With this classification scheme, cutaneous manifestations in AIDs could be more easily identified to facilitate diagnosis in clinical practice.","['Wu D', 'Shen M', 'Yao Q']",2021,2,4,Rheumatol Immunol Res,"Wu D, et al.

In line with the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation, the underlying lesional inflammation in LE skin samples is defined by different immune cell infiltrates. Pathophysiologically, lesional inflammation is driven by autoreactive cytotoxic T cells, targeting keratinocytes; plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), producing large amounts of interferon (IFN); and B cells, whose function in cutaneous LE is still unclear. This study aims to (a) classify inflammatory patterns with regard to the dominating cell type or cytokine expression and (b) investigating the specific role of B cells in LE skin lesions.

Its pathogenesis remains poorly understood because it is often studied as secondary to other underlying conditions.
METHODS: We systematically investigated the population characteristics, symptoms, and predisposing factors of chilblains in healthy adults exposed to cool/cold environments. We screened PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, and we adopted PRISMA reporting guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42021245307). The risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers (RTI item bank). Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed to calculate the pooled prevalence of histopathological features. Mixed-effects meta-regressions were used to assess other sources of between-study heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies (477 patients) were included. Chilblains affect more women than men, up to 12% of the body skin surface, and most frequently, the hands and fingers. Meta-analyses of nine studies (303 patients) showed a frequent presence of perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (81%), basal epidermal-cell layer vacuolation (67%), papillary dermal edema (66%), and perieccrine lymphocytic infiltrate (57%).

36342945,COVID-19 and cutaneous manifestations: A review of the published literature.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. COVID-19 outbreak, which caused thousands of deaths, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.
AIM: Skin manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection can be divided mainly into five groups: chilblainlike lesions (CBLLs), maculopapular eruptions, urticarial eruptions, vesicular eruptions, and livedo or necrosis. Other skin findings reported are erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions and skin findings associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and rarely with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A). Other manifestations such as pityriasis rosea or shingles are also reported.
METHODS: A total of 60 articles including reviews, studies and case reports were selected for the evaluation in this review.
RESULTS: The skin manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection are numerous and can vary widely. The major dermatological patterns of COVID-19 can be classified as inflammatory reactions (maculopapular/morbilliform, urticarial and vesicular rashes), or lesions of vascular origin (chilblain like rashes, petechiae/purpura, and livedo acemose-like pattern) CONCLUSION: We believe that the dermatologist could play an important role in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through early recognition of skin lesions suggestive of COVID-19, particularly in paucisymptomatic infections where this recognition could direct toward an early diagnosis of infection that certainly leads to a better prognosis.","['Martora F', 'Villani A', 'Fabbrocini G', 'Battista T']",2023,22,1,J Cosmet Dermatol,"Martora F, et al.

RECENT FINDINGS: The most commonly reported cutaneous reactions after COVID-19 infection in the literature to date include morbilliform or maculopapular rashes, chilblains, and urticaria. The incidence of cutaneous reactions after COVID-19 vaccination was 9% in larger cohort studies and more commonly occurred after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines than adenovirus vector vaccines. The most frequently reported cutaneous reactions after COVID-19 vaccines were delayed large local reactions, local injection site reactions, urticarial eruptions, and morbilliform eruptions.
SUMMARY: With the ongoing pandemic, and continued development of new COVID-19 variants and vaccines, the landscape of cutaneous reactions continues to rapidly evolve. Dermatologists have an important role in evaluating skin manifestations of the virus, as well as discussion and promoting COVID-19 vaccination for their patients.","['Singh R', 'Freeman EE']",2022,11,4,Curr Dermatol Rep,"Singh R and Freeman EE.

36237171,A comprehensive narrative review of the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19.,"The systemic and respiratory clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include fever, coughing, sneezing, sore throat, rhinitis, dyspnea, chest pain, malaise, fatigue, anorexia and headache. Moreover, cutaneous manifestations have been reported in 0.2% to 20.4% of cases. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 leads to a better prognosis; knowledge of its cutaneous manifestations is one way that may help fulfil this goal. In this review, PubMed and Medline were searched with the terms ""dermatology"", ""skin"" and ""cutaneous"", each in combination with ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""COVID-19"". All articles, including original articles, case reports, case series and review articles published from the emergence of the disease to the time of submission, were included. In this comprehensive narrative review, we tried to provide an analysis of the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19, including maculopapular rash, urticaria, Chilblain-like, vesicular lesions, livedo reticularis and petechiae in asymptomatic/symptomatic COVID-19 patients that might be the first complication of infection after respiratory symptoms. Immune dysregulation, cytokine storms, side effects of antiviral drugs, environmental conditions and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy might be involved in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, knowledge of cutaneous COVID-19 manifestations might be vital in achieving a quick diagnosis in some COVID-19 patients, which would help control the pandemic. Further research is very much warranted to clarify this issue.","['Arefinia N', 'Ghoreshi ZA', 'Alipour AH', 'Iranmanesh B', 'Mehrolhasani N', 'Shamsi-Meymandi S', 'Sarvari J']",2023,20,3,Int Wound J,"Arefinia N, et al.

36228990,Chilblain-like lesions coinciding with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,"Chilblain-like lesions (CLL) coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described. Previous systematic reviews suggest CLL are associated with younger age, an equal sex ratio, negative testing for SARS-CoV-2, and mild to no extracutaneous symptoms. A systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines on CLL coinciding with SARS-CoV-2 to clarify the demographic characteristics, clinical features, and resolution outcomes of these skin findings. One hundred twenty-eight studies, published between March 2020 and January 2022, met inclusion criteria and were summarized in this review, representing 4,982 cases of CLL. Available data showed a slight female predominance (55%, n = 2,471 of 4,472). The mean age was 25 years, ranging from 0 to 95 years. Most cases were not associated with extracutaneous signs and symptoms (63%, n = 1,649 of 2,636). Overall, 19% (n = 347 of 1,838) of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction, serology, or tissue biopsy. Clinical course was generally benign with 80% (n = 979 of 1,224) of cases resolving and 47% (n = 204 of 432) resolving without receiving treatment. This review provides a comprehensive summary of CLL associated with SARS-CoV-2. CLL occurred at a mean age of 25 years with a slight female predominance. The majority had negative COVID-19 testing, no extracutaneous signs and symptoms, and resolution without recurrence.","['Starkey SY', 'Mar K', 'Kashetsky N', 'Lam JM', 'Dutz J', 'Mukovozov I']",2023,41,1,Clin Dermatol,"Starkey SY, et al.

36208009,Pentoxifylline in dermatology.,"BACKGROUND: Pentoxifylline was initially marketed for use in patients with intermittent claudication due to chronic occlusive arterial disease of the extremities but has since been shown to have several off-label uses in dermatology.
AIMS: The aim of this review is to increase awareness of the several applications of pentoxifylline in the field of dermatology.
METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted in May 2022 using the following phrases ""dermatology"" AND ""pentoxifylline."" Our search period spanned 34 years from 1988 to 2022. All available literature was reviewed. Reference lists of identified articles were included. Studies were excluded if they were not in English and if the study was out of scope. Eighty-one articles were included in this review.
RESULTS: Pentoxifylline has been used to treat various dermatological conditions including peripheral vascular disease, vasculitis and vasculopathies, chilblains, pigmented purpuric dermatosis, granuloma annulare, necrobiosis, keloids, lichen sclerosis et atrophicus, scars, radiation-induced fibrosis, vitiligo, alopecia areata, leishmaniasis, and leprosy.
CONCLUSIONS: Pentoxifylline's use in dermatology is growing. However, there are limited larger studies and randomized control trials on the use of pentoxifylline in dermatology and more investigation is needed to evaluate its use for many dermatologic conditions. Pentoxifylline's unique mechanism of action as well as its good tolerability, cost-effectiveness, and minimal drug interactions make it a convenient primary or adjunctive option in many dermatological conditions.","['Balazic E', 'Axler E', 'Konisky H', 'Khanna U', 'Kobets K']",2023,22,2,J Cosmet Dermatol,"Balazic E, et al.

36197514,Dermatopathology of COVID-19 infection and vaccination.,"BACKGROUND: Many peculiar skin changes have been described in relation to both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and vaccination.
OBJECTIVE: This paper provides an overview of these dermatologic manifestations, focusing on their dermatopathological appearances.
RESULTS: Most COVID-19 patients develop variegated maculopapular eruptions with a combination of histological patterns commonly including keratinocyte apoptosis and eosinophilia. Urticaria-like lesions often show a combination of spongiotic and lichenoid patterns and are more frequent in individuals with severe disease. Vesicular lesions can be disseminated; in some cases, they become pustular and in others show dyskeratosis and a peculiar form of ballooning. Some patients develop vesicular Grover disease on the trunk. Young patients with a strong immunological response can eliminate the virus easily but may develop chilblains as a consequence of the high interferon response. Conversely, older individuals with immunosenescence and a tendency toward hypercoagulability can present livedoid and ischemic areas. Regarding COVID-19 vaccination, hypersensitivity reactions are most frequent, including ""COVID-arm."" Nonetheless, a combination of local and systemic cutaneous manifestations (reactogenicity) is commonly seen. Histopathologically, lichenoid and spongiotic changes and a variable number of eosinophils are typical of rashes characterized by papules and plaques. Other dermatological side effects of COVID-19 vaccination include lesions mimicking well-defined dermatoses such as lichen planus or bullous pemphigoid and triggering of collagenous diseases.
CONCLUSION: Well-characterized skin manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include chilblains, livedo necrotic lesions, vesicular eruptions, urticarial lesions, and maculopapular eruptions. Hypersensitivity reactions are common after SARS-CoV‑2 mRNA vaccination.

36065533,"Chilblains observed during the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be distinguished from classic, cold-related chilblains.","BACKGROUND: Type 1 interferon (IFN-I) response induced by SARS-CoV-2 has been hypothesized to explain the association between chilblain lesions (CL) and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
OBJECTIVE: To explore direct cytopathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in CL and to focus on IFN-I expression in patients with chilblains.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A monocentric cohort of 43 patients presenting with CL from April 2020 to May 2021 were included. During this period, all CL were, a priori, considered to be SARS-CoV-2-related. RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and measurements of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were performed. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunostainings as well as SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR were performed on biopsy specimens of CL and controls. Expression of MX1 and IRF7 was analysed on patients’ biopsy specimens and/or PBMC and compared with controls and/or chilblains observed before the pandemic. Serum IFN-α was also measured.
RESULTS: RT-qPCR was negative in all patients and serological tests were positive in 11 patients. Immunostaining targeting viral proteins confirmed the lack of specificity. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained undetected in all CL specimens. MX1 immunostaining was positive in CL and in pre-pandemic chilblains compared to controls. MX1 and IRF7 expression was significantly increased in CL specimens but not in PBMC. Serum IFN-α was undetected in CL patients.

35996053,"Chronic Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus in a White Population: Dermoscopic Characteristics by Clinical Subtype, Lesion Location and Disease Duration.","INTRODUCTION: Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE) comprises three major clinical variants: discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE), and lupus erythematosus profundus, also referred to as lupus erythematosus panniculitis (LEP). The aim of the current study was to systematically describe the dermoscopic features of CCLE in Polish patients with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes I-III.
METHODS: The videodermoscopic images from patients with various clinical variants of CCLE (DLE, CHLE and LEP) were reviewed. Predefined parameters for dermoscopic evaluation in general dermatology were used to describe the findings in lesions located beyond the scalp. In the analysis of trichoscopic findings in lesions located on the scalp, dermoscopic features of follicular openings, hair shafts, the perifollicular surface, the interfollicular surface and vessel morphology were considered. Based on personal experience, several additional dermoscopic and trichoscopic characteristics were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 85 lesions from 26 patients (16 women and 10 men; mean age 40.8 ± 11.2 years) were assessed. DLE on glabrous skin showed polymorphous vessels (89.1%), pink-red background (70.9%), follicular plugs (67.3%) and white scaling (58.2%), while scalp DLE was characterized by polymorphous vessels (83.3%), yellow dots (66.7%), follicular plugs (55.6%) and a reduced number of follicles (55.6%). Labial DLE (n = 2) showed linear branched and linear curved vessels, white structureless areas, red structureless (hemorrhagic) areas and red dots/globules. White scaling (61.1% vs. 34.1%; p = 0.042), gray-brown dots/globules (44.4% vs. 12.2%; p = 0.015) and peripheral pigmentation (100.0% vs. 46.2%; p = 0.036) were significantly more common in long-lasting (> 1 year) DLE lesions. CHLE (n = 5) presented with polymorphous vessels, white scales, pink-red background, red structureless areas and red dots/globules. LEP showed polymorphous vessels, white-yellow scales, follicular plugs, white structureless areas and red hemorrhagic areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Dermoscopy might be useful in the preliminary diagnosis of DLE, and its role in the diagnosis of CHLE and LEP needs further elucidation.","['Żychowska M', 'Reich A']",2022,12,9,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),"Żychowska M and Reich A.

35964089,Characteristics and genetic analysis of patients suspected with early-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.,"BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is rarely diagnosed before 5-years-old. Those with disease onset at a very young age are predicted by a higher genetic risk and a more severe phenotype. We performed whole-exome sequencing to survey the genetic etiologies and clinical manifestations in patients fulfilling 2012 SLICC SLE classification criteria before the age of 5.
CASE PRESENTATION: Among the 184 childhood-onset SLE patients regularly followed in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan, 7 cases (3.8%) of which onset ≦ 5 years of age were identified for characteristic review and genetic analysis. Compared to those onset at elder age, cases onset before the age of 5 are more likely to suffer from proliferative glomerulonephritis, renal thrombotic microangiopathy, neuropsychiatric disorder and failure to thrive. Causative genetic etiologies were identified in 3. In addition to the abundance of autoantibodies, patient with homozygous TREX1 (c.292_293 ins A) mutation presented with chilblain-like skin lesions, peripheral spasticity, endocrinopathy and experienced multiple invasive infections. Patient with SLC7A7 (c.625 + 1 G > A) mutation suffered from profound glomerulonephritis with full-house glomerular deposits as well as hyperammonemia, metabolic acidosis and episodic conscious disturbance. Two other cases harbored variants in lupus associating genes C1s, C2, DNASE1 and DNASE1L3 and another with CFHR4. Despite fulfilling the classification criteria for lupus, many of the patients required treatments beyond conventional therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic etiologies and lupus mimickers were found among a substantial proportion of patients suspected with early-onset SLE. Detail clinical evaluation and genetic testing are important for tailored care and personalized treatment.","['Lee WF', 'Fan WL', 'Tseng MH', 'Yang HY', 'Huang JL', 'Wu CY']",2022,20,1,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,"Lee WF, et al.

The aim of this systematic literature review was to determine the type, prevalence, time of onset, and evolution of cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 in newborns, children, and adolescents, after excluding multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). PubMed, Tripdatabase, ClinicalTrials, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using an ad hoc string for case reports/series and observational studies, published between December 2019 and February 2022. Study quality was assessed using the STROBE and CARE tools. Seventy-three (49 case reports/series and 24 studies) out of 26,545 identified articles were included in the analysis. Dermatological lesions were highly heterogeneous for clinical presentation, time of onset, and association with other COVID-19 manifestations. Overall, they mainly affected the acral portions, and typically presented a favorable outcome. Pseudo-chilblains were the most common.
CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous manifestations could be the only/predominant and early manifestation of COVID-19 that could precede other more severe manifestations by days or weeks. Therefore, physicians of all disciplines should be familiar with them.
WHAT IS KNOWN: • A variety of cutaneous manifestations have been reported in association with COVID-19. • Urticaria, maculopapular, or vesicular rashes can occur at any age, while chilblains and erythema multiforme are more common in children and young patients.
WHAT IS NEW: • Skin lesions related to SARS-CoV-2 infection often show a peculiar acral distribution. • Mucocutaneous lesions of various type may be the only/predominant manifestation of COVID-19; they could present in paucisymptomatic and severely ill patients and occur at different stages of the disease.","['Dondi A', 'Sperti G', 'Gori D', 'Guaraldi F', 'Montalti M', 'Parini L', 'Piraccini BM', 'Lanari M', 'Neri I']",2022,181,10,Eur J Pediatr,"Dondi A, et al.

Examining data from this cohort could provide useful information to help with the management of COVID-19. To that end, we conducted a systematic review primarily to assess rash morphologies associated with COVID-19 and their relationship with disease severity. Secondary outcomes include demographics, distribution, dermatological symptoms, timeline, diagnostic method and medication history. The literature was searched for all patients with skin manifestations thought to be related to suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Patients with a history of dermatological, rheumatological or occupational skin disorders were excluded. Of the 2056 patients selected, the most common morphologies were chilblain-like lesions (54.2%), maculopapular (13.6%) and urticaria (8.3%). Chilblain-like lesions were more frequent in the younger population (mean age 21.5, standard deviation ± 10.8) and were strongly linked with milder disease, not requiring an admission (odds ratio [OR] 35.36 [95% confidence interval {CI} 23.58, 53.03]). Conversely, acro-ischaemia and livedo reticularis were associated with worse outcomes, including a need for ICU (OR 34.01 [95% CI 16.62, 69.57] and OR 5.57 [95% CI 3.02, 10.30], respectively) and mortality (OR 25.66 [95% CI 10.83, 60.79] and OR 10.71 [95% CI 4.76, 24.13], respectively). Acral lesions were the most common site (83.5%). 35.1% experienced pruritus, 16.4% had pain and 4.7% reported a burning sensation. 34.1% had asymptomatic lesions. Rash was the only symptom in 20.9% and occurred before or alongside systemic symptoms in 12.4%. 28.3% had a positive polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab and 5.4% had positive antibodies, while 21.9% tested negative and 45.1% were not tested.

Studying multinational cohorts, we found that, in CLLs, NETs were significantly increased in serum and skin. There was geographic variability in the prevalence of increased NETs in MIS-C, in association with disease severity. MIS-C and CLL serum samples displayed decreased NET degradation ability, in association with C1q and G-actin or anti-NET antibodies, respectively, but not with genetic variants of DNases. In adult COVID-19, persistent elevations in NETs after disease diagnosis were detected but did not occur in asymptomatic infection. COVID-19-affected adults displayed significant prevalence of impaired NET degradation, in association with anti-DNase1L3, G-actin, and specific disease manifestations, but not with genetic variants of DNases. NETs were detected in many organs of adult patients who died from COVID-19 complications. Infection with the Omicron variant was associated with decreased NET levels when compared with other SARS-CoV-2 strains. These data support a role for NETs in the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19 in pediatric and adult patients.","['Carmona-Rivera C', 'Zhang Y', 'Dobbs K', 'Markowitz TE', 'Dalgard CL', 'Oler AJ', 'Claybaugh DR', 'Draper D', 'Truong M', 'Delmonte OM', 'Licciardi F', 'Ramenghi U', 'Crescenzio N', 'Imberti L', 'Sottini A', 'Quaresima V', 'Fiorini C', 'Discepolo V', 'Lo Vecchio A', 'Guarino A', 'Pierri L', 'Catzola A', 'Biondi A', 'Bonfanti P', 'Poli Harlowe MC', 'Espinosa Y', 'Astudillo C', 'Rey-Jurado E', 'Vial C', 'de la Cruz J', 'Gonzalez R', 'Pinera C', 'Mays JW', 'Ng A', 'Platt A', 'NIH COVID Autopsy Consortium', 'COVID STORM Clinicians', 'Drolet B', 'Moon J', 'Cowen EW', 'Kenney H', 'Weber SE', 'Castagnoli R', 'Magliocco M', 'Stack MA', 'Montealegre G', 'Barron K', 'Fink DL', 'Kuhns DB', 'Hewitt SM', 'Arkin LM', 'Chertow DS', 'Su HC', 'Notarangelo LD', 'Kaplan MJ']",2022,7,16,JCI Insight,"Carmona-Rivera C, et al.

They include primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), which is the most common, secondary RP and erythermalgia. They are to be distinguished from non-paroxysmal acrosyndromes such as acrocyanosis and chilblains, which are very frequent and often associated with RP, digital ischemia and necrosis, spontaneous digital hematoma and acrocholosis. The challenge of a consultation for a vascular acrosyndrome is to make positive diagnosis through history and clinical examination, and to specify its nature, to prescribe complementary exams. In any patient consulting for RP, assessment includes at least an antinuclear antibody test and capillaroscopy. For erythermalgia, a blood count and even a search for JAK2 mutation are required. A thryoid-stimulating hormon assay, a test for antinuclear antibodies, and a search for small fiber neuropathy are also performed. The treatment of RP is essentially documented for secondary RP where calcium channel blockers are indicated in first line, and iloprost in severe cases. The treatment of primitive erythermalgia is based on sodium channel blockers such as mexiletine or lidocaine infusions, and on drugs effective on neuropathic pain, such as gabapentin or amitryptiline, in case of erythermalgia associated with small fiber neuropathy.

35797144,Complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in children.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although during the initial stages of COVID-19 pandemic, the pediatric population seemed to be less affected, a number of SARS-CoV-2-related manifestations emerged over time, the principal of which is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Here we provide an update on the main pediatric disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
RECENT FINDINGS: MIS-C is novel postinfectious manifestation with clinical features similar to Kawasaki disease and characterized by intense systemic inflammation affecting multiple organs. Many children required intensive care therapy because of circulatory shock, usually of myocardial origin. Appropriate treatment with immunomodulatory therapies led to favorable outcomes in most patients, with recovery of overall health and cardiac dysfunction. In addition to MIS-C, a variety of other complications of COVID-19 in children have been described, including thrombotic events, neurologic manifestations, and chilblain-like lesions. There is still uncertainty about the true prevalence of long COVID in children and its distinction from pandemic-related complaints.
SUMMARY: The experience gained so far with MIS-C and the other SARS-CoV-2-related complications in children and adolescents will facilitate accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of MIS-C and to determine the real impact of long-COVID in the pediatric age group.","['Caorsi R', 'Civino A', 'Ravelli A']",2022,34,5,Curr Opin Rheumatol,"Caorsi R, et al.

Articles including data about the patients with 1) onset of vasculitis <18 years of age, 2) evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 3) evidence of vasculitis diagnosis (imaging, histopathologic evidences or fulfilling the specific diagnostic/classification criteria) were included in the final analysis. Patients with Kawasaki disease-like vasculitis associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 25 articles describing 36 patients with COVID-19 associated pediatric vasculitis (median age 13 years; M/F: 2.3) were included. The most frequent phenotype was IgA vasculitis (n=9) followed by chilblains (n=7) and ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) (n=5). Skin (58.3%) and renal (30.5%) involvements were the most common manifestations of vasculitis. The majority of patients received corticosteroids (40%), while rituximab (14.2%) and cyclophosphamide (11.4%) were the most frequently used immunosuppressive drugs. Remission was achieved in 23 of 28 patients. Five patients (4 with central nervous system vasculitis; 1 with AAV) died.
CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 associated pediatric vasculitis is very rare, awareness of this rare entity is important to secure earlier diagnosis and treatment. The clinical features of COVID-19 associated pediatric vasculitis subtypes look similar to those in pediatric vasculitis not associated with COVID-19. Whether COVID-19 is the reason of the vasculitis or only the trigger remains unknown.","['Batu ED', 'Sener S', 'Ozen S']",2022,55,,Semin Arthritis Rheum,"Batu ED, et al.

35703724,COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations in children and adolescents: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cutaneous manifestations described in pediatric patients and discuss their relevance for early diagnosis.
DATA SOURCE: The study consisted of a systematic review of original articles indexed in PubMed and Embase databases, as well as gray literature articles found through Google Scholar. A search strategy, based on PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) Tool, with the terms ""child,"" ""infant,"" ""childhood,"" ""adolescents,"" ""teenagers,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" and ""skin manifestations,"" was performed to optimize the findings. The study did not restrict any article regarding language.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Out of the 310 articles that initially met the inclusion criteria, 35 were selected for review, totalizing 369 patients. The most common COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations in children and adolescents were Chilblain-like lesions, presented in 67.5% of the cases, followed by erythema multiforme-like (31.7%) and varicella-like lesions (0.8%). The Chilblain-like lesions appeared 7.6 days (95%CI 7.4-7.8) after the viral infection and lasted for 17.5 days (95%CI 16.5-18.5), erythema multiforme-like lesions appeared in 9.5 days (95%CI 9-10) and lasted for 10.3 days (95%CI 9.1-11.5), and varicella-like lesions appeared in 12.3 days (95%CI 4-20.6) and lasted for 7 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the different skin manifestations in children and adolescents with COVID-19 is essential for an early diagnosis and, consequently, the possibility of promptly care adoption as well as to interrupt the new coronavirus transmission chains in the current pandemic context.","['Pasquini Neto R', 'Mazzo FAT', 'Vieira FA', 'Bueno GS', 'Previdi JVC', 'Silva LRD', 'Silva NKBD', 'Jorizzo JL', 'Cerci FB']",2022,40,,Rev Paul Pediatr,"Pasquini Neto R, et al.

Most cases were described in patients with negative microbiological tests for SARS-CoV-2, therefore the possible relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as with the nowadays broadly available mRNA-based vaccination, has not been fully elucidated.  CASE PRESENTATION: We here describe the case of a 14-year-old male who developed chilblain-like skin eruptions during SARS-CoV-2 infection despite two mRNA-based vaccine doses and review the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of chilblain-like lesions as a cutaneous presentation of COVID-19 in children.
CONCLUSIONS: Most children and adolescent with COVID toes have a mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our report aims to highlight the possible onset of these skin lesions in vaccinated children, if infection has occurred, and the potential use of systemic corticosteroids as a first line treatment. Additional evidence is required to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and cutaneous manifestations in children and determine the relationship between chilblain-like lesions and COVID-19 vaccination.","['Paparella R', 'Tarani L', 'Properzi E', 'Costantino F', 'Saburri C', 'Lucibello R', 'Richetta A', 'Spalice A', 'Leonardi L']",2022,48,1,Ital J Pediatr,"Paparella R, et al.

35656967,Intracellular Sensing of DNA in Autoinflammation and Autoimmunity.,"Evidence has shown that DNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, posing a unique challenge in the discrimination between endogenous and foreign DNA. This challenge is highlighted by certain autoinflammatory diseases that arise from monogenic mutations and result in periodic flares of inflammation, typically in the absence of autoantibodies or antigen-specific T lymphocytes. Several autoinflammatory diseases arise due to mutations in genes that normally prevent the accrual of endogenous DNA or are due to mutations that cause activation of intracellular DNA-sensing pathway components. Evidence from genetically modified murine models further support an ability of endogenous DNA and DNA sensing to drive disease pathogenesis, prompting the question of whether endogenous DNA can also induce inflammation in human autoimmune diseases. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of intracellular DNA sensing and downstream signaling pathways as they pertain to autoinflammatory disease, including the development of monogenic disorders such as Stimulator of interferon genes-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. In addition, we discuss systemic rheumatic diseases, including certain forms of systemic lupus erythematosus, familial chilblain lupus, and other diseases with established links to intracellular DNA-sensing pathways, and highlight the lessons learned from these examples as they apply to the development of therapies targeting these pathways.","['MacLauchlan S', 'Fitzgerald KA', 'Gravallese EM']",2022,74,10,Arthritis Rheumatol,"MacLauchlan S, et al.

Cutaneous manifestations are reported by patients following disease recovery.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to document various skin lesions relating to COVID-19 symptoms either before, during, or after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
METHODS: This was a descriptive study with 273 patients who had cutaneous manifestations after recovering from COVID-19. Each patient provided a thorough medical history and underwent a general physical examination. Following polymerase chain reaction analysis, all participants were confirmed to be COVID-19 patients.
RESULTS: Acral lesions were the most common, accounting for 39% of all cases. An erythematous maculopapular rash was found in 21% of cases and was the second most common after urticaria, with fewer cases of erythema multiform, vesicular rash (9%), vascular livedo reticularis, figurate erythema, and flexural rash documented.
CONCLUSION: The most common cutaneous changes seen in patients with COVID-19 were pseudo-chilblain acral lesions, which had a good prognosis.

35551623,Analysis of clinical characteristics of children with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome in China.,"BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) is an inflammatory disorder belonging to the type I interferonopathy group. The clinical diagnosis of AGS is difficult, which can lead to a high mortality rate. Overall, there is a lack of large-sample research data on AGS in China. We aim to summarize the clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with AGS and provide clues for clinical diagnostic.
METHODS: The genetic and clinical features of Chinese patients with AGS were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).
RESULTS: A total of 23 cases were included, consisting of 7 cases of AGS1 with three prime repair exonuclease 1 mutations, 3 of AGS2 with ribonuclease H2 subunit B (RNASEH2B) mutations, 3 of ASG3 with RNASEH2C, 1 of AGS4 with RNASEH2A mutations, 2 of AGS6 with adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 mutations, and 7 of AGS7 with interferon induced with helicase C domain 1 mutations. Onset before the age of 3 years occurred in 82.6%. Neurologic involvement was most common (100%), including signs of intracranial calcification which mainly distributed in the bilateral basal ganglia, leukodystrophy, dystonia, epilepsy, brain atrophy and dysphagia. Intellectual disability, language disability and motor skill impairment were also observed. Skin manifestations (60.87%) were dominated by a chilblain-like rash. Features such as microcephaly (47.62%), short stature (52.38%), liver dysfunction (42.11%), thyroid dysfunction (46.15%), positive autoimmune antibodies (66.67%), and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (53.85%) were also found. The phenotypes of 2 cases fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE). One death was recorded. ISGs expression were elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: AGS is a systemic disease that causes sequelae and mortality. A diagnosis of AGS should be considered for patients who have an early onset of chilblain-like rash, intracranial calcification, leukodystrophy, dystonia, developmental delay, positive autoimmune antibodies, and elevated ISGs, and for those diagnosed with SLE with atypical presentation who are nonresponsive to conventional treatments. Comprehensive assessment of vital organ function and symptomatic treatment are important.","['Wang W', 'Wang W', 'He TY', 'Zou LP', 'Li WD', 'Yu ZX', 'Ma MS', 'Yang J', 'Song HM']",2022,18,7,World J Pediatr,"Wang W, et al.

35463901,"Case Report, Practices Survey and Literature Review of an Under-Recognized Pediatric Vascular Disorder: The BASCULE Syndrome.","INTRODUCTION: Bier anemic spots, cyanosis, and urticaria-like eruption (BASCULE) syndrome is an underreported pediatric vascular disorder from the group of acrosyndromes. In children, these include paroxysmal acrosyndromes (Raynaud's phenomenon and chilblain-like lesions), permanent acrosyndromes (acrocyanosis), and transient acrosyndromes, in which their pathogeneses are associated with virus infections, Epstein-Barr virus, and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2, respectively.
METHODS: We reported a case of BASCULE syndrome associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and provided a narrative review of case reports describing the BASCULE syndrome in children. Moreover, we presented the results of a prospective practice survey that we performed in the French medical community.
RESULTS: A 14-years-old boy reported pruritic erythrocyanic lesions on the lower limbs, which occurred whenever he was in a standing position and fully resolved when he laid down. He reported asthenia and cramps. He presented a typical BASCULE syndrome associated with POTS confirmed by a tilt-test. Physical and vascular examinations were within the normal range. We identified 12 case reports, describing 21 pediatric cases since 2016. Most patients were adolescents between 12 and 19 years of age or were newborns. Furthermore, 20% of cases in the literature have presented POTS or orthostatic intolerance. Our survey among 95 French physicians confirmed that BASCULE syndrome is an underdiagnosed and under recognized disease in the general pediatric practice, at least in France. Among these physicians, 65% had already encountered patients with similar symptoms, but only 30% declared that they had knowledge of the BASCULE syndrome.
CONCLUSION: The under-recognition of the clinical manifestations leads the patients to consult emergency rooms, with multiple unnecessary investigations performed. Therefore, we suggest that the diagnosis of BASCULE syndrome is based on clinical observations, without the need for laboratory tests, to avoid unnecessary health costs. We suggest physicians to perform a tilt-test when POTS is suspected.","['Baurens N', 'Briand C', 'Giovannini-Chami L', 'De Guillebon De Resnes JM', 'Hubiche T', 'Chiaverini C', 'Giordana P', 'Leftheriotis G', 'Bernardor J']",2022,10,,Front Pediatr,"Baurens N, et al.

35445943,Design and optimization of a novel herbosomal-loaded PEG-poloxamer topical formulation for the treatment of cold injuries: a quality-by-design approach.,"The spectrum of cold injuries ranges from frostnip, chilblains to severe frostbite. Cold injuries occur upon prolonged exposure to freezing temperature and are pathologically a combination of ice crystal formation in the tissue resulting in inflammation, thrombosis and ischemia in the extremities, often necessitating limb amputation in extreme cases due to tissue necrosis. Severe forms of frostbite are a cause of major concern to patients as well as the treating physician. Due to the lack of effective treatment modalities and paucity of research on prophylaxis and therapeutics of cold injuries, we developed a novel herbosomal-loaded PEG-poloxamer topical formulation (n-HPTF) employing quality-by-design (QBD) approach. Natural compounds exhibiting potent therapeutic potential for the management of cold injuries were incorporated in novel lipid vesicles (herbosomes) loaded in PEG-poloxamer polymers. The herbosomal formulation effectively creates an occlusion barrier that promotes epithelial regeneration, desmosome scale-up and angiogenesis and thus promotes rapid healing, indicating controlled release of herbosomes.

Two family members were hospitalized and one of them succumbed with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia within 10 days of exposure. Biopsy specimen of the distal toe 16 weeks after initial exposure showed papillary dermal capillary thrombosis with endothelial swelling, telangiectasia, and peri-eccrine lymphocytic infiltrates resembling pernio. Overall, this is the first case of biopsy specimen of ""long COVID toe"" following presumed SARS-CoV-2 exposure, with a demonstration of thrombotic vasculopathy, toe cyanosis, and pernio-like pathology.","['Nirenberg MS', 'Requena L', 'Santonja C', 'Smith GT', 'McClain SA']",2022,49,9,J Cutan Pathol,"Nirenberg MS, et al.

35338000,Pandemic chilblains: Are they SARS-CoV-2-related or not?,"The exact etiopathology of chilblains observed during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still unclear. Initially, SARS-CoV-2 appeared as the obvious causing agent, but two years of various investigations have failed to convincingly support its direct implication. Most affected individuals have no detectable virus, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and no symptoms of COVID-19. Analyses of skin biopsies similarly failed to unambiguously demonstrate presence of the virus or its genome. In a recent hypothesis, SARS-CoV-2 would cause the lesions before being promptly eliminated by unusually strong type I interferon responses. With others, we feel that environmental factors have not been sufficiently considered, in particular cold exposure related to unprecedented containment measures. The cause of pandemic chilblains remains a stimulating puzzle which warrants further investigation.","['De Greef A', 'Coulie PG', 'Baeck M']",2022,237,,Clin Immunol,"De Greef A, et al.

35336199,Cutaneous Complications of mRNA and AZD1222 COVID-19 Vaccines: A Worldwide Review.,"Because of the increasing emergence of cutaneous reactions from COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, we investigated the published reports of these complications. We searched the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases and the preprint server bioRxiv for articles on cutaneous complications linked to mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca-Oxford University) vaccines published until 30 September 2021. Eighty studies describing a total of 1415 reactions were included. Cutaneous reactions were more prevalent in females (81.6%). Delayed large local reactions were the most common complication (40.4%), followed by local injection site reactions (16.5%), zoster (9.5%), and urticarial eruptions (9.0%). Injection site and delayed large local reactions were predominantly caused by the mRNA-1273 vaccine (79.5% and 72.0%, respectively). BNT162b2 vaccination was more closely linked to distant reactions (50.1%) than mRNA-1273 (30.0%). Zoster was the most common distant reaction. Of reactions with adequate information for both vaccine doses, 58.3% occurred after the first dose only, 26.9% after the second dose only, and 14.8% after both doses. Overall, a large spectrum of cutaneous reaction patterns occurred following the COVID-19 vaccination. Most were mild and without long-term health implications. Therefore, the occurrence of such dermatologic complications does not contraindicate subsequent vaccination.","['Kroumpouzos G', 'Paroikaki ME', 'Yumeen S', 'Bhargava S', 'Mylonakis E']",2022,10,3,Microorganisms,"Kroumpouzos G, et al.

35319174,Acrocyanosis in a large italian pediatric series during the Covid-19 pandemic.,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV2 infection may present at onset with cutaneous manifestations as chilblains, pernio-like lesions characterized by rapid onset, itching, pain and tenderness and quick improvement with re-warming as similarly observed in primary acrocyanosis. The purpose of the present study was to detect in a single institution series of pediatric patients, during COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of acrocyanosis compared to previous period and an eventual correlation with SARS-Cov2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection or other secondary etiologies of this disorder.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of pediatric patients with acrocyanosis between January 2020 and July 2021, compared to the same period of previous year. All patients were investigated with capillaroscopies, clinical and laboratory texts. Those patients referred to our Institution, during the Covid-19 pandemic were also examined for SARS-CoV2 serologies to find out an eventual specific correlation with this secondary potential etiology.
RESULTS: During the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic we observed an increased prevalence of this manifestation. The analysis showed that the higher prevalence of patients with acrocyanosis, in this period, was not related to SARS-Cov2 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The acrocyanosis in pediatric patients is rarely associated with rheumatological diseases, being more frequently a primary disorder and strictly related to a sedentary lifestyle.","['Soscia F', 'Ardenti Morini F', 'Cortis E', 'Ferrari F', 'Civitelli FS', 'Marcoccia A']",2022,,,Minerva Pediatr (Torino),"Soscia F, et al.

35317059,Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among healthcare workers: A Case report and literature review.,"Common clinical features of COVID-19 are increasingly known but cutaneous manifestations are rarely described among healthcare workers. A review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 especially among healthcare workers (HCW) is thus required. The aim of our current study was to provide a comprehensive review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW through six case reports and a literature review. We conducted a literature search for cases reports, original and review articles using PubMed and the Google search engines. We included the written English studies that mentioned cutaneous symptoms during COVID-19 infection. In addition to the review, 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January 2021. In our review, we included 17 articles in addition to our six cases. The type of papers was case series and case reports in respectively 8 and 9 studies. Skin manifestations were reported in two studies including two HCW, in addition to our series of six HCW. Skin manifestations were chilblain-like lesions (44.5%), a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%), a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%), painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%), urticaria (2.8%), purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%), and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%). Of the 218 cases, 203 cases have reported the location of lesions. The very great majority of lesions were found on the trunk, hands, and feet. Fifty-one patients (23.4%) experienced lesions on the trunk. The time of onset of cutaneous lesions was variable. At the diagnosis or the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, 8.3% (18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. After the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis, 36.7% (80/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. Of the 197 cases with reported healing times, healing times were up to 24 days. COVID-19 has been associated with different cutaneous manifestations, likely of varying pathophysiology and severity, some preceding COVID-19 symptomatology and others occurring during active disease or later in the course. Thus, heightened awareness and timely recognition of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19.","['Imen Y', 'Mechergui N', 'Litaiem N', 'Youssef I', 'Gara S', 'Zeglaoui F', 'Rammeh S', 'Ladhari N']",2022,10,3,Clin Case Rep,"Imen Y, et al.

The size of the harm that this agent can unleash against us is appallingly wide, from brain ischemia to foot chilblain, passing by heart massive infarction. Designing a possible response, we reappraised the well-known equation depression-inflammation, and tested the hypothesis that an upgraded ease-of-mind might help reduce the host's hospitality towards SARS-CoV-2. With time passing, it becomes increasingly evident that the virus shall tend to progressively occupy spaces, replacing pandemics with an apparently calm endemicity.

In this review, we summarize the varied morphological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive literature search was conducted (23 September, 2021) across multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane) with the relevant keywords. An additional filter of age group between 0-18 years was kept in each of the searches.
RESULTS: Chilblains constitute the most common cutaneous manifestation of pediatric coronavirus disease (covid-19). Other commonly reported manifestations include maculopapular rash, urticaria, erythema multiforme, and papulovesicular eruptions. Majority of children with these manifestations are asymptomatic, highlighting the need to clinically suspect and appropriately manage such patients. A subset of pediatric patients develop severe multisystem involvement termed as multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) that has varied mucocutaneous manifestations.
CONCLUSION: A wide variety of dermatological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is reported, and both the pediatrician and dermatologist need to be aware of the same to suspect and diagnose COVID-19 infection in children.","['Panda M', 'Agarwal A', 'Hassanandani T']",2022,59,5,Indian Pediatr,"Panda M, et al.

35262093,Multicenter analysis of neutrophil extracellular trap dysregulation in adult and pediatric COVID-19.,"UNLABELLED: Dysregulation in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and degradation may play a role in the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19; however, its role in the pediatric manifestations of this disease including MIS-C and chilblain-like lesions (CLL), otherwise known as ""COVID toes"", remains unclear. Studying multinational cohorts, we found that, in CLL, NETs were significantly increased in serum and skin. There was geographic variability in the prevalence of increased NETs in MIS-C, in association with disease severity. MIS-C and CLL serum samples displayed decreased NET degradation ability, in association with C1q and G-actin or anti-NET antibodies, respectively, but not with genetic variants of DNases. In adult COVID-19, persistent elevations in NETs post-disease diagnosis were detected but did not occur in asymptomatic infection. COVID-19-affected adults displayed significant prevalence of impaired NET degradation, in association with anti-DNase1L3, G-actin, and specific disease manifestations, but not with genetic variants of DNases. NETs were detected in many organs of adult patients who died from COVID-19 complications. Infection with the Omicron variant was associated with decreased levels of NETs when compared to other SARS-CoV-2 strains. These data support a role for NETs in the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19 in pediatric and adult patients.
SUMMARY: NET formation and degradation are dysregulated in pediatric and symptomatic adult patients with various complications of COVID-19, in association with disease severity. NET degradation impairments are multifactorial and associated with natural inhibitors of DNase 1, G-actin and anti-DNase1L3 and anti-NET antibodies. Infection with the Omicron variant is associated with decreased levels of NETs when compared to other SARS-CoV-2 strains.","['Carmona-Rivera C', 'Zhang Y', 'Dobbs K', 'Markowitz TE', 'Dalgard CL', 'Oler AJ', 'Claybaugh DR', 'Draper D', 'Truong M', 'Delmonte OM', 'Licciardi F', 'Ramenghi U', 'Crescenzio N', 'Imberti L', 'Sottini A', 'Quaresima V', 'Fiorini C', 'Discepolo V', 'Lo Vecchio A', 'Guarino A', 'Pierri L', 'Catzola A', 'Biondi A', 'Bonfanti P', 'Poli Harlowe MC', 'Espinosa Y', 'Astudillo C', 'Rey-Jurado E', 'Vial C', 'de la Cruz J', 'Gonzalez R', 'Pinera C', 'Mays JW', 'Ng A', 'Platt A', 'NIH COVID Autopsy Consortium', 'COVID STORM Clinicians', 'Drolet B', 'Moon J', 'Cowen EW', 'Kenney H', 'Weber SE', 'Castagnoli R', 'Magliocco M', 'Stack MA', 'Montealegre G', 'Barron K', 'Hewitt SM', 'Arkin LM', 'Chertow DS', 'Su HC', 'Notarangelo LD', 'Kaplan MJ']",2022,,,medRxiv,"Carmona-Rivera C, et al.

Mucocutaneous lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are still under investigation, due to their polymorphic clinical aspect and incompletely understood pathogenic mechanism. The cutaneous inflammatory, exanthematous and purpuric rashes, erythemato-purpuric enanthems, oral ulcers, lichenoid oral lesions, conjunctivitis, conjunctival pseudomembranes, or corneal lesions have been described in patients with COVID-19. Several classifications have been proposed based on the clinical pattern, histological findings, and possible pathogenic mechanisms. The pathogenic mechanism, the diagnostic criteria, the prognostic importance of these lesions are still being debated. The diverse clinical aspects of dermatological manifestations render the diagnosis difficult. However, several clinical patterns strongly associated with COVID-19, such as chilblains, papulovesicular exanthems, and febrile rash require increased awareness and changes to the investigation protocols for these conditions, to include testing for SARS-CoV-2.

35217624,Lack of association between pandemic chilblains and SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"An increased incidence of chilblains has been observed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and attributed to viral infection. Direct evidence of this relationship has been limited, however, as most cases do not have molecular evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with PCR or antibodies. We enrolled a cohort of 23 patients who were diagnosed and managed as having SARS-CoV-2-associated skin eruptions (including 21 pandemic chilblains [PC]) during the first wave of the pandemic in Connecticut. Antibody responses were determined through endpoint titration enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serum epitope repertoire analysis. T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 were assessed by T cell receptor sequencing and in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific peptide stimulation assays. Immunohistochemical and PCR studies of PC biopsies and tissue microarrays for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Among patients diagnosed and managed as ""covid toes"" during the pandemic, we find a percentage of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (9.5%) that approximates background seroprevalence (8.5%) at the time. Immunohistochemistry studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 staining in PC biopsies may not be from SARS-CoV-2. Our results do not support SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent of pandemic chilblains; however, our study does not exclude the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative abortive infections.","['Gehlhausen JR', 'Little AJ', 'Ko CJ', 'Emmenegger M', 'Lucas C', 'Wong P', 'Klein J', 'Lu P', 'Mao T', 'Jaycox J', 'Wang E', 'Yale IMPACT Team', 'Ugwu N', 'Muenker C', 'Mekael D', 'Klein RQ', 'Patrignelli R', 'Antaya R', 'McNiff J', 'Damsky W', 'Kamath K', 'Shon J', 'Ring AM', 'Yildirim I', 'Omer S', 'Ko AI', 'Aguzzi A', 'Iwasaki A']",2022,119,9,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Gehlhausen JR, et al.

35194586,Cutaneous reactions to COVID-19 vaccines: A review.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing number of reports on cutaneous reactions following COVID-19 vaccination has led to growing concerns among certain groups.
OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the published reports of cutaneous lesions after COVID-19 vaccination.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search for original and review articles published between January 1, 2020, and September 27, 2021.
RESULTS: Eleven cutaneous reactions associated with COVID-19 vaccines were determined; the most prevalent reactions were local injection site reactions, delayed local reactions, urticaria, angioedema, and morbilliform eruptions. There were more reports on skin reactions following the administration of messenger RNA-based vaccines than on those following the administration of adenoviral vector or inactivated whole-virus vaccines, in part, due to their higher administration rate. Most reported skin reactions occurred after the first vaccine dose.
LIMITATIONS: A reporting bias could not be excluded, and skin biopsy results were not available for most included individuals. Moreover, given that the included trials focused on vaccine efficacy, there was a lack of details concerning cutaneous reactions and participant information.
CONCLUSION: Not all cutaneous reactions observed after COVID-19 vaccination are hypersensitivity reactions. Different cutaneous reactions may reflect underlying immune responses to the vaccines. A large majority of COVID-19 vaccination reactions were mild and self-limiting, and people should be encouraged to complete their vaccination regimen.","['Tan SW', 'Tam YC', 'Pang SM']",2022,7,,JAAD Int,"Tan SW, et al.

35160051,Experience with Cutaneous Manifestations in COVID-19 Patients during the Pandemic.,"After the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, our dermatology department created a multidisciplinary unit to manage patients with cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. With the objective of identifying skin lesions in patients with suspected COVID-19 and evaluating possible associations with systemic involvement, other infectious agents and coagulation disorders, we carried out a prospective observational study that included all patients that attended our COVID-19 dermatology clinic with a multidisciplinary protocol. A total of 63 patients (mean 34.6 years) were enrolled between May 2020 and February 2021. Overall, 27 patients (42.9%) had a positive COVID-19 test, and 74.6% had COVID-19 clinical signs. The most common skin lesion was maculopapular rash (36.5%), predominantly seen in male (54.2%) and older patients (42 vs. 30 years), followed by chilblain-like lesions (20.6%) in younger patients (13.9 vs. 20.9 years) who were predominantly barefoot at home (69.2%); these patients exhibited a tendency towards a negative COVID-19 test. A total of 12 patients (19.1%) had positive serology for herpesvirus 6 (IgM or IgG). We conclude that the COVID-19-associated skin lesions we observed were similar to those previously described. Questions as to the underlying mechanisms remain. Interferon, possibly aided by cold exposure, may cause perniosis-like lesions. Other cutaneous manifestations were similar to those caused by other viruses, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may reactivate or facilitate other viral infections.","['Navarro-Bielsa A', 'Abadías-Granado I', 'Morales-Callaghan AM', 'Suso-Estívalez C', 'Povar-Echeverría M', 'Rello L', 'Gilaberte Y']",2022,11,3,J Clin Med,"Navarro-Bielsa A, et al.

35129855,Evolution of incidence of chilblain-like lesions in children during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic.,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought innumerable reports of chilblains. The relation between pernio-like acral eruptions and COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated because most reported cases have occurred in patients with negative microbiological tests for SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 49 cases of chilblains seen during the first year of the pandemic in a children's hospital in Madrid, Spain. The incidence of these skin lesions was correlated with the number of COVID-19 admissions and environmental temperatures. Patients were separated into two groups depending on the day of onset (strict lockdown period vs. outside the lockdown period).
RESULTS: Most chilblains cases presented during the first and third waves of the pandemic, paralleling the number of COVID-19 admissions. The first wave coincided with a strict lockdown, and the third wave coincided with the lowest ambient seasonal temperatures of the year. Systemic symptoms preceding chilblains were more frequent in the first wave (45.8% vs. 8.0%, p = .002), as was the co-occurrence with erythema multiforme-like lesions (16.7% vs. 0%, p = .033). Laboratory test and skin biopsies were performed more frequently in the first wave (75.0% vs. 12.0%, p < .001; and 25.0% vs. 0%, p = .007; respectively). Five patients developed recurrent cutaneous symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: An increased incidence of chilblains coincided not only with the two major waves of the pandemic, but also with the strict lockdown period in the first wave and low seasonal temperatures during the third wave. Both increased sedentary behaviors and cold environmental temperatures may have played an additive role in the development of COVID-19-related chilblains.","['Bascuas-Arribas M', 'Andina-Martinez D', 'Añon-Hidalgo J', 'Alonso-Cadenas JA', 'Hernandez-Martin A', 'Lamagrande-Casanova N', 'Noguero-Morel L', 'Mateos-Mayo A', 'Colmenero-Blanco I', 'Torrelo A']",2022,39,2,Pediatr Dermatol,"Bascuas-Arribas M, et al.

The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and loss of smell or taste. Recent reports indicate the possibility of several nonspecific dermatological symptoms. These include urticaria, maculopapular lesions, vascular lesions involving petechiae, purpura and livedo reticularis. The onset of cutaneous lesions may precede full-blown COVID-19 or remain the only manifestation of the disease (especially in young patients).

35085122,"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Expression Is Detectable in Keratinocytes, Cutaneous Appendages, and Blood Vessels by Multiplex RNA In Situ Hybridization.","OBJECTIVE: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor mediates uptake of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Previous work analyzing publicly available bulk RNA-sequencing data sets has shown the expression of ACE2 in human keratinocytes. This finding is potentially relevant for the etiology of COVID-19-associated rashes and might also suggest a possible entry mechanism for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this study, the authors examined the spatial localization of ACE2 mRNA in vivo.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors analyzed several publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing data sets. They determined spatial localization of ACE2 mRNA using multiplex RNA in situ hybridization in human skin.
CONCLUSIONS: Both analyses supported ACE2 expression in keratinocytes and skin vasculature, which could reflect a potential cutaneous entry point for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in damaged or broken skin. Moreover, ACE2 expression in vascular endothelial cells may support direct, virally mediated mechanisms in the etiology of the chilblain-like acral eruption that is seen in patients with COVID-19.","['Ganier C', 'Harun N', 'Peplow I', 'Du-Harpur X', 'Arthurs C', 'Watt FM', 'Lynch MD']",2022,35,4,Adv Skin Wound Care,"Ganier C, et al.

34989043,"RNAscope in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in chilblain-like lesions: A clinical, laboratory and histopathological study.","BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an increasing number of chilblain-like lesions (ChLL) have been increasingly reported worldwide. To date, the causal link between ChLL and SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been unequivocally established.
METHODS: In this case series, we present demographic, clinical, laboratory, and histopathological information regarding 27 young patients with a clinical diagnosis of ChLL who referred to the Dermatology Unit of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy, from 1 April 2020 to 1 June 2020.
RESULTS: The mean age was 14.2 years, and 21 patients (78%) experienced mild systemic symptoms a median of 28 days before the onset of cutaneous lesions. ChLL mostly involved the feet (20 patients - 74%). Among acral lesions, we identified three different clinical patterns: (i) chilblains in 20 patients (74%); (ii) fixed erythematous macules in 4 children (15%); (iii) erythrocyanosis in 3 female patients (11%). Blood examinations and viral serologies, including parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and coxsackievirus were normal in all. Three patients (11%) underwent nasopharyngeal swab for RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 showing only 1 positive. Histopathological examinations of 7 skin biopsies confirmed the clinical diagnosis of chilblains; vessel thrombi were observed only in 1 case. Our findings failed to demonstrate the direct presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in skin biopsies, both with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH).
LIMITATIONS: Limited number of cases, unavailability of laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 in all patients, potential methodological weakness, and latency of skin biopsies in comparison to cutaneous lesions onset.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations may support the hypothesis of an inflammatory pathogenesis rather than the presence of peripheral viral particles. Although, we could not exclude an early phase of viral endothelial damage followed by an IFN-I or complement-mediated inflammatory phase. Further observations on a large number of patients are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","['Robustelli Test E', 'Sena P', 'Locatelli AG', 'Carugno A', 'di Mercurio M', 'Moggio E', 'Gambini DM', 'Arosio MEG', 'Callegaro A', 'Morotti D', 'Gianatti A', 'Vezzoli P']",2022,39,1,Pediatr Dermatol,"Robustelli Test E, et al.

They may last for several months. We conducted this study to investigate chilblain-like lesions in children during the COVID-19 pandemic, any predisposition, location, clinical course, and prognosis. We searched Google Scholar, Scopus, and Medline (PubMed) databases using the following keywords: ""Coronavirus"" OR ""COVID-19"" AND ""Chilblains"" OR ""Pernio"" OR ""Perniosis"" OR ""Children"" OR ""Cutaneous"" OR ""skin."" The inclusion criteria were: (a) Studies that described the specific vascular skin lesion. (b) Studies that included patients aged >1 month till 18 years. (c) Case reports, case series, retrospective or prospective cohort studies, case-control studies. A total of 28 articles were included. The total number of children with chiblain-like lesions (CLL) was 433. The mean age of children presenting CLL during the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated as 12.58 ± 2.15.

34906456,Stankiewicz-Isidor syndrome: expanding the clinical and molecular phenotype.,"PURPOSE: Haploinsufficiency of PSMD12 has been reported in individuals with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID), facial dysmorphism, and congenital malformations, defined as Stankiewicz-Isidor syndrome (STISS). Investigations showed that pathogenic variants in PSMD12 perturb intracellular protein homeostasis. Our objective was to further explore the clinical and molecular phenotypic spectrum of STISS.
METHODS: We report 24 additional unrelated patients with STISS with various truncating single nucleotide variants or copy-number variant deletions involving PSMD12. We explore disease etiology by assessing patient cells and CRISPR/Cas9-engineered cell clones for various cellular pathways and inflammatory status.
RESULTS: The expressivity of most clinical features in STISS is highly variable. In addition to previously reported DD/ID, speech delay, cardiac and renal anomalies, we also confirmed preaxial hand abnormalities as a feature of this syndrome. Of note, 2 patients also showed chilblains resembling signs observed in interferonopathy. Remarkably, our data show that STISS patient cells exhibit a profound remodeling of the mTORC1 and mitophagy pathways with an induction of type I interferon-stimulated genes.
CONCLUSION: We refine the phenotype of STISS and show that it can be clinically recognizable and biochemically diagnosed by a type I interferon gene signature.","['Isidor B', 'Ebstein F', 'Hurst A', 'Vincent M', 'Bader I', 'Rudy NL', 'Cogne B', 'Mayr J', 'Brehm A', 'Bupp C', 'Warren K', 'Bacino CA', 'Gerard A', 'Ranells JD', 'Metcalfe KA', 'van Bever Y', 'Jiang YH', 'Mendelssohn BA', 'Cope H', 'Rosenfeld JA', 'Blackburn PR', 'Goodenberger ML', 'Kearney HM', 'Kennedy J', 'Scurr I', 'Szczaluba K', 'Ploski R', 'de Saint Martin A', 'Alembik Y', 'Piton A', 'Bruel AL', 'Thauvin-Robinet C', 'Strong A', 'Diderich KEM', 'Bourgeois D', 'Dahan K', 'Vignard V', 'Bonneau D', 'Colin E', 'Barth M', 'Camby C', 'Baujat G', 'Briceño I', 'Gómez A', 'Deb W', 'Conrad S', 'Besnard T', 'Bézieau S', 'Krüger E', 'Küry S', 'Stankiewicz P']",2022,24,1,Genet Med,"Isidor B, et al.

34663122,COVID-19 Skin Manifestations in Skin of Colour.,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) skin manifestations have been increasingly reported in medical literature. Recent discussions have identified a lack of images of skin of color (SOC) patients with COVID-19 related skin findings despite people with skin of color being disproportionately affected with the disease. There have been calls to prioritize the identification of COVID-19 skin manifestations in patients with SOC and disseminate these findings. The objective of this article is to review the existing literature on COVID-19 skin manifestations and, where possible, discuss how they may present differently in patients with SOC. Further research is needed to allow primary care physicians and dermatologists to be aware of and easily identify patients with cutaneous findings that may be secondary to COVID-19. Patients presenting with idiopathic dermatologic manifestations should be considered for COVID-19 testing and follow public health guidelines for self-isolation.","['Akuffo-Addo E', 'Nicholas MN', 'Joseph M']",2022,26,2,J Cutan Med Surg,"Akuffo-Addo E, et al.

34661927,Cutaneous findings following COVID-19 vaccination: review of world literature and own experience.,"There is growing evidence that not only the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) but also the COVID-19 vaccines can cause a variety of skin reactions. In this review article, we provide a brief overview on cutaneous findings that have been observed since the emerging mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns all over the world. Unspecific injection-site reactions very early occurring after the vaccination are most frequent. Type I hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. urticaria, angio-oedema and anaphylaxis) likely due to allergy to ingredients may rarely occur but can be severe. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions may be observed, including delayed large local skin lesions (""COVID arm""), inflammatory reactions in dermal filler or previous radiation sites or even old BCG scars, and more commonly morbilliform and erythema multiforme-like rashes. Autoimmune-mediated skin findings after COVID-19 vaccination include leucocytoclastic vasculitis, lupus erythematosus and immune thrombocytopenia. Functional angiopathies (chilblain-like lesions, erythromelalgia) may also be observed. Pityriasis rosea-like rashes and reactivation of herpes zoster have also been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. In conclusion, there are numerous cutaneous reaction patterns that may occur following COVID-19 vaccination, whereby many of these skin findings are of immunological/autoimmunological nature. Importantly, molecular mimicry exists between SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. the spike-protein sequences used to design the vaccines) and human components and may thus explain some COVID-19 pathologies as well as adverse skin reactions to COVID-19 vaccinations.","['Gambichler T', 'Boms S', 'Susok L', 'Dickel H', 'Finis C', 'Abu Rached N', 'Barras M', 'Stücker M', 'Kasakovski D']",2022,36,2,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Gambichler T, et al.

34657406,Molecular mechanisms of vasculopathy and coagulopathy in COVID-19.,"COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system and may lead to severe systemic complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, cytokine storm, and thromboembolic events. Depending on the immune status of the affected individual early disease control can be reached by a robust type-I-interferon (type-I-IFN) response restricting viral replication. If type-I-IFN upregulation is impaired, patients develop severe COVID-19 that involves profound alveolitis, endothelitis, complement activation, recruitment of immune cells, as well as immunothrombosis. In patients with proper initial disease control there can be a second flare of type-I-IFN release leading to post-COVID manifestation such as chilblain-like lesions that are characterized by thrombosis of small vessels in addition to an inflammatory infiltrate resembling lupus erythematosus (LE). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 invades pneumocytes and endothelial cells by acting on angiotensin-II-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is hypothesized, that viral uptake might downregulate ACE2 bioavailability and enhance angiotensin-II-derived pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state. Since ACE2 is encoded on the X chromosome these conditions might also be influenced by gender-specific regulation. Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the vascular compartment leading to variable thrombogenic or inflammatory response depending on the individual immune response status.","['Al-Gburi S', 'Beissert S', 'Günther C']",2021,402,12,Biol Chem,"Al-Gburi S, et al.

34619397,Chilblains during lockdown are associated with household exposure to SARS-CoV-2: a multicentre case-control study.,"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous cases of chilblains have been reported. However, in most cases, RT-PCR or serology did not confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hypotheses have been raised about an interferon-mediated immunological response to SARS-CoV-2, leading to effective clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 without the involvement of humoral immunity. Our objective was to explore the association between chilblains and exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: In this multicentre case-control study, cases were the 102 individuals referred to five referral hospitals for chilblains occurring during the first lockdown (March to May 2020). Controls were recruited from healthy volunteers' files held by the same hospitals. All members of their households were included, resulting in 77 case households (262 individuals) and 74 control households (230 individuals). Household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during the first lockdown was categorized as high, intermediate or low, using a pre-established algorithm based on individual data on symptoms, high-risk contacts, activities outside the home and RT-PCR testing. Participants were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serological test.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age, the association between chilblains and viral exposure was estimated at OR 3.3, 95% CI (1.4-7.3) for an intermediate household exposure, and 6.9 (2.5-19.5) for a high household exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Out of 57 case households tested, six (11%) had positive serology for SARS-CoV-2, whereas all control households tested (n = 50) were seronegative (p = 0.03). The effect of potential misclassification on exposure has been assessed in a bias analysis.
DISCUSSION: This case-control study demonstrates the association between chilblains occurring during the lockdown and household exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","['Poizeau F', 'Oger E', 'Barbarot S', 'Le Corre Y', 'Samimi M', 'Brenaut E', 'Aubert H', 'Chambrelan E', 'Droitcourt C', 'Gissot V', 'Heslan C', 'Laurent C', 'Martin L', 'Misery L', 'Tattevin P', 'Toubel A', 'Thibault V', 'Dupuy A']",2022,28,2,Clin Microbiol Infect,"Poizeau F, et al.

34611893,Type I interferon response and vascular alteration in chilblain-like lesions during the COVID-19 outbreak.,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of chilblain-like lesions (CLL) during the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported extensively, potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet its underlying pathophysiology is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To study skin and blood endothelial and immune system activation in CLL in comparison with healthy controls and seasonal chilblains (SC), defined as cold-induced sporadic chilblains occurring during 2015 and 2019 with exclusion of chilblain lupus.
METHODS: This observational study was conducted during 9-16 April 2020 at Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris, France. All patients referred with CLL seen during this period of the COVID-19 pandemic were included in this study. We excluded patients with a history of chilblains or chilblain lupus. Fifty patients were included.
RESULTS: Histological patterns were similar and transcriptomic signatures overlapped in both the CLL and SC groups, with type I interferon polarization and a cytotoxic-natural killer gene signature. CLL were characterized by higher IgA tissue deposition and more significant transcriptomic activation of complement and angiogenesis factors compared with SC. We observed in CLL a systemic immune response associated with IgA antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in 73% of patients, and elevated type I interferon blood signature in comparison with healthy controls. Finally, using blood biomarkers related to endothelial dysfunction and activation, and to angiogenesis or endothelial progenitor cell mobilization, we confirmed endothelial dysfunction in CLL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an activation loop in the skin in CLL associated with endothelial alteration and immune infiltration of cytotoxic and type I IFN-polarized cells leading to clinical manifestations.","['Frumholtz L', 'Bouaziz JD', 'Battistella M', 'Hadjadj J', 'Chocron R', 'Bengoufa D', 'Le Buanec H', 'Barnabei L', 'Meynier S', 'Schwartz O', 'Grzelak L', 'Smith N', 'Charbit B', 'Duffy D', 'Yatim N', 'Calugareanu A', 'Philippe A', 'Guerin CL', 'Joly B', 'Siguret V', 'Jaume L', 'Bachelez H', 'Bagot M', 'Rieux-Laucat F', 'Maylin S', 'Legoff J', 'Delaugerre C', 'Gendron N', 'Smadja DM', 'Cassius C', 'Saint-Louis CORE (COvid REsearch)']",2021,185,6,Br J Dermatol,"Frumholtz L, et al.

34549491,No antibody response in cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19: An observational study of 64 cases with microbiological and clinical characterization.,"BACKGROUND: The microbiological diagnosis of skin lesions related to COVID-19 is not well known.
OBJECTIVE: Perform a microbiological diagnosis in COVID19-related cutaneous manifestations.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed with 64 patients with cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 who underwent serological and nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: Out of the 64 patients, 6 patients had positive RT-PCR, with all of them developing SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 4 of them had positive IgM + IgA. Of the 58 patients with negative RT-PCR, 8 cases had positive IgM + IgA and only one of them had IgG seroconversion. Therefore, the infection was demonstrated in 7 cases (10.9%) and was doubtful in 7 other cases (10.9%) who presented negative RT-PCR and presence of IgA + IgM without subsequent seroconversion of IgG. Fifty patients (78.1%) had negative serological tests. The most frequent cutaneous pattern was pseudo-chilblain (48.4%) followed by maculo-papular pattern (26.6%), urticarial lesions (10.9%), vesicular eruptions (6.3%) and livedoid pattern (4.7%). The maculo-papular pattern showed the highest positivity in RT-PCR (3 cases; 17.6%) and serologies (4 cases; 23.5%). Skin lesions developed after the systemic symptoms in most patients (19 cases; 61.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological confirmation tests may not be an effective diagnostic technique for COVID-related cutaneous manifestations or that attributed lesions are not related to COVID-19. Confounding factors such as adverse drug reaction, serological cross-reactions with other viruses, the low production of antibodies in asymptomatic or mild forms of COVID-19 or its rapid disappearance, increase diagnostic uncertainty.","['García-Gil MF', 'Monte-Serrano J', 'Lapeña-Casado A', 'Villagrasa-Boli P', 'Ramírez-Lluch M', 'Martínez-Pallás I', 'Bularca A', 'Aldea-Manrique B', 'Benito-Ruesca R', 'Ventura-Faci MP', 'Ara-Martín M']",2021,34,6,Dermatol Ther,"García-Gil MF, et al.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 (diagnosed using PCR and/or serology) in patients with CLL. We undertook a literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus (to 15 March 2021), including studies that reported on the number of patients with CLL with positive PCR and/or serology for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19. Regardless of data heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used to pool prevalence estimates. The meta-analysis included 63 original studies, involving 2919 cases of CLL.

34525782,[Cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 with significant attention to urticaria].,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the most frequent dermatological conditions observed in COVID-19 patients and to determine whether their presence could be used to establish an early diagnosis or to predict the progression of the infection.
METHODS: There was a review in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE of all the articles that had been published between January 1st and November 1st, 2020, with the search terms focused on ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"" and ""Skin diseases"".
RESULTS: Eighty three studies met the inclusion criteria. Skin lesions have been reported in 0.2 % of the patients. The most frequently reported dermatoses were: maculopapular/ morbilliform rashes, urticaria and angioedema, chilblain-like acral pattern, and vesicular lesions. Among researchers, there are differences of opinion about a possible diagnostic or prognostic value of the skin diseases that are associated to the infection.
CONCLUSIONS: It is advisable to consider the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who call the doctor for skin lesions, urticaria, or angioedema, with or without other symptoms of the infection, especially if there is a previous history of recent exposure to other infected subjects.","['Sánchez-Borges M', 'González-Díaz SN', 'Ortega-Martell JA', 'Rojo-Gutiérrez MI', 'Ansotegui-Zubeldia IJ']",2021,68,2,Rev Alerg Mex,"Sánchez-Borges M, et al.

COVID-19 is a systemic respiratory infection that may have dermatologic signs and systemic sequelae, a devastating public health challenge with parallels to the two great influenza pandemics of the last century. Skin lesions linked with COVID-19 have been grouped into six categories, with three distinct indicative patterns: vesicular (varicella-like), vasculopathic, and chilblains-like (including ""COVID toes"" and ""COVID fingers"") plus the following three less suggestive patterns: dermatitic, maculopapular, and urticarial morphologies. Vasculopathic changes are the most concerning, in some patients, reflecting a devastating blood clotting dysfunction. We discuss the ways to detect, prevent, and treat COVID-19, keeping in mind the context of possible cutaneous markers of COVID-19 to enhance detection.","['Schwartz RA', 'Lambert WC']",2021,39,3,Clin Dermatol,Schwartz RA and Lambert WC.

34517079,Clinical and pathologic correlation of cutaneous COVID-19 vaccine reactions including V-REPP: A registry-based study.,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous reactions after COVID-19 vaccination have been commonly reported; however, histopathologic features and clinical correlations have not been well characterized.
METHODS: We evaluated for a history of skin biopsy all reports of reactions associated with COVID-19 vaccination identified in an international registry. When histopathology reports were available, we categorized them by reaction patterns.
RESULTS: Of 803 vaccine reactions reported, 58 (7%) cases had biopsy reports available for review. The most common histopathologic reaction pattern was spongiotic dermatitis, which clinically ranged from robust papules with overlying crust, to pityriasis rosea-like eruptions, to pink papules with fine scale. We propose the acronym ""V-REPP"" (vaccine-related eruption of papules and plaques) for this spectrum. Other clinical patterns included bullous pemphigoid-like (n = 12), dermal hypersensitivity (n = 4), herpes zoster (n = 4), lichen planus-like (n = 4), pernio (n = 3), urticarial (n = 2), neutrophilic dermatosis (n = 2), leukocytoclastic vasculitis (n = 2), morbilliform (n = 2), delayed large local reactions (n = 2), erythromelalgia (n = 1), and other (n = 5).
LIMITATIONS: Cases in which histopathology was available represented a minority of registry entries. Analysis of registry data cannot measure incidence.
CONCLUSION: Clinical and histopathologic correlation allowed for categorization of cutaneous reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine. We propose defining a subset of vaccine-related eruption of papules and plaques, as well as 12 other patterns, following COVID-19 vaccination.","['McMahon DE', 'Kovarik CL', 'Damsky W', 'Rosenbach M', 'Lipoff JB', 'Tyagi A', 'Chamberlin G', 'Fathy R', 'Nazarian RM', 'Desai SR', 'Lim HW', 'Thiers BH', 'Hruza GJ', 'French LE', 'Blumenthal K', 'Fox LP', 'Freeman EE']",2022,86,1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"McMahon DE, et al.

34515805,Long-term Outcome of Chilblains Associated with SARS-CoV-2.,"Numerous cases of chilblains have been observed in the course if the COVID-19 pandemic. The aims of this study were to provide comprehensive follow-up data for patients reporting chilblains, and to determine the risk factors for incomplete recovery. Patients referred to 5 hospitals in France between March and May 2020 for chilblains were surveyed on December 2020. A teleconsultation was offered. Among 82 patients reporting chilblains, 27 (33%) reported complete recovery, 33 (40%) had recurrences of chilblains after their hands and feet had returned to normal, and 22 (27%) developed persistent acral manifestations, mostly acrocyanosis, with or without further recurrences of chilblains. Most recurrences of chilblains occurred during the following autumn and winter. A past history of chilblains was not associated with recurrences or persistent acral manifestations. Women had a significantly higher risk of developing recurrences or persistent acral manifestations (odds ratio 1.30; 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.59). In conclusion, two-thirds of patients reporting chilblains at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced persistent or recurrent acral manifestations after a 10-month follow-up.","['Poizeau F', 'Barbarot S', 'Le Corre Y', 'Brenaut E', 'Samimi M', 'Aubert H', 'Toubel A', 'Dupuy A']",2021,101,12,Acta Derm Venereol,"Poizeau F, et al.

34515379,"""COVID toes"": A meta-analysis of case and observational studies on clinical, histopathological, and laboratory findings.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is related to several extrapulmonary disorders; however, little is known about the clinical, laboratory, and histopathological characteristics of pernio-like skin lesions associated with COVID-19 infection.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and summarize the clinical, laboratory, and histopathological characteristics of pernio-like lesions reported in the literature.
METHODS: We conducted a search of the PubMed, SciELO, and ScienceDirect databases for articles published between January 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020, following the PRISMA recommendations (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42020225055). The target population was individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with pernio-like lesions. Observational studies, research letters, and case/series reports were all eligible for inclusion. Observational studies were evaluated using a random-effects model to calculate the weighted mean prevalence, overall mean, and 95% confidence interval. We evaluated case studies using the chi-square test for dichotomous variables and the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables.
RESULTS: A total of 187 patients from case reports and 715 patients from 18 observational studies were included. The mean age of patients was 16.6 years (range 14.5-18.8). Feet were affected in 91.4% (87.0-94.4%) of patients in observational studies. The proportion of patients with a positive RT-PCR test was less than 15%. Lesion topography and morphology were associated with age.
CONCLUSION: Lesions mostly occurred in pediatric patients, and the morphological characteristics tended to differ between pediatric and non-pediatric populations. There is a possible multifactorial component in lesion pathophysiology. The non-positivity of laboratory tests does not exclude an association with COVID-19. Pernio-like lesions may be a late manifestation of COVID-19.","['Rocha KO', 'Zanuncio VV', 'Freitas BAC', 'Lima LM']",2021,38,5,Pediatr Dermatol,"Rocha KO, et al.

34466301,Acute Limb Ischemia: A Catastrophic COVID-19 Sequel Leading to Amputation.,"A positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus causes the novel coronavirus illness 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 symptoms range from mild to moderate to severe and very severe. Fever, cough, headache, anosmia, ageusia, body ache, and diarrhoea are mild to moderate grade symptoms, whereas systemic involvements (pneumonia, myocarditis, stroke, and other coagulation abnormalities) are more serious. Except for a few patients who have mild complaints of cough and shortness of breath, the majority of patients are recuperating entirely from the viral infection. Patients with severe to very severe illnesses experience significant lung damage and fibrosis. These are the patients who are more likely to experience extrapulmonary complications after COVID-19. The disease's aberrant presentation may be related to systemic involvement and a hypercoagulable condition with micro and macro-angiopathy. Acute limb ischemia is one of the symptoms of the hypercoagulable condition. Its presentation can be in the form of chilblains, bullae, acral cyanosis, bruising, blood blisters, dry gangrene, or life-threatening acute limb ischemia. Unfortunately, most patients have to undergo amputation due to a delay in presentation or rapidly progressing disease. Here we present a case series of two COVID-19 infected patients who were initially discharged from the hospital after proper treatment but developed acute limb ischemia within the home isolation period and their treatment strategy.","['Biswal JK', 'Mohanty SK', 'Behera SN', 'Swain SK', 'Sahoo AK']",2021,13,7,Cureus,"Biswal JK, et al.

34446945,Virology and Etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 with Special Reference to Cutaneous Implications.,"Severe Acute Respiratory Virus Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has got its name Corona from Latin meaning ""crown."" It has crown-like spikes present on the surface, which encloses the RNA, genetic material of this deadly virus. The virus attacks pneumocytes after binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the cell surface, which ultimately leads to chemotaxis followed by leukocyte infiltration, increased permeability of blood vessels and alveolar walls, and decreased surfactant in the lung leading to various symptoms. Skin provides a window to the internal changes of the body and also to mechanisms that are not readily visible. Commonly observed skin manifestations include vesicular lesions, maculopapular exanthema, urticarial eruptions, livedo or necrosis, and other forms of vasculitis, chilblain-like lesions. The skin lesions are attributed to either the virus directly affecting the skin or interferon dysregulation due to viral RNA or vascular involvement associated with alteration in coagulation or drug-induced skin manifestations. Observation of skin involvement and the vasculature due to SARS-CoV-2 illustrates the need for a precise stratification and differential diagnostic valuation so that the mechanisms of this novel virus are clearer for better management of the condition in the future. Vascular skin lesions are not seen in all the patients of COVID, but certain lesions should definitely alarm us to evaluate for coagulation abnormalities, complement levels, and skin biopsy, especially in critically ill patients. This review attempts to outline the pathogen briefly and the pathomechanism behind the development of various cutaneous manifestations.","['Sarkar R', 'Bhargava S', 'Mendiratta V']",2021,66,3,Indian J Dermatol,"Sarkar R, et al.

34433495,Delayed skin reaction after mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a rare clinical reaction.,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a wide clinical spectrum of skin manifestations, including urticarial, vesicular, vasculitic and chilblain-like lesions. Recently, delayed skin reactions have been reported in 1% individuals following mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The exact pathophysiology and the risk factors still remain unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 6821 employees and patients were vaccinated at our institutions between February and June 2021. Every patient received two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in our hospitals, and reported back in case of any side effects which were collected in our hospital managed database.
RESULTS: Eleven of 6821 vaccinated patients (0.16%) developed delayed skin reactions after either the first or second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Eight of 11 patients (73%) developed a rash after the first dose, while in 3/11 (27%), the rash occurred after the second dose. More females (9/11) were affected. Four of 11 patients required antihistamines, with two needing additional topical steroids. All the cutaneous manifestations resolved within 14 days. None of the skin reactions after the first dose of the vaccine prevented the administration of the second dose. There were no long-term cutaneous sequelae in any of the affected individuals.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that skin reactions after the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 are possible, but rare. Further studies need to be done to understand the pathophysiology of these lesions.","['Hoff NP', 'Freise NF', 'Schmidt AG', 'Firouzi-Memarpuri P', 'Reifenberger J', 'Luedde T', 'Bölke E', 'Meller S', 'Homey B', 'Feldt T', 'Jensen BEO', 'Keitel V', 'Schmidt L', 'Maas K', 'Haussmann J', 'Tamaskovics B', 'Budach W', 'Fischer JC', 'Buhren BA', 'Knoefel WT', 'Schneider M', 'Gerber PA', 'Pedoto A', 'Häussinger D', 'Grebe O', 'van Griensven M', 'Braun SA', 'Salzmann S', 'Rezazadeh A', 'Matuschek C']",2021,26,1,Eur J Med Res,"Hoff NP, et al.

34411313,Patient characteristics in tardive COVID-19 pseudoperniosis: a case series of 16 patients.,"BACKGROUND: Acute pseudoperniosis (PP) has a recognized association with COVID-19 and tends to occur without cold precipitation in young, healthy patients, often without a clear history of COVID-19. These lesions usually resolve within 2 weeks and without long-term sequelae. In the early months of 2021, patients with delayed and protracted PP began to emerge. We have called this presentation 'tardive COVID-19 PP (TCPP)'.
AIM: To consolidate and expand knowledge on TCPP, we describe the clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 16 patients with TCPP who were reviewed by our outpatient dermatology service.
RESULTS: The initial clinical manifestations were erythema, swelling and PP of the fingers in 56.2%, and of the toes in 31.2%, desquamation in 56.2% and acrocyanosis in 12.5%. Ten patients had eventual involvement of all acral sites. The median duration of symptoms was 191 days. Six patients reported close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, but only two had positive COVID-19 tests. Four patients experienced complete or almost complete resolution of symptoms, while the rest remain under active treatment.
CONCLUSION: Unlike acute PP, TCPP has a protracted and delayed presentation that is typically associated with profound acrocyanosis. Patients with TCPP represent a new phenomenon that is part of the post-COVID-19 syndrome, with risk factors and pathophysiology that are not yet fully understood. Our data indicate that likely predisposing factors for developing TCPP include young age, a preceding history of cold intolerance and an arachnodactyloid phenotype. Anorexia, connective tissue disorders or sickle cell trait may also predispose to TCPP. In addition, low titre antinuclear antibody positivity, the presence of cryoglobulins, or low complement levels may represent further risk factors. Finally, prolonged low temperatures are also likely to be contributing to the symptoms.","['Ganatra B', 'Amarnani R', 'Alfallouji Y', 'Dear K', 'Twigg E', 'Westwood JP', 'Goulden B', 'Morris V', 'Hillman T', 'Goolamali S', 'Naderi Z', 'Sidwell R', 'Ellery P', 'Calonje E', 'Kravvas G', 'Bunker CB']",2022,47,2,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Ganatra B, et al.

34400195,Photosensitivity and cGAS-Dependent IFN-1 Activation in Patients with Lupus and TREX1 Deficiency.,"The exonuclease TREX1 safeguards the cells against DNA accumulation in the cytosol and thereby prevents innate immune activation and autoimmunity. TREX1 mutations lead to chronic DNA damage and cell-intrinsic IFN-1 response. Associated disease phenotypes include Aicardi‒Goutières syndrome, familial chilblain lupus, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Given the role of UV light in lupus pathogenesis, we assessed sensitivity to UV light in patients with lupus and TREX1 mutation by phototesting, which revealed enhanced photosensitivity. TREX1-deficient fibroblasts and keratinocytes generated increased levels of ROS in response to UV irradiation as well as increased levels of 8-oxo-guanine lesions after oxidative stress. Likewise, the primary UV-induced DNA lesions cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were induced more strongly in TREX1-deficient cells. Further analysis revealed that single-stranded DNA regions, frequently formed during DNA replication and repair, promote cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation. Together, this resulted in a strong UV-induced DNA damage response that was associated with a cGAS-dependent IFN-1 activation. In conclusion, these findings link chronic DNA damage to photosensitivity and IFN-1 production in TREX1 deficiency and explain the induction of disease flares on UV exposure in patients with lupus and TREX1 mutation.","['Berndt N', 'Wolf C', 'Fischer K', 'Cura Costa E', 'Knuschke P', 'Zimmermann N', 'Schmidt F', 'Merkel M', 'Chara O', 'Lee-Kirsch MA', 'Günther C']",2022,142,3 Pt A,J Invest Dermatol,"Berndt N, et al.

34385830,Synthesis of the Data on COVID-19 Skin Manifestations: Underlying Mechanisms and Potential Outcomes.,"The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related skin manifestations has progressively grown, in parallel with the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreading. The available evidence indicates that cutaneous signs are heterogeneous and can be divided as follows: a) erythematous rashes, b) lesions of vascular origin, c) vesicular rashes, d) urticarial rashes, and e) acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme (EM) and other polymorphic/atypical reactions. Most cutaneous manifestations appear simultaneously or after respiratory and/or systemic symptoms such as fever, even if rarely urticaria has been reported as the first sign of the disease. It has been proposed that erythematous and vesicular rashes, as well as urticaria, are the result of immunological activation against Sars-CoV-2, similarly to other viral exanthems; alternatively, reactivation or co-infection of herpesviruses and drug hypersensitivity represent possible etiologic diagnosis that has to be considered. Regarding lesions of vascular origin, ischemic ones are the result of systemic hypercoagulability established in severe infections, whereas chilblains seem to be linked to the type I-interferon massively produced to halt virus replication. AGEP is triggered by drugs, whereas EM could represent a delayed immune response to the virus or a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs elicited by the inflammatory process built to fight the infection. A further pathogenic hypothesis is that the virus, or its particles detected in the skin (particularly in endothelium and eccrine glands), could be responsible for certain skin reactions, including chilblains and EM. From the available data, it appears that chilblains are correlated with younger age and less severe disease, while ischemic manifestations occur in the elderly with severe infection. In conclusion, larger studies are needed to confirm the suggested pathogenetic mechanisms of COVID-19-related skin reactions and to determine the potential prognostic significance of each one.","['Farinazzo E', 'Dianzani C', 'Zalaudek I', 'Conforti C', 'Grabbe S', 'Goldust M']",2021,14,,Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol,"Farinazzo E, et al.

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Google Scholar and PubMed searches were conducted using the terms 
MAIN MESSAGE: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a range of cutaneous presentations through direct infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, such as maculopapular, vesicular, pseudo-chilblain, livedoid, necrotic, urticarial, and Kawasaki-like rashes. Indirect presentations secondary to behavioural modifications are associated with use of personal protective equipment and sanitization procedures. Furthermore, psychosocial factors and stress associated with the pandemic also exacerbate pre-existing skin conditions.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased rates of dermatologic conditions through direct infection, behavioural changes, and association with psychosocial factors.

34381458,Type I Interferon Induction in Cutaneous DNA Damage Syndromes.,"Type I interferons (IFNs) as part of the innate immune system have an outstanding importance as antiviral defense cytokines that stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses. Upon sensing of pattern recognition particles (PRPs) such as nucleic acids, IFN secretion is activated and induces the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Uncontrolled constitutive activation of the type I IFN system can lead to autoinflammation and autoimmunity, which is observed in autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematodes and in monogenic interferonopathies. They are caused by mutations in genes which are involved in sensing or metabolism of intracellular nucleic acids and DNA repair. Many authors described mechanisms of type I IFN secretion upon increased DNA damage, including the formation of micronuclei, cytosolic chromatin fragments and destabilization of DNA binding proteins. Hereditary cutaneous DNA damage syndromes, which are caused by mutations in proteins of the DNA repair, share laboratory and clinical features also seen in autoimmune disorders and interferonopathies; hence a potential role of DNA-damage-induced type I IFN secretion seems likely. Here, we aim to summarize possible mechanisms of IFN induction in cutaneous DNA damage syndromes with defects in the DNA double-strand repair and nucleotide excision repair. We review recent publications referring to Ataxia teleangiectasia, Bloom syndrome, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, Werner syndrome, Huriez syndrome, and Xeroderma pigmentosum. Furthermore, we aim to discuss the role of type I IFN in cancer and these syndromes.","['Klein B', 'Günther C']",2021,12,,Front Immunol,Klein B and Günther C.

34367710,Utilization of Rituximab for Refractory Rowell Syndrome.,"Rowell syndrome describes the occurrence of erythema multiforme-like lesions in patients with cutaneous lesions of lupus erythematosus. The clinical picture of atypical erythema multiforme-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, anti-Ro/SSA, or anti-La/SSB antibodies, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus are some of the classic clinical and serologic features. Histopathologic and serologic findings can help differentiate this process from erythema multiforme. We present a case of young woman with systemic lupus erythematosus, end-stage renal disease due to lupus nephritis, and a remote history of Steven-Johnson syndrome due to sulfa allergy who presented to the hospital with a recurrent, progressive, targetoid erythematous rash involving more than 60% of her body surface area. Our patient had several hospitalizations in the recent past for this erythematous rash and had failed oral therapy with prednisone 1 mg/kg and hydroxychloroquine. In view of the minimal improvement and increasing severity and patient exhibiting early features of mast cell activation syndrome, the patient was treated with pulse intravenous glucocorticoids followed by rituximab with an excellent response. We highlight a unique case report of progressive Rowell syndrome refractory to standard of care with an excellent response to rituximab.","['Singh S', 'Sheffield S', 'Chowdhury N', 'Nuthulaganti S', 'Vaghaiwalla Z', 'Ramsubeik K']",2021,2021,,Case Rep Rheumatol,"Singh S, et al.

34364171,"Guideline for the diagnosis, treatment and long-term management of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.","Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an inflammatory, autoimmune disease encompassing a broad spectrum of subtypes including acute, subacute, chronic and intermittent CLE. Among these, chronic CLE can be further classified into several subclasses of lupus erythematosus (LE) such as discoid LE, verrucous LE, LE profundus, chilblain LE and Blaschko linear LE. To provide all dermatologists and rheumatologists with a practical guideline for the diagnosis, treatment and long-term management of CLE, this evidence- and consensus-based guideline was developed following the checklist established by the international Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare (RIGHT) Working Group and was registered at the International Practice Guideline Registry Platform. With the joint efforts of the Asian Dermatological Association (ADA), the Asian Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AADV) and the Lupus Erythematosus Research Center of Chinese Society of Dermatology (CSD), a total of 25 dermatologists, 7 rheumatologists, one research scientist on lupus and 2 methodologists, from 16 countries/regions in Asia, America and Europe, participated in the development of this guideline. All recommendations were agreed on by at least 80% of the 32 voting physicians. As a consensus, diagnosis of CLE is mainly based on the evaluation of clinical and histopathological manifestations, with an exclusion of SLE by assessment of systemic involvement. For localized CLE lesions, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors are first-line treatment. For widespread or severe CLE lesions and (or) cases resistant to topical treatment, systemic treatment including antimalarials and (or) short-term corticosteroids can be added. Notably, antimalarials are the first-line systemic treatment for all types of CLE, and can also be used in pregnant patients and pediatric patients. Second-line choices include thalidomide, retinoids, dapsone and MTX, whereas MMF is third-line treatment. Finally, pulsed-dye laser or surgery can be added as fourth-line treatment for localized, refractory lesions of CCLE in cosmetically unacceptable areas, whereas belimumab may be used as fourth-line treatment for widespread CLE lesions in patients with active SLE, or recurrence of ACLE during tapering of corticosteroids. As for management of the disease, patient education and a long-term follow-up are necessary. Disease activity, damage of skin and other organs, quality of life, comorbidities and possible adverse events are suggested to be assessed in every follow-up visit, when appropriate.","['Lu Q', 'Long H', 'Chow S', 'Hidayat S', 'Danarti R', 'Listiawan Y', 'Deng D', 'Guo Q', 'Fang H', 'Tao J', 'Zhao M', 'Xiang L', 'Che N', 'Li F', 'Zhao H', 'Lau CS', 'Ip FC', 'Ho KM', 'Paliza AC', 'Vicheth C', 'Godse K', 'Cho S', 'Seow CS', 'Miyachi Y', 'Khang TH', 'Ungpakorn R', 'Galadari H', 'Shah R', 'Yang K', 'Zhou Y', 'Selmi C', 'Sawalha AH', 'Zhang X', 'Chen Y', 'Lin CS']",2021,123,,J Autoimmun,"Lu Q, et al.

34336629,COVID-19 Related Acro-Ischemic Neuropathic-like Painful Lesions in Pediatric Patients: A Case Series.,"BACKGROUND: A variety of skin manifestations have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Acral lesions on hands and feet, closely resembling chilblains, have been reported in association with COVID-19, which are nonspecific. These acro-ischemic painful lesions have been described mainly in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic pediatric COVID-19 positive patients, without a precise pathogenetic mechanism. COVID-19-induced chilblains may portend an indolent course and a good outcome. In young patients, the IFN-1 response induces microangiopathic changes and produces a chilblain lupus erythematosus-like eruption with vasculitic neuropathic pain features.
OBJECTIVES: This paper presented a case series of pediatric patients with COVID-19-related skin lesions and neuropathic-like pain.
METHODS: Clinical outcomes were collected from 11 patients diagnosed with painful erythematous skin lesions with neuropathic-like pain and positive IgG for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
RESULTS: It is a mildly symptomatic condition not related to severe pain rates, and it is treated with paracetamol due to the transitory nature of the problem, which provides good results.
CONCLUSIONS: A particular point of interest is skin lesion manifestation as a further indirect sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to the initial manifestation of chilblains in pauci-symptomatic pediatric patients, they need to be immediately tested and isolated. Chilblains can be considered a clinical clue to suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection and help in early diagnosis, patient triage, and infection control.","['Papa A', 'Salzano AM', 'Di Dato MT', 'Lo Bianco G', 'Tedesco M', 'Salzano A', 'Myrcik D', 'Imani F', 'Varrassi G', 'Akhavan Akbari G', 'Paladini A']",2021,11,2,Anesth Pain Med,"Papa A, et al.

34307634,Histopathology and immunophenotyping of late onset cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in elderly patients: Three case reports.,"BACKGROUND: Several cutaneous manifestations such as urticarial rash, erythematous patches and chilblain-like lesions have been described in young adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are present in up to 20% patients, but few reports exist describing histopathological and immunophenotypic characteristics of dermatological lesions in older patients. Our aim was to characterize skin lesions in elderly patients during late stages of COVID-19 from clinical, histological and immunophenotypic perspectives.
CASE SUMMARY: Three patients, admitted for COVID-19, and who developed cutaneous manifestations underwent skin biopsies. Immunophenotypic analysis for CD20, CD3, CD4 and CD8 was performed on skin biopsies to assess immune cell infiltrates. CD1a was used as a marker of Langerhans cells, and CD31 as a marker of endothelial cells. In the three study patients, cutaneous manifestations were evident in the late-stage of COVID-19 (mean time from the first positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) swab to rash onset was 35 d). Skin biopsies showed a similar pattern of T lymphocyte infiltration in all patients. Indeed, a chronic dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate was observed with predominance of CD3+ T-cell (CD3+).
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms previous reports. Histological and immunophenotypic patterns in our patients confirm results described in the two previous reported experiences. This pattern is similar to what is found in some lympho-proliferative disorders. Therefore, since these findings are non-specific, SARS-CoV-2 infection should be suspected.","['Mazzitelli M', 'Dastoli S', 'Mignogna C', 'Bennardo L', 'Lio E', 'Pelle MC', 'Trecarichi EM', 'Pereira BI', 'Nisticò SP', 'Torti C']",2021,9,20,World J Clin Cases,"Mazzitelli M, et al.

34272741,A clinicopathological description of COVID-19-induced chilblains (COVID-toes) correlated with a published literature review.,"BACKGROUND: The abundance of publications of COVID-19-induced chilblains has resulted in a confusing situation.
METHODS: This is a prospective single-institution study from 15 March to 13 May 2020. Thirty-two patients received PCR nasopharyngeal swabs. Of these, 28 patients had a thoracic CT-scan, 31 patients had blood and urine examinations, 24 patients had skin biopsies including immunohistochemical and direct immunofluorescence studies, and four patients had electron microscopy.
RESULTS: COVID-19-induced chilblains are clinically and histopathologically identical to chilblains from other causes. Although intravascular thrombi are sometimes observed, no patient had a systemic coagulopathy or severe clinical course. The exhaustive clinical, radiological, and laboratory work-up in this study ruled-out other primary and secondary causes. Electron microscopy revealed rare, probable viral particles whose core and spikes measured from 120 to 133 nm within endothelium and eccrine glands in two cases.
CONCLUSION: This study provides further clinicopathologic evidence of COVID-19-related chilblains. Negative PCR and antibody tests do not rule-out infection. Chilblains represent a good prognosis, occurring later in the disease course. No systemic coagulopathy was identified in any patient. Patients presenting with acral lesions should be isolated, and chilblains should be distinguished from thrombotic lesions (livedo racemosa, retiform purpura, or ischemic acral necrosis).","['Kolivras A', 'Thompson C', 'Pastushenko I', 'Mathieu M', 'Bruderer P', 'de Vicq M', 'Feoli F', 'Harag S', 'Meiers I', 'Olemans C', 'Sass U', 'Dehavay F', 'Fakih A', 'Lam-Hoai XL', 'Marneffe A', 'Van De Borne L', 'Vandersleyen V', 'Richert B']",2022,49,1,J Cutan Pathol,"Kolivras A, et al.

Initial reports did not include cutaneous manifestations as a feature of COVID-19; however, there is a growing repertoire of reports demonstrating an array of dermatologic manifestations on the skin in children and adults. Dermatologic afflictions have been summarized into different categories several times, with the most recent analysis identifying six clinical patterns: urticaria, maculopapular-morbilliform eruption, papulovesicular exanthem, chilblain-like acral pattern, livedo reticularis-livedo racemosa pattern, and purpuric vasculitic pattern. In children, the dermatologic features appear to occur before or concomitantly with other COVID-19 manifestations. Dermatologists play a key role in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 who may present for the first time unwittingly exhibiting early signs of COVID-19.

34213786,COVID-19 skin lesions are rarely positive at RT-PCR test: the macrophage activation with vascular impact and SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm.,"BACKGROUND: Several skin manifestations have been reported since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic: chilblains-like, livedoid lesions, urticaria-like, pseudo-Kawasaki disease, and others. Histopathologic images of these lesions most often show aspects of endothelitis, images similar to autoimmune vasculitis. Cutaneous lesions are often negative at RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus.
METHOD AND RESULTS: We reviewed recent articles on the mechanisms of COVID-19 and we synthesized main pathways of inflammatory cascade. After the penetration into the cells of the respiratory epithelium, SARS-CoV-2 virus initiates a ""cytokine storm"" well described in previous publications: the expression of interferon type I (IFN-I) is one of the key elements of the antiviral response in COVID-19 patients, IFN-I expression seems to play an important role in the induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6), chemotactic factors such as Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and the consequent activation of monocyte-macrophage system followed by the expression of TNF-alpha, and finally by the induction of coagulation factors by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

34160569,Epidemiologic Analysis of Chilblains Cohorts Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"IMPORTANCE: Beginning in March 2020, case reports and case series linked the COVID-19 pandemic with an increased occurrence of chilblains, but this association has not been evaluated in an epidemiologic study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a correlation exists between COVID-19 incidence and chilblains incidence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020; health plan members of all ages were included.
EXPOSURE: COVID-19 incidence in 207 location-months, representing 23 geographic locations in northern California across 9 months.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Chilblains incidence was the main outcome. The association of chilblains incidence with COVID-19 incidence across the 207 location-months was measured using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Of 780 patients with chilblains reported during the pandemic, 464 were female (59.5%); mean (SD) age was 36.8 (21.8) years. COVID-19 incidence was correlated with chilblains incidence at 207 location-months (Spearman coefficient 0.18; P = .01). However, only 17 of 456 (3.7%) patients with chilblains tested during the pandemic were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and only 9 of 456 (2.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 6 weeks of the chilblains diagnosis. Test results of 1 of 97 (1.0%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Latinx patients were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 but not by chilblains.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that in northern California, the incidence of chilblains increased during the pandemic but was correlated weakly with the incidence of COVID-19 across 207 location-months. These findings may have resulted from a causal role of COVID-19, increased care-seeking by patients with chilblains during the pandemic, or changes in behavior during shelter in place.","['McCleskey PE', 'Zimmerman B', 'Lieberman A', 'Liu L', 'Chen C', 'Gorouhi F', 'Jacobson CC', 'Lee DS', 'Sriram A', 'Thornton A', 'Herz AM', 'Mirmirani P', 'Herrinton LJ']",2021,157,8,JAMA Dermatol,"McCleskey PE, et al.

34127574,Covid-19 skin manifestations: an update.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 is a multisystemic disease manifesting mainly with dry cough, fever, and pneumonia and can present with a myriad of cutaneous manifestations. This chapter will review SARS-CoV-2 associated cutaneous findings, including incidence and relevance to the pediatric population.
RECENT FINDINGS: The most commonly reported cutaneous findings described for COVID-19 in adults and children were chilblains-like lesions, followed by maculopapular eruption, urticarial lesions, vesicular lesions, and livedoid lesions. Children can also present with erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions and skin findings associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).
SUMMARY: There are numerous cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, some of which are unique to children such as EM-like lesions and skin findings for MIS-C. Livedoid lesions do not commonly occur in the pediatric population. In mild cases, supportive care is indicated, whereas severe cases warrant intensive care and hospitalization.","['Sanchez-Flores X', 'Huynh T', 'Huang JT']",2021,33,4,Curr Opin Pediatr,"Sanchez-Flores X, et al.

34110396,Bilateral Chilblain-like Lesions of the Toes Characterized by Microvascular Remodeling in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"IMPORTANCE: Chilblain-like lesions have been one of the most frequently described cutaneous manifestations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their etiopathogenesis, including the role of SARS-CoV-2, remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of chilblain-like lesions with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective case series enrolled 17 adolescents who presented with chilblain-like lesions from April 1 to June 30, 2020, at a tertiary referral academic hospital in Italy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Macroscopic (clinical and dermoscopic) and microscopic (histopathologic) analysis contributed to a thorough understanding of the lesions. Nasopharyngeal swab, serologic testing, and in situ hybridization of the skin biopsy specimens were performed to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory tests explored signs of systemic inflammation or thrombophilia. Structural changes in peripheral microcirculation were investigated by capillaroscopy.
RESULTS: Of the 17 adolescents (9 [52.9%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 13.2 [12.5-14.3] years) enrolled during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 16 (94.1%) had bilaterally localized distal erythematous or cyanotic lesions. A triad of red dots (16 [100%]), white rosettes (11 [68.8%]), and white streaks (10 [62.5%]) characterized the dermoscopic picture. Histologic analysis revealed a remodeling of the dermal blood vessels with a lobular arrangement, wall thickening, and a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. SARS-CoV-2 infection was excluded by molecular and serologic testing. In situ hybridization did not highlight the viral genome in the lesions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study delineated the clinical, histologic, and laboratory features of chilblain-like lesions that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, and its findings do not support their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lesions occurred in otherwise healthy adolescents, had a long but benign course to self-resolution, and were characterized by a microvascular remodeling with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate but no other signs of vasculitis. These results suggest that chilblain-like lesions do not imply a concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ongoing studies will help clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms.","['Discepolo V', 'Catzola A', 'Pierri L', 'Mascolo M', 'Della Casa F', 'Vastarella M', 'Smith G', 'Travaglino A', 'Punziano A', 'Nappa P', 'Staibano S', 'Bruzzese E', 'Fabbrocini G', 'Guarino A', 'Alessio M']",2021,4,6,JAMA Netw Open,"Discepolo V, et al.

34103198,New use of old medicine: Nifedipine acts on the TRP family and inflammatory proteins in the treatment of chilblain.,"As a calcium antagonist, the mechanism of nifedipine for treating chilblain has not been reported. In the present study, we established the chilblain model by using -20 ℃ 95% ethanol to freeze the right back foot of SD rats, and investigated the effects of this drug. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) examination indicated most of pannus in the skin tissue of chilblain rats had disappeared, and the local inflammatory cells were also greatly reduced when given nifedipine at 15.0 mg/kg/d. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that nifedipine inhibited release of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and VEGF in serum. The RT-PCR analysis showed that nifedipine down regulated mRNA levels of TRPC-6 and VEGF in skin tissue. Furthermore, immunohistochemical examination showed nifedipine inhibited expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α inflammatory protein and further inhibited expression of TRP (transient receptor potential) family proteins TRPM-7, TRPC-1, TRPC-3 and TRPC-6 and reduced expression of VEGF in skin and relieved erythema and oedema. This study demonstrated that nifedipine as an old medicine can be new use for the treatment of chilblain by acting on TRPs family and inflammatory proteins.","['Zhou Y', 'Yan H', 'Li T', 'Xie M', 'Li X', 'Zhao C']",2022,48,2,Burns,"Zhou Y, et al.

34089197,An unusual case of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia mimicking a cutaneous vasculitis.,"T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is an aggressive post-thymic T-cell malignancy, which accounts for 2% of mature lymphocytic leukemias in adults. Though typically presenting with a brief history of B symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, and marked lymphocytosis, erythematous or nodular skin rashes involving the trunk or limbs may be seen in 25% to 30% of patients, as well as a purpuric rash in a periorbital distribution. Cutaneous involvement typically presents in the context of patients with an established history of T-PLL, but it can less frequently present as an initial symptom heralding the diagnosis. An unusual case of T-PLL is described, presenting initially as palmoplantar ulcerated nodules with an initial biopsy suggestive of perniosis, followed by rapid progression of dark violaceous and bright red papules throughout the body after initiation of obinutuzumab. The diagnosis of T-PLL was subsequently fully supported by the clinical, laboratory, cytologic, and immunophenotypic findings. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach to address such rare and atypical presentations.","['Edmonds N', 'Guerra R', 'Noland MB', 'Schenck O', 'Krasner B', 'Gru AA']",2021,48,10,J Cutan Pathol,"Edmonds N, et al.

34069751,Clinical Manifestations of COVID-19 in the Feet: A Review of Reviews.,"There is a lack of scientific evidence about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical manifestations are not thoroughly understood; classically, the virus manifests itself at the pulmonary level but can manifest at other levels. To the best of our knowledge, systematic reviews and non-systematic reviews about COVID-19 symptoms in the feet have not been published. The aim of this review of reviews was to analyze and synthesize the published reviews on manifestations of COVID-19 at the foot level. Methods: a review of reviews was conducted; the eligibility criteria included studies published in English or Spanish, involving children and adults with COVID-19, and reporting foot manifestations. PubMed, SciELO, Science Direct, Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, and Google Scholar were analyzed. Two authors independently performed the screening and quality assessment of the studies with AMSTAR 1, and finally, nine reviews were analyzed (one systematic and eight narratives studies). The main clinical manifestations at the foot level in patients with COVID-19 were vascular (edema, exanthems, chilblains, ischemia, and distal necrosis), dermatological (vesicular, maculopapular, papulosquamous, urticarial skin breakouts, and recurrent herpes), and neurological (muscular weakness in lower limbs, paresis, areflexias, ataxia, and difficulty walking). Erythema pernio or ""COVID toes"" was shown as the most characteristic lesion of this disease, especially in asymptomatic children and young people, so this typical manifestation may be considered important in patients who are positive for COVID-19. This finding does not allow for strong conclusions due to the scarce literature and methodological quality in this regard. Future studies are necessary.","['Jimenez-Cebrian AM', 'Castro-Mendez A', 'García-Podadera B', 'Romero-Galisteo R', 'Medina-Alcántara M', 'Garcia-Paya I', 'Páez-Moguer J', 'Córdoba-Fernández A']",2021,10,10,J Clin Med,"Jimenez-Cebrian AM, et al.

Hence, this review gives the clinicians a future direction to be vigilant for skin presentations during pandemics. The Pubmed database used for literature search with keywords COVID 19, children, and skin in different combinations. Articles published in English with cases of age one month to 18 years were eligible. The outcome included varied aspects of cutaneous and COVID 19 infection. The authors did not register review protocol. Of 51 publications identified, 13 studies containing 149 children met the eligibility criteria. Acrally located erythematous maculopapular lesion was the most common finding in 138 children. The researcher reported Erythema multiforme, varicella like exanthem, and Kawasaki disease like presentations in the rest of the cases. The duration of the skin lesion was 1 2 weeks in 43%. Skin biopsy done in 18 patients revealed superficial and deep perivascular and peri eccrine lymphocytic infiltrate and lymphocytic vasculitis. RT PCR was positive13.8% cases. Serological markers for HSV, parvovirus B19 analyzed across various studies, were negative, except positive mycoplasma pneumonia in 2 of 20 cases tested.

Our objective was to determine the association between skin lesions in children and SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzing others possible infectious/autoimmune etiologies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, multicenter, cross-sectional study, about children with skin manifestations from April to May 2020. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by PCR in nasopharyngeal exudate and/or presence of antibodies by serology.
RESULTS: Sixty-two children were included, 9 (14.5%) presented positive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, with no positive PCR to SARS-Cov-2 in those patients in whom it was made. Patients with positive serology to SARS-CoV-2 presented chilblains and/or vesicular-bullous skin lesions more frequently (66.7% vs. 24.5%, p=0.019). Generalized, urticarial and maculopapular rash was more common in patients with negative antibodies (37.7 vs. 0%, p=0.047), others pathogens were isolated in 41.5% of these patients. There were no significant differences in the positivity for autoantibodies between both groups.
CONCLUSION: In our study, the presence of chilblains-like and/or vesicular lesions were significantly related to SARS-CoV-2 previous contact.","['Carazo Gallego B', 'Martín Pedraz L', 'Galindo Zavala R', 'Rivera Cuello M', 'Mediavilla Gradolph C', 'Núñez Cuadros E']",2021,157,1,Med Clin (Barc),"Carazo Gallego B, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To describe and classify the cutaneous findings with supporting histopathology of confirmed COVID-19 inpatients.
METHODS: We included consecutive inpatients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 for whom a dermatology consult was requested. A skin biopsy was performed in all cases. Skin findings were classified as being compatible with a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 or as representing a distinct clinical entity.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were studied in whom thirty-one dermatologic diagnoses were made. Twenty-two of the dermatoses were compatible with a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19; nine entities were not associated with infection by SARS-CoV-2. The most common COVID-19-associated pattern was an exanthematous presentation. In four patients, a new pattern was observed, characterized by discrete papules with varied histopathological findings including a case of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. No cases of pernio-like lesions were identified. Skin findings not associated with COVID-19 represented 29% of diagnoses and included Malassezia folliculitis, tinea, miliaria and contact dermatitis.
LIMITATIONS: There is no gold-standard test to distinguish between viral exanthems and drug reactions.
CONCLUSION: A histopathological study is critical before attributing skin findings to a manifestation of COVID-19.","['Barrera-Godínez A', 'Méndez-Flores S', 'Gatica-Torres M', 'Rosales-Sotomayor A', 'Campos-Jiménez KI', 'Carrillo-Córdova DM', 'Durand-Muñoz MC', 'Mena-Hernández GL', 'Melchor-Mendoza YK', 'Ruelas-Villavicencio AL', 'García-Irigoyen A', 'Acatitla-Acevedo GA', 'Toussaint-Caire S', 'Domínguez-Cherit J']",2021,35,9,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Barrera-Godínez A, et al.

33972057,Pediatric COVID toes and fingers.,"The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic has been associated with a new constellation of cutaneous features in children. Among the unusual dermatologic presentations are the so-called COVID toes, inflammatory nodules of the feet and toes, sometimes involving the hands and fingers. These lesions mimic acral pernio, the synonym being chilblains. Unlike adult patients with COVID toes, children are less likely to manifest symptomatic COVID-19. Although a few studies have found some linkage to COVID-19 through the serum IgA or IgG severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, other studies have no demonstrable linkage suggesting that barefoot children in cold weather develop such lesions. It appears that the chilblain-like lesions related to the period of the COVID-19 pandemic may reflect a brisk immune response portending a good prognosis and perhaps some form of innate immunity. The possible need to screen for coagulopathy is unclear, but this has been suggested in one report. Until we fully understand the pattern of immune response to COVID-19, questions may persist as to how disease manifestations are linked to SARS-CoV-2 exposures.","['Koschitzky M', 'Oyola RR', 'Lee-Wong M', 'Abittan B', 'Silverberg N']",2021,39,1,Clin Dermatol,"Koschitzky M, et al.

33972045,Clinicopathologic correlations of COVID-19-related cutaneous manifestations with special emphasis on histopathologic patterns.,"Skin is one of target organs affected by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, a fast body of literature has emerged on related cutaneous manifestations. Current perspective is that the skin is not only a bystander of the general cytokines storm with thrombophilic multiorgan injury, but it is directly affected by the epithelial tropism of the virus, as confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of epidermis and eccrine glands. In contrast with the abundance of epidemiologic and clinical reports, histopathologic characterization of skin manifestations is limited. Without an adequate clinicopathologic correlation, nosology of clinically similar conditions is confusing, and effective association with COVID-19 remains presumptive. Several patients with different types of skin lesions, including the most specific acral chilblains-like lesions, showed negative results at SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and serologic sampling. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of what has currently been reported worldwide, with a particular emphasis on microscopic patterns of the skin manifestations in patients exposed to or affected by COVID-19. Substantial breakthroughs may occur in the near future from more skin biopsies, improvement of immunohistochemistry studies, RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 strain by real-time polymerase chain reaction-based assay, and electron microscopic studies.","['Rongioletti F', 'Ferreli C', 'Sena P', 'Caputo V', 'Atzori L']",2021,39,1,Clin Dermatol,"Rongioletti F, et al.

This retrospective study assesses the presence and impact of dermatologic manifestations related to the spread of COVID-19 in Lombardy, the geographic district with the first outbreak in Italy. A cohort of 345 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was collected from February 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Cutaneous signs and dermatologic diagnoses were recorded on admission, and during the course of the disease. Of the 345 patients included in the study, 52 (15%) had new-onset dermatologic conditions related to COVID-19. We observed seven major cutaneous clinical patterns, merged under 3 main groups: Exanthems, vascular lesions, and other cutaneous manifestations. Each subset was detailed with prevalence, age, duration, prognosis, and histology. Cutaneous findings can lead to suspect COVID-19 infection and identify potentially contagious cases with indolent course.","['Recalcati S', 'Gianotti R', 'Fantini F']",2021,39,1,Clin Dermatol,"Recalcati S, et al.

33963765,International registry of dermatological manifestations secondary to COVID-19 infection in 347 Hispanic patients from 25 countries.,"BACKGROUND: The infection by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with multiple cutaneous manifestations, although characterization of them in Hispanic patients with darker skin phototypes is lacking. The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical dermatological manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection in cases with few or without general symptoms in patients from Latin America.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study using a questionnaire that was made for health professionals (physicians with a specialty in dermatology) to investigate dermatological lesions associated with COVID-19 infection in patients from 25 countries of Latin America. The survey was active from June 9 to July 30, 2020.
RESULTS: In this study, information was collected from a total of 347 patients. We found a female gender predominance: 179/347 (51.6%). The mean age at presentation was 40.87 years. The most frequent dermatological manifestations were maculopapular rash and urticarial lesions, followed by papulovesicular lesions, vesicular lesions, chilblain-like lesions, papular lesions, ecchymosis, petechial purpura, pityriasis rosea-like lesions, pruritus, palmoplantar dysesthesias, transient livedo, acral necrosis, palpable purpura, livedo racemosa, and retiform purpura. As far as we know, there are no previous reports of pruritus and palmoplantar dysesthesias.
CONCLUSIONS: This registry emphasizes skin manifestations as an important criterion for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in Latin American countries. This information will be useful for the early identification of suspected cases by health professionals (dermatologists and nondermatologists) and will allow contact tracing to mitigate the impact on health systems at different levels.","['Ocampo-Candiani J', 'Ramos-Cavazos CJ', 'Arellano-Mendoza MI', 'Arenas-Guzmán R', 'Beirana-Palencia A', 'Salmon-Demongin A', 'Welsh-Hernández E', 'Cabo HA', 'Gómez-Flores M', 'Dominguez-Cherit J', 'Criado PR', 'Castro-López H', 'Alfaro-Sánchez AB', 'García-Vargas A', 'Cohen-Sabban EN', 'Del Solar M', 'Fich F', 'Galimberti G', 'Gatti CF', 'López-Estebaranz JL', 'Lupi O', 'Olmos-Pérez M', 'Pérez-Alfonzo R']",2021,60,8,Int J Dermatol,"Ocampo-Candiani J, et al.

33938934,Clinical Characteristics and Transmission of COVID-19 in Children and Youths During 3 Waves of Outbreaks in Hong Kong.,"IMPORTANCE: Schools were closed intermittently across Hong Kong to control the COVID-19 outbreak, which led to significant physical and psychosocial problems among children and youths.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical characteristics and sources of infection among children and youths with COVID-19 during the 3 waves of outbreaks in Hong Kong in 2020.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study involved children and youths aged 18 years or younger with COVID-19 in the 3 waves of outbreaks from January 23 through December 2, 2020. Data were analyzed from December 2020 through January 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Demographic characteristics, travel and contact histories, lengths of hospital stay, and symptoms were captured through the central electronic database. Individuals who were infected without recent international travel were defined as having domestic infections.
RESULTS: Among 397 children and youths confirmed with COVID-19 infections, the mean (SD) age was 9.95 (5.34) years, 220 individuals (55.4%) were male, and 154 individuals (38.8%) were asymptomatic. There were significantly more individuals who were infected without symptoms in the second wave (59 of 118 individuals [50.0%]) and third wave (94 of 265 individuals [35.5%]) than in the first wave (1 of 14 individuals [7.1%]) (P = .001). Significantly fewer individuals who were infected in the second and third waves, compared with the first wave, had fever (first wave: 10 individuals [71.4%]; second wave: 22 individuals [18.5%]; third wave: 98 individuals [37.0%]; P < .001) or cough (first wave: 6 individuals [42.9%]; second wave: 15 individuals [12.7%]; third wave: 52 individuals [19.6%]; P = .02). Among all individuals, 394 individuals (99.2%) had mild illness. One patient developed chilblains (ie, COVID toes), 1 patient developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and 1 patient developed post-COVID-19 autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In all 3 waves, 204 patients with COVID-19 (51.4%) had domestic infections. Among these individuals, 186 (91.2%) reported having a contact history with another individual with COVID-19, of which most (183 individuals [90.0%]) were family members. In the third wave, 18 individuals with domestic infections had unknown contact histories. Three schoolmates were confirmed with COVID-19 on the same day and were reported to be close contacts.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that nearly all children and youths with COVID-19 in Hong Kong had mild illness. These findings suggest that household transmission was the main source of infection for children and youths with domestic infections and that the risk of being infected at school was small.","['Chua GT', 'Wong JSC', 'Lam I', 'Ho PPK', 'Chan WH', 'Yau FYS', 'Rosa Duque JS', 'Ho ACC', 'Siu KK', 'Cheung TWY', 'Lam DSY', 'Chan VCM', 'Lee KP', 'Tsui KW', 'Wong TW', 'Yau MM', 'Yau TY', 'Chan KCC', 'Yu MWL', 'Chow CK', 'Chiu WK', 'Chan KC', 'Wong WHS', 'Ho MHK', 'Tso WWY', 'Tung KTS', 'Wong CS', 'Kwok J', 'Leung WH', 'Yam JC', 'Wong ICK', 'Tam PKH', 'Chan GCF', 'Chow CB', 'To KKW', 'Lau YL', 'Yuen KY', 'Ip P', 'Kwan MYW']",2021,4,5,JAMA Netw Open,"Chua GT, et al.

33856640,Efficacy and Safety of Janus Kinase Inhibitors in Type I Interferon-Mediated Monogenic Autoinflammatory Disorders: A Scoping Review.,"IMPORTANCE: Type I interferon (IFN)-mediated monogenic autoinflammatory disorders (interferonopathies) are childhood-onset rare multisystemic diseases with limited treatment options. The Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are promising potential therapeutic candidates for immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To review the use of JAK inhibitors to improve decision-making when treating interferonopathies with cutaneous manifestations.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies that used JAK protein inhibitors to treat IFN-related monogenic diseases with cutaneous manifestations in humans. The search results are reported using the scoping review approach.
FINDINGS: Seventeen open-label studies assessing the efficacy of ruxolitinib, baricitinib, or tofacitinib reported variable responses in patients with chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) and related syndromes, stimulator of IFN genes [STING]-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), familial chilblain lupus (FCh-L), gain-of-function mutations of STAT1 (GOF-STAT1), or Aicardi-Goutiéres syndrome. JAK inhibitors improved clinical and analytical parameters and decreased flare numbers, plasma inflammatory markers, and expression of IFN-stimulated genes. BK viremia and upper respiratory infections were the most frequent and severe adverse events. Significant heterogeneity in efficacy assessment methods and poor reporting of safety events were detected.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Evidence of the use of JAK inhibitors in patients with interpheronopathies is scarce and of low methodological quality. Future clinical trials should use validated scales and report drug safety in a more accurate way.","['Gómez-Arias PJ', 'Gómez-García F', 'Hernández-Parada J', 'Montilla-López AM', 'Ruano J', 'Parra-Peralbo E']",2021,11,3,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),"Gómez-Arias PJ, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To compare nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) findings in CLE patients with or without digital involvement, and to compare capillaroscopic findings between CLE patients with digital lesions and DM patients.
METHODS: Prospective monocentric study including CLE and DM patients. NFC was performed and standardized items were recorded.
RESULTS: Fifty-one CLE patients and 10 DM patients with digital lesions were included. A scleroderma pattern was found in 6 patients (12%): in 5 out of 17 patients with digital lesions, compared with only 1 out of 34 patients without digital lesions (p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, CLE digital lesions and digital ulcerations were statistically associated with scleroderma pattern. CLE digital lesions were significantly associated with architectural disorganization (p = 0.0003) and capillary rarefaction (p = 0.0038). A scleroderma pattern was significantly more frequent in DM patients (80%) than in CLE patients with digital lesions (30%, p = 0.018). Capillaroscopic findings were not significantly different between CLE patients with digital lesions and DM patients.

A literature search was conducted using the Embase, Pubmed, and Scopus databases from December 2019 to June 16, 2020 using the search terms (""COVID-19"" OR ""coronavirus"" OR ""2019-nCoV"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""chilblain-like"" OR ""COVID toes"" OR ""acral""). Papers that described skin changes in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included. A total of 31 papers were summarized, representing 813 cases of CLL. Available data suggests an equal gender distribution, mean age of 21 years, and median age of 14 years. Mild extracutaneous symptoms were reported in 53% of cases and 47% were asymptomatic. CLL occurred an average of 16 days after extracutaneous symptoms. Patients with CLL were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 15% of cases. Lesions were mainly described as asymptomatic and/or pruritic erythematous to violaceous acral macules and plaques. Partial or complete resolution occurred in 85% of cases in a mean of 13 days. The most common histologic findings were perivascular and perieccrine superficial and deep lymphocytic infiltrates. Although a causal relationship between CLL and SARS-CoV-2 has not been confirmed, the temporal association and 15% positive SARS-CoV-2 rate in affected individuals should not be ignored.","['Kashetsky N', 'Mukovozov IM', 'Bergman J']",2021,25,6,J Cutan Med Surg,"Kashetsky N, et al.

33838206,Cutaneous reactions reported after Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination: A registry-based study of 414 cases.,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous reactions after messenger RNA (mRNA)-based COVID-19 vaccines have been reported but are not well characterized.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the morphology and timing of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
METHODS: A provider-facing registry-based study collected cases of cutaneous manifestations after COVID-19 vaccination.
RESULTS: From December 2020 to February 2021, we recorded 414 cutaneous reactions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna (83%) and Pfizer (17%). Delayed large local reactions were most common, followed by local injection site reactions, urticarial eruptions, and morbilliform eruptions. Forty-three percent of patients with first-dose reactions experienced second-dose recurrence. Additional less common reactions included pernio/chilblains, cosmetic filler reactions, zoster, herpes simplex flares, and pityriasis rosea-like reactions.
LIMITATIONS: Registry analysis does not measure incidence. Morphologic misclassification is possible.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a spectrum of cutaneous reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. We observed some dermatologic reactions to Moderna and Pfizer vaccines that mimicked SARS-CoV-2 infection itself, such as pernio/chilblains. Most patients with first-dose reactions did not have a second-dose reaction and serious adverse events did not develop in any of the patients in the registry after the first or second dose. Our data support that cutaneous reactions to COVID-19 vaccination are generally minor and self-limited, and should not discourage vaccination.","['McMahon DE', 'Amerson E', 'Rosenbach M', 'Lipoff JB', 'Moustafa D', 'Tyagi A', 'Desai SR', 'French LE', 'Lim HW', 'Thiers BH', 'Hruza GJ', 'Blumenthal KG', 'Fox LP', 'Freeman EE']",2021,85,1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"McMahon DE, et al.

33811315,Time of Onset of Selected Skin Lesions Associated with COVID-19: A Systematic Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Distinct skin lesions associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, but data regarding their time of onset during the COVID-19 course are scant. Our objective was to systematically review the studies reporting the time of onset of selected skin lesions with respect to the reported onset of the COVID-19 core symptoms.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of studies published before 21 January 2021 was performed on MEDLINE via PubMed database using a predefined strategy to identify relevant articles.
RESULTS: Out of 354 references, 87 were selected, reporting a total of 895 patients with skin lesions associated with COVID-19. The most frequent pattern was exanthema (n = 430, 48%), followed by vascular (n = 299, 33%), urticarial (n = 105, 12%) and others (n = 66, 7%). Skin lesions occurred more frequently in the first 4 weeks from the COVID-19 onset (n = 831, 92%), whereas prodromal or late lesions were rarer (n = 69, 8%). The urticarial and exanthema patterns were more frequent in the first 2 weeks. About the vascular pattern some differences were noted among its subtypes. Livedoid lesions occurred mainly in the first 2 weeks, while chilblain-like lesions between weeks 2 and 4. Purpuric/petechial lesions were equally distributed during the first 4 weeks. Several skin manifestations did not fall into the pattern classification, including erythema multiforme, generalized pruritus, Kawasaki disease and others.
CONCLUSION: The diversity in the time of onset of skin lesions as well as their polymorphic nature likely reflects the diversity of the pathogenetic underlying mechanisms.

33793103,"[COVID-toes, a cutaneous sign of innate resistance to SARS-CoV-2].","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, dermatologists around the world have reported patients with chilblain-like skin lesions on their toes, called COVID-toes. Surprisingly, the majority of these patients do not develop COVID-19 symptoms, and their nasal swabs and serological tests are unable to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite a clear exposure to the virus. Recent evidence suggests that these patients mount a robust type I interferon response to SARS-CoV-2, making them resistant to the infection. Because chilblains are hallmarks of excessive type I interferons, COVID-toes may represent the skin expression of interferon-mediated resistance to SARS-CoV-2. Uncovering the molecular patho-mechanisms of COVID-toes may provide new avenues to promote SARS-CoV-2 resistance and control the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Yatim A', 'Gilliet M']",2021,17,732,Rev Med Suisse,"Yatim A and Gilliet M.

Antinuclear antibodies and anti-PL-12 antisynthetase autoantibodies were found in complementary examinations. Interstitial lung disease was found on chest computed tomography. Nailfold capillaroscopy showed microangiopathic lesions. Antisynthetase syndrome is a recently described entity in inflammatory myopathies, with specific clinical criteria. Interstitial lung disease is very common, especially in anti-PL-12 associated antisynthetase syndrome. Raynaud's phenomenon is another well-defined criterion.

Considering that the pandemic prolonged more than initially expected was prognostic, it is essential for the medical community to identify the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Thus, this work's objectives were to present cases of cutaneous lesions observed in COVID-19 Mexican patients. We register cutaneous lesions in COVID-19 patients referred from internal medicine and otorhinolaryngology services to dermatology. We presented four interesting cases with cutaneous lesions, including exanthema morbilliform, urticaria, chilblains, ecchymosis, and facial edema, and review the available literature. The most frequent cutaneous markers are rash, chilblains, and urticaria. Skin lesions may be the first manifestation of COVID-19, accompany initial respiratory symptoms, or appear during the disease course. Symptoms associated with vascular changes (livedo reticularis and vasculitis) are considered of poor prognosis.","['Palomo-Pérez JC', 'Vega-Memije ME', 'Aguilar-Blancas D', 'González-Martínez E', 'Rangel-Gamboa L']",2021,9,,SAGE Open Med Case Rep,"Palomo-Pérez JC, et al.

33740317,Idiopathic perniosis presenting as acral purpuric lesions: Clustering of cases before COVID-19 pandemic and their comparison with chilblain like lesions reported in the literature.,"Perniosis/chilblains are the acral inflammatory skin lesions developing in susceptible individuals as an abnormal reaction to cold. In the absence of a discernible cause, it is labeled as idiopathic perniosis (IP). With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there was an upsurge of reports of chilblain like lesions (CLL) especially in young patients possibly implicated to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Twelve clinically suspected and histopathologically confirmed cases of IP seen from November 2019 through February 2020 were retrospectively recruited. Clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathological characteristics of these were reviewed and compared with CLL reported in the literature. Mean age of patients was 26.58 ± 15.18 years with an equal male to female ratio. Characteristic histopathology findings were spongiosis (100%), dermal edema (100%), perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (100%) with peri-eccrine accentuation (66.7%), keratinocyte necrosis (50%), focal basal vacuolar damage (58.3%), and lymphocytic vasculitis (58.3%). Significant dermoscopy findings were variable background color ranging from dull red and violaceous to copper red and brown orange, coiled vessels (44.4%) and orange-red structureless areas (63.9%). Lesions over palms and soles preferentially had white dots/clods and lines (38.9%). There appears no exclusive histopathological as well as dermoscopy features of CLL and IP, yet certain clues can be appreciated. Keratinocyte necrosis and severe dermal edema favors IP, whereas fibrin thrombi with involvement of both superficial and deep dermal vessels favor CLL. Dermoscopically presence of irregular, linear or branching vessels, red/purple dots and clods and gray brown reticule supports CLL while white dots/clods and lines supports IP.","['Jindal R', 'Chauhan P', 'Goyal D', 'Shirazi N']",2021,34,3,Dermatol Ther,"Jindal R, et al.

Out of 417 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [median age 29.5 years (range 15-65); 62.5% males], dermatological lesions were detected in 7 (1.7%). Three patients had acral lesions; their age (range) was 15-29 years; all had a negative nasopharyngeal swab and developed IgG and/or IgM-specific antibodies; all presented none or mild symptoms. A fourth patient remained negative at repeated testing; mother, father and sister had a documented mild COVID-19. Non-acral lesions were observed in four older patients, with severe COVID-19.

33727065,Successful treatment of a novel type I interferonopathy due to a de novo PSMB9 gene mutation with a Janus kinase inhibitor.,"BACKGROUND: Type I interferonopathies are a recently established subgroup of autoinflammatory diseases caused by mutations in genes associated with proteasome degradation or cytoplasmic RNA- and DNA-sensing pathways.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to unveil the molecular pathogenesis of a patient with novel type I interferonopathy, for which no known genetic mutations have been identified.
METHODS: We performed the whole-exome sequencing of a 1-month-old boy with novel type I interferonopathy. We also investigated proteasome activities using patient-derived B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and normal LCLs transduced with the mutant gene.
RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing identified a de novo proteasome 20S subunit beta 9 (PSMB9) p.G156D mutation in the patient who developed fever, a chilblain-like skin rash, myositis, and severe pulmonary hypertension due to the hyperactivation of IFN-α. Patient-derived LCLs revealed reduced proteasome activities, and exogenous transduction of mutant PSMB9 p.G156D into normal LCLs significantly suppressed proteasome activities, and the endogenous PSMB9 protein was lost along with the reduction of other immunoproteasome subunits, PSMB8 and PSMB10 proteins. He responded to the administration of a Janus kinase inhibitor, tofacitinib, and he was successfully withdrawn from venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation. At age 7 months, he received an unrelated cord blood transplantation. At 2 years posttransplantation, he no longer required tofacitinib and experienced no disease recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the case of a patient with a novel type I interferonopathy caused by a de novo PSMB9 p.G156D mutation that suppressed the wild-type PSMB9 protein expression. Janus kinase inhibitor and stem cell transplantation could be curative therapies in patients with severe interferonopathies.","['Kataoka S', 'Kawashima N', 'Okuno Y', 'Muramatsu H', 'Miwata S', 'Narita K', 'Hamada M', 'Murakami N', 'Taniguchi R', 'Ichikawa D', 'Kitazawa H', 'Suzuki K', 'Nishikawa E', 'Narita A', 'Nishio N', 'Yamamoto H', 'Fukasawa Y', 'Kato T', 'Yamamoto H', 'Natsume J', 'Kojima S', 'Nishino I', 'Taketani T', 'Ohnishi H', 'Takahashi Y']",2021,148,2,J Allergy Clin Immunol,"Kataoka S, et al.

33714595,"Pernio (Chilblains), SARS-CoV-2, and COVID Toes Unified Through Cutaneous and Systemic Mechanisms.","Pernio or chilblains is characterized by erythema and swelling at acral sites (eg, toes and fingers), typically triggered by cold exposure. Clinical and histopathologic features of pernio are well described, but the pathogenesis is not entirely understood; vasospasm and a type I interferon (IFN-I) immune response are likely involved. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, dermatologists have observed an increase in pernio-like acral eruptions. Direct causality of pernio due to COVID-19 has not been established in many cases because of inconsistent testing methods (often negative results) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, a form of COVID-19‒associated pernio (also called COVID toes) is probable because of increased occurrence, frequently in young patients with no cold exposure or a history of pernio, and reports of skin biopsies with positive SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry. PubMed was searched between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020 for publications using the following keywords: pernio, chilblain, and acral COVID-19. On the basis of our review of the published literature, we speculate that several unifying cutaneous and systemic mechanisms may explain COVID-19‒associated pernio: (1) SARS-CoV-2 cell infection occurs through the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mediated by transmembrane protease serine 2, subsequently affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with an increase in the vasoconstricting, pro-inflammatory, and prothrombotic angiotensin II pathway. (2) Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cell infection triggers an immune response with robust IFN-I release in patients predisposed to COVID-19‒associated pernio. (3) Age and sex discrepancies correlated with COVID-19 severity and manifestations, including pernio as a sign of mild disease, are likely explained by age-related immune and vascular differences influenced by sex hormones and genetics, which affect susceptibility to viral cellular infection, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system balance, and the IFN-I response.","['Cappel MA', 'Cappel JA', 'Wetter DA']",2021,96,4,Mayo Clin Proc,"Cappel MA, et al.

33652010,Are Oral Mucosal Changes a Sign of COVID-19? A Cross-Sectional Study at a Field Hospital.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has many manifestations, including respiratory, thrombotic, neurologic, digestive, and cutaneous ones. Cutaneous manifestations have been classified into 5 clinical patterns: acro-ischemic (pseudo-chilblain), vesicular, urticarial, maculopapular, and livedoid. Oral manifestations have also been reported, but much less frequently.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in which we examined the oral mucosa of 666 patients with COVID-19 at the IFEMA field hospital in Madrid in April 2020.
RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (11.7%) had changes involving the oral mucosa. The most common were transient anterior U-shaped lingual papillitis (11.5%) accompanied or not by tongue swelling (6.6%), aphthous stomatitis (6.9%), a burning sensation in the mouth (5.3%), mucositis (3.9%), glossitis with patchy depapillation (3.9%), white tongue (1.6%), and enanthema (0.5%). Most of the patients also reported taste disturbances.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 also manifests in the oral cavity. The most common manifestations are transient U-shaped lingual papillitis, glossitis with patchy depapillation, and burning mouth syndrome. Mucositis with or without aphthous ulcers or enanthema may also be observed. Any these findings may be key clues to a diagnosis of COVID-19.","['Nuño González A', 'Magaletskyy K', 'Martín Carrillo P', 'Lozano Masdemont B', 'Mayor Ibarguren A', 'Feito Rodríguez M', 'Herranz Pinto P']",2021,112,7,Actas Dermosifiliogr (Engl Ed),"Nuño González A, et al.

33630167,Cutaneous Manifestations Related to COVID-19 Immune Dysregulation in the Pediatric Age Group.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: At the juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is currently in an early phase of collecting clinical data and reports of its skin manifestations, and its pathophysiology is still highly conjectural. We reviewed cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 in the pediatric age group.
RECENT FINDINGS: Children infected by SARS-CoV-2 usually develop milder respiratory symptoms, but cutaneous manifestations seem a little more prevalent than in adults. These skin features of infection by the coronavirus can be similar to those produced by other common viruses, but there are also reports of cases with more heterogeneous clinical pictures, which have made their classification difficult. To date, the more frequently reported skin variants featured in pediatric cases are purpuric (pseudo-chilblain, necrotic-acral ischemia, hemorrhagic macules, and/or cutaneous necrosis), morbilliform/maculopapular, erythema multiforme, urticarial, vesicular, Kawasaki-like, and miscellaneous (highly variable in both frequency and severity). Their pathophysiological mechanism is still elusive and is likely to be the result of the complex involvement of one or more mechanisms, like direct virus-induced skin damage, vasculitis-like reactions, and/or indirect injury as a consequence of a systemic inflammatory reaction. In this review, we presented and discussed clinical cases as examples of different cutaneous responses reported in some children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, differential diagnosis considerations, and a preliminary conceptual approach to some of their probable associated pathologic mechanisms.","['Larenas-Linnemann D', 'Luna-Pech J', 'Navarrete-Rodríguez EM', 'Rodríguez-Pérez N', 'Arias-Cruz A', 'Blandón-Vijil MV', 'Del Rio-Navarro BE', 'Estrada-Cardona A', 'Onuma-Takane E', 'Pozo-Beltrán CF', 'Valencia-Herrera AM', 'Ortiz-Aldana FI', 'Toledo-Bahena ME']",2021,21,2,Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,"Larenas-Linnemann D, et al.

33551211,Acute acral eruptions in children during the COVID-19 pandemic: Characteristics of 103 children and their family clusters.,"BACKGROUND: A marked increase in frequency of acute acral eruptions (AAE) was observed in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring period.
OBJECTIVES: In this observational multicenter study, based on children with AAE, we aimed to assess the proportion of household members possibly infected by SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: We collected data from all children observed with AAE, prospectively from April 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020, and retrospectively since February 28, 2020. The primary outcome was the household infection rate, defined as the proportion of family clusters having at least one member with COVID-19 infection other than the child with AAE (""index child""). The definition of a case was based on characteristic clinical signs and a positive PCR or serology.
RESULTS: The study included 103 children in 10 French departments and in Quebec. The median age was 13 years and the interquartile range [8-15], with a female-to-male ratio of 1/1.15. In children with AAE, all PCR tests were negative (n=18), and serology was positive in 2/14 (14.3%) cases. We found no significant anomalies in the lab results. A total of 66 of the 103 families (64.1%) of included children had at least one other infected member apart from the index child. The total number of household members was 292, of whom 119 (40.8%) were considered possibly infected by SARS-CoV-2. No index children or households exhibited severe COVID-19.
DISCUSSION: Among the 103 households included, 64.1% had at least one infected member. Neither children with AAE nor their households showed severe COVID-19.","['Hubiche T', 'Phan A', 'Leducq S', 'Rapp J', 'Fertitta L', 'Aubert H', 'Barbarot S', 'Chiaverini C', 'Giraudeau B', 'Lasek A', 'Mallet S', 'Labarelle A', 'Piram M', 'McCuaig C', 'Martin L', 'Monitor L', 'Nicol I', 'Bissuel M', 'Bellissen A', 'Jullien D', 'Lesort C', 'Vabres P', 'Maruani A', 'Research Group of the Société Française de Dermatologie Pédiatrique (French Society of Pediatric Dermatology)']",2021,148,2,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Hubiche T, et al.

33533036,"Skin manifestations in COVID-19 patients, state of the art. A systematic review.","INTRODUCTION: Since COVID-19 has become a pandemic, extensive literature has been produced. The commonest symptoms of COVID-19 disease are fever, cough, anosmia, and lymphocytopenia. However, other apparently less common clinical symptoms have been described, including skin lesions. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate skin involvement in COVID-19.
METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review of literature, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The search was reiterated until May 06, 2020.
RESULTS: Overall, 1593 patients (M/F ratio: 1 : 9) with suspect of COVID-19 were examined. The mean age was 37.8 (range 0-91) years. Among the analyzed patients, 84 (5.3%) were pediatrics (<18 years). Chilblains are very common among skin lesions and represent almost half of all skin lesions reported (46%); in 75% of patients with cutaneous manifestation, the latter presented before other typical clinical manifestation of COVID-19. Vasculitis or thrombosis was identified in almost 70% of patients who suffered from skin manifestations.
CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the importance of skin involvement in COVID-19. Limbs should be examined to eventually foresee the onset of further typical symptoms. Chilblains can be considered typical features. Studies with higher scientific evidence are required.","['Perna A', 'Passiatore M', 'Massaro A', 'Terrinoni A', 'Bianchi L', 'Cilli V', ""D'Orio M"", 'Proietti L', 'Taccardo G', 'De Vitis R']",2021,60,5,Int J Dermatol,"Perna A, et al.

33513563,The Influence of Media Coverage and Governmental Policies on Google Queries Related to COVID-19 Cutaneous Symptoms: Infodemiology Study.,"BACKGROUND: During COVID-19, studies have reported the appearance of internet searches for disease symptoms before their validation by the World Health Organization. This suggested that monitoring of these searches with tools including Google Trends may help monitor the pandemic itself. In Europe and North America, dermatologists reported an unexpected outbreak of cutaneous acral lesions (eg, chilblain-like lesions) in April 2020. However, external factors such as public communications may also hinder the use of Google Trends as an infodemiology tool.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess the impact of media announcements and lockdown enforcement on internet searches related to cutaneous acral lesions during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.
METHODS: Two searches on Google Trends, including daily relative search volumes for (1) ""toe"" or ""chilblains"" and (2) ""coronavirus,"" were performed from January 1 to May 16, 2020, with the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany as the countries of choice. The ratio of interest over time in ""chilblains"" and ""coronavirus"" was plotted. To assess the impact of lockdown enforcement and media coverage on these internet searches, we performed an interrupted time-series analysis for each country.
RESULTS: The ratio of interest over time in ""chilblains"" to ""coronavirus"" showed a constant upward trend. In France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, lockdown enforcement was associated with a significant slope change for ""chilblain"" searches with a variation coefficient of 1.06 (SE 0.42) (P=0.01), 1.04 (SE 0.28) (P<.01), and 1.21 (SE 0.44) (P=0.01), respectively. After media announcements, these ratios significantly increased in France, Spain, Italy, and the United States with variation coefficients of 18.95 (SE 5.77) (P=.001), 31.31 (SE 6.31) (P<.001), 14.57 (SE 6.33) (P=.02), and 11.24 (SE 4.93) (P=.02), respectively, followed by a significant downward trend in France (-1.82 [SE 0.45]), Spain (-1.10 [SE 0.38]), and Italy (-0.93 [SE 0.33]) (P<.001, P=0.004, and P<.001, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: To date, the association between chilblain-like lesions and COVID-19 remains controversial; however, our results indicate that Google queries of ""chilblain"" were highly influenced by media coverage and government policies, indicating that caution should be exercised when using Google Trends as a monitoring tool for emerging diseases.","['Huynh Dagher S', 'Lamé G', 'Hubiche T', 'Ezzedine K', 'Duong TA']",2021,7,2,JMIR Public Health Surveill,"Huynh Dagher S, et al.

33501498,Histopathologic Features of Chilblainlike Lesions Developing in the Setting of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.,"CONTEXT.—: During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, several studies have described a distinctive cutaneous manifestation with a clinical picture resembling chilblains or chilblain lupus in young patients.
OBJECTIVE.—: To report the histopathologic description of a series of chilblainlike lesions appearing in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic.
DESIGN.—: The study included 13 patients with cutaneous acral lesions resembling chilblains occurring in the setting of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with available skin biopsy.
RESULTS.—: Two main histopathologic patterns were observed: a chilblainlike histopathologic pattern (10 of 13 cases; 77%) and a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern (3 of 13 cases; 23%). The chilblainlike histopathologic pattern featured a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes of varying intensity. This infiltrate was sometimes peri-eccrine and alterations of eccrine glands were present in most cases. Vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis was found in a majority of patients. Lichenoid interface dermatitis was rarely present. The thrombotic vasculopathy pattern featured an absent or mild inflammatory infiltrate, multiple intraluminal fibrin thrombi, and ischemic epidermal necrosis. In both patterns, no true vasculitis was observed. No patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction, possibly because these lesions may represent late cutaneous manifestations of the disease or are associated with an early effective immune response.
CONCLUSIONS.—: The relationship of chilblainlike lesions to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requires further investigations. Histopathologic features mimic chilblains, chilblain lupus, and, less frequently, a thrombotic vasculopathy. Response to viral infection might trigger diverse mechanisms leading to the 2 histopathologic patterns described.","['Sohier P', 'Matar S', 'Meritet JF', 'Laurent-Roussel S', 'Dupin N', 'Aractingi S']",2021,145,2,Arch Pathol Lab Med,"Sohier P, et al.

33486780,Cutaneous manifestations in Moyamoya angiopathy: A review.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Moyamoya angiopathy (MA) is a progressive cerebrovascular disease with a poorly understood pathophysiology. It is mainly characterized by progressive bilateral stenosis of the terminal intracranial part of the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries and the proximal parts of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. This results in early-onset ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. The disease may be idiopathic (known as Moyamoya disease) or associated with other heritable or acquired conditions, including type 1 neurofibromatosis or other RASopathies, sickle cell disease, Down syndrome, or autoimmune disorders (known as Moyamoya syndrome). Apart from the brain, other organ manifestations including cutaneous ones have also been described in MA patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature research on PubMed was performed for articles mentioning the cutaneous association in MA and published between 1994 and October 2020.
CONCLUSION: The present review summarizes the cutaneous associations as well as the coincidental dermatological findings seen in MA patients. Those include changes in the epidermis, dermis, or skin appendages for example café-au-lait spots, hypomelanosis of Ito, livedo racemosa, hemangiomas, premature graying of hair, chilblains etc.","['Mitri F', 'Bersano A', 'Hervé D', 'Kraemer M']",2021,28,5,Eur J Neurol,"Mitri F, et al.

33482855,Systemic inflammation and chronic kidney disease in a patient due to the RNASEH2B defect.,"INTRODUCTION: Aicardi-Goutières (AGS) is a rare immune dysregulated disease due to mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, or IFIH1. Clinical features include basal ganglia calcifications, white matter abnormalities, and cerebral atrophy. Severe systemic inflammation and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are extremely rare in AGS. Herein, we report a patient presenting with systemic inflammation and CKD to broaden the clinical phenotype spectrum of the RNASEH2B defect.
METHODS: All testing and molecular genetic analysis were performed after obtaining the informed consent of the parents. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings were abstracted from outpatient and inpatient encounters. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, and renal biopsy histopathology reports were reviewed and summarized. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on peripheral blood cells. After exposure to cGAMP in vitro for 24 h, mRNA expression of 12 IFN-stimulated cytokine genes in PBMCs was assessed. Serum cytokine levels were detected by Milliplex.
RESULTS: A 11-year-old girl presented with recurrent aseptic fever, arthritis, chilblains, failure to thrive, mild hearing loss, and neurological manifestations. Laboratory and immunologic findings demonstrated lymphopenia, low complement levels, positive autoantibodies, elevated levels of acute-phase reactants and inflammatory cytokines. Cerebral imaging showed cerebral atrophy, white matter abnormalities, and intracranial calcification. Renal biopsy showed glomerular sclerosis in 3 of 14 glomeruli, infiltration of lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells. WES revealed a homozygous and heterozygous mutations in RNASEH2B. Over-expression of IFN-stimulated cytokine genes was observed, including IFI44, IFI27, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, ISG15, OAS1, and SIGLEC1.
CONCLUSIONS: To date, only two cases with AGS have been reported to have renal disease. Here, we describe a patient with both homozygous and heterozygous variants in RNASEH2B, presenting with neurological manifestations, persistently systemic autoinflammation, and CKD. CKD has never been reported in patients with AGS due to the RNASEH2B defect.

33479703,Skin manifestations of COVID-19: A worldwide review.,"OBJECTIVE: Because of the increasing emergence of skin manifestations of COVID-19 worldwide, we investigated the published reports of these lesions.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search for original and review articles published from November 11, 2019 to September 30, 2020.
RESULTS: We identified 5 skin lesions common in patients with COVID-19: pseudo-chilblains, rashes containing macules and papules, and urticarial, vesicular, and vaso-occlusive lesions. These lesions manifested at various times in relation to the COVID-19 symptoms, which may indicate whether the lesions are virus-induced or are delayed immunological responses to the infection. Skin lesions were more prevalent among Europeans and United States residents than among Asians, as was pseudo-chilblain, and the morphology of the skin lesions varied among continents. Pseudo-chilblains were the most common COVID-19 skin manifestation in Europe and the United States, but there was only 1 reported case from Asian populations. Additionally, patients with vaso-occlusive lesions were more likely than those with pseudo-chilblains to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to die.
CONCLUSION: Different cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 could reflect a wide spectrum of viral interactions with the skin, though reporting bias may play a role as well.","['Tan SW', 'Tam YC', 'Oh CC']",2021,2,,JAAD Int,"Tan SW, et al.

33476725,The clinical spectrum of COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations: An Italian multicenter study of 200 adult patients.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with a wide range of skin manifestations.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations and explore the relationships among the 6 main cutaneous phenotypes and systemic findings.
METHODS: Twenty-one Italian Dermatology Units were asked to collect the demographic, clinical, and histopathologic data of 200 patients with COVID-19-associated skin manifestations. The severity of COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe.
RESULTS: A chilblain-like acral pattern was significantly associated with a younger age (P < .0001) and, after adjusting for age, significantly associated with less severe COVID-19 (P = .0009). However, the median duration of chilblain-like lesions was significantly longer than that of the other cutaneous manifestations taken together (P < .0001). Patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 were more represented than those with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 among the patients with cutaneous manifestations other than chilblain-like lesions, but only the confluent erythematous/maculo-papular/morbilliform phenotype was significantly associated with more severe COVID-19 (P = .015), and this significance disappeared after adjustment for age.
LIMITATIONS: Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was not possible in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for age, there was no clear-cut spectrum of COVID-19 severity in patients with COVID-19-related skin manifestations, although chilblain-like acral lesions were more frequent in younger patients with asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic COVID-19.","['Marzano AV', 'Genovese G', 'Moltrasio C', 'Gaspari V', 'Vezzoli P', 'Maione V', 'Misciali C', 'Sena P', 'Patrizi A', 'Offidani A', 'Quaglino P', 'Arco R', 'Caproni M', 'Rovesti M', 'Bordin G', 'Recalcati S', 'Potenza C', 'Guarneri C', 'Fabbrocini G', 'Tomasini C', 'Sorci M', 'Lombardo M', 'Gisondi P', 'Conti A', 'Casazza G', 'Peris K', 'Calzavara-Pinton P', 'Berti E', 'Italian Skin COVID-19 Network of the Italian Society of Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted Diseases']",2021,84,5,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Marzano AV, et al.

We conducted a systematic review to identify case reports and case series characterizing cutaneous manifestations of confirmed COVID-19. Key demographic and clinical data from each case were extracted and analyzed. The primary outcome measure was risk factor analysis of skin related outcomes for severe COVID-19 disease. Seventy-one case reports and series comprising 144 cases of cutaneous involvement in COVID-19 were included. The most frequently occurring morphologies were: morbilliform (30.6%), varicelliform (18.8%), urticarial (13.2%), chilblains-like (12.5%), and acro-ischemic (9%). The median age of patients was 51 years (mean: 45.9, range: 0 to 91). Patients with chilblains-like eruptions had lower frequencies of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (5/18, 27.8%, P&lt;0.05) and were less likely to have severe COVID-19 disease (2/18, 11%, 95% CI 1.4% to 34.7%, P=0.02). Patients with livedoid and acro-ischemic morphologies had severe COVID-19 more frequently than those with other morphologies (17/21, 81%, 95% CI 58.0% to 94.5%, P&lt;0.0001). The most frequently observed cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 (morbilliform, varicelliform, and urticarial) are well-described patterns of viral exanthems. However, chilblains-like, livedoid, and acro-ischemic morphologies are not traditionally associated with viral infections and were significantly associated with severity of COVID-19 disease.","['Lee DS', 'Mirmirani P', 'McCleskey PE', 'Mehrpouya M', 'Gorouhi F']",2020,26,12,Dermatol Online J,"Lee DS, et al.

33407657,Type I interferonopathies with novel compound heterozygous TREX1 mutations in two siblings with different symptoms responded to tofacitinib.,"BACKGROUND: Type I interferonopathies are a group of rare autoimmune diseases characterised by excessive activation of type I interferon that leads to disturbances in immune function. Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an important exonuclease and plays an important role in DNA damage repair. TREX1 mutations are associated with many type I interferonopathies. Studies have been published on the effectiveness of tofacitinib in the treatment of type I interferonopathies. The aim of this study is to identify the pathogenic variation in a Chinese family with type I interferonopathies and to observe the therapeutic effects of tofacitinib.
METHODS: A Chinese family with two members with type I interferonopathies was investigated. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing were applied for mutation screening using peripheral blood DNA of the patient and her family members. Sequencing results were analysed using bioinformatics software tools including VarCards and PolyPhen-2. Close clinical follow-up and observation were used to record changes in the disease before and after treatment with tofacitinib.
RESULTS: Compound heterozygous variants of TREX1 were observed in the patient's genome. One was a missense variant (NM_016381; c.C227T; p.Ala76Val) from the patient's father, and the other was a frameshift variant (NM_016381; c.458dupA; p.Gln153Glnfs*3) from the patient's mother. One of the proband's elder brothers with similar skin lesions also carried these two variants. This brother of the proband had more serious cutaneous involvement with the comorbidity of cerebral palsy. These TREX1 variants have not been reported in previous studies and are predicted to be highly pathogenic. The proband was given tofacitinib that led to a marked improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified two novel complex heterozygous variants in the TREX1 gene, which may underlie the molecular pathogenesis of the type I interferonopathies observed in members of this family. Tofacitinib could be an alternative treatment for this disease.","['Zhang S', 'Song J', 'Yang Y', 'Miao H', 'Yang L', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang X', 'Liu Y', 'Wang T']",2021,19,1,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,"Zhang S, et al.

33400417,Presentation and Management of Cutaneous Manifestations of COVID-19.,"INTRODUCTION: The spread of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has instigated a fervent race of the medical community to identify its manifestations, the patients at risk, and optimal disease management. While the COVID-19 illness is largely associated with respiratory consequences, there is increased reporting of other organ-specific disease sequelae that include the skin.
OBJECTIVE: To identify, describe, and classify the main skin manifestations of COVID-19 and associated protocols for management.
METHODS: Forty-five patients from three clinical centers in North and South America with positive COVID-19 PCR and/or serology presenting cutaneous manifestations were included in this retrospective chart review. Medical history, biopsies, dermoscopy, laboratory findings, clinical photography, and disease management were documented.
RESULTS: Seven main types of cutaneous manifestations were identified: exanthema/molbilliform, urticaria, papular/pustular/vesicular, petechiae/purpura, livedo reticularis, chilblains, and alopecia. Histopathogical analysis from skin biopsies and/or dermoscopy highlighted an inflammatory or vascular pathophysiology depending on the type of manifestation. While the first three types of COVID-19 skin manifestations preceded or coincided with other symptoms such as anosmia, fever, chills, chilblains, and livedo were found in later disease stages. All cases had a positive resolution with appropriate treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous symptoms are part of the COVID-19 disease spectrum. Early identification, diagnosis, and management through a multidisciplinary approach can facilitate safe disease resolution for patients.

33399338,Spectrum of Clinicopathologic Findings in COVID-19-induced Skin Lesions: Demonstration of Direct Viral Infection of the Endothelial Cells.,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading pandemic, secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The severity and the little knowledge that we have of the disease have made us focus mostly on the respiratory symptoms. As we bend the curve, other findings reported in association with COVID-19 become of importance for specialists to recognize. We describe the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions in the skin that can be the only symptom or the first manifestation of COVID-19 and demonstrate the origin of the virus. We collected 25 patients with skin lesions in this context. We recognized 5 types of cutaneous manifestations including acute acroischemic or chilblain-like lesions (11), purpura palpable (2), exanthemas (9), urticarial eruptions (1), and other lesions (2) that might appear with more unspecific pictures. Chilblain-like lesions were the most common form of presentation, which tend to appear as self-healing, erythematous-necrotic plaques mostly on the feet, in young patients with no systemic symptoms associated. Importantly, we visualized viral particles with electron microscopy in 5 of 13 cases analyzed. In this study, we seek to draw a picture of the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions that may appear in the skin in the context of COVID-19. Although apparently skin lesions are not correlated with disease severity, it may help in some cases to recognize and control the spread of the infection sooner.","['Garrido Ruiz MC', 'Santos-Briz Á', 'Santos-Briz Á', 'Sánchez A', 'Alonso-Riaño M', 'Burgos J', 'Medina-Miguelañez M', 'Puebla L', 'Román-Curto C', 'Roncero-Riesco M', 'Garcia R', 'Ortiz PL', 'Rodriguez-Peralto JL']",2021,45,3,Am J Surg Pathol,"Garrido Ruiz MC, et al.

33398677,Pharmacokinetic study of traditional Japanese Kampo medicine shimotsuto used to treat gynecological diseases in rats.,"Shimotsuto is a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine used to treat gynecological diseases, such as irregular menstruation, in addition to oversensitivity to cold and chilblains. Part of the pharmacological actions of shimotsuto is traditionally considered to be exerted by an improvement effect of the blood and the circulatory system. Multiple ingredients (e.g., catalpol and paeoniflorin) contained in shimotsuto have been reported to have pharmacological activities on the blood and circulatory system, and thus been considered to contribute to the pharmacological actions of shimotsuto. However, it remains unclear whether the ingredients can be absorbed into the body following oral administration of shimotsuto. The aim in the present study was to specify shimotsuto ingredient absorbed into the systemic circulation in rats. Seven candidate active ingredients (catalpol, paeoniflorin, albiflorin, ligustilide, senkyunolide A, butylphthalide, and ferulic acid) in plasma after oral administration of shimotsuto were quantified by targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. This study also performed nontargeted LC-MS/MS analysis of plasma following administration of constituent crude drugs of shimotsuto to find extensively blood-absorbed ingredients of shimotsuto. Among detected peaks in the nontargeted analysis, two peaks could be identified as bergapten and 8-debenzoylpaeoniflorin, subsequently their concentrations in shimotsuto-treated rat plasma were quantified. These pharmacokinetic studies indicated that catalpol showed the highest plasma concentration following administration of shimotsuto, followed by 8-debenzoylpaeoniflorin. This study suggests that all nine ingredients are absorbed into the blood following oral administration of shimotsuto and possibly contribute to its pharmacological action.","['Takiyama M', 'Matsumoto T', 'Sanechika S', 'Watanabe J']",2021,75,2,J Nat Med,"Takiyama M, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence of mucocutaneous findings, characterize morphologic patterns, and describe relationship to course in hospitalized adults with COVID-19.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study at 2 tertiary hospitals (Northwell Health) between May 11, 2020 and June 15, 2020.
RESULTS: Among 296 hospitalized adults with COVID-19, 35 (11.8%) had at least 1 disease-related eruption. Patterns included ulcer (13/35, 37.1%), purpura (9/35, 25.7%), necrosis (5/35, 14.3%), nonspecific erythema (4/35, 11.4%), morbilliform eruption (4/35, 11.4%), pernio-like lesions (4/35, 11.4%), and vesicles (1/35, 2.9%). Patterns also showed anatomic site specificity. A greater proportion of patients with mucocutaneous findings used mechanical ventilation (61% vs 30%), used vasopressors (77% vs 33%), initiated dialysis (31% vs 9%), had thrombosis (17% vs 11%), and had in-hospital mortality (34% vs 12%) compared with those without mucocutaneous findings. Patients with mucocutaneous disease were more likely to use mechanical ventilation (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-2.86); P < .001). Differences for other outcomes were attenuated after covariate adjustment and did not reach statistical significance.
LIMITATIONS: Skin biopsies were not performed.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can induce both a classic viral eruption and a paraviral eruption, the meaning of which in terms of pathophysiology and prognosis is very different. Some patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a papulovesicular eruption involving mainly the trunk. Those patients have active viremia, and some have developed pneumonia and died. Biopsy of the eruption revealed cytopathogenic viral effect, and thus there is a direct interaction of the virus with the skin; it is, therefore, a classic viral exanthema. Others, mainly young patients, developed chilblains of the fingers and toes 3 or 4 weeks after minor signs of COVID-19 or after contact with a diseased person. They did not develop severe COVID-19. Biopsy revealed classic findings of chilblains without cytopathogenic viral effect. Most of those patients did not develop specific antibodies. Those chilblains can be considered as paraviral. Classic viral manifestations are the consequence of a direct interaction of the skin with the virus, whereas paraviral manifestations result from the activation of the immune system. In the case of paraviral chilblains, I hypothesize that it is the innate immune system that rejects SARS-CoV-2. Chilblains are also observed in rare monogenic disorders called type 1 interferonopathies, where antiviral innate imunity is abormally activated. This would explain why these individuals do not develop specific antibodies, because they are probably naturally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection via their innate immuen system.",['Lipsker D'],2020,38,6,Clin Dermatol,Lipsker D.

There are reports of multiple groups of skin lesions presenting in different stages of this diagnosis. The most common reported groups are chilblains, vesicular eruptions, morbilliformexanthems, acute urticaria and livedo. It is unlikely that all these groups of skin lesions are distinctive of an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Chilblains of new onset, however, could possibly be a distinctive symptom of a mild/asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. It is recommended to consider an infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with these groups of skin lesions. Consider testing for SARS-CoV-2 and consult the dermatologist if needed, especially in case of chilblains, to ensure histopathological evaluation of the skin lesions to increase knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology.","['Çiftçi Z', 'Clabbers JMK', 'Galimont-Collen AFS', 'Gostyński A']",2020,164,,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,"Çiftçi Z, et al.

33315008,[Cutaneous Manifestations Associated with COVID-19: A Narrative Review].,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that has spread rapidly throughout the world. This has resulted in an urgent need to obtain information regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical manifestations. More specifically, skin manifestations, seldom reported initially, have been increasingly described.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a literature search in the PubMed database, regarding cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This article describes the clinical and histological findings of the main skin lesions observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
DISCUSSION: Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described in multiple retrospective and prospective studies, case series and case reports. The reported incidence reached 20.4%. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in terms of clinical patterns, the main ones include: erythematous/maculopapular, urticarial, papulovesicular, and purpuric/petechial eruptions, chilblain-like lesions and livedoid/acro-ischemic lesions. In the vast majority, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not fully understood, although histopathological findings and biomolecular studies can add relevant data.
CONCLUSION: The recognition of cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 is of utmost importance. They may help establishing an early diagnosis, namely in oligosymptomatic patients or when confirmatory tests are impossible to perform. Moreover, chilblain-like lesions and acro-ischemia, also seem to play an important role in terms of prognosis.","['Relvas M', 'Calvão J', 'Oliveira R', 'Cardoso JC', 'Gonçalo M']",2021,34,2,Acta Med Port,"Relvas M, et al.

33307271,Late-Onset Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome: A Characterization of Presenting Clinical Features.,"BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a genetic interferonopathy characterized by early onset of severe neurological injury with intracranial calcifications, leukoencephalopathy, and systemic inflammation. Increasingly, a spectrum of neurological dysfunction and presentation beyond the infantile period is being recognized in AGS. The aim of this study was to characterize late-infantile and juvenile-onset AGS.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-institution review of individuals with AGS who were older than one year at the time of presentation, including medical history, imaging characteristics, and suspected diagnoses at presentation.
RESULTS: Thirty-four individuals were identified, all with pathogenic variants in RNASEH2B, SAMHD1, ADAR1, or IFIH1. Most individuals had a history of developmental delay and/or systemic symptoms, such as sterile pyrexias and chilblains, followed by a prodromal period associated with increasing symptoms. This was followed by an abrupt onset of neurological decline (fulminant phase), with a median onset at 1.33 years (range 1.00 to 17.68 years). Most individuals presented with a change in gross motor skills (97.0%), typically with increased tone (78.8%). Leukodystrophy was the most common magnetic resonance imaging finding (40.0%). Calcifications were less common (12.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to characterize the presentation of late-infantile and juvenile onset AGS and its phenotypic spectrum. Late-onset AGS can present insidiously and lacks classical clinical and neuroimaging findings. Signs of early systemic dysfunction before fulminant disease onset and loss of motor symptoms were common. We strongly recommend genetic testing when there is concern for sustained inflammation of unknown origins or changes in motor skills in children older than one year.","['Piccoli C', 'Bronner N', 'Gavazzi F', 'Dubbs H', 'De Simone M', 'De Giorgis V', 'Orcesi S', 'Fazzi E', 'Galli J', 'Masnada S', 'Tonduti D', 'Varesio C', 'Vanderver A', 'Vossough A', 'Adang L']",2021,115,,Pediatr Neurol,"Piccoli C, et al.

33291622,Type I Interferon Signature in Chilblain-Like Lesions Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Contemporarily to the new SARS-CoV-2 mediated COVID-19 pandemic, a rise in patients with acral chilblain lesions has been described. They manifest late after mild disease or asymptomatic exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Their pathogenic evolution is currently unknown. In biopsies from three patients with acral partially ulcerating chilblain lesions that occurred associated to the COVID-19 pandemic, we analysed the expression of type I interferon induced proteins and signal transduction kinases. Histology demonstrated perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates and endothelial dominated MxA-staining, as well as pJAK1 activation. Our findings demonstrate induction of the type I IFN pathway in lesional sections of COVID-19-associated chilblain-like lesions. This may indicate a local antiviral immune activation status associated with preceding exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","['Aschoff R', 'Zimmermann N', 'Beissert S', 'Günther C']",2020,7,3,Dermatopathology (Basel),"Aschoff R, et al.

33278056,Skin manifestations during the COVID-19 pandemic in the pediatric emergency department.,"BACKGROUND: The role of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of chilblains in children remains a matter of debate but it is important to elucidate it for patient isolation and contact tracing. We sought to define the etiology, clinical presentation, time course, and outcomes of children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with cutaneous manifestations shortly after the first pandemic peak of COVID-19 in Spain.
METHODS: A prospective, observational study in children <15 years of age evaluated for skin lesions in the EDs of three pediatric hospitals. Children underwent a comprehensive work-up including tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serology and PCR tests for other viruses and bacteria. A 1 month follow-up visit was conducted.
RESULTS: From April 14 through May 8, 2020, we enrolled 62 children. Of those, 34 had acro-ischemic skin lesions and 28 had a variety of skin rashes. Overall, 40% of children had mild systemic symptoms. Children with chilblains were older, had pain more frequently and a more prolonged duration of skin lesions, while those with non-specific rashes had fever more frequently. Lesions were resolved in 75% of children at follow up. Five patients demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and none tested positive with PCR. Three additional patients tested positive with PCR for rhinovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of ED visits for chilblains, which are rare in pediatrics, was high soon after the first peak of COVID-19 in Spain. The disease course was self-limited, outcomes were favorable, and the possibility of viral transmission was negligible as all patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR.","['Oliva Rodríguez-Pastor S', 'Martín Pedraz L', 'Carazo Gallego B', 'Galindo Zavala R', 'Lozano Sánchez G', 'de Toro Peinado I', 'Rodriguez Benjumea M', 'Mejias A', 'Núñez Cuadros E']",2021,63,9,Pediatr Int,"Oliva Rodríguez-Pastor S, et al.

33269132,"Discoid Lupus Erythematosus: A Cross-Sectional Study From the Sindh Institute of Skin Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan.","Introduction Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is the most common form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. It is a chronic, scar-forming, photosensitive autoimmune dermatosis presenting with erythematous and scaly lesions. Predisposed areas include sun-exposed areas like the nose, forehead, and cheeks, as well as the upper body and extremities. The histological findings are typical, with interface dermatitis. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) are the most common deposits in the dermoepidermal junction of the involved skin. The most common treatments used are sunscreens, topical corticosteroids, and antimalarials. Immunosuppressive agents, thalidomide, dapsone, and retinoids can be used in refractory cases. The aim of this study was to study the clinicopathologic patterns of DLE in patients presenting to the Institute of Skin Diseases in Sindh, Karachi. Methods A total of 53 consecutive patients with DLE meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated between February 18, 2018 to March 2, 2019 at the Institute of Skin Diseases. Patients with clinical suspicion of DLE were evaluated and studied prospectively after written informed consent was obtained. Information was then collected from their medical histories, physical examination records, and laboratory investigation reports. Results A total of 53 consecutive patients with clinical and/or histological diagnosis of DLE was included in this study, out of which 75.5% (40) were females with a male to female ratio of 1:3.1. The mean age of the patients at the time of presentation was 36.02 ± 10.04 years, ranging from 14 to 65 years. More than half of the patients (35, 66.0%) were under 40 years of age and 20.8% (11) had a positive family history of DLE. DLE was localized in 36 patients (67.9%) and exposure to the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) was found to be the most frequent induced factor in 46 patients (86.8%), followed by stress which was observed in 14 patients (26.4%). The distribution of commonly affected sites were the face (81.1%), the limbs (71.7%), and the scalp (48.4%) of the patients. Serology antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive in 56.6% and serology anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies (anti-dsDNA) were positive in 45.3% of patients. Smoking, as an induced factor, was more commonly observed among male patients as compared to the female patients with a proportion of 53.8% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.001, while stress was more common among female patients with a proportion of 35% vs. 0%, p = 0.013, respectively. Histopathology with direct immunofluorescence was done in 33 cases which included cases with negative serology or where the diagnosis was in doubt clinically. The main histopathological features observed were periadnexal and perivascular dermal infiltrates, basal cells vacuolization, epidermal atrophy, hyperkeratosis, and follicular plugging. The commonest morphological form observed was the classic discoid plaque form. Conclusion Clinical patterns of DLE in our population comprises of female dominance. Exposure to UVR was the leading inducing factor. The face and limbs were the most commonly involved sites, and the majority of the patients had localized DLE with positive ANA in more than half of those patients. The importance of limiting ultraviolet radiation exposure and toxins (drugs and smoking) should be emphasized in our population.","['Ashraf E', 'Ghouse AN', 'Siddiqui S', 'Siddiqui S', 'Khan Z']",2020,12,10,Cureus,"Ashraf E, et al.

33262599,"Incidence, Characteristics, Laboratory Findings and Outcomes in Acro-Ischemia in COVID-19 Patients.","AIM: In addition to its respiratory impact of SARS-CoV2, skin lesions of probable vascular origin have been described. This study intends to quantify the incidence of acro-ischemic lesions in COVID-19 infected adult subjects in our population, describing clinical patterns and associated findings.
METHODS: All adult confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection who presented with acro-ischemic lesions and received care in our institution were prospectively enrolled up to May 15th, 2020. The variables included demographics, comorbidities, analytical parameters, clinical presentations and COVID-19 treatment.
RESULTS: We enrolled 24 patients. The overall rate of acro-ischemic findings in COVID-19 patients was 1.2% [0.6% for outpatients and 2.9% for hospitalized (ICU and non-ICU patients)], but the observed incidence for acro-ischemia in ICU patients was remarkably higher (23.0%, p<0.001). We have described four different clinical patterns of acroischemia: atypical Raynaud´s phenomenon (ARP), (4); pseudo-pernio (PP), (5); severe microcirculatory ischemia with preserved pulse (SMI), (6); and dry gangrene with arteriosclerosis obliterans (AO), (9). Kendall´s τ correlation with lung disease severity was 0.877 (95% CI, 0.756 to 0.968); p<0.01). ARP individuals were predominantly female, while SMI appeared lately in elderly hospitalized subjects with better prognosis. AO occurred in patients with more comorbidity and younger than those with SMI. We observed other associated lesions of suggestive ischemic nature in other organs in all groups (15 patients of total sample). Plasma procalcitonin was significantly higher in patients who developed SMI (median and interquartile range: 9.99 (4.2, 12.3) mg/mL vs 0.26 (0.11, 0.89) mg/mL; p<0.001), and D-dimer level at hospital admission was significantly higher in AO patients (median and interquartile range: 1166 (1050, 2111) mg/L vs 502 (448, 777) mg/L; p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The observed risk for acroischemia in COVID-19 is high in ICU patients (23%). We have described four different clinical patterns of acroischemia (ARP, PP, SMI and AO) associated with lung disease severity.

The pathophysiology of such manifestations remains largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic clinical, histologic, and biologic assessment in a cohort of patients with chilblain-like lesions occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective case series carried out with a COVID-19 multidisciplinary consultation group at the University Hospital of Nice, France, 40 consecutive patients presenting with chilblain-like lesions were included.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients underwent a thorough general and dermatologic examination, including skin biopsies, vascular investigations, biologic analyses, interferon-alpha (IFN-α) stimulation and detection, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serologic analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 40 consecutive patients with chilblain-like lesions were included. Most patients were young, with a median (range) age of 22 (12-67) years; 19 were male and 21 were female. The clinical presentation was highly reproducible with chilblain-like lesions mostly on the toes. Bullous and necrotic evolution was observed in 11 patients. Acrocyanosis or cold toes were reported in 19 (47.5%) cases. Criteria compatible with COVID-19 cases were noted in 11 (27.5%) within 6 weeks prior to the eruption. The real-time PCR (rt-PCR) testing results were negative in all cases. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 serology results were positive in 12 patients (30%). D-dimer concentration levels were elevated in 24 (60.0%) cases. Cryoglobulinemia and parvovirus B19 serologic results were negative for all tested patients. The major histologic findings were features of lymphocytic inflammation and vascular damage with thickening of venule walls and pericyte hyperplasia. A significant increase of IFN-α production after in vitro stimulation was observed in the chilblain population compared with patients with mild-severe acute COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Taken together, our results suggest that chilblain-like lesions observed during the COVID-19 pandemic represent manifestations of a viral-induced type I interferonopathy.

33232965,Skin Manifestations Associated with COVID-19: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic caused by the ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), which was isolated for the first time in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea and hypogeusia/hyposmia. Among extrapulmonary signs associated with COVID-19, dermatological manifestations have been increasingly reported in the last few months.
SUMMARY: The polymorphic nature of COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations led our group to propose a classification, which distinguishes the following six main clinical patterns: (i) urticarial rash, (ii) confluent erythematous/maculopapular/morbilliform rash, (iii) papulovesicular exanthem, (iv) chilblain-like acral pattern, (v) livedo reticularis/racemosa-like pattern, (vi) purpuric ""vasculitic"" pattern. This review summarizes the current knowledge on COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations, focusing on clinical features and therapeutic management of each category and attempting to give an overview of the hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms of these conditions.","['Genovese G', 'Moltrasio C', 'Berti E', 'Marzano AV']",2021,237,1,Dermatology,"Genovese G, et al.

33230062,Clinical manifestation and disease progression in COVID-19 infection.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly an infectious disease of the respiratory system transmitted through air droplets, and pulmonary symptoms constitute main presentations of this disease. However, COVID-19 demonstrates a clinically diverse manifestation ranging from asymptomatic presentation to critically illness with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, or multiple organ failure. Accumulating evidences demonstrated that COVID-19 has extrapulmonary involvement, including neurological, smelling sensation, cardiovascular, digestive, hepatobiliary, renal, endocrinologic, dermatologic system, and others. Over a third of COVID-19 patients manifest a wide range of neurological symptoms involving the central/peripheral nervous system. Underlying cardiovascular comorbidities were associated with detrimental outcomes, meanwhile the occurrence of cardiovascular complications correlate to poor survival. Gastrointestinal symptoms frequently occur and have been associated with a longer period of illness. Impaired hepatic functions were associated with the severity of the disease. Higher rate of acute kidney injury was reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Endocrinologic presentations of COVID-19 include exacerbating hyperglycemia, euglycemic ketosis, and diabetic ketoacidosis. The most common cutaneous manifestation was acro-cutaneous (pernio or chilblain-like) lesions, and other skin lesions consist of maculopapular rash, vesicular lesions, livedoid/necrotic lesions, exanthematous rashes, and petechiae. This review article summarized the general clinical signs and symptoms, radiologic features, and disease manifestation with progression in patients with COVID-19.","['Tsai PH', 'Lai WY', 'Lin YY', 'Luo YH', 'Lin YT', 'Chen HK', 'Chen YM', 'Lai YC', 'Kuo LC', 'Chen SD', 'Chang KJ', 'Liu CH', 'Chang SC', 'Wang FD', 'Yang YP']",2021,84,1,J Chin Med Assoc,"Tsai PH, et al.

However, it is not always easy to distinguish whether these skin manifestations are the result of a direct action of the virus on epidermal and/or dermal cell populations, represent a paraviral phenomenon or are a rather fortuitous association. In this review the principal cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 are described as well as their eventual value in terms of diagnostic aid or as prognostic factor. The palmoplantar ischemic pseudo-chilblains lesions are the most frequently observed and are useful for epidemiological purposes.

As it is a novel virus, its manifestations have been slowly revealed. Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have gradually been reported from different regions of the world. However, their significance in diagnosis, as well as predicting prognosis, remains to be established.
OBJECTIVE: This review describes the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 patients from diverse regions with the aim of highlighting any important associations.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted using ""PubMed"" for original articles, case series, and case reports using the search terms ""cutaneous manifestations"" and ""skin manifestations"" in combination with ""COVID-19"" published up to 31 May.
RESULTS: Nine original research articles and 35 case series or case reports were identified, including 458 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The ratio of male to female patients was 0.94, and the patients' age ranged from 2 months to 84 years. In 10% of cases, skin lesions appeared before systemic manifestations. The most common cutaneous manifestation was macular/maculo-papular rash (42.5%), followed by acute urticaria (17.9%), vesicular rash (15.3%), pseudo-chilblain or acral purpuric lesions (15.1), and livedo-reticularis (4.4%). The majority of reported cases were located in Spain, Italy, and France. These manifestations do not seem to be sex-, age-, or country-specific.
CONCLUSION: It is necessary to conduct worldwide registries and prospective studies to assess the true incidence of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 and to streamline their categorization based on their pathogenesis. There appears to be no specific manifestation at present, but a high index of suspicion can help in the diagnosis of patients presenting with cutaneous lesions as the first manifestation.","['Jindal R', 'Chauhan P']",2020,9,9,J Family Med Prim Care,Jindal R and Chauhan P.

33207021,Skin manifestations of COVID-19 in children: Part 3.,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The initial recognized symptoms were respiratory, sometimes culminating in severe respiratory distress requiring ventilation, and causing death in a percentage of those infected. As time has passed, other symptoms have been recognized. The initial reports of cutaneous manifestations were from Italian dermatologists, probably because Italy was the first European country to be heavily affected by the pandemic. The overall clinical presentation, course and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children differ from those in adults as do the cutaneous manifestations of childhood.

33201148,What Are COVID Toes? A Case Study.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 symptoms mimic many other common conditions, making it difficult to identify patients infected with COVID-19. Adult patients may exhibit what is called ""COVID toes"" later in their course of illness. Noteworthy is that COVID toes may be the only symptom in otherwise asymptomatic young adults and children.
CASE: We present experience with an adult female patient residing in the United States with presumed COVID-19 infection who was self-isolating with illness not severe enough to require hospitalization. COVID toes were one symptom experienced as a part of her illness. Because COVID toes are usually seen in the recovery phase of COVID-19, and often in patients with less severe cases, many providers are unfamiliar with this new symptom.
CONCLUSION: Familiarity with COVID toes will help foot care providers to identify patients who may not have been diagnosed with COVID-19 but could still be infectious and need to be isolated. COVID toe signs may be subtle and often mimic other conditions such as chilblains/pernio, thus a thorough history and physical examination are required.","['Beuscher TL', 'Andrews SE']",2020,47,6,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,Beuscher TL and Andrews SE.

Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 were included. The cutaneous manifestations can be classified into 2 types. Patients with inflammatory reactions consisted of morbilliform, varicella-like, urticarial eruptions, and vesiculobullous manifestations. These manifestations were mainly found on the trunk, limbs, and faces of patients and had mainly positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction findings (97.7%). Furthermore, there were 516 patients with acral vascular lesions: chilblains, livedo lesions, cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, and other noninflammatory purpura. These were often nonpruritic (88%) and not seen in severe disease (88.7%). The cutaneous lesions have potential for early diagnosis of COVID-19 and prevention of disease transmission. The implications of COVID-19 in the field of dermatology continue to evolve as more clinical data becomes available.","['Naderi-Azad S', 'Vender R']",2021,25,2,J Cutan Med Surg,Naderi-Azad S and Vender R.

35664813,Covid-19 dermatoses: Acral vesicular pattern evolving into bullous pemphigoid.,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) appears to be rising in incidence across the Western World, especially in the elderly. Some of the pathogenetic mechanisms involving antigen mimicry and antibody cross-reactivity have been elucidated for cases associated with neurological disease and certain drugs. There have been reports of cutaneous manifestations of Covid-19 (SARS-Cov2 infection) as the pandemic has raged across the world. We report here a case of prolonged Covid-19, symptomatic with dermatoses only, which was seen to evolve initially from a maculo-papular exanthema with acral vesicular dermatitis, into classical BP disease. This was confirmed histologically by positive skin autoantibody serology, direct IMF on peri-lesional skin and also salt-split IMF. Although possible that the development of BP could be a purely co-incidental finding during Covid-19, we suggest that it is more likely that prolonged SARS-Cov2 infection triggered an autoimmune response to the basement membrane antigens, BP 180 and 230. To our knowledge, this is the first case of BP developing during concurrent Covid-19 disease. It will be necessary to continue dermatological surveillance as the pandemic continues, to collate data on BP incidence and to test these patients for Covid-19 disease. As the pandemic continues, even potential and rare associations such as this will be clarified eventually. What's already known about this topic? Covid-19 disease has been associated with a spectrum of dermatosesCommon presentations in up to 20% of patients include exanthema, pseudo-chilblain like acral lesions 'Covid toes', livedo-/retiform purpuric/necrotic vascular lesions, acute urticarial lesions, and vesicular/varicella-like lesionsA multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children akin to Kawasaki syndrome has been described What does this study add?

Major histopathologic findings were lymphocytic eccrine inflammation and a spectrum of vasculopathic findings to include superficial and deep angiocentric-perivascular lymphocytic inflammation, lymphocytes in vessel walls (lymphocytic vasculitis), endothelial swelling, red blood cell extravasation, and focal deposits of fibrin in both vessel lumina, and vessel walls. Interface changes were observed to include vacuolopathy and apoptotic keratinocytes at the basement membrane. Immunostains showed a dominant T-cell lineage (positive for T-cell receptor beta, CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7). B-cells were rare and clusters of CD123-positive dermal plasmacytoid dendritic cells were observed surrounding eccrine clusters and some perivascular zones. The consistent perieccrine and vasculopathic features represent important pathologic findings in the diagnosis of COVID toes and are suggestive of pathogenetic mechanisms. Clinicopathologic correlation, the epidemiological backdrop, and the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic favor a viral causation and should alert the physician to initiate a workup and the appropriate use of COVID-19 testing.","['Olsen TG', 'Shrit MA', 'Feeser TA', 'Wargo JJ']",2021,43,4,Am J Dermatopathol,"Olsen TG, et al.

The variability of nasal olfactory symptoms in pediatric patients is interlinked with possible warning signs, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, ocular, or dermatological symptoms. Skin findings in patients with COVID-19 can range from petechiae to papulovesicular rashes to diffuse urticaria and can be confused with rashes of non-COVID-19 conditions. These lesions typically appear early during COVID-19 and are thought to be secondary to viral replication or circulating cytokines. Herein, we discuss two pediatric cases, presenting with skin lesions, which tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, thus, briefly reviewing current literature for similar reports and related management. Although these lesions heal spontaneously in most cases, an adequate ""targeted"" therapeutic approach can shorten the time and the discomfort of the skin disease.","['Pavone P', 'Marino S', 'Marino L', 'Cacciaguerra G', 'Guarneri C', 'Nunnari G', 'Taibi R', 'Marletta L', 'Falsaperla R']",2021,34,1,Dermatol Ther,"Pavone P, et al.

33141443,Dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19: a comprehensive systematic review.,"Recent reports have suggested that there may be dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19. We searched 12 databases for peer-reviewed or pre-print published studies until July 15, 2020, for this PRISMA-compliant review (CRD42020182050). We used the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence to facilitate data synthesis. From 86 retrieved studies, we collated data on 2,560 patients with dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19. The most common findings were chilblains/pernio-like lesion (51.5%), erythematous maculopapular rashes (13.3%), and viral exanthem (7.7%). Average pediatric age was 12.9 years (SD 3.6) and adult was 34.2 years (SD 21.8). Average latency from time of upper respiratory illness symptoms to cutaneous findings was 1.5 days (SD 2.9) in children and 7.9 days (SD 10.7) in adults, ranging from -3 to 38 days. Roughly one-tenth in both populations were otherwise asymptomatic or presented with only skin findings for the entirety of the disease course; 13.3% (pediatrics) and 5.3% (adults) presented with skin issues first. Dermatologic findings may play an important role in identifying cases early and serve as an important proxy to manage spread.

33123675,Rheumatic manifestations of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Different proportions of musculoskeletal or autoimmune manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been reported in literature. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim of assessing the prevalence of rheumatic manifestations in patients affected by COVID-19, as initial symptom or during disease course.
METHODS: A database search was run on May 18th, 2020, using two distinct strategies. We were interested in the percentage of symptoms of potential rheumatologic interest observed in large population studies of COVID-19 cases, and in identifying uncommon autoimmune disorders described in patients with COVID-19. For manifestations individually reported, a meta-analysis was performed taking into consideration the proportion of COVID-19 patients presenting the symptom.
RESULTS: Eighty eight original articles were included in the systematic review and 51 in the meta-analysis. We found pooled estimates of 19% for muscle pain and 32% for fatigue as initial symptom of COVID-19 presentation and, respectively, of 16 and 36% during the disease course. Only one article discussed arthralgia as unique symptom. Additionally, we found that vasculitis, chilblains, presence of autoantibodies commonly found in patients with rheumatic diseases, or autoimmune haematological and neurological disorders have all been reported in patients with COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our review and meta-analysis emphasises that symptoms potentially leading to rheumatologic referral are common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, COVID-19 is a new differential diagnosis to bear in mind when evaluating patients with musculoskeletal symptoms and rheumatologists might play a crucial role in identifying COVID-19 cases in early phases of the illness.","['Ciaffi J', 'Meliconi R', 'Ruscitti P', 'Berardicurti O', 'Giacomelli R', 'Ursini F']",2020,4,,BMC Rheumatol,"Ciaffi J, et al.

33075530,COVID toes: where do we stand with the current evidence?,"BACKGROUND: Numerous of cases of chilblains have been observed, mainly in young subjects with no or mild symptoms compatible with COVID-19. The pathophysiology of these lesions is still widely debated and an association with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unconfirmed.
OBJECTIVES: This paper focus on the unresolved issues about these COVID toes and in particular whether or not they are associated with COVID-19.
ARGUMENTS: The temporal link between the outbreak of chilblains and the COVID-19 pandemic is a first suggests a link between the two events. Positive anti-SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 immunostaining on skin biopsy of chilblains seem to confirm the presence of the virus in the lesions, but lack specificity and must be interpreted with caution. Conversely, RT-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology were negative in the majority of patients with chilblains. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be excluded, with relative certainty, even after accounting for possible lower immunization in mild/asymptomatic patients and for some differences in sensitivity/specificity between the tests used. Some authors hypothesize that chilblains could be the cutaneous expression of a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) response. High production of IFN-I is suggested to be associated with early viral control and may suppress antibody response. However, the absence of other cutaneous or extracutaneous symptoms as observed in other interferonopathies raises unanswered questions. To date, a direct link between chilblains and COVID-19 still seems impossible to confirm. A more indirect association due to lifestyle changes induced by lockdown is a possible explanation. Improvement of chilblains when protective measures were adopted and after lifting of lockdown, support this hypothesis.
CONCLUSION: Conflicting current evidence highlights the need for systematic and repeated testing of larger numbers of patients and the need for valid follow-up data that take into consideration epidemic curves and evolution of lockdown measures.","['Baeck M', 'Herman A']",2021,102,,Int J Infect Dis,Baeck M and Herman A.

33070314,High prevalence of cryofibrinogenemia in patients with chilblains during the COVID-19 outbreak.,"BACKGROUND: Many cutaneous manifestations have been described in possible association with the COVID-19 pandemic, including acral lesions resembling chilblains. The underlying pathomechanisms of COVID-19 chilblains are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, pathological, and laboratory findings of a series of patients who developed chilblains during the COVID-19 outbreak and to investigate the possible factors that could be involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study that included 54 patients who presented with chilblains during the highest peak in the incidence of COVID-19 in Cantabria (northern Spain). Skin biopsies were performed on 10 of these patients who presented with recent lesions. Laboratory investigations, including immunological analysis, serological studies, and the assessment of cryoproteins, were also performed.
RESULTS: Most patients presented erythematous plaques located on the toes and/or purpuric macules located on the feet. Histopathological findings were compatible with those of idiopathic chilblains. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed C3d and C4d deposits in the vessel walls in seven cases. The autoimmunity panel was negative in most of our series. Cryoprotein testing showed positive cryofibrinogen in two-thirds (66.7%) of the patients assessed. On follow-up, most patients presented almost complete resolution, although six patients required prednisone and antiaggregant drug treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows, for the first time to our knowledge, a high prevalence of cryofibrinogenemia in patients with chilblains during the COVID-19 pandemic.

33069200,Erythema Pernio-Like in Four Adolescents in the Era of the Coronavirus-2 Infection.,"BACKGROUND: Although epidemic, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection rarely affects the pediatric population. However, in the last months, an increasing number of Italian pediatricians have reported the occurrence of erythema pernio-like in children following a flu-like syndrome, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
OBJECTIVE: The study aims to report cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4 adolescents.
METHODS: Observational study reporting 4 adolescents with skin lesions, 2 weeks after the occurrence of a flu-like syndrome.
RESULTS: Fourteen days after a flu-like syndrome, adolescents exhibited skin lesions to toes and feet. These lesions were rounded, with blurred limits, with a 5-15 mm diameter, red-violaceous- bluish colored, sometimes resulting in bullous lesions in correspondence of the central or apical portion, which tended to be covered with blackish crusts after evolution. Lesions were also accompanied by pain of variable intensity and evolved within two or three weeks to self-resolution without particular sequelae. In two patients, pharyngeal and nasal swabs were negative for SARSCoV- 2 infection, at the presentation of skin lesions. After 2 months from clinical manifestations, patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: In the pediatric and adolescent population, the occurrence of an erythema pernio-like after a flu-like syndrome could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Promenzio L', 'Arcangeli F', 'Cortis E', 'Sama E', 'Longhini F']",2021,16,2,Rev Recent Clin Trials,"Promenzio L, et al.

33058134,The Cutaneous Manifestations of COVID-19: A Review of Emerging Literature.,"The initial clinical manifestations of COVID 19 in Wuhan was fever, cough and shortness of breath but early reports in Italy and Spain preceded emerging literature of skin involvement. COVID19 was first reported in December, 2019 and after several observations of cutaneous involvement in patients with the disease there was need to document such in literature. The details of the clinical presentation and the pathophysiological mechanisms of these cutaneous lesions are, however, still poorly understood. This is a review of twenty-four published scientific articles summarizing the various cutaneous features observed by the frontline health care givers involved in the management of patients with Covid-19. Maculopapular exanthem was the most common pattern reported, accounting for 44.4% of skin manifestations. The pseudo-chilblain, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid and Kawasaki-like disease patterns accounted for 18.1%, 17.6%, 12.9%, 5.1% and 1.9% respectively. Anumber of the patients (9.5%) developed skin lesions at the time of diagnosis of Covid-19 or at the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms while 75.1% developed the lesions after the onset of Covid-19 respiratory symptoms or after laboratory diagnosis of the disease had been made. There is no gainsaying that apart from the respiratory and other reported systems, Covid-19 also affects the skin. Clinicians, especially dermatologists, should therefore watch out for the already reported skin lesions and for possible yet to be discovered or reported skin lesions in patients with Covid-19. Dermatologists must bear in mind that patients presenting at skin clinics may actually be infected with Covid-19.","['Enitan AO', 'Olasode OA']",2020,37,5,West Afr J Med,Enitan AO and Olasode OA.

33055537,"An Autopsy Review: ""COVID Toes"".","""Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2"" (SARS-CoV-2) infection has variable described dermatologic manifestations. ""COVID (coronavirus disease) toes"" became a hallmark of the disease in young and largely asymptomatic patients, who may have negative test results for SARS-CoV-2. Pernio (chilblains)-like lesions are seen mostly in infected pediatric patients and are purple painful, frequently bilateral, ill-defined plaques with prominent inflammation on histological examination. In contrast to pernio-like presentation in children, critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 develop ""purple"" digits that may be sharply demarcated and may demonstrate asymmetric areas of ischemia. These 2 contrasting entities are sometimes grouped together as ""COVID toes"" due to some similarities in clinical appearance and presentation. Here, we summarize histopathologic examination from an autopsy, including the cutaneous lesions from the affected and normal contralateral toes and correlate them with systemic findings. In contrast to pernio-like lesions, the skin of the affected necrotic toes contained thrombi in vessels without prominent inflammation, suggestive of an embolic event. This is further supported by the clinical history of and autopsy findings of popliteal artery thrombus and multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Our findings suggest that critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 have different pathological processes affecting skin at peripheral sites (ie, fingers, toes, ears, and nose), which may be due to thromboembolic events. The skin is a mirror of the body and skin pathology may shed light into overall pathogenesis of systemic illness and processes.","['Yilmaz MM', 'Szabolcs MJ', 'Geskin LJ', 'Niedt GW']",2021,43,8,Am J Dermatopathol,"Yilmaz MM, et al.

33053817,Skin Manifestations in COVID-19: Prevalence and Relationship with Disease Severity.,"BACKGROUND: Data on the clinical patterns and histopathology of SARS-CoV-2 related skin lesions, as well as on their relationship with the severity of COVID-19 are limited.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from 1 April to 1 May 2020. Clinical, microbiological and therapeutic characteristics, clinicopathological patterns of skin lesions, and direct immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical findings in skin biopsies were analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight out of the 2761 patients (2.1%) either consulting to the emergency room or admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 suspicion during the study period presented COVID-19 related skin lesions. Cutaneous lesions could be categorized into six patterns represented by the acronym ""GROUCH"": Generalized maculo-papular (20.7%), Grover's disease and other papulo-vesicular eruptions (13.8%), livedo Reticularis (6.9%), Other eruptions (22.4%), Urticarial (6.9%), and CHilblain-like (29.3%). Skin biopsies were performed in 72.4%, including direct immunofluorescence in 71.4% and immunohistochemistry in 28.6%. Patients with chilblain-like lesions exhibited a characteristic histology and were significantly younger and presented lower rates of systemic symptoms, radiological lung infiltrates and analytical abnormalities, and hospital and ICU admission compared to the rest of patients.
CONCLUSION: Cutaneous lesions in patients with COVID-19 appear to be relatively rare and varied. Patients with chilblain-like lesions have a characteristic clinicopathological pattern and a less severe presentation of COVID-19.","['Giavedoni P', 'Podlipnik S', 'Pericàs JM', 'Fuertes de Vega I', 'García-Herrera A', 'Alós L', 'Carrera C', 'Andreu-Febrer C', 'Sanz-Beltran J', 'Riquelme-Mc Loughlin C', 'Riera-Monroig J', 'Combalia A', 'Bosch-Amate X', 'Morgado-Carrasco D', 'Pigem R', 'Toll-Abelló A', 'Martí-Martí I', 'Rizo-Potau D', 'Serra-García L', 'Alamon-Reig F', 'Iranzo P', 'Almuedo-Riera A', 'Muñoz J', 'Puig S', 'Mascaró JM']",2020,9,10,J Clin Med,"Giavedoni P, et al.

32975345,No SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in 25 patients with pseudo-chilblains.,"Chilblain-like acral lesions have been identified in some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. It has been suggested that these pseudo-chilblains could be a specific marker of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Most patients with these lesions have had negative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), but some authors believe serology tests are likely to give positive results. We designed a prospective study including all patients with pseudo-chilblains treated in outpatient department in April and May 2020 and then performed SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology tests on all available patients. We evaluated 59 patients, of whom 17 had undergone PCR before the study period, all with negative results. For the present study, we performed 20 additional PCRs, serology tests in 25 patients, and a parvovirus B19 antibody test in 15 patients. All results were negative. Our findings counter the hypothesis that serology is likely to reveal SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pseudo-chilblains. One hypothesis for our negative results is that the time period between symptom onset and antibody production is longer in these patients; another is that the lesions are caused by behavioral changes during lockdown rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection. We nevertheless maintain that COVID-19 should be ruled out in people presenting with chilblain-like lesions.","['Docampo-Simón A', 'Sánchez-Pujol MJ', 'Gimeno-Gascon A', 'Palazón-Cabanes JC', 'Juan-Carpena G', 'Vergara-De Caso E', 'González-Villanueva I', 'Blanes-Martínez M', 'Betlloch-Mas I']",2020,33,6,Dermatol Ther,"Docampo-Simón A, et al.

32970840,Skin manifestations in patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 disease: a cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations have been recently described and classified in five different clinical patterns, including acral erythema-edema (pseudo-chilblain), maculopapular exanthemas, vesicular eruptions, urticarial lesions, and livedo or necrosis.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the skin of hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 disease and describe the real prevalence of skin manifestations.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study, which included hospitalized patients in Cruces University Hospital from April 14-30, 2020, with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (with polymerase chain reaction and/or serology tests), was conducted. Entire body surface examination was performed by experienced dermatologists to search for cutaneous manifestations related to COVID-19 disease.
RESULTS: From a sample of 75 patients, 14 (18.7%) developed cutaneous manifestations possibly related to COVID-19. We found six patients with acral erythema-edema (pseudo-chilblain) (42.8%), four patients with maculopapular exanthemas (28.6%), two patients with urticarial lesions (14.3%), one patient with livedo reticularis-like lesions (7.15%), and one patient with vesicular eruption (7.15%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a more plausible relationship between the main cutaneous patterns and COVID-19 in hospitalized patients as all of them had a confirmatory laboratory test. Skin manifestations are frequent but mild with spontaneous resolution. These findings are nonspecific and can be similar to other viral infections and adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients.","['Méndez Maestro I', 'Peña Merino L', 'Udondo González Del Tánago B', 'Aramburu González A', 'Orbea Sopeña A', 'Sánchez De Vicente J', 'Ratón Nieto JA', 'Acebo Mariñas E', 'Gardeazabal García J']",2020,59,11,Int J Dermatol,"Méndez Maestro I, et al.

32954488,Covid-19 pandemic and the skin.,"In the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, skin manifestations, if present, were not paid enough attention. Then, the focus moved toward the impact of the prolonged use of personal protective measures in both healthcare workers and patients. In the meantime, attention is increasingly paid to dermatology as a result of the concern for certain groups of dermatologic patients, including those whose condition may worsen by the thorough disinfection measures and those treated with immunosuppressants or immunomodulators. Following patients with psoriasis on biological therapy, as well as other inflammatory and autoimmune cutaneous disorders such as atopic dermatitis, pemphigus, pemphigoid diseases, and skin cancer provoked the interest of dermatologists. Finally, an intriguing question to the dermatologic society was whether skin changes during COVID-19 infection exist and what could be their diagnostic or prognostic value. Here, we summarize skin conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, patient information, and expert recommendations and give an overview about the registries launched to document skin changes during COVID-19, as well as details about certain patient groups infected with SARS-CoV-2, for example, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and autoimmune bullous diseases.","['Drenovska K', 'Schmidt E', 'Vassileva S']",2020,59,11,Int J Dermatol,"Drenovska K, et al.

32949449,Management of pernio-like cutaneous manifestations in children during the outbreak of COVID-19.,"During the outbreak of COVID-19 many pernio-like lesions have been increasingly reported. The aim of the study is to describe our management of these skin manifestations and to evaluate a possible correlation to SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory tests to detect a possible underlying connective disease and also to specific SARS-CoV-2 investigations such as oropharyngeal swab and IgG-IgM serology. Nine patients aged between 5 and 15 years old were evaluated. Skin lesions observed were purplish, erythematous and oedematous, in some cases painful and itchy. Six out of nine had respiratory and systemic symptoms (cough, nasal congestion, chills, fever, and asthenia) that preceded cutaneous findings of approximately 2 weeks. Concerning blood exams, three out of nine had D-dimer weakly increased, four had ANA positivity: two with a title 1:160, one with 1:320, and one with 1:5120 and a speckled pattern. The latter patient had also ENA SS-A positive and RF positivity, confirmed at a second check, so as to allow us to make a diagnosis of connective tissue disease. Four out of nine had aPL positivity (IgM). Reactants acute phase were all negative. Oropharyngeal swabs and serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (borderline in one patient for IgM). No treatment was needed. Even if we do not have enough data to prove it, we hypothesize a correlation between pernio-like lesions and SARS-CoV-2 infection for an increased number of these lesions described during the pandemic and also because such manifestations appeared when temperatures were mild and patients were at home in isolation for the lockdown. Many questions remain open about interaction host-virus.","['Gallizzi R', 'Sutera D', 'Spagnolo A', 'Bagnato AM', 'Cannavò SP', 'Grasso L', 'Guarneri C', 'Nunnari G', 'Mazza F', 'Pajno GB']",2020,33,6,Dermatol Ther,"Gallizzi R, et al.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A detailed literature search was done in PubMed and Embase from December 1, 2019, till May 1, 2020. Studies reporting cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients were included. Irrespective of the heterogeneity of data, a random effects model with inverse-variance approach was used for pooling the prevalence using meta package in R version 3.6.2.
RESULTS: Out of 15,143 articles, 2086 articles were selected for full-text read. Forty-three articles were selected for qualitative analysis, of which 10 articles (N = 1682) were included for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of overall cutaneous lesions was 5.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.87-15.98; I
CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 was 5.69%. Other manifestations were urticaria, chilblain-like lesions, livedo reticularis, and finger/toe gangrene. Although it is premature to conclude the prevalence of the cutaneous manifestations during this ongoing pandemic, our report may be a stimulating factor for the physicians to perform further vigilant streamlined reporting of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients to estimate the final prevalence.","['Rajan M B', 'Kumar-M P', 'Bhardwaj A']",2020,59,11,Int J Dermatol,"Rajan M B, et al.

32914775,[Acro-ischemic injuries in children-adolescents during CoViD-19 pandemic: from lifestyle changes due to lockdown to interferone.].,"At the end of March 2020, just over a month after the first ascertained case of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, the first reports of acute lesions of acro-ischemia appeared, especially in pre-adolescents and adolescents. These manifestations have been called in the course of these months in various ways, from ""acro-ischemia acuta"", ""erythema pernio"", ""chilblains"", up to characterize them more recently as ""CoViD Toes"". Clinical manifestations do not usually associate with other typical symptoms of Covid-19 and do not find a classical and defined serological antibody response (IgG and IgM). From a clinical point of view it is a localized and self-resolving problem of an interesting and relatively new pathogenetic model of disease in relation to a viral agent. Future studies must make us understand if there is in this specific condition a low viral load is not detectable by current methods and if this explains the inability to produce an adequate immune response for CoViD-19. It is important to determine whether the interferon immune response in some subjects can be the cause of both the low viremia and the endothelial damage so localized in the acral-site, as happens in other models of diseases (chilblain-lupus like). On the contrary, some authors believe that the acral lesions are attributable to chilblains caused by a series of favourable environmental conditions due to forced enclosure. We report the descriptive experience of 14 cases of acro-ischemia in children and adolescents observed in the territorial area of Ravenna and Rimini. The cases were subjected to the nasopharyngeal swab and to the search for antibodies with ELISA method for CoViD-19 both with negative results.","['Marchetti F', 'Guiducci C', 'Bigucci B', 'Iacono A', 'Calderoni O', 'Sorci MR', 'Sparacino M', 'Semprini S', 'Vergine G']",2020,111,9,Recenti Prog Med,"Marchetti F, et al.

32901377,Acral lesions in a pediatric population during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case series of 36 patients from a single hospital in Spain.,"BACKGROUND: To describe the cutaneous acral findings in a pediatric population noticed during this pandemic.
METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was performed collecting data on 36 patients under 14 years old, presenting suspicious acral skin manifestations for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
RESULTS: Patients were mostly male (63.8%). The mean age was 11.11 years. 66.67% of patients showed erythematous papules, and 44.44% purpuric macules. Feet were affected in 97.22% of patients and hands in 5.55%. Lesions were asymptomatic in 50% of patients. 30.55% of patients showed extracutaneous findings, preceding skin lesions in 12.62 days. Seven patients underwent specific severe acute coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing; all of these patients tested negative.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between these symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. We recommend using these manifestations as a sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. This could lead to the examination of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic children so that contagions may be avoided.","['Rosés-Gibert P', 'Gimeno Castillo J', 'Saenz Aguirre A', 'De la Torre Gomar FJ', 'Carnero González L', 'Martinez de Lagrán Alvarez de Arcaya Z', 'Gonzalez-Perez R']",2020,16,6,World J Pediatr,"Rosés-Gibert P, et al.

32895985,Discordant anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RNA staining in cutaneous perniotic lesions suggests endothelial deposition of cleaved spike protein.,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown the presence of immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) in endothelial cells and eccrine epithelium of acral perniosis classified as ""COVID toes."" Yet, other studies have been unable to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in skin biopsies of ""COVID toes"" by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing.
OBJECTIVE: In order to address these apparently conflicting findings, we compared detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP, through RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) vs immunohistochemistry (IHC), in skin biopsies of acral perniotic lesions presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: Three of six cases showed positive immunohistochemical labeling of endothelial cells, with one of three cases with sufficient depth also having labeling of eccrine glands, using an anti-SP SARS-CoV-2 antibody. These three cases positive with IHC were negative for SP by RNA ISH.
CONCLUSION: While the gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissue sections has yet to be determined, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP alone without spike RNA suggests that cleaved SP may be present in cutaneous endothelial cells and eccrine epithelium, providing a potential pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19 endotheliitis.","['Ko CJ', 'Harigopal M', 'Gehlhausen JR', 'Bosenberg M', 'McNiff JM', 'Damsky W']",2021,48,1,J Cutan Pathol,"Ko CJ, et al.

32865778,Cutaneous Manifestations of COVID-19: An Evidence-Based Review.,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected 18 million people and killed over 690,000 patients. Although this virus primarily causes respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of cutaneous manifestations associated with this disease have been reported.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to collate and categorize the dermatologic findings reported in patients with COVID-19 and identify specific lesions that may facilitate diagnosis and prognostication.
METHODS: An evidence-based review of the PubMed database was conducted on 14 May, 2020 using the search terms ""Covid-19 skin,"" ""Covid-19 rash,"" ""Covid-19 exanthem,"" and ""Covid-19 chilblains."" Peer-reviewed publications containing original COVID-19 patient cases and a discussion of the associated cutaneous findings were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: The literature search identified 115 records, of which 34 publications describing 996 patients with dermatologic conditions were included. Case reports (n = 15), case series (n = 13), and observational prospective studies (n = 4) were the most common publication types. Acral lesions resembling pseudo-chilblains were the most frequent lesion identified (40.4% of cases), appearing in young adults (mean age, 23.2 years) after the onset of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (55/100 patients). Erythematous maculopapular rashes affected 21.3% of patients, most frequently impacting middle-aged adults (mean age, 53.2 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (110/187 patients). Vesicular rashes affected 13.0% of patients, appearing in middle-aged adults (mean age, 48.3 years) after the onset of other symptoms (52/84 patients). Urticarial rashes affected 10.9% of patients, appearing in adults (mean age, 38.3 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (46/78 patients). Vascular rashes resembling livedo or purpura were uncommon (4% of cases), appearing in elderly patients (mean age, 77.5 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (18/29 patients). Erythema multiforme-like eruptions, although infrequent (3.7% of cases), affected mostly children (mean age, 12.2 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Vesicular rashes may suggest an initial diagnosis of COVID-19, acral lesions may be most appropriate for epidemiological uses, and vascular rashes may be a useful prognostic marker for severe disease. As a potential correlate to disease severity, prognosis, or infectibility, it is critical that all healthcare professionals be well versed in these increasingly common cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.","['Daneshgaran G', 'Dubin DP', 'Gould DJ']",2020,21,5,Am J Clin Dermatol,"Daneshgaran G, et al.

32844512,Do we have serological evidences that chilblain-like lesions are related to SARS-CoV-2? A review of the literature.,"The outbreak of chilblain-like lesions (CLL) coincidentally to the COVID-19 pandemic is a topic of great concern. SARS-CoV-2 was initially hypothesized as the etiologic agent of CLL, but, since nasopharyngeal swabs seldom resulted positive, dermatologists' attention focused on the search for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Many papers were published contemporarily on this topic, reporting limited case series. We reviewed the English literature up to the first July 2020 and, excluding single case reports, we considered 13 studies that serologically investigated 220 patients. The presence of specific antibodies was detected in 18 subjects (8.2%): isolated IgA were found in 6 patients, IgA and IgG in 1, isolated IgG in 5, and IgM in 2. In 4 patients, isotypes were not specified. Our review demonstrated a high prevalence of negative serological results in CLL: antibodies were observed only in a few patients, that are even less excluding those with positive IgA, not clearly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. In conclusion, although it is still uncertain whether CLL are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients affected by CLL seem not to be prone to shedding the virus, hence, if they are asymptomatic, we can reassure them, thus avoiding hospital referral.","['Balestri R', 'Magnano M', 'Rizzoli L', 'Rech G']",2020,33,6,Dermatol Ther,"Balestri R, et al.

We examined the histological features of 30 skin biopsies from two groups of patients: Ten specimens of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with an active systemic infection and associated dermatosis. Twenty specimens were from patients not considered COVID-positive (due to PCR swab negativity or not tested at all) with cutaneous lesions either showing viral infection symptoms (fever, cough, ageusia and severe immunocompromised condition due to HIV infection and malignancies), or presented a high risk of being infected (such as cohabitation with COVID-19 positive parents and siblings with simultaneous chilblains). This study analyses the histological and immunohistochemical (SARS-CoV-2 2019-nCoV nucleocapsid antibody) characteristics of the two groups and identifies 4 histopathological patterns. The histopathological features of the two groups present similar features that may help to identify an ongoing COVID-19 infection even in asymptomatic carriers with dermatosis.","['Gianotti R', 'Coggi A', 'Boggio F', 'Fellegara G']",2020,100,15,Acta Derm Venereol,"Gianotti R, et al.

32779733,The differing pathophysiologies that underlie COVID-19-associated perniosis and thrombotic retiform purpura: a case series.,"BACKGROUND: There are two distinctive acral manifestations of COVID-19 embodying disparate clinical phenotypes. One is perniosis occurring in mildly symptomatic patients, typically children and young adults; the second is the thrombotic retiform purpura of critically ill adults with COVID-19.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical and pathological profiles of these two different cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.
METHODS: We compared the light microscopic, phenotypic, cytokine and SARS-CoV-2 protein and RNA profiles of COVID-19-associated perniosis with that of thrombotic retiform purpura in critical patients with COVID-19.
RESULTS: Biopsies of COVID-19-associated perniosis exhibited vasocentric and eccrinotropic T-cell- and monocyte-derived CD11c
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-associated perniosis represents a virally triggered exaggerated immune reaction with significant type I interferon signaling. This is important to SARS-CoV-2 eradication and has implications in regards to a more generalized highly inflammatory response. We hypothesize that in the thrombotic retiform purpura of critically ill patients with COVID-19, the vascular thrombosis in the skin and other organ systems is associated with a minimal interferon response. This allows excessive viral replication with release of viral proteins that localize to extrapulmonary endothelium and trigger extensive complement activation.","['Magro CM', 'Mulvey JJ', 'Laurence J', 'Sanders S', 'Crowson AN', 'Grossman M', 'Harp J', 'Nuovo G']",2021,184,1,Br J Dermatol,"Magro CM, et al.

32773409,Coronavirus disease 2019 in children: Clinical & epidemiological implications.,"Despite the global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there are limited data emerging in children. This review provides an update on clinical features, diagnosis, epidemiology, management and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. Specific characteristics noted in children and their implications in disease management as well as transmission control are highlighted. Besides respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal and atypical features such as chilblains, neurological symptoms and multisystem inflammation are also reported. Younger infants and those with comorbidity were found to be at risk of severe illness. Infected pregnant women and neonates were reported to have good prognosis. It is possible to manage the children with mild disease at home, with strict infection prevention control measures; severely affected require respiratory support and intensive care management. There are anecdotal reports of using antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs, benefit of which needs to be confirmed in clinical trials. A significant percentage of asymptomatic infection in children has epidemiological implication as these may act as links in transmission chain in the community. There is a need for systematic data on extra-pulmonary manifestations and atypical features, risk factors of severity, role of imaging and biomarkers, testing and management strategies and trials with antivirals and immunomodulatory drugs in children. The psychosocial effects of quarantine, closure of schools, lack of play activities and impact of lockdown need to be addressed. Understanding the biological basis for the profound age-dependent differential outcome of COVID-19 infection is important. Elucidating the protective mechanisms in children may aid in developing novel treatment strategies.","['Kuttiatt VS', 'Abraham PR', 'Menon RP', 'Vaidya PC', 'Rahi M']",2020,152,1 & 2,Indian J Med Res,"Kuttiatt VS, et al.

32745281,Perniosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: Negative anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry in six patients and comparison to perniosis before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.,"BACKGROUND: Acral inflammatory lesions that have some resemblance to idiopathic or autoimmune-associated perniosis (chilblains) have been described in multiple countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We examined histopathologic findings in six consecutive such cases from five patients received in mid-May to mid-June of 2020, evaluating immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. We compared these six cases to eight cases diagnosed as perniosis between January and June of 2019.
RESULTS: Five of six lesions with perniosis-like histopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic had distinctive tight cuffing of lymphocytes; intravascular material was present in one case. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemical staining using an antibody directed at the nucleocapsid protein was negative in all six cases. Only one of eight specimens with microscopic findings of perniosis received prior to the COVID-19 pandemic had tightly cuffed perivascular lymphocytes, and none had obvious intravascular occlusion.
CONCLUSIONS: A tightly cuffed pattern of perivascular lymphocytes is a feature of perniosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. The absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in these cases suggests against the virus being directly present in these lesions.","['Ko CJ', 'Harigopal M', 'Damsky W', 'Gehlhausen JR', 'Bosenberg M', 'Patrignelli R', 'McNiff JM']",2020,47,11,J Cutan Pathol,"Ko CJ, et al.

32745249,Five common skin manifestations of COVID-19 identified.,"COVID-19, also called coronavirus, is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. First identified in December 2019, in March 2020 it was announced by the World Health Organisation that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic. The disease can affect different organ systems, and early reports have suggested skin symptoms. The researchers, working with dermatologists across Spain, reviewed 375 patients with suspected, or confirmed, COVID-19, with the aim of developing a detailed classification of the different types of skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 with corresponding images. An initial 120 images were reviewed by four dermatologists, without knowing any other clinical information, and they identified patterns of symptoms associated with COVID-19. These patterns were then applied to the rest of the images and further refined. Five common skin symptoms were identified this way. These symptoms are chilblain-like lesions, outbreaks of small blisters, wheals, rashes comprised of small flat and raised red bumps, and livedo and necrosis. Livedo is a skin condition where circulation is impaired within the blood vessels of the skin, necrosis refers to the premature death of skin tissue. These symptoms are associated with different severity of COVID-19 infection, from less severe disease in the chilblain-like lesions, to most severe in patients with livedo. The researchers noted that some of the skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 are common and can have many causes, particularly wheals and rashes. As such, they may not be particularly helpful as an aide to diagnosis.",[],2020,183,1,Br J Dermatol,(None). Five common skin manifestations of COVID-19 identified.

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has been purportedly linked to multiple cutaneous manifestations, among them chilblain-like skin lesions, also known as ""COVID toes."" Driven in large part by social media, dermatologists around the world reported a dramatic increase in the frequency of chilblain-like diagnoses early in the COVID-19 pandemic, often in members of the same family. This phenomenon has been captured in a rapidly expanding medical literature. As of this writing, the chilblain-like presentation has been reported to occur predominantly in younger, minimally symptomatic patients and to emerge late in the COVID-19 disease course. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not consistently found when these patients are evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. A robust antiviral immune response in young patients that induces microangiopathic changes has been posited as a mechanism.

32731141,Dermatologic manifestations and complications of COVID-19.,"UNLABELLED: The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While much of the focus has been on the cardiac and pulmonary complications, there are several important dermatologic components that clinicians must be aware of.
OBJECTIVE: This brief report summarizes the dermatologic manifestations and complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on Emergency Medicine clinicians.
DISCUSSION: Dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly recognized within the literature. The primary etiologies include vasculitis versus direct viral involvement. There are several types of skin findings described in association with COVID-19. These include maculopapular rashes, urticaria, vesicles, petechiae, purpura, chilblains, livedo racemosa, and distal limb ischemia. While most of these dermatologic findings are self-resolving, they can help increase one's suspicion for COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: It is important to be aware of the dermatologic manifestations and complications of COVID-19. Knowledge of the components is important to help identify potential COVID-19 patients and properly treat complications.","['Gottlieb M', 'Long B']",2020,38,9,Am J Emerg Med,Gottlieb M and Long B.

We had the opportunity to examine the clinical and histopathological features of several patients who were divided into 3 groups. The first group included 8 COVID-19-positive patients who were hospitalized and quarantined at home. The second group included children and young adults who presented with chilblain erythema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria-like lesions. This group of patients was negative for the COVID-19 gene sequences by polymerase chain reaction but had a high risk of COVID-19 infection. The third group included clinically heterogeneous and challenging lesions. These patients were not subject to either polymerase chain reaction tests or serological analyses because they sought dermatological attention only for a dermatosis. The histopathological analysis of these cases showed a wide spectrum of histopathological patterns. What appears to be constant in all skin biopsies was the presence of prominent dilated blood vessels with a swollen endothelial layer, vessels engulfed with red blood cells, and perivascular infiltrates, consisting mainly of cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes and eosinophils. In 2 cases, there was diffuse coagulopathy in the cutaneous vascular plexus. In the early phases of the disease, there were numerous collections of Langerhans cells in the epidermis after being activated by the virus. The presence of urticarial lesions, chilblains, targetoid lesions (erythema multiforme-like lesions), exanthema, maculohemorrhagic rash, or chickenpox-like lesions associated with the histopathological features mentioned previously should cause clinical dermatologists to suspect the possibility of COVID-19 infection, especially in patients with fever and cough.","['Gianotti R', 'Recalcati S', 'Fantini F', 'Riva C', 'Milani M', 'Dainese E', 'Boggio F']",2020,42,8,Am J Dermatopathol,"Gianotti R, et al.

32628270,Most chilblains observed during the COVID-19 outbreak occur in patients who are negative for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction and serology testing.,"BACKGROUND: Acral lesions, mainly chilblains, are the most frequently reported cutaneous lesions associated with COVID-19. In more than 80% of patients tested, nasopharyngeal swabs were negative on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 when performed, and serology was generally not performed.
METHODS: A national survey was launched on 30 March 2020 by the French Society of Dermatology asking physicians to report cases of skin manifestations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 by using a standardized questionnaire. We report the results for acral manifestations.
RESULTS: We collected 311 cases of acral manifestations [58.5% women, median age 25.7 years (range 18-39)]. The most frequent clinical presentation (65%) was typical chilblains. In total, 93 cases (30%) showed clinical suspicion of COVID-19, 67 (22%) had only less specific infectious symptoms and 151 (49%) had no clinical signs preceding or during the course of acral lesions. Histology of skin biopsies was consistent with chilblains. Overall, 12 patients showed significant immunological abnormalities. Of the 150 (48%) patients who were tested, 10 patients were positive. Seven of 121 (6%) RT-PCR-tested patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and five of 75 (7%) serology-tested patients had IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. Tested/untested patients or those with/without confirmed COVID-19 did not differ in age, sex, history or acral lesion clinical characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey do not rule out that SARS-CoV-2 could be directly responsible for some cases of chilblains, but we found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the large majority of patients with acral lesions during the COVID-19 lockdown period in France. What is already known about this topic? About 1000 cases of acral lesions, mainly chilblains, were reported during the COVID-19 outbreak. Chilblains were reported to occur in young people within 2 weeks of infectious signs, which were mild when present. Most cases did not have COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and few serology results were available. What does this study add? Among 311 patients with acral lesions, mainly chilblains, during the COVID-19 lockdown period in France, the majority of patients tested had no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, 70 of 75 patients were seronegative for SARS-Cov-2 serology and 114 of 121 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.","['Le Cleach L', 'Dousset L', 'Assier H', 'Fourati S', 'Barbarot S', 'Boulard C', 'Bourseau Quetier C', 'Cambon L', 'Cazanave C', 'Colin A', 'Kostrzewa E', 'Lesort C', 'Levy Roy A', 'Lombart F', 'Marco-Bonnet J', 'Monfort JB', 'Samimi M', 'Tardieu M', 'Wolkenstein P', 'Sbidian E', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'French Society of Dermatology']",2020,183,5,Br J Dermatol,"Le Cleach L, et al.

Acral ischemic findings present with a hypercoagulable state in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Pathologically confirmed varicella-like exanthem and perniosis COVID-19 cases have correlated with paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic patients in previous reports. We present the second case of biopsy-proven COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains (pernio) in a paucisymptomatic patient with a brisk perieccrine lymphocytic response. Based on an antecedent pathological study, we know coronavirus particles have been seen in the eccrine gland associated with a brisk peri-inflammatory response. The prominent perieccrine inflammation is helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. Currently, nonischemic pathological findings correlate with a good prognosis based on the paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic nature of their disease courses. Patients presenting with suspected COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains who are paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic should be isolated and immediately tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (as there is a delay in diagnosis based on the poor sensitivity of the current rapid test). We continue to stress the importance of early diagnosis and quarantining to prevent spread to the older and immunocompromised patients.","['Wargo JJ', 'Weir NM', 'Shamma HN']",2021,43,2,Am J Dermatopathol,"Wargo JJ, et al.

32608380,Clinical and Histopathological Features and Potential Pathological Mechanisms of Skin Lesions in COVID-19: Review of the Literature.,"In recent weeks, several reports have emerged of skin lesions with different clinical presentations in COVID-19 cases. All dermatologists should be aware of these cutaneous lesions, which may be early clinical symptoms of infection. We reviewed the literature on cutaneous manifestations in the PubMed database from December 2019 and June 2020. From the cases described as case reports or series in 57 recent articles, it appears that skin lesions (i) are highly varied, (ii) may not be related to the severity of the condition and (iii) resolve spontaneously in a few days. The frequency of these lesions in COVID-19 patients varies between 1.8% and 20.4%. The major clinical forms described were maculopapular eruptions, acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (pseudochilblain), urticarial lesions, other vesicular eruptions and livedo or necrosis. The lesions were mainly localized in the trunk and extremities. The majority of patients were male, aged between 4.5 and 89 years. A minority of the patients were children presenting with acral, chilblain-like lesions, papulo-vesicular eruptions or Kawasaki disease-like pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome. The mean duration of the lesions was a few days, but some lasting as little as 20 min and others as long as four weeks have been reported. The mean latency time in the majority of cases was between 1 and 14 days; however, in some patients, lesions appeared 2 to 5 days before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The histopathological features of these lesions also vary, corresponding to the diversity of clinical manifestations. These features underline the nature of epidermal and dermal vascular lesions-and in severe cases, microvascular injury and thrombosis-associated with COVID-19, and provide important clues to their pathological mechanisms.","['Kaya G', 'Kaya A', 'Saurat JH']",2020,7,1,Dermatopathology (Basel),"Kaya G, et al.

32599968,COVID-19 and dermatology.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Sars-CoV-2 virus infection (COVID-19) was observed in China in the last months of 2019. In the period following, this infection spread all over the world. In March 2020 the World Health Organization announced the existence of a pandemic. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate skin diseases associated with COVID-19 under three main headings: skin problems related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, and skin findings due to COVID-19 treatment agents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In PubMed, Google Scholar databases, skin lesions related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections and skin findings due to COVID-19 treatment agents subjects are searched in detail.
RESULTS: Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itching, pressure urticaria, exacerbation of preexisting skin diseases, and new skin lesion occurrence/new skin disease occurrence may be due to personal protective equipment. Skin problems related to personal hygiene measures could include itching, dryness, and contact dermatitis. Skin findings may also be observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. The incidence of skin lesions due to COVID-19 was reported to be between 0.2% and 29%. Many skin lesions including maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain-like, thrombotic/ischemic, etc. are observed in COVID-19 patients. Some authors have stated that there is an absence of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection-specific skin findings. However, in asymptomatic or presymptomatic COVID-19 patients in particular, skin lesions can lead to the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, skin lesions may occur due to COVID-19 treatment agents.
CONCLUSION: Many skin lesions may appear as a result of COVID-19. Even in the absence of a COVID-19 diagnosis, skin findings should be evaluated carefully in this pandemic period.",['Gül Ü'],2020,50,8,Turk J Med Sci,Gül Ü. COVID-19 and dermatology.

Totally, 44 articles met the inclusion criteria. A total of 507 patients with cutaneous manifestations were summarized, and 96.25% patients were from Europe. The average age of the patients was 49.03 (range: 5-91) with a female ratio of 60.44%. The skin lesions were polymorphic, and erythema, chilblain-like and urticarial lesions were most common, occurring on an average of 9.92 days (range: 1-30) after the onset of systemic symptoms. The receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, was found to be expressed on skin, mainly on keratinocytes. Our review systematically presented the clinical characteristics of 507 patients and showed that skin might be the potential target of the infection according to ACE2 expression. More work should be done to better understand the underlying pathogenesis.","['Zhao Q', 'Fang X', 'Pang Z', 'Zhang B', 'Liu H', 'Zhang F']",2020,34,11,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Zhao Q, et al.

32585074,Cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a clinical update.,"On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus). A consistent number of case reports and clinical series have been already published describing a complex spectrum of skin manifestations associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We carried out a review of the English-language literature up to 20 May 2020, reporting original cases or case series of the cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The following databases were consulted: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and ResearchGate. The search of papers was conducted by using the key term 'COVID-19' or 'SARS-CoV-2' or 'coronavirus' combined with each of the following: 'skin', 'cutaneous', 'dermatologic' or 'dermatology', 'manifestation', 'lesions', or 'rash'. The patterns of dermatological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be classified into four categories: exanthema (varicella-like, papulo-vesicular and morbilliform rash), vascular (chilblain-like, purpuric/petechial and livedoid lesions), urticarial and acro-papular eruption. Lastly, other skin manifestations to be considered are the cutaneous adverse reactions to the drugs prescribed for the treatment of COVID-19. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can directly cause a worsening of chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis remains to be determined. Dermatology's outlook in the COVID-19 pandemic is multidimensional.","['Gisondi P', 'PIaserico S', 'Bordin C', 'Alaibac M', 'Girolomoni G', 'Naldi L']",2020,34,11,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Gisondi P, et al.

32584377,Evaluation of Chilblains as a Manifestation of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"IMPORTANCE: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several cases of chilblains have been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if chilblains are associated with COVID-19.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This monocentric case series was conducted at the Department of Dermatology at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, a tertiary care hospital in Brussels, Belgium, between April 10 and April 17, 2020. We evaluated a total of 31 referred patients who had recently developed chilblains.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs for all patients and in skin biopsy specimens for 22 patients. Blood samples from all patients were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies. All patients had extended blood analyses. Histologic (22 patients) and immunofluorescence examinations (15 patients) were performed on the skin biopsy specimens.
RESULTS: The 31 patients were generally in good health; most were teenagers or young adults, and 19 were women. Histopathologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens (22 patients) confirmed the diagnosis of chilblains and showed occasional lymphocytic or microthrombotic phenomena. Immunofluorescence analyses showed vasculitis of small-diameter vessels in 7 patients. In all patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained undetected by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and in biopsy samples of the skin lesions. The IgM and IgG antibody titers were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all patients (<1.0 arbitrary unit/mL). No significant abnormalities in blood test results were suggestive of systemic disease. Antinuclear antibody titers were low in 7 patients and higher in 1 patient.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Chilblains appeared not to be directly associated with COVID-19 in this case series. Lifestyle changes associated with community containment and lockdown measures are a possible explanation for these lesions.","['Herman A', 'Peeters C', 'Verroken A', 'Tromme I', 'Tennstedt D', 'Marot L', 'Dachelet C', 'Gruson D', 'Hermans C', 'Baeck M']",2020,156,9,JAMA Dermatol,"Herman A, et al.

32583809,COVID-19 Associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Coagulopathy: Targeting the Duumvirate.,"CONTEXT: Preliminary data on coexistence of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (HLH) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in critically ill children with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging. Herein, we summarize the available literature and fill-in the gaps in this regard.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We have performed a literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till May 12, 2020, with following keywords: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""HLH"", ""HScore"", ""coagulopathy"", ""D-dimer"", ""cytokine storm"", ""children"" and ""pediatrics"" with interposition of Boolean operator ""AND"".
RESULTS: Children presenting with moderate-severe COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous to HLH. HScore, a validated tool to diagnose HLH, has been suggested to screen severe COVID-19 patients for cytokine storm. However, HScore faces certain limitations in this scenario. It may be more pragmatic to use 'high D-dimer' (> 3 µg/mL) instead of 'low fibrinogen' to facilitate early detection of cytokine storm. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy resembles hypercoagulable form of DIC with bleeding being rarely reported. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) interim guidance recommends low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, data is lacking in population below 14 years of age. However, in the presence of life-threatening thromboembolic event or symptomatic acro-ischemia, unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be used with caution.
CONCLUSIONS: HScore can be used as a complement to clinical decision for initiating immunosuppression. Children with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, especially those with documented thrombocytopenia or chilblains, should be regularly monitored for coagulopathy.","['Bhattacharjee S', 'Banerjee M', 'Pal R']",2020,57,9,Indian Pediatr,"Bhattacharjee S, et al.

32562567,"SARS-CoV-2 endothelial infection causes COVID-19 chilblains: histopathological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study of seven paediatric cases.","BACKGROUND: Chilblains ('COVID toes') are being seen with increasing frequency in children and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Detailed histopathological descriptions of COVID-19 chilblains have not been reported, and causality of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the histopathological features of COVID-19 chilblains and to explore the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue.
METHODS: We examined skin biopsies from seven paediatric patients presenting with chilblains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in all cases and electron microscopy in one.
RESULTS: Histopathology showed variable degrees of lymphocytic vasculitis ranging from endothelial swelling and endotheliitis to fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis. Purpura, superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic inflammation with perieccrine accentuation, oedema, and mild vacuolar interface damage were also seen. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry was positive in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of eccrine glands. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells on electron microscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical and histopathological features were similar to other forms of chilblains, the presence of viral particles in the endothelium and the histological evidence of vascular damage support a causal relation of the lesions with SARS-CoV-2. Endothelial damage induced by the virus could be the key mechanism in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 chilblains and perhaps also in a group of patients severely affected by COVID-19 presenting with features of microangiopathic damage. What is already known about this topic? Despite the high number of cases of chilblains seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, a definite causative role for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been proven. Different pathogenetic hypotheses have been proposed, including coagulation anomalies, interferon release and external factors. What does this study add? The demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells of skin biopsies by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy confirms that these lesions are part of the spectrum of COVID-19. Virus-induced vascular damage and secondary ischaemia could explain the pathophysiology of COVID-19 chilblains. Our findings support the hypothesis that widespread endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 could have a pathogenetic role in the severe forms of COVID-19. Linked Comment: Wetter.

32559324,Unraveling the mystery of Covid-19 cytokine storm: From skin to organ systems.,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that emerged from Wuhan, China. Besides pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the disease leads to multisystem involvement in the form of myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoxemic brain injury, acute liver, and renal function impairment. There are also reports of cutaneous lesions in form of urticarial and maculopapular rashes, chilblain like fingers and toes (covid feet), livedoid vasculopathy, and chicken-pox like or varicelliform vesicles. Clinically, many of these skin lesions are likely secondary to occlusion of small to medium blood vessels due to microthrombi formation or due to viral laden antigen-antibody immune complexes; and same explanation may hold true for possible hypoxemic injury simultaneously occurring in other vital organs like lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. The histopathology, immunoflorescence and RT-PCR analysis of skin biopsies can provide useful insights for ascertaining the pathogenesis of this complex viral syndrome. Apparently, it is interplay of disarmed cellular immunity and over-activated humoral immunity that culminates in end-organ changes. The morbidity and mortality can be significantly reduced by upgrading the cellular immunity and downgrading the humoral response; along with prevention of hypoxemic and reperfusion injuries by using antivirals, immunomodulators, antioxidants, anti-platelets, and anticoagulants in judicious and phased manner.","['Garg S', 'Garg M', 'Prabhakar N', 'Malhotra P', 'Agarwal R']",2020,33,6,Dermatol Ther,"Garg S, et al.

32533899,Major cluster of paediatric 'true' primary chilblains during the COVID-19 pandemic: a consequence of lifestyle changes due to lockdown.,"BACKGROUND: Over the last months, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of chilblain-like lesions were reported mainly in children and rarely in young adults. The relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection was postulated, often without any laboratory, instrumental or clinical confirmation. The disclosure of information about chilblain-like lesions as a COVID-19 manifestation in social media has created concern in children's families and paediatricians.
OBJECTIVES: To verify whether the chilblain-like lesions were caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: Prospective study on a case series including children who presented with acral lesions at the Pediatric Dermatology Outpatient and Pediatric Emergency Unit of the University of Bologna, from 1 April to 30 April 2020. We reported demographical, laboratory and clinical features, history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, presence of similar skin lesions in other family members, precipitating and risk factors for chilblain onset.
RESULTS: We evaluated eight patients (five females, three males) aged between 11 and 15 years. We excluded acute or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab, serum antibody levels using chemiluminescent immunoassays. Other acute infections causing purpuric lesions at the extremities were negative in all patients. Skin lesion biopsy for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation was made in two cases and was consistent with chilblain. PCR assay on skin lesion biopsy for parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a patient and resulted negative. We identified common precipitating and risk factors: physical (cold and wet extremities, low BMI), cold and wet indoor and outdoor environment, behaviours, habits and lifestyle. We therefore reached a diagnosis of primary chilblains.
CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a 'cluster' of primary chilblains developed in predisposed subjects, mainly teenagers, due to cold exposure in the lockdown period. Laboratory findings support our hypothesis, although it is also possible that an unknown infectious trigger may have contributed to the pathogenesis.","['Neri I', 'Virdi A', 'Corsini I', 'Guglielmo A', 'Lazzarotto T', 'Gabrielli L', 'Misciali C', 'Patrizi A', 'Lanari M']",2020,34,11,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Neri I, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathologic features of chilblain-like lesions.
METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from 17 cases of chilblain-like lesions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in France and were studied by routine histologic examination, immunohistochemistry, and direct immunofluorescence. The patients had suspected but unconfirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (negative nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction and serologic test results).

32488318,Are the cutaneous manifestations during or due to SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 frequent or not? Revision of possible pathophysiologic mechanisms.,"BACKGROUND: SARS-Cov-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, a Betacoronavirus, composed of 16 non-structural proteins, with specific roles in replication of coronaviruses. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not yet fully understood. The virus and host factors interplay among distinct outcomes of infected patients.
METHODS: Using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) in PubMed, authors searched for articles cotaining information on COVID-19 and the skin.
RESULTS: The pathophysiology of the disease is multifactorial: association with innate immune response, hypercoagulability state, lung tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, monocytic/macrophage activation syndrome, culminating in exaggerated cytokine secretion, called ""cytokine storm"", which leads to worsening and death. These systemic conditions may be associated with cutaneous lesions, that have polymorphic aspects, where at histopathological level show involvement in different skin changes. These lesions may be associated with multisystemic manifestations that could occur due to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and transmembrane serine protease action, allowing the pulmonary infection and possibly skin manifestation. Several reports in literature show cutaneous lesions similar to chilblain, urticarial eruptions, diffuse or disseminated erythema, livedo racemosa, blue toe syndrome, retiform purpura, vesicle trunk, purpuric exanthema or exanthema with clinical aspects of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE) and others.

32482519,Effect of Calcium-Channel Blockade on the Cold-Induced Vasodilation Response.,"INTRODUCTION: Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) is seen in the extremities during exposure to cold. A strong vasodilation response has been associated with a decreased risk of cold injury. Increasing CIVD might further decrease this risk. The calcium-channel blocker nifedipine causes vasodilation and is used to treat Raynaud's syndrome and chilblains. Nifedipine is also used for high altitude pulmonary edema and could potentially serve a dual purpose in preventing frostbite. The effects of nifedipine on CIVD have not been studied.
METHODS: A double-blind crossover study comparing nifedipine (30 mg SR (sustained release) orally twice daily) to placebo was designed using 2 sessions of 4 finger immersion in 5°C water, with 24 h of medication pretreatment before each session. Finger temperatures were measured via nailbed thermocouples. The primary outcome was mean finger temperature; secondary outcomes were mean apex and nadir temperatures, first apex and nadir temperatures, subjective pain ranking, and time of vasodilation onset (all presented as mean±SD).
RESULTS: Twelve volunteers (age 29±3 [24-34] y) completed the study. No significant difference in finger temperature (9.2±1.1°C nifedipine vs 9.0±0.7°C placebo, P=0.38) or any secondary outcome was found. Pain levels were similar (2.8±1.6 nifedipine vs 3.0±1.5 placebo, P=0.32). The most common adverse event was headache (32% of nifedipine trials vs 8% placebo).
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with 30 mg of oral nifedipine twice daily does not affect the CIVD response in healthy individuals under cold stress.","['Milliner BHA', 'Brant-Zawadzki G', 'McIntosh SE']",2020,31,3,Wilderness Environ Med,"Milliner BHA, et al.

32479979,Pernio-like skin lesions associated with COVID-19: A case series of 318 patients from 8 countries.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests pernio-like lesions are cutaneous manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19).
OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and pathologic findings of pernio-like lesions in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
METHODS: An international dermatology registry was circulated to health care providers worldwide through the American Academy of Dermatology, International League of Dermatologic Societies, and other organizations.
RESULTS: We documented 505 patients with dermatologic manifestations associated with COVID-19, including 318 (63%) with pernio-like lesions. Patients with pernio-like lesions were generally young and healthy, with relatively mild COVID-19. Of 318 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 by providers, 23 (7%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive, and 20 others (6%) were close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Given current testing criteria, many patients lacked COVID-19 testing access. For 55% of patients, pernio-like lesions were their only symptom. In patients with other COVID-19 symptoms, pernio-like lesions typically appeared after other symptoms. Pernio-like lesions lasted a median of 14 days (interquartile range, 10-21 days).
LIMITATIONS: A case series cannot estimate population-level incidence or prevalence. In addition, there may be confirmation bias in reporting. We cannot exclude an epiphenomenon.
CONCLUSIONS: Pernio-like skin changes of the feet and hands, without another explanation, may suggest COVID-19 infection and should prompt confirmatory testing.","['Freeman EE', 'McMahon DE', 'Lipoff JB', 'Rosenbach M', 'Kovarik C', 'Takeshita J', 'French LE', 'Thiers BH', 'Hruza GJ', 'Fox LP', 'American Academy of Dermatology Ad Hoc Task Force on COVID-19']",2020,83,2,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Freeman EE, et al.

32479680,Cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19: a preliminary review of an emerging issue.,"BACKGROUND: The infection caused by the recently identified SARS-CoV-2, called coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread throughout the world. With the exponential increase of patients worldwide, the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is being better defined and new symptoms are emerging. Numerous reports are documenting the occurrence of different cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a brief overview of cutaneous lesions associated with COVID-19.
METHODS: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases up to 30 April 2020. This narrative review summarizes the available data regarding the clinical and histological features of COVID-19-associated skin manifestations.
RESULTS: The literature reports showed a great heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations, as well as in their latency periods and associated extracutaneous symptoms. Pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although the roles of a hyperactive immune response, complement activation and microvascular injury have been hypothesized. Based on our experience and the literature data, we subdivided the reported cutaneous lesions into six main clinical patterns: (i) urticarial rash; (ii) confluent erythematous-maculopapular-morbilliform rash; (iii) papulovesicular exanthem; (iv) chilblain-like acral pattern; (v) livedo reticularis-livedo racemosa-like pattern; and (vi) purpuric 'vasculitic' pattern. These six patterns can be merged into two main groups: the first - inflammatory and exanthematous - includes the first three groups listed above, and the second includes the vasculopathic and vasculitic lesions of the last three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The possible presence of cutaneous findings leading to suspect COVID-19 puts dermatologists in a relevant position. Further studies are needed to delineate the diagnostic and prognostic values of such cutaneous manifestations.","['Marzano AV', 'Cassano N', 'Genovese G', 'Moltrasio C', 'Vena GA']",2020,183,3,Br J Dermatol,"Marzano AV, et al.

32474947,"A clinical, histopathological and laboratory study of 19 consecutive Italian paediatric patients with chilblain-like lesions: lights and shadows on the relationship with COVID-19 infection.","BACKGROUND: Acral chilblain-like lesions are being increasingly reported during COVID-19 pandemic. However, only few patients proved positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The relationship between this skin manifestation and COVID-19 infection has not been clarified yet.
OBJECTIVE: To thoroughly characterize a prospective group of patients with chilblain-like lesions and to investigate the possible relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: Following informed consent, patients underwent (i) clinical evaluation, (ii) RT-PCR and serology testing for SARS-CoV-2, (iii) digital videocapillaroscopy of finger and toe nailfolds, (iv) blood testing to screen for autoimmune diseases and coagulation anomalies, and (v) skin biopsy for histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and, in selected cases, electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients, all adolescents (mean age: 14 years), were recruited. 11/19 (58%) of them and/or their cohabitants reported flu-like symptoms one to two months prior to skin manifestation onset. Lesions were localized to toes and also heels and soles. Videocapillaroscopy showed pericapillary oedema, dilated and abnormal capillaries, and microhaemorrhages both in finger and toe in the majority of patients. Major pathological findings included epidermal basal layer vacuolation, papillary dermis oedema and erythrocyte extravasation, perivascular and perieccrine dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, and mucin deposition in the dermis and hypodermis; dermal vessel thrombi were observed in two cases. Blood examinations were normal. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and IgG serology for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were negative. Importantly, IgA serology for S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was positive in 6 patients and borderline in 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Chilblain-like lesions during COVID-19 pandemic have specific epidemiologic, clinical, capillaroscopic and histopathological characteristics, which distinguish them from idiopathic perniosis. Though we could not formally prove SARS-CoV-2 infection in our patients, history data and the detection of anti-SARS-COV-2 IgA strongly suggest a relationship between skin lesions and COVID-19.

32445583,Erythema multiforme-like lesions in children and COVID-19.,"During examination of cases of chilblains in children and adolescents, we identified four patients who also showed skin lesions similar to erythema multiforme (EM). They had no other known triggers for EM. One of them had a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, while the other three were negative. Skin biopsies from two patients showed features not typical of EM, such as deep perivascular and perieccrine infiltrate and absence of necrosis of keratinocytes. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein showed granular positivity in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of eccrine glands in both biopsies. All patients had an excellent outcome, and had minimal or no systemic symptoms. The coincidence of EM, a condition commonly related to viruses, and chilblains in the setting of COVID-19, and the positivity for SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by immunohistochemistry strongly suggest a link between EM-like lesions and SARS-CoV-2.","['Torrelo A', 'Andina D', 'Santonja C', 'Noguera-Morel L', 'Bascuas-Arribas M', 'Gaitero-Tristán J', 'Alonso-Cadenas JA', 'Escalada-Pellitero S', 'Hernández-Martín Á', 'de la Torre-Espi M', 'Colmenero I']",2020,37,3,Pediatr Dermatol,"Torrelo A, et al.

32441360,Evaluation of dermatology consultations in the era of COVID-19.,"It has been reported that dermatology practices may be a vector for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and elective cases should be postponed during the pandemic period. In this context, studies on the change of patient profile in Dermatology outpatient clinic have been conducted. However, there was no study in the literature about dermatology consultations during the pandemic period. One hundred and forty-seven dermatology consultation cases in the era of COVID-19 pandemic between March 11, 2020 and May 4, 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Twenty-four patients (16.3%) had suspicion and signs of COVID during consultation (fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc.). Nine (37.5%) of these patients also had accompanying COVID-19 skin lesions (two urticarial lesions, two livedo and necrosis, two maculopapular eruption, two vesicular rashes, one pseudo-chilblain). The number of cases that were suspected to have COVID-19 was statistically significantly higher in consultations requested by the emergency department and intensive care unit, while there were no suspected cases in outpatient clinic consultations (P = .001). Two (1.4%) of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR within 2 weeks. We acknowledge that daily practice changes frequently during this period, but still our study provides a perspective to other dermatology clinics in terms of the requested dermatology consultations during the pandemic.","['Temiz SA', 'Dursun R', 'Daye M', 'Ataseven A']",2020,33,5,Dermatol Ther,"Temiz SA, et al.

The clinical and histopathological features and relationship to COVID-19 have not been well described. The objective of this case series is to describe the clinical features and determine the histopathologic findings and clinical implications of the clusters of acral perniosis cases identified in pediatric patients.
METHODS: We describe six otherwise healthy adolescents-three siblings per family from two unrelated families-presented within a 48-hour period in April, 2020, with acral perniosis-like lesions in the context of over 30 similar patients who were evaluated within the same week.
RESULTS: Affected patients had mild symptoms of viral upper respiratory infection (URI) or contact with symptomatic persons 1-2 weeks preceding the rash. They all presented with red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques scattered on the mid and distal aspects of the toes. Skin biopsies performed on each of the six patients demonstrated near identical histopathologic findings to those of idiopathic perniosis, with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate without evidence of thromboembolism or immune complex vasculitis. While SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction was negative, testing was performed 1-2 weeks after URI symptoms or sick contact exposure.
CONCLUSION: We offer a clinical approach to evaluation of patients with this presentation and discuss the possibility that these skin findings represent a convalescent-phase cutaneous reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Cordoro KM', 'Reynolds SD', 'Wattier R', 'McCalmont TH']",2020,37,3,Pediatr Dermatol,"Cordoro KM, et al.

With the increasing involvement of dermatologist in management of this crisis, cutaneous symptoms gained more and more attention. In this review, we will describe cutaneous symptoms of patients of all ages in association with COVID-19. We will focus on such disorders that are caused by direct action of SARS-CoV-2 on tissues, complement, and coagulation system and on nonspecific eruption of the systemic viral infection. Drug-induced reactions are only mentioned in the differential diagnoses. Although more systematic investigations are warranted, it becomes clear that some symptoms are clinical signs of a milder COVID-19 course, while others are a red flag for a more severe course. Knowledge of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 may help in early diagnosis, triage of patients, and risk stratification.","['Wollina U', 'Karadağ AS', 'Rowland-Payne C', 'Chiriac A', 'Lotti T']",2020,33,5,Dermatol Ther,"Wollina U, et al.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 22 children and adolescents with chilblain-like lesions seen over a short period of time in the Emergency Department of a children's hospital during the peak incidence of COVID-19 in Madrid, Spain.
RESULTS: All patients had lesions clinically consistent with chilblains of the toes or feet, with three also having lesions of the fingers. Pruritus and mild pain were the only skin symptoms elicited, and only 10 had mild respiratory and/or GI symptoms. None had fever. Coagulation tests, hemogram, serum chemistry, and lupus anticoagulant were normal in all patients tested. One out of 16 tested cases had elevated D-dimer results, but without systemic symptoms or other laboratory anomalies. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested in 19 cases was positive in just one case. Skin biopsies obtained in six patients were consistent with chilblains. On follow-up, all cases showed spontaneous marked improvement or complete healing.
CONCLUSION: Acute chilblains were observed during COVID-19 pandemic in children and teenagers. It is a mildly symptomatic condition with an excellent prognosis, usually requiring no therapy.

32348545,Classification of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19: a rapid prospective nationwide consensus study in Spain with 375 cases.,"BACKGROUND: The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease are poorly characterized.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings.
METHODS: We carried out a nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data. Using a consensus we described five clinical patterns. We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, the timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, the severity and the prognosis.
RESULTS: The lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (pseudo-chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%). Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms). The pseudo-chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID-19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 shows a gradient from less severe disease in acral lesions to more severe in the latter groups. The results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, in terms of both clinical and epidemiological findings. Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo-chilblain and vesicular).
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a description of the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection. These may help clinicians approach patients with the disease and recognize cases presenting with few symptoms. What is already known about this topic? Previous descriptions of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 were case reports and mostly lacked illustrations. What does this study add? We describe a large, representative sample of patients with unexplained skin manifestations and a diagnosis of COVID-19, using a consensus method to define morphological patterns associated with COVID-19. We describe five clinical patterns associated with different patient demographics, timing and prognosis, and provide illustrations of these patterns to allow for easy recognition.","['Galván Casas C', 'Català A', 'Carretero Hernández G', 'Rodríguez-Jiménez P', 'Fernández-Nieto D', 'Rodríguez-Villa Lario A', 'Navarro Fernández I', 'Ruiz-Villaverde R', 'Falkenhain-López D', 'Llamas Velasco M', 'García-Gavín J', 'Baniandrés O', 'González-Cruz C', 'Morillas-Lahuerta V', 'Cubiró X', 'Figueras Nart I', 'Selda-Enriquez G', 'Romaní J', 'Fustà-Novell X', 'Melian-Olivera A', 'Roncero Riesco M', 'Burgos-Blasco P', 'Sola Ortigosa J', 'Feito Rodriguez M', 'García-Doval I']",2020,183,1,Br J Dermatol,"Galván Casas C, et al.

Mutations in TREX1, SAMHD1 and STING have been described in FCL patients. Less than 10 TREX1 mutation positive FCL families have been described in the literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: Genetic study was performed in a large, nonconsanguineous Chinese family with 13 members over 4 generations affected by chilblain lupus. Whole exome sequencing was performed for the index patient. Significant variant detection was subsequently validated by resequencing using Sanger sequencing in the index patient and other family members. A novel pathogenic mutation TREX1 p.Asp18His was iditified in the index patient. The mutation was present in affected individuals and was absent in non-affected individuals in the familiy.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a four-generation Chinese family with FCL caused by a novel heterozygous mutation TREX1 p.Asp18His, which had been reported in a patient with Aicardi-Goutie'res syndrome.

31790182,Hypothermia and Cold Weather Injuries.,"Hypothermia, frostbite, and nonfreezing cold injuries predominantly affect older adults, homeless or intoxicated people, adventurers, and military personnel. Prevention begins with clothing that is clean, layered, and loose to promote circulation. Base layers made of moisture-wicking materials are favored over wool or cotton. Wool or fleece garments are ideal for middle layers, whereas outer layers should repel moisture. Hypothermia occurs when core body temperature drops below 95°F and can be staged by clinical symptoms when core temperature measurement is unavailable. Initial treatment includes external and internal rewarming. Warmed normal saline is favored over lactated Ringer solution. Frostbite is a freezing injury that usually affects the extremities. After rapid rewarming, prognosis is best determined with technetium 99mTc pyrophosphate scintigraphy or magnetic resonance angiography. Initial treatment includes protecting tissue from further trauma, preventing refreezing, and avoiding dry heat sources. Ideally, patients should be transported to facilities where rapid rewarming, imaging, and thrombolytic treatment are available. Tissue plasminogen activator significantly decreases amputation rates for severe injuries if started within 24 hours of rewarming. Immersion foot occurs during damp nonfreezing conditions. Rapid rewarming should be avoided, and amitriptyline should be considered for pain control.","['Rathjen NA', 'Shahbodaghi SD', 'Brown JA']",2019,100,11,Am Fam Physician,"Rathjen NA, et al.

31717566,Development of a UV-Stabilized Topical Formulation of Nifedipine for the Treatment of Raynaud Phenomenon and Chilblains.,"Raynaud's Phenomenon is a vascular affliction resulting in pain and blanching of the skin caused by excessive and prolonged constriction of arterioles, usually due to cold exposure. Nifedipine is a vasodilatory calcium channel antagonist, which is used orally as the first-line pharmacological treatment to reduce the incidence and severity of attacks when other interventions fail to alleviate the condition and there is danger of tissue injury. Oral administration of nifedipine, however, is associated with systemic adverse effects, and thus topical administration with nifedipine locally to the extremities would be advantageous. However, nifedipine is subject to rapid photodegradation, which is problematic for exposed skin such as the hands. The goal of this project was to analyze the photostability of a novel topical nifedipine cream to UVA light. The effect of incorporating the photoprotectants rutin, quercetin, and/or avobenzone (BMDBM) into the nifedipine cream on the stability of nifedipine to UVA light exposure and the appearance of degradation products of nifedipine was determined. Rutin and quercetin are flavonoids with antioxidant activity. Both have the potential to improve the photostability of nifedipine by a number of mechanisms that either quench the intermolecular electron transfer of the singlet excited dihydropyridine to the nitrobenzene group or by preventing photoexcitation of nifedipine.

However, little is known about the implication of NETs in cutaneous lupus. In this case series of 30 patients, we compared the amounts of neutrophils producing NETs in cutaneous lesions of different subtypes of lupus (5 with discoid lupus or DLE, 5 with subacute cutaneous lupus or SCLE, 11 with acute cutaneous SLE, 7 with lupus panniculitis and 2 with chilblains). Immunofluorescence was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin biopsies using antibodies against neutrophilic granules (elastase, myeloperoxidase, PR-3 proteins and citrullinated histone 3). Dihydroethidium staining was performed to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS), known inducers of NETs. NETs were detected in the different subtypes of cutaneous lupus as well as in cutaneous lesions of SLE. The amounts of neutrophils producing NETs were significantly higher in lupus panniculitis (49%), acute cutaneous SLE (41%) and DLE (32%), in comparison with SCLE (5%) and chilblains (0%). This suggests that NETs might be associated with more tissue damage and scarring. ROS were observed in the different cutaneous subtypes of lupus independent of NETs.","['Safi R', 'Al-Hage J', 'Abbas O', 'Kibbi AG', 'Nassar D']",2019,28,11,Exp Dermatol,"Safi R, et al.

31351509,Rowell's Syndrome Triggered by Omeprazole.,"Dear Editor, Rowell's syndrome is a rare disease, characterized by the appearance of erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions in patients with lupus erythematosus. It was initially reported by Rowell (1) in 1963 and its existence as a separate clinical entity is currently under debate (2,3). A few cases may have been induced by drugs such as systemic antimycotics, antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and more recently proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). CASE REPORT We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and EM-like lesions who fulfilled all the criteria for Rowell's syndrome. The patient had lupus arthritis for two years and was treated with oral methylprednisolone 8 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day. She started receiving 20 mg of omeprazole daily for gastroprotection. The patient also had arterial hypertension with no current treatment, osteoporosis, and an L1 vertebral fracture. The dermatological examination revealed multiple erythematous infiltrated plaques involving mainly the sun-exposed areas (neck, chest, upper back, and shoulders). Cutaneous lesions had an annular or target pattern and a tendency to form hemorrhagic crusts and scales at the margins (Figure 1, A). The mucous membranes were unaffected. Histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin ×200) found epidermal atrophy, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, and sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis - features corresponding to lupus erythematosus (Figure 2, A). Single eosinophilic necrotic keratinocytes characteristic for erythema multiforme were observed in the epidermis (Figure 2, B). Direct immunofluorescence (IF) from lesional skin showed granular deposits of C3 on the dermo-epidermal junction. Lupus band test from sun-protected, nonlesional skin was negative. On indirect IF a speckled pattern antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with >1:1280 titers were detected. Anti-Ro (>200 U/mL) and anti-La (>200 U/mL) antibodies were also positive. The blood cell count and differential analysis were within reference ranges. The 24-hour urine protein test showed a non-significant proteinuria - 0.36 g/24h. Photo-testing was impossible considering the extent of the skin lesions. The therapeutic approach consisted of increasing the hydroxychloroquine dose to 400 mg/day, substituting PPI with famotidine 20 mg/day p.o. and ceftriaxone 2 g/day for the superinfection with Ps. aeruginosa, which led to a clinical improvement (Figure 1, B). The methylprednisolone dose remained unchanged due to already existing severe adverse effects. DISCUSSION The diagnosis was based on Zeitouni et al.'s classification (4). The three main criteria are as follows: lupus erythematosus, EM-like lesions, and speckled pattern of ANA. Our patient met all three major and one minor criteria, namely the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. As for the other minor criteria, RF was negative and no chilblains were found. Although there was a continuous time lapse (more than 1 year) between the initiation of omeprazole intake and the diagnosis of Rowell's syndrome, we suggest that the connection is probable. For instance, the latency differs depending on the incriminated medication in drug induced SCLE. Longer periods are reported for diuretics and calcium blockers, while the time interval is shorter for chemotherapeutic drugs and antimycotics (5). Our suspicions were further confirmed by the fact that the lesions improved promptly within a month after discontinuation of omeprazole and doubling the dose of hydroxychloroquine. PPIs are reported to be a major cause of drug-induced SCLE (6,7). According to Laurinaviciene et al., the most common drugs involved are PPIs, thiazide diuretics, antifungals, chemotherapeutics, statins, and antiepileptics (6). However, very few cases of Rowell's syndrome are found to be drug-related. The culprit drugs include: oral terbinafine (8,9), norfloxacin (10), sodium valproate (11) and esomeprazole (12) (Table 1). CONCLUSION Despite the common clinical and immunological features shared between SCLE, drug-induced SCLE and EM, Rowell's syndrome seems to be a separate entity rather than a coincidental association. Finally, according to our knowledge this case would be the second of Rowell's syndrome due to PPIs.","['Pozharashka J', 'Dourmishev L', 'Balabanova M', 'Vassileva S', 'Miteva L']",2019,27,2,Acta Dermatovenerol Croat,"Pozharashka J, et al.

31326279,TREX1 variants in Sjogren's syndrome related lymphomagenesis.,"Genetic variants of the three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) -an exonuclease involved in DNA repair and degradation- have been previously found to increase susceptibility to Aicardi Goutieres syndrome, familial chilblain lupus and systemic lupus erythematosus. We aimed to explore whether TREX1 common variants could influence the risk of primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and SS-related lymphoma. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TREX1 gene (rs11797, rs3135941 and rs3135945) were evaluated in 229 SS, 89 SS-lymphoma (70 SS-MALT and 19 SS non-MALT) and 240 healthy controls by PCR-based assays. In available 52 peripheral blood and 26 minor salivary gland tissues from our SS cohort, mRNA expression of type I interferon (IFN) related genes and TREX1 was determined by real-time PCR. Significantly decreased prevalence of rs11797 A minor allele was detected in SS patients complicated by non-MALT lymphoma compared to controls (ΟR [95% CI]: 0.4 [0.2-0.9], p-value: 0.02). SS patients carrying the rs11797 AA genotype had increased type I IFN related gene mRNA expression in minor salivary gland tissues. These data support genetically related dampened type I IFN production as an additional mechanism for SS-related lymphomagenesis.","['Nezos A', 'Makri P', 'Gandolfo S', 'De Vita S', 'Voulgarelis M', 'Crow MK', 'Mavragani CP']",2020,132,,Cytokine,"Nezos A, et al.

30929875,[Two cases of unilateral chilblains associated with monoparesis].,"BACKGROUND: Chilblains are inflammatory dermal lesions associated with hypersensitivity to cold, and they occur on the extremities bilaterally and symmetrically. Their onset during the course of pro-thermogenic and autoimmune diseases has been widely reported, but the association with predisposing locoregional causes is not well known.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case 1: a 57-year-old man, who smoked 80 packets per year, presenting a deficit of the levator muscles in his right foot following lumbar sciatica with paralysis of L5, consulted for unilateral necrotic lesions of the toes recurring each winter in the paralysed limb only. Case 2: a 60-year-old man had a previous history of liposarcoma of the right side treated with radiotherapy and surgery, resulting in sequelae of monoparesis and radiation-induced arteritis. Each winter, he presented recurring unilateral purpuric macules of the toes on his right foot, with no necrotic progression. In both cases, clinical examination, disease progression over time, histology and laboratory tests confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic chilblains.
CONCLUSION: The physiopathological hypotheses posited to account for the unilateral appearance of chilblains in the event of paralysis include decreased blood flow to the paralysed limb, imbalance in neuromodulators, dysfunction of the autonomous nervous system, cutaneous atrophy with hypertrophy of underlying soft tissues, and finally, hypoesthesia aggravating the trophic disorders.","['Couture P', 'Moguelet P', 'Chasset F', 'Barbaud A', 'Senet P', 'Monfort JB']",2019,146,8-9,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Couture P, et al.

30806709,"JAK-inhibitors. New players in the field of immune-mediated diseases, beyond rheumatoid arthritis.","Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are a group of molecules associated with one of the major pathways through which many cytokines exert and integrate their function, and as such they are increasingly recognized as playing critical role in the pathogenesis subserving various immune-mediated diseases, including RA, PsA, SpAs, IBD, skin disorders (e.g. alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis), single-gene disorders like interferonopathies, and others. JAKs are the key initiating players of the JAK/STAT pathway. Upon binding of their respective effector molecules (cytokines, IFNs, growth factors and others) to type I and type II receptors, JAKs are activated, and through phosphorylation of themselves and of other molecules (including STATs), they mediate signal transduction to the nucleus. A class of drugs-called JAK inhibitors or JAKinibs-that block one or more JAKs has been developed in the last decade, and now numbers >20 members. Although, so far, JAK inhibitors have been marketed only for RA and PsA, these drugs have been tested in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials for other inflammatory conditions and beyond. In this review, we summarize the clinical data, including efficacy and safety, available for JAK inhibitors used in some immune-mediated conditions other than RA.","['Fragoulis GE', 'McInnes IB', 'Siebert S']",2019,58,Suppl 1,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Fragoulis GE, et al.

30685859,TREX-1-Related Disease Associated with the Presence of Cryofibrinogenemia.,"PURPOSE: Cryofibrinogenemia is a rare cryopathy presenting as acrocyanosis following exposure to cold. Familial presentation has been described but the underlying molecular cause remained undetermined.
METHODS: Forty (40) members from a large family with an initial diagnosis of familial cryofibrinogenemia were interviewed and examined to determine affected status and collect DNA. Exome sequencing was performed on three affected individuals from distinct branches of the pedigree.
RESULTS: Seventeen (17) family members reported a history of acrocyanosis with cold exposure. None reported symptoms were suggestive of lupus. Exome sequencing of three subjects identified the heterozygous mutation D18N in the TREX1 gene which was then confirmed by Sanger sequencing in all affected as well as 2 unaffected family members. The mutation is already being associated with familial chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE), and a systematic review of literature was undertaken to compare reports of familial CHLE and cryofibrinogenemia. Both entities were found to share highly similar clinical presentations suggesting they are part of a same syndrome in which cryofibrinogenemia and lupus manifestations have variable penetrance.
CONCLUSIONS: Familial cryofibrinogenemia without lupus should be added to the spectrum of TREX1-related disease.","['Paradis C', 'Cadieux-Dion M', 'Meloche C', 'Gravel M', 'Paradis J', 'Des Roches A', 'Leclerc G', 'Cossette P', 'Begin P']",2019,39,1,J Clin Immunol,"Paradis C, et al.

30673078,Assessment of Clinical Response to Janus Kinase Inhibition in Patients With Familial Chilblain Lupus and TREX1 Mutation.,"IMPORTANCE: Familial chilblain lupus is a monogenic autosomal dominant form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that in most cases is caused by mutations in the 3 prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1). Familial chilblain lupus presents in early childhood with cold-induced painful erythematous infiltrates leading to mutilation and is associated with systemic involvement illustrated by an elevated type I interferon (IFN) signature in the skin and blood. Effective treatment is currently not available.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical response to the Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib in familial chilblain lupus and assess the effect of cold on patient fibroblasts.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this case series, 3 patients with familial chilblain lupus due to TREX1 mutation underwent treatment with baricitinib for 3 months.
INTERVENTIONS: Doses of baricitinib, 4 mg, were administered daily for 3 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reduction of cutaneous lupus lesions was measured by the revised cutaneous lupus area and severity index, pain due to skin and joint involvement was assessed by visual analog scale, type I IFN signature in blood was determined by polymerase chain reaction, and the in vitro response of fibroblasts to cold exposure was analyzed.
RESULTS: All 3 patients (2 women and 1 man; mean [SD] age, 51 [24] years) showed a significant improvement of cutaneous lupus lesions with suppression of systemic type I IFN activation. One patient had a complete remission regarding pain and, in 2 patients, pain associated with joint inflammation was partially reduced. No severe adverse reactions were reported. Exposure of patient fibroblasts to cold induced a stress response and enhanced senescence along with induction of IFN-stimulated gene in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of Janus kinase inhibition in a monogenic form of lupus among 3 patients and provide mechanistic insight into the process of disease exacerbation by cold in TREX1-deficient cells. This finding may be relevant to other type I IFN-mediated disorders and implicates Janus kinase inhibition as a potential therapeutic option also for multifactorial cutaneous lupus erythematosus.","['Zimmermann N', 'Wolf C', 'Schwenke R', 'Lüth A', 'Schmidt F', 'Engel K', 'Lee-Kirsch MA', 'Günther C']",2019,155,3,JAMA Dermatol,"Zimmermann N, et al.

30459032,Acral coldness - severely reduced blood flow to fingers and toes.,"The term acral coldness is used to describe physiologic or pathologic situations in humans where the fingers and toes are exceptionally cold in spite of normal central body temperature. In the thermoneutral zone, the blood flow to acral skin normally shows large fluctuations between high and low values, with a frequency of about 3 cycles per minute. At an acral skin temperature of about 21°C, finger blood flow is constantly low. At lower temperatures the fingers and toes become painful. This is a normal physiologic reaction, probably because of ischemia. The characteristics of the most frequent acral vascular syndromes, Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis, and chilblains, are discussed. Common to all three is pathologically low blood flow and disappearance of physiologic fluctuations even in the thermoneutral zone. Ischemic vascular diseases in acral skin are usually diagnosed from clinical observations. Measurements of fluctuating blood flow by laser or ultrasound Doppler could be useful, but should be carried out at a room temperature of 24-25°C.","['Bergersen TK', 'Walløe L']",2018,157,,Handb Clin Neurol,Bergersen TK and Walløe L.

30217686,[Familial chilblain lupus: Four cases spanning three generations].,"BACKGROUND: Familial chilblain lupus is a hereditary form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus seen in young children. It shows autosomal dominant inheritance due to mutations in the TREX-1 gene, or, more rarely, SAMHD1 or TMEM173 (STING). It belongs to the type I interferonopathies, i.e. inflammatory diseases associated with excessive interferon production and characterized by a positive ""interferon signature"". This is a rare entity with fewer than 10 families described to date. We report a new family followed over several years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were four subjects from the same family and spanning three generations (a brother and sister aged 17 and 15 years, their 39-year-old mother, and their 60-year-old grandfather). The initial cutaneous lesions on the extremities were described as papular, erythematous, purplish, infiltrated, hyperkeratotic, pruritic and/or painful. They occurred in childhood, improved during summer and stabilized over time. Immunological abnormalities such as positive antinuclear antibodies were noted. The interferon signature was positive in all patients. Molecular analysis of TREX-1, SAMHD1 and STING genes in both children showed no evidence of mutation.
DISCUSSION: The cutaneous involvement was classic except for absence of the scarring and mutilating progression, photosensitivity and vasculopathy reported in other families. There was no intrafamily variability other than unconstant immunological abnormalities. At the molecular level, no mutations in the known genes were identified. A complementary molecular analysis is in progress.
CONCLUSION: We report a new case of familial LEF, thus adding to knowledge about this very rare form of lupus erythematosus.","['Beltoise AS', 'Audouin-Pajot C', 'Lucas P', 'Tournier E', 'Rice GI', 'Crow YJ', 'Mazereeuw-Hautier J']",2018,145,11,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Beltoise AS, et al.

Some recent data have indicated that it may also be associated with autoimmune connective tissue diseases, including systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis; however, studies on the prevalence and clinical characteristics of pruritus in CLE are limited. We have performed a multinational, prospective, cross-sectional study in order to assess the prevalence and intensity of pruritus in adult patients suffering from various subtypes of CLE. After developing a questionnaire assessing various aspects of pruritus, we have surveyed 567 patients with cutaneous involvement during the course of LE regarding the presence and intensity of pruritus. Pruritus was present in 425 of all patients (75.0%) and was most frequently reported by subjects with acute CLE (82.1%), followed by chronic CLE (78.8%), subacute CLE (65.9%), and intermittent CLE (55.6%) (p<0.001). Based on the Numerical Rating Scale, the severity of itch was mild, moderate, and severe in 264 (62.1%), 98 (23.1%), and 63 (14.8%) patients, respectively. The highest mean pruritus intensity was reported by subjects with hypertrophic LE (5.1 ± 3.0 points) followed by generalized discoid LE (3.6 ± 3.0 points), subacute CLE (3.0 ± 3.0 points), chilblain LE (3.0 ± 1.0 points), localized discoid LE (2.6 ± 2.0 points), intermittent CLE (2.6 ± 3.0 points), acute CLE (2.5 ± 1.2 points), and lupus erythematosus profundus (1.9 ± 2.7 points). In conclusion, pruritus is a frequent phenomenon in CLE; however, in most patients it is of mild severity.

30093237,Foot and ankle characteristics in systemic lupus erythematosus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine characteristics of the foot and ankle in people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, Sports-Discus, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to January 2018. Studies reporting foot- and ankle-related outcomes in the following domains were included: vascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, cutaneous (skin and nail) or pain/function. The Quality Index tool was used to assess methodological quality. Where appropriate, odds ratio (OR) and mean difference meta-analyses were conducted for case-control studies; and pooled mean prevalence meta-analyses for studies assessing characteristics in SLE.
RESULTS: Forty-nine studies were included with mean (range) quality scores of 75% (38-100%). Twenty-three studies assessed vascular characteristics, followed by musculoskeletal (n = 16), neurological (n = 11), cutaneous (n = 5) and pain/function (n = 4). Foot and ankle characteristics in people with SLE included impaired vascular supply, abnormal nerve function, musculoskeletal pathology, skin and nail pathology, and pain and functional disability. Twenty-four studies were included in meta-analyses. Pooled OR for abnormal ankle brachial index was 3.08 for SLE compared with controls. Pooled mean difference in brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity between SLE and controls was significant (161.39 cm/s, P = 0.004). Pooled prevalence was 0.54 for intermittent claudication, 0.50 for Raynaud's phenomenon, 0.28 for chilblains, 0.00 for gangrene, 0.30 for hallux valgus, 0.15 for onychomycosis, 0.76 for history of foot pain, and 0.36 for current foot pain.

29803925,TNFSF15 is likely a susceptibility gene for systemic lupus erythematosus.,"We aim to explore the correlation of TNFSF15 genetic polymorphisms with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study enrolled SLE patients and healthy individuals to detect three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TNFSF15 (rs3810936, rs6478108 and rs4979462) through using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to analyze the possible association of these three SNPs with the risk of SLE and the mRNA level of TNFSF15 was quantified by real-time PCR. The rs3810936 T allele carrier greatly decreased risk of SLE (OR = 0.620, 95% CI = 0.454-0.849, P = 0.003), while the risk of SLE for rs4979462 T allele carrier was significantly increased (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.243-2.218, P < 0.001). The mRNA level of TNFSF15 was obviously higher in SLE patients, and specifically, the patients who carried the CC genotype of TNFSF15 rs3810936 had a higher TNFSF15 mRNA, but the rs4979462 CC genotype carriers appeared to be associated with the decreased TNFSF15 mRNA (all P < 0.05). Besides, the genotypes of rs3810936 and rs4979462 of TNFSF15 were significantly associated with butterfly rash, arthritis, serositis, renal nephritis, hematological disorder, immunological disorder and positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) of SLE patients (all P < 0.05). CCT and CTT haplotypes were risk factors of SLE, but CCC and TTT were protective factors of SLE (all P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that rs3810936 and rs4979462 of TNFSF15, histories of chilblain and wet living environment were independently associated with the risk of SLE (all P < 0.05).The current results suggested that TNFSF15 (rs3810936 and rs4979462) SNPs may confer susceptibility to SLE risk, which were significantly associated with the clinical phenotypes of SLE.","['Wang XM', 'Tu JC']",2018,670,,Gene,Wang XM and Tu JC.

OBJECTIVE: To report a series of children with phalangeal microgeodic syndrome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty children with phalangeal microgeodic syndrome were retrospectively identified at our hospital after 2007. The clinical data, radiologic manifestation and pathologic appearance were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age was 10.3 years (range: 6.5-14.6 years). Twelve patients were boys. Twenty-five phalanges were affected radiographically (23 middle phalanges [92%] and 2 proximal phalanges [8%]). On radiographs, there were multiple small phalangeal lacunae in all cases. Metaphyseal rarefaction was seen in 15 phalanges, and metaphyseal transverse lucent bands were found in 7 phalanges. Epiphyseal rarefaction was seen in three phalanges. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse signal abnormalities of affected phalanges were observed in all cases. Multiple other phalanges and metacarpals also showed marrow edema in three cases.
CONCLUSION: Phalangeal microgeodes may represent bone absorption and destruction in response to exaggerated peripheral circulatory impairment following chilblain, and mainly occur in bone growth spurts.","['Yang YZ', 'Ma XH', 'Yang XH', 'Gu WZ', 'Jin WY', 'Zhao ZY']",2018,48,8,Pediatr Radiol,"Yang YZ, et al.

To date, several cases of systemic lupus erythematosus, Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, familial chilblain lupus, retinal vasculopathy-cerebral leukodystrophy have been reported with TREX1 mutations. Chilblain lupus is a skin disease characterized by blue-reddish coloring, swelling or ulcers on acral regions of body such as fingertips, heels, nose and auricles. Central nervous system vasculitis is a prominent cause of childhood strokes. 10 families with familial chilblain lupus related to TREX1 mutations were reported previously in the literature, in which homozygote D18N variant in TREX1 gene was related to chilblains with cerebral vasculitis. In this report, whole-exome-sequencing revealed a homozygote R114C mutation in TREX1 gene was shown in two siblings with recurrent chilblains whom one of them was the second case accompanied by cerebral vasculitis in the literature. As a result, the approach of WES in clinical use revealed a novel mutation in clinically heterogenous patients to provide genetic counseling.","['Kisla Ekinci RM', 'Balci S', 'Bisgin A', 'Altintas DU', 'Yilmaz M']",2017,60,12,Eur J Med Genet,"Kisla Ekinci RM, et al.

28913687,Non-Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease in Women.,"Takayasu arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), spontaneous arterial dissection, Raynaud's phenomenon, and chilblains are vascular conditions that are associated with an increased predisposition in women and are often underdiagnosed. Takayasu arteritis has an incidence rate of 2.6 cases per million individuals per year in the USA and predominantly affects women of childbearing age. HLA-B5 genetic locus is linked with Takayasu arteritis susceptibility. Methods to determine active disease are limiting; currently utilized clinical and imaging findings and laboratory tests are of limited value for this purpose. Pregnancy poses risks for maternal and fetal complications, and these patients need additional monitoring and care before and after conception. Controlling hypertension and immunosuppression using steroids, biological and non-biological immunosuppressants, are key components of managing patients with this arteritis. FMD commonly affects middle-aged, white females. Its true prevalence is unknown. Renal and cerebrovascular beds are the most frequently involved vascular beds. Its clinical presentation varies from no symptoms to catastrophic events. Controlling vascular risk factors, periodic surveillance, and revascularization when indicated are important factors in FMD management. Spontaneous arterial dissections are less common, but are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in specific populations. Cervicocephalic dissection causes 10-20% of the strokes in young adults, and coronary artery dissection is the culprit in almost one fourth of young women presenting with acute myocardial infarction. Early diagnosis is key to improving prognosis in these patients, as the majority of patients have spontaneous resolution of the dissection with conservative management alone. Increased clinician awareness of the presentation features and angiographic findings are imperative for early diagnosis. Raynaud's phenomenon and chilblains are cold- or stress-induced cutaneous lesions, commonly involving distal extremities. Secondary causes such as connective tissue diseases and malignancies must be thoroughly excluded during evaluation of these conditions. Cold avoidance, systemic and local warming, and oral vasodilator therapy are the mainstays of therapy.","['Joseph L', 'Kim ESH']",2017,19,10,Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med,Joseph L and Kim ESH.

This review aims to give an overview of clinical signs and the pathophysiological mechanisms.
RECENT FINDINGS: There are several mutations that can lead to this autosomal dominant disease. Most frequent is a mutation of the gene for TREX-1. However, as well cases of families with mutations in the SAMHD1 gene and, recently, with one for the gene that codes for the protein stimulator of interferon genes have been described. These genes are involved in the process of the detection of intracellular DNA, and their mutation results in an increased production of type I interferons and their gene products, resulting in auto-inflammation and auto-immunity. JAK inhibitors have been successfully used to treat this disorder. Familial chilblain is a rare disorder with very distinct clinical signs. Its pathophysiological mechanism gives insight into the process of interferon-induced inflammation in auto-immune diseases.",['Fiehn C'],2017,19,10,Curr Rheumatol Rep,Fiehn C.

28808969,Methods of Assessing STING Activation and Trafficking.,"The signaling adapter protein STING is crucial for the host immune response to cytosolic DNA and cyclic dinucleotides. Under basal conditions, STING resides on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER ) , but upon activation, it traffics through secretory pathway to cytoplasmic vesicles, where STING activates downstream immune signaling. Classical STING activation and trafficking are triggered by binding of cyclic dinucleotide ligands. STING signaling can also be activated by gain-of-function mutations that lead to constitutive trafficking of STING. These gain-of-function mutations are associated with several human diseases such as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or familial chilblain lupus (FCL). This dynamic activation pathway presents a challenge to study. We describe methods here for measuring ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of STING signaling in HEK293T cells. We also describe a retroviral-based reconstitution assay to study STING protein trafficking and activation in immune competent cells such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), which avoids the use of plasmid DNA. These methods will expedite research regarding STING trafficking and signaling dynamics in the settings of infection and autoimmune diseases.","['Pokatayev V', 'Yan N']",2017,1656,,Methods Mol Biol,Pokatayev V and Yan N.

Increased CD123 plasmacytoid dendritic cells and CD30 lymphocytes have been demonstrated in various forms of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and IP, respectively. To our knowledge, CD123 and CD30 have not been examined in CLE. Our objective was to identify helpful histopathologic and immunohistochemical features in distinguishing CLE and IP. Skin biopsies classified as CLE (n = 20) and IP (n = 39) based on clinicopathologic correlation were collected from 2000 to 2015. Various histopathologic features were examined on hematoxylin and eosin and alcian blue stains. CD123 and CD30 immunostains were performed and characterized. We identified dermal interstitial fibrin exudate (P = 0.0352) and increased dermal mucin (P = 0.0002) as features significantly associated with CLE. Other histopathologic features and CD123 failed to distinguish between groups. CD30 lymphocytes were sparse in all cases. Despite being the largest series of CLE and IP to date, the number of CLE cases in this study remained relatively limited, and some patients in the IP group may have yet to develop diagnostic features of systemic lupus erythematosus. In conclusion, histopathologic distinction between CLE and IP remains challenging. Interstitial fibrin and abundant dermal mucin help favor CLE. The number and distribution of CD123 plasmacytoid dendritic cells and CD30 lymphocytes have no discriminatory role.","['Wang ML', 'Chan MP']",2018,40,4,Am J Dermatopathol,Wang ML and Chan MP.

28543432,Clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis with rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia: The relation between the disease activity and the serum interleukin-6 level.,"A 67-year-old woman exhibited chilblain-like erythema on the bilateral auricles, erythema with hyperkeratosis on the sides of fingers and the bilateral elbows, and erythema on the extensor/flexor sides of the finger joints and the iliac regions. Fine crackles were audible on the dorsal side of the bilateral lower lung regions. We diagnosed clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis accompanied by rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia. While we initiated immunosuppressive therapy, the respiratory failure showed no responses. We performed endotoxin adsorption therapy using polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX-DHP). After the first PMX-DHP session, the respiratory condition was slightly improved but it soon deteriorated. At the second PMX-DHP session, subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema was noted. The patient died, showing no improvement in the respiratory condition. We measured the levels of serum interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-10 before and after PMX-DHP and compared them with previously reported levels. The levels of TNF-α and IL-10 showed no or slight changes, but those of IL-6 at the beginning of the treatment were higher compared with previous reports. After the first PMX-DHP, the IL-6 level decreased with slight improvement in respiratory condition. However, after the second PMX-DHP, it increased markedly with exacerbation of the respiratory failure.

28334850,Aicardi-Goutières syndrome protein TREX1 suppresses L1 and maintains genome integrity through exonuclease-independent ORF1p depletion.,"Maintaining genome integrity is important for cells and damaged DNA triggers autoimmunity. Previous studies have reported that Three-prime repair exonuclease 1(TREX1), an endogenous DNA exonuclease, prevents immune activation by depleting damaged DNA, thus preventing the development of certain autoimmune diseases. Consistently, mutations in TREX1 are linked with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and familial chilblain lupus. However, TREX1 mutants competent for DNA exonuclease activity are also linked to AGS. Here, we report a nuclease-independent involvement of TREX1 in preventing the L1 retrotransposon-induced DNA damage response. TREX1 interacted with ORF1p and altered its intracellular localization. Furthermore, TREX1 triggered ORF1p depletion and reduced the L1-mediated nicking of genomic DNA. TREX1 mutants related to AGS were deficient in inducing ORF1p depletion and could not prevent L1-mediated DNA damage. Therefore, our findings not only reveal a new mechanism for TREX1-mediated L1 suppression and uncover a new function for TREX1 in protein destabilization, but they also suggest a novel mechanism for TREX1-mediated suppression of innate immune activation through maintaining genome integrity.","['Li P', 'Du J', 'Goodier JL', 'Hou J', 'Kang J', 'Kazazian HH', 'Zhao K', 'Yu XF']",2017,45,8,Nucleic Acids Res,"Li P, et al.

AIM: To assess the effectiveness of topical application of betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream in patients with chronic chilblains.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, randomised clinical trial in a Dutch primary care setting.
METHOD: The study population consisted of 34 participants suffering from chronic chilblains. Intervention was topical application of betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream twice a day for 6 weeks compared with placebo. Primary outcome was the visual analogue scale on complaints (VOC). Secondary outcome was the visual analogue scale on disability (VOD). Both were assessed with a diary of daily scores on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. The authors took ambient temperatures into account, checked for a carry-over effect, performed additional analysis, and monitored adverse effects.

28112801,Efficacy and comparison of antimalarials in cutaneous lupus erythematosus subtypes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The antimalarials (AMs) hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have demonstrated variable cutaneous response rates in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).
OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the global cutaneous response rates to HCQ and CQ, with respect to CLE subtypes, based on previously published studies.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library between 1965 and December 2015. The proportions of responders to AMs according to CLE subtypes were extracted from individual studies and pooled using random-effects or fixed models. The odds ratio (OR) was used as the measure of association to compare the response rates between CLE subtypes and AMs.
RESULTS: Among 1990 courses of treatment with AMs from 31 included studies, the overall response rate to AMs was 63% [95% confidence interval (CI) 55-70], with important statistical heterogeneity across the included studies. HCQ had a higher overall efficacy than CQ, but this was not significant (OR 1·48, 95% CI 0·98-2·23). The response rate to AMs was different between CLE subtypes, ranging from 31% (95% CI 20-44) for chilblain lupus to 91% (95% CI 87-93) for acute CLE. The response was significantly higher for acute CLE than for subacute CLE and intermittent CLE. In case of failure of monotherapy with AM, the combination of quinacrine with HCQ or CQ seemed effective, whereas too little data were available to assess the efficacy of the switch to another AM agent.
CONCLUSIONS: Wide discrepancies in cutaneous response to AMs are observed between CLE subtypes. A specific therapeutic approach considering CLE subtypes may improve CLE management.","['Chasset F', 'Bouaziz JD', 'Costedoat-Chalumeau N', 'Francès C', 'Arnaud L']",2017,177,1,Br J Dermatol,"Chasset F, et al.

20301648,Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Most characteristically, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) manifests as an early-onset encephalopathy that usually, but not always, results in severe intellectual and physical disability. A subgroup of infants with AGS present at birth with abnormal neurologic findings, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia, a picture highly suggestive of congenital infection. Otherwise, most affected infants present at variable times after the first few weeks of life, frequently after a period of apparently normal development. Typically, they demonstrate the subacute onset of a severe encephalopathy characterized by extreme irritability, intermittent sterile pyrexias, loss of skills, and slowing of head growth. Over time, as many as 40% develop chilblain skin lesions on the fingers, toes, and ears. It is becoming apparent that atypical, sometimes milder, cases of AGS exist, and thus the true extent of the phenotype associated with pathogenic variants in the AGS-related genes is not yet known.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of AGS is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and characteristic abnormalities on cranial CT (calcification of the basal ganglia and white matter) and MRI (leukodystrophic changes); AND/OR by identification of one of the following: Biallelic pathogenic variants in

27633611,Cold-associated perniosis of the thighs histopathologically mimicking lupus. Six observations.,"BACKGROUND: Equestrian cold panniculitis has been described since 1980 in horse riders or in stable employees. Histological aspect is underdescribed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe clinical and histological features of six horse riding or stable employees patients presenting with upper lateral thigh lesions during the winter months between 2014 and 2016 in our dermatological department.
RESULTS: Six horse riding or stable employees ladies without any known disease presented with similar symptoms. They had urticarial or violaceous, slightly pruritic, sometimes necrotic lesions of the upper lateral thighs. Clinically, equestrian cold panniculitis, insect bite or a caustic dermatitis was suspected. Four of these patients had a cutaneous biopsy. They all showed a similar histological appearance resembling lupus erythematosus, combining dermo-epidermal lesions, with foci of interface dermatitis, an abundant dermal lymphocytic infiltrate and a dermal mucinosis. Hypodermal infiltration was present on samples including subcutis. Laboratory workup for systemic disease was unremarkable for two patients and not performed for the four others, having no other clinical sign of lupus. All patients improved rapidly with very high potent topical steroids.
CONCLUSION: Cold-associated perniosis of the thighs should be considered whenever a histopathological appearance of lupus is associated with lesions of the upper lateral thighs in patients practicing horse riding. This disease belongs to the spectrum of miscellaneous cold-induced dermatoses in which histopathological lesions identical to lupus can be encountered.","['Karkouche R', 'Bernigaud C', 'Fontugne J', 'Zehou O', 'Bellaud G', ""N'Diaye M"", 'Cherif K', 'Wolkenstein P', 'Chosidow O', 'Ortonne N', 'Ingen-Housz-Oro S']",2017,31,6,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Karkouche R, et al.

27621162,Nifedipine vs Placebo for Treatment of Chronic Chilblains: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"PURPOSE: Nifedipine is commonly prescribed for the treatment of chilblains (pernio, perniosis) on the basis of observational studies and a single small, older clinical trial. We aimed to confirm the proposed superiority of oral nifedipine 60 mg per day over placebo for treatment of chronic chilblains in primary care.
METHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, closely following the design of the older trial. A total of 32 patients with chronic chilblains were randomly assigned to nifedipine (30 mg controlled release twice a day) or placebo. The primary outcome was patient-reported complaints; the secondary outcome was patient-reported disability. Both were assessed from daily ratings on 100-mm visual analogue scales recorded in a diary. We took ambient temperatures into account and checked for a carry-over effect, and monitored for adverse effects.
RESULTS: After 6 weeks of treatment, mean scores on the visual analogue scale on complaints showed a nonsignificant difference of 1.84 mm (95% CI, -6.67 to 2.99 mm) in favor of nifedipine (P = .44). Mean scores on the visual analogue scale on disability showed a nonsignificant difference of 0.56 mm (95% CI, -2.97 to 4.09 mm) in favor of placebo (P = .75). There was no carry-over effect of prior study treatment. Nifedipine was associated with significantly lower systolic blood pressure and a significantly higher incidence of edema.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, nifedipine was not superior to placebo for treating chronic chilblains. These findings contrast with those of the older study and do not support routine use of nifedipine for this condition.","['Souwer IH', 'Bor JH', 'Smits P', 'Lagro-Janssen AL']",2016,14,5,Ann Fam Med,"Souwer IH, et al.

Pulmonary symptoms were associated with various clinical features of systemic inflammation and vasculitis involving the skin, and appeared at different ages. A strong interferon signature was found in all three cases. Disease was not responsive to corticosteroids, and lung transplantation was considered for all three subjects at an early age. One of them underwent double-lung transplantation, but she immediately experienced a primary graft dysfunction and died soon after. Recognized causes of familial interstitial lung disease were all excluded. All three subjects had a mutation in the previously described autoinflammatory disease called SAVI (stimulator of interferon genes [STING]-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy).

However, in some cases, the presenting symptom of concern may actually be cutaneous rather than neurological, leading to the misdiagnosis of the condition. We report the case of three teenage siblings who presented with a lifetime history of chilblain lesions, only one of whom had notable neurologic deficits. Additional findings included acrocyanosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, low-pitch hoarse voice, headache, and arthritis.

27566796,Familial chilblain lupus due to a gain-of-function mutation in STING.,"OBJECTIVES: Familial chilblain lupus is a monogenic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus caused by loss-of-function mutations in the nucleases TREX1 or SAMHD1. In a family without TREX1 or SAMHD1 mutation, we sought to determine the causative gene and the underlying disease pathology.
METHODS: Exome sequencing was used for disease gene identification. Structural analysis was performed by homology modelling and docking simulations. Type I interferon (IFN) activation was assessed in cells transfected with STING cDNA using an IFN-β reporter and Western blotting. IFN signatures in patient blood in response to tofacitinib treatment were measured by RT-PCR of IFN-stimulated genes.
RESULTS: In a multigenerational family with five members affected with chilblain lupus, we identified a heterozygous mutation of STING, a signalling molecule in the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway. Structural and functional analyses indicate that mutant STING enhances homodimerisation in the absence of its ligand cGAMP resulting in constitutive type I IFN activation. Treatment of two affected family members with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib led to a marked suppression of the IFN signature.
CONCLUSIONS: A heterozygous gain-of-function mutation in STING can cause familial chilblain lupus. These findings expand the genetic spectrum of type I IFN-dependent disorders and suggest that JAK inhibition may be of therapeutic value.","['König N', 'Fiehn C', 'Wolf C', 'Schuster M', 'Cura Costa E', 'Tüngler V', 'Alvarez HA', 'Chara O', 'Engel K', 'Goldbach-Mansky R', 'Günther C', 'Lee-Kirsch MA']",2017,76,2,Ann Rheum Dis,"König N, et al.

27091617,[Lumbar sympathectomy literature review over the past 15 years].,"INTRODUCTION: Lumbar sympathectomy (LS) irreversibly damages a part of the sympathetic trunk and adjacent ganglia between L1 and L5, typically between L2 and L4. The first LS was performed in 1923. Initially, it used to be performed very often; however, with the progress of vascular and endovascular surgery its importance gradually continues to decline. The aim of the paper is to present literature review focusing on LS over the past 15 years.
METHOD: Literature review of 113 academic articles found in academic journal databases.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Irreversible interruption of the efferent innervation leads to relative vasodilation of small vessels in lower extremities (α1-receptors blockade), and it reduces the volume of sweat due to inactivation of eccrine glands and nociception from lower limbs.
INDICATION: Raynaud´s phenomenon, thromboangitis obliterans, non-revascularizable peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (Fontain grade III-IV), hyperhidrosis, persistent pain in lower extremities, chronic pain of amputation stump, frostbites, chilblains.Effect: The three largest studies showed a positive effect in 63.6-93.4% cases of PAD and in 97%100% cases of hyperhidrosis. The positive effect was defined as warmer lower extremities, increased blood flow, acceleration of chronic defects healing, sweating disappearance and pain reduction.
CONCLUSION: Lumbar sympathectomy still remains a useful method in the treatment of above mentioned diseases if properly indicated.

27061329,Seasonal variations in dermatologic and dermatopathologic diagnoses: a retrospective 15-year analysis of dermatopathologic data.,"BACKGROUND: Certain dermatologic conditions are known to show seasonal variations in frequency, the reasons for which are unclear but in some cases may be attributable to changes in ambient weather conditions.
OBJECTIVES: The current study was conducted to determine whether seasonal trends might exist for dermatologic conditions including erythema multiforme, guttate psoriasis, erythema dyschromicum perstans (ashy dermatosis), pityriasis lichenoides, and pityriasis rosea.
METHODS: Data were derived from a 15-year retrospective review of electronic records from a large dermatopathology laboratory located in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA. Numbers of diagnoses per month and ""per season"" were determined. Pairwise comparisons of seasonal data were made using two-sample t-tests with significance set at P ≤ 0.05.
RESULTS: Perniosis (chilblains) was significantly more common in winter and spring (P = 0.001). Hand, foot, and mouth disease was statistically more prevalent in summer and autumn (P = 0.028). Erythema multiforme was most common in spring and summer (P = 0.004). Grover's disease was most common in winter and spring (P = 0.000039). Guttate psoriasis was non-significantly more common in winter and spring (P = 0.076). No statistically significant seasonal variation was found for erythema dyschromicum perstans (P = 0.899), pityriasis rosea (P = 0.727), or pityriasis lichenoides (P = 0.366).
CONCLUSIONS: This study found statistically significant seasonal trends for several dermatologic conditions. The study was primarily epidemiologic and was not intended to address histopathologic differences that might underlie the seasonal variations observed. However, further investigation of seasonal differences in the histopathology of erythema multiforme may prove interesting.","['Harvell JD', 'Selig DJ']",2016,55,10,Int J Dermatol,Harvell JD and Selig DJ.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of PFH in a population-based sample of subjects and to describe their semiological characteristics.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study of random samples of the general population in three geographic areas of France involved 802 subjects, 548 women and 254 men, aged 18 to 84 years. The diagnosis of PFH was made from a report by the subject of a history of recurrent haematoma in the fingers with a sudden, painful and unexpected occurrence. Diagnosis of associated conditions and evaluation of lifestyle variables were obtained through standardised medical interview and examination.
RESULTS: A history of PFH was detected in 71 subjects, with a prevalence of 1.2% in men and 12.4% in women; there was no significant regional variation. Onset before 40 years of age was rare. Besides female sex and age, no socio-economical nor lifestyle risk factors were detected. PFH was associated with Raynaud phenomenon and a history of chilblains, but no link with any health threatening disease was found. In addition to the sudden onset of pain and hematoma, the main clinical features were a frequent digital swelling during the painful attack, and their predominant location on the volar side of the first and second phalanges of the third or second fingers of the dominant hand.

26892242,Genetic spectrum of dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria in Chinese patients including a novel nonstop mutation in ADAR1 gene.,"BACKGROUND: Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) is a rare autosomal dominant cutaneous disorder caused by the mutations of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) gene. We present a clinical and genetic study of seven unrelated families and two sporadic cases with DSH for mutations in the full coding sequence of ADAR1 gene.
METHODS: ADAR1 gene was sequenced in seven unrelated families and two sporadic cases with DSH and 120 controls. Functional significance of the observed ADAR1 mutations was analyzed using PolyPhen 2, SIFT and DDIG-in.
RESULTS: We describe six novel mutations of the ADAR1 gene in Chinese patients with DSH including a nonstop mutation p.Stop1227R, which was firstly reported in ADAR1 gene. In silico analysis proves that all the mutations reported here are pathogenic.
CONCLUSION: This study is useful for functional studies of the protein and to define a diagnostic strategy for mutation screening of the ADAR1 gene. A three-generation family exhibiting phenotypic variability with a single germline ADAR1 mutation suggests that chilblain might aggravate the clinical phenotypes of DSH.","['Zhang G', 'Shao M', 'Li Z', 'Gu Y', 'Du X', 'Wang X', 'Li M']",2016,17,,BMC Med Genet,"Zhang G, et al.

The authors retrieved 6 cases for a re-evaluation of their clinicopathologic features and for an immunohistochemical assessment with antibodies anti-CD3, anti-CD20, and anti-CD123. All patients were women, aged 17-45 years. One of them had elevated antinuclear antibody titers. Available anamnestic data confirmed the triggering role of prolonged/intermittent exposure to cold (not necessarily for equestrian activities). The lesions affected the thighs, with a preferential, although not exclusive involvement of the upper lateral surface. The histopathological pattern was perivascular, superficial, and deep, extending toward the superficial fat lobules, with lymphocytic vasculitis and mucin deposition; clumps of CD123 cells were found in 4 of 6 cases. Cold-associated perniosis of the thighs cannot be considered as a panniculitis.

An extensive hypothesis-driven etiological assessment was performed and failed to detect the precise etiology during many years. We therefore decided to perform whole exome sequencing of the child-unaffected parents trio. A de novo pathogenic variant in the IFIH1 gene which has recently been shown to cause autosomal dominant forms of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome was identified. This child presented with a severe form with neonatal thrombocytopenia and hepatomegaly, the latter having been detected during late gestation. Although first milestones were uneventful, he progressively lost motor skills from the age of 12 months and developed severe spastic paraplegia. Brain imaging revealed white matter abnormalities and extensive calcifications. He also presented atypical skin lesions, different from chilblains. His medical history was marked by two episodes of acute pancreatitis. We provide herein the results of pathological examination including detailed description of the neuropathological hallmarks.

26702233,Single-Port Microthoracoscopic Sympathicotomy for the Treatment of Primary Palmar Hyperhidrosis: an Analysis of 56 Consecutive Cases.,"The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of single-port microthoracoscopic thoracic sympathicotomy for the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis. Between January 2008 and March 2013, 56 patients (36 male, 20 female; mean age 25.6 years, age range 16-39 years) underwent single-port microthoracoscopic thoracic sympathicotomy for palmar hyperhidrosis. Nineteen patients (33.9 %) had moderate palmar hyperhidrosis that could thoroughly wet a handkerchief, and 37 (66.1 %) had severe palmar hyperhidrosis with sweat dripping from the palm. Eight patients (14.3 %) had a positive family history, 34 (60.7 %) had plantar hyperhidrosis, 22 (39.3 %) had axillary hyperhidrosis, and 20 (35.7 %) had both plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis. In addition, 21 patients (37.5 %) had palmar pompholyx, five (8.9 %) had keratolysis exfoliativa, 10 (17.9 %) had chilblains, and nine (16.1 %) had palmar rhagades. A single 10-mm skin incision was made in the third intercostal space at the anterior axillary line, posterior to the pectoralis muscle. A 5-mm microthoracoscope and a 3-mm microelectrocautery hook were inserted through a single port into the thoracic cavity. The third and fourth ribs were identified, and the sympathetic chain was cut using the microelectrocautery hook. The bypassing nerve fibers, such as the Kuntz nerve fiber bundle, were ablated for 2-3 cm along the surface of the rib. The palmar temperature was recorded before and after sympathicotomy. All 56 procedures were completed using single-port microthoracoscopy. No postoperative complications such as hemorrhage, wound infection, hemopneumothorax, bradycardia, or Horner's syndrome were observed. Bilateral procedures were completed in 20-56 min (mean 30 min). The palmar temperature increased by 2.2 ± 0.3 °C after surgery. The postoperative hospital stay was 1-4 days (mean 2.5 days). Mild compensatory sweating of the back and thigh occurred in five patients (8.9 %) at 2-3 days after surgery and disappeared at 7-15 days. The patients were followed up for 28.5 months (range 1-62 months). Hyperhidrosis resolved in both hands after surgery, and the previously wet, cold hands became dry and warm. The efficacy rate was 100 %. Plantar hyperhidrosis was also significantly reduced in 33 of the 34 patients with this condition (remission rate 97.1 %), and axillary hyperhidrosis was significantly reduced in 19 of 22 patients (remission rate 86.4 %). Eighteen of the 20 patients (90.0 %) with both plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis experienced significant alleviation of their symptoms. Single-port microthoracoscopic thoracic sympathicotomy is a safe, convenient, and effective method of treating palmar hyperhidrosis. This procedure can accurately locate the sympathetic chain with a small incision, minimal invasiveness, and good cosmetic results. The procedure is suitable for extensive clinical use.","['Shi H', 'Shu Y', 'Shi W', 'Lu S', 'Sun C']",2015,77,4,Indian J Surg,"Shi H, et al.

26697993,Musculoskeletal manifestations of Fabry disease: A retrospective study.,"OBJECTIVES: Fabry disease is a rare X-linked metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Both males and females can be affected. The main presenting symptom is pain in the extremities, whereas at a more advanced stage, the manifestations include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmia, proteinuria, chronic kidney dysfunction, stroke, and hearing loss. When not diagnosed and treated, Fabry disease causes early death. No studies specifically designed to describe the musculoskeletal manifestations of Fabry disease are available.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of patients receiving follow-up at a Fabry disease referral center. We described the musculoskeletal manifestations and analyzed the differential diagnoses.
RESULTS: Our study included 40 patients belonging to 20 families, including 25 females with a mean age of 44.2 years (range, 20-76 years) and 15 males with a mean age of 40.1 years (range, 16-61 years). Mean age at the diagnosis of Fabry disease was 37.2 years (range, 7-71 years) in the females and 26.9 years (range, 9-51 years) in the males. Specific enzyme replacement therapy was given to 10 (40%) females and 12 (80%) males. Musculoskeletal manifestations were as follows: past or present pain in the extremities (13 females and 10 males), combined in some patients with vasomotor disorders in the extremities and telangiectasia; exercise intolerance (12 females and 12 males); osteoporotic fractures (2 brothers aged 45 and 44 years, respectively); osteoporosis (3 females, aged 57, 63, and 75 years, respectively), which contributed to death in the oldest patient; osteopenia (2 females aged 38 and 47 years, respectively; and 1 male aged 43 years); Charcot foot and lymphedema with serious infectious complications (4 males older than 40 years), with avascular osteonecrosis of the lower limbs in 2 cases; toe amputations (3 cases); bilateral lower-limb amputation (1 case); abnormally slender lower limbs (5 females and 8 males); acute gout (3 males with severe chronic kidney failure); and carpal tunnel syndrome (1 female and 1 male, both younger than 40 years). Mistaken diagnoses that were made at an early stage, contributing to delay the identification of Fabry disease, included rheumatic fever (2 females and 2 males), growing pains (2 males), pain with paralysis (1 female), chilblains of the lower limbs (1 female), and erythermalgia (1 female). In adulthood, the following mistaken diagnoses were made: Sjögren's syndrome and/or sicca syndrome (6 females), systemic sclerosis (1 male), dysautonomia (1 female), and familial Mediterranean fever (1 female).
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of Fabry disease is usually delayed, due to confusion with more common disorders. Musculoskeletal manifestations may constitute the presenting symptoms. Past or present pain in the extremities is typical. Osteoporosis may develop early and become severe. Together with the family history, the presence of musculoskeletal manifestations can lead to the correct diagnosis by prompting alpha-galactosidase assays in males and genetic testing in females. Fabry disease is often responsible for musculoskeletal manifestations, of which the most common are pain in the extremities and osteoporosis. These manifestations can be inaugural and lead to diagnostic wanderings. They require specific treatment strategies.","['Lidove O', 'Zeller V', 'Chicheportiche V', 'Meyssonnier V', 'Sené T', 'Godot S', 'Ziza JM']",2016,83,4,Joint Bone Spine,"Lidove O, et al.

26286795,"Pattern of chilblains in a high altitude region of Ladakh, India.","BACKGROUND: Extreme sub-zero temperature in winters (15 °C to -25 °C), high velocity winds and wind-chill factor pose risk to those who resides at the high altitude environment to develop cold related injuries like chilblains and frostbite. The aim of this study was to study the patterns of chilblains in high altitude region like Ladakh.
METHODS: The study was conducted at Dermatology outpatient department of Military Hospital, Leh from 1 Sep 2009 to 31 May 2010. Patients, satisfying clinical criteria for the diagnosis of chilblains were included into the study. Detailed history and thorough clinical examination was conducted. Complete blood count and Urine routine examination was carried out in every patient. Anti Nuclear Factor tests were carried out in only those who had history suggestive of connective tissue disease.
RESULTS: Total 108 (5.75%) were diagnosed to have chilblains. Only a single case of chilblain was found in a local resident (p < 0.005). Family history of chilblains was present in 10 (9.2%) patients, there was recurrence in 12 (11.1%) and 21 patients (19.4%) were smokers. Most (63.8%) of the patients, had BMI between 20 and 22 kg/m(2) (mean = 20.03 kg/m(2); 95% CI = 19.68-20.38 and SD 1.82). 42.1% of cases of chilblains also had hyperhidrosis (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In a HA area like Ladakh, the non-natives suffer maximum from chilblains. This could be explained by the protective genetic adaptability of natives to extreme cold environment and their protective life style against cold.

26284909,Unusual cutaneous features associated with a heterozygous gain-of-function mutation in IFIH1: overlap between Aicardi-Goutières and Singleton-Merten syndromes.,"Cutaneous lesions described as chilblain lupus occur in the context of familial chilblain lupus or Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. To date, seven genes related to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome have been described. The most recently described encodes the cytosolic double-stranded RNA receptor IFIH1 (also known as MDA5), a key component of the antiviral type I interferon-mediated innate immune response. Enhanced type I interferon signalling secondary to gain-of-function mutations in IFIH1 can result in a range of neuroinflammatory phenotypes including classical Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. It is of note that none of the patients with a neurological phenotype so far described with mutations in this gene was reported to demonstrate cutaneous involvement. We present a family segregating a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in IFIH1 showing dermatological involvement as a prominent feature, variably associated with neurological disturbance and premature tooth loss. All three affected individuals exhibited increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes in whole blood, and the mutant protein resulted in enhanced interferon signalling in vitro, both in the basal state and following ligand stimulation. Our results further extend the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in IFIH1, indicating that the disease can be confined predominantly to the skin, while also highlighting phenotypic overlap with both Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and Singleton-Merten syndrome.","['Bursztejn AC', 'Briggs TA', 'del Toro Duany Y', 'Anderson BH', ""O'Sullivan J"", 'Williams SG', 'Bodemer C', 'Fraitag S', 'Gebhard F', 'Leheup B', 'Lemelle I', 'Oojageer A', 'Raffo E', 'Schmitt E', 'Rice GI', 'Hur S', 'Crow YJ']",2015,173,6,Br J Dermatol,"Bursztejn AC, et al.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 5 patients with pernio who were seen at our institution between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2011, and had undergone a noninvasive arterial vascular study of the upper extremities that corresponded to a site of clinical involvement of pernio and who had also undergone vasospastic testing and ice water immersion as part of the noninvasive arterial vascular study protocol.
RESULTS: Vascular testing in all patients (mean age 37.8 years; 4 women) demonstrated vasospasm with ice water immersion.

26223655,Cutting Edge: cGAS Is Required for Lethal Autoimmune Disease in the Trex1-Deficient Mouse Model of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome.,"Detection of intracellular DNA triggers activation of the stimulator of IFN genes-dependent IFN-stimulatory DNA (ISD) pathway, which is essential for antiviral immune responses. However, chronic activation of this pathway is implicated in autoimmunity. Mutations in TREX1, a 3' repair exonuclease that degrades cytosolic DNA, cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and chilblain lupus. Trex1 (-/-) mice develop lethal, IFN-driven autoimmune disease that is dependent on activation of the ISD pathway, but the DNA sensors that detect the endogenous DNA that accumulates in Trex1 (-/-) mice have not been defined. Multiple DNA sensors have been proposed to activate the ISD pathway, including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). In this study, we show that Trex1 (-/-) mice lacking cGAS are completely protected from lethality, exhibit dramatically reduced tissue inflammation, and fail to develop autoantibodies. These findings implicate cGAS as a key driver of autoimmune disease and suggest that cGAS inhibitors may be useful therapeutics for Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and related autoimmune diseases.","['Gray EE', 'Treuting PM', 'Woodward JJ', 'Stetson DB']",2015,195,5,J Immunol,"Gray EE, et al.

Others are permanent or semi-permanent, such as acrocyanosis, chilblains, spontaneous haematoma of the fingers, acrocholose and digital ischaemia or necrosis. Diagnosis of the type of acrosyndrome at issue is based primarily on clinical examination and history-taking. Capillaroscopy and antinuclear antibody assay are key examinations essential for distinguishing between primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and connective tissue disorders. Complete blood counts, screening for thyroid dysthyroidism, and antinuclear antibody assay can help distinguish between primary erythromelalgia and erythromelalgia secondary to a systemic disease, principally myeloproliferative syndrome. In the case of acrocyanosis, spontaneous digital haematomas and typical bilateral chilblains, examinations are of no value. For the other permanent and semi-permanent acrosyndromes such as digital ischaemia and purpuric or livedoid lesions, screening for arterial or thrombotic disease is necessary.",['Senet P'],2015,142,8-9,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Senet P.

25992765,Stimulator of Interferon Genes-Associated Vasculopathy With Onset in Infancy: A Mimic of Childhood Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis.,"IMPORTANCE: The type I interferonopathies comprise a recently recognized group of mendelian diseases characterized by an upregulation of type I interferon signaling. These monogenic phenotypes include classic Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and syndromic forms of systemic lupus erythematosus, including familial chilblain lupus and spondyloenchondrodysplasia. Dermatologic features provide a major diagnostic clue to this disease grouping, as exemplified by the recently described stimulator of interferon genes-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) caused by gain-of-function mutations in TMEM173.
OBSERVATIONS: We describe a male child who, from the age of 2 months, had significant cutaneous disease that manifested as red violaceous plaques of the cheeks, nose, ears, fingers, and toes that progressed to gangrenous necrosis. In addition to his severe cutaneous vasculopathy, he experienced recurrent fevers, interstitial lung disease, and failure to thrive. His clinical syndrome was refractory to multiple immunosuppressive therapies. Evidence of marked upregulation of type I interferon signaling was observed in peripheral blood, and genetic testing identified a de novo germline mutation in TMEM173, confirming a diagnosis of SAVI 7 years after the onset of his disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This observational report describes a new case of SAVI, a recently defined monogenic inflammatory phenotype, that exemplifies an emerging group of disorders related to primary upregulation of type I interferon signaling.","['Munoz J', 'Rodière M', 'Jeremiah N', 'Rieux-Laucat F', 'Oojageer A', 'Rice GI', 'Rozenberg F', 'Crow YJ', 'Bessis D']",2015,151,8,JAMA Dermatol,"Munoz J, et al.

25848017,Exonuclease TREX1 degrades double-stranded DNA to prevent spontaneous lupus-like inflammatory disease.,"The TREX1 gene encodes a potent DNA exonuclease, and mutations in TREX1 cause a spectrum of lupus-like autoimmune diseases. Most lupus patients develop autoantibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but the source of DNA antigen is unknown. The TREX1 D18N mutation causes a monogenic, cutaneous form of lupus called familial chilblain lupus, and the TREX1 D18N enzyme exhibits dysfunctional dsDNA-degrading activity, providing a link between dsDNA degradation and nucleic acid-mediated autoimmune disease. We determined the structure of the TREX1 D18N protein in complex with dsDNA, revealing how this exonuclease uses a novel DNA-unwinding mechanism to separate the polynucleotide strands for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) loading into the active site. The TREX1 D18N dsDNA interactions coupled with catalytic deficiency explain how this mutant nuclease prevents dsDNA degradation. We tested the effects of TREX1 D18N in vivo by replacing the TREX1 WT gene in mice with the TREX1 D18N allele. The TREX1 D18N mice exhibit systemic inflammation, lymphoid hyperplasia, vasculitis, and kidney disease. The observed lupus-like inflammatory disease is associated with immune activation, production of autoantibodies to dsDNA, and deposition of immune complexes in the kidney. Thus, dysfunctional dsDNA degradation by TREX1 D18N induces disease in mice that recapitulates many characteristics of human lupus. Failure to clear DNA has long been linked to lupus in humans, and these data point to dsDNA as a key substrate for TREX1 and a major antigen source in mice with dysfunctional TREX1 enzyme.","['Grieves JL', 'Fye JM', 'Harvey S', 'Grayson JM', 'Hollis T', 'Perrino FW']",2015,112,16,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Grieves JL, et al.

The incidence of thymoma in MG is reported as ∼10%-15%. The incidence of extrathoracic metastatic thymoma is exceedingly rare and may present years after resection. Associations between thymoma and immunodeficiency have also been described, including Good syndrome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the clinical course, investigations, and treatments performed in a patient presenting with a myasthenic crisis in the setting of acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive generalized MG 10 years postthymectomy. Computed tomography imaging revealed 2 pancreatic lesions, but no residual thoracic thymoma. Biopsy confirmed metastatic pancreatic thymoma, which was successfully resected. His course was further complicated by cytomegalovirus retinitis with a depressed CD4 count and perniosis.

25659384,[Genetics of lupus erythematosus].,"Lupus erythematosus is a prototypic autoimmune disease that can be triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by environmental exposures. The disease is based on an uncontrolled activation of the immune system that recognizes self antigens and induces inflammatory disease flares. The multifactorial pathogenesis is based on a polygenic model of inheritance with multiple various susceptibility genes elevating the disease risk. Many of these polymorphisms have been recently identified by genome-wide association studies. Monogenic forms of lupus erythematosus are rare. The identification of their underlying pathogenesis is important for the recognition of main mechanistic pathways in lupus as demonstrated by the history of defects in the complement system. The monogenic, autosomal dominant inherited familial chilblain lupus is characterized by cold-induced infiltrates on acral locations occurring in early childhood. Molecular exploration of the disease pathogenesis revealed that autoimmunity and especially lupus erythematosus can be induced by defects in intracellular elimination of nucleic acids and the subsequent type I-IFN-dependent activation of the innate immune system. This mechanism extends the concept of lupus pathogenesis: both defects in the extra- and intracellular elimination of autoantigens can lead to activation of the innate and adaptive immune system.",['Günther C'],2015,66,2,Hautarzt,Günther C.

We report on 374 patients from 299 families with mutations in these seven genes. Most patients conformed to one of two fairly stereotyped clinical profiles; either exhibiting an in utero disease-onset (74 patients; 22.8% of all patients where data were available), or a post-natal presentation, usually within the first year of life (223 patients; 68.6%), characterized by a sub-acute encephalopathy and a loss of previously acquired skills. Other clinically distinct phenotypes were also observed; particularly, bilateral striatal necrosis (13 patients; 3.6%) and non-syndromic spastic paraparesis (12 patients; 3.4%). We recorded 69 deaths (19.3% of patients with follow-up data). Of 285 patients for whom data were available, 210 (73.7%) were profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function. Chilblains, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy, intracerebral vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, bowel inflammation and systemic lupus erythematosus were seen frequently enough to be confirmed as real associations with the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome phenotype. We observed a robust relationship between mutations in all seven genes with increased type I interferon activity in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and the increased expression of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts in peripheral blood. We recorded a positive correlation between the level of cerebrospinal fluid interferon activity assayed within one year of disease presentation and the degree of subsequent disability. Interferon-stimulated gene transcripts remained high in most patients, indicating an ongoing disease process. On the basis of substantial morbidity and mortality, our data highlight the urgent need to define coherent treatment strategies for the phenotypes associated with mutations in the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-related genes. Our findings also make it clear that a window of therapeutic opportunity exists relevant to the majority of affected patients and indicate that the assessment of type I interferon activity might serve as a useful biomarker in future clinical trials.","['Crow YJ', 'Chase DS', 'Lowenstein Schmidt J', 'Szynkiewicz M', 'Forte GM', 'Gornall HL', 'Oojageer A', 'Anderson B', 'Pizzino A', 'Helman G', 'Abdel-Hamid MS', 'Abdel-Salam GM', 'Ackroyd S', 'Aeby A', 'Agosta G', 'Albin C', 'Allon-Shalev S', 'Arellano M', 'Ariaudo G', 'Aswani V', 'Babul-Hirji R', 'Baildam EM', 'Bahi-Buisson N', 'Bailey KM', 'Barnerias C', 'Barth M', 'Battini R', 'Beresford MW', 'Bernard G', 'Bianchi M', 'Billette de Villemeur T', 'Blair EM', 'Bloom M', 'Burlina AB', 'Carpanelli ML', 'Carvalho DR', 'Castro-Gago M', 'Cavallini A', 'Cereda C', 'Chandler KE', 'Chitayat DA', 'Collins AE', 'Sierra Corcoles C', 'Cordeiro NJ', 'Crichiutti G', 'Dabydeen L', 'Dale RC', ""D'Arrigo S"", 'De Goede CG', 'De Laet C', 'De Waele LM', 'Denzler I', 'Desguerre I', 'Devriendt K', 'Di Rocco M', 'Fahey MC', 'Fazzi E', 'Ferrie CD', 'Figueiredo A', 'Gener B', 'Goizet C', 'Gowrinathan NR', 'Gowrishankar K', 'Hanrahan D', 'Isidor B', 'Kara B', 'Khan N', 'King MD', 'Kirk EP', 'Kumar R', 'Lagae L', 'Landrieu P', 'Lauffer H', 'Laugel V', 'La Piana R', 'Lim MJ', 'Lin JP', 'Linnankivi T', 'Mackay MT', 'Marom DR', 'Marques Lourenço C', 'McKee SA', 'Moroni I', 'Morton JE', 'Moutard ML', 'Murray K', 'Nabbout R', 'Nampoothiri S', 'Nunez-Enamorado N', 'Oades PJ', 'Olivieri I', 'Ostergaard JR', 'Pérez-Dueñas B', 'Prendiville JS', 'Ramesh V', 'Rasmussen M', 'Régal L', 'Ricci F', 'Rio M', 'Rodriguez D', 'Roubertie A', 'Salvatici E', 'Segers KA', 'Sinha GP', 'Soler D', 'Spiegel R', 'Stödberg TI', 'Straussberg R', 'Swoboda KJ', 'Suri M', 'Tacke U', 'Tan TY', 'te Water Naude J', 'Wee Teik K', 'Thomas MM', 'Till M', 'Tonduti D', 'Valente EM', 'Van Coster RN', 'van der Knaap MS', 'Vassallo G', 'Vijzelaar R', 'Vogt J', 'Wallace GB', 'Wassmer E', 'Webb HJ', 'Whitehouse WP', 'Whitney RN', 'Zaki MS', 'Zuberi SM', 'Livingston JH', 'Rozenberg F', 'Lebon P', 'Vanderver A', 'Orcesi S', 'Rice GI']",2015,167A,2,Am J Med Genet A,"Crow YJ, et al.

The aim of this study was to explore the clinical, imaging and genetic features of a family with AGS, which may contribute to definite diagnosis, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of this rare disease in China. We summarized the characteristics of AGS through reviewing related references.
METHOD: Information of the proband and other family members as well as their DNA samples were collected. All the exons and exon-intron boundaries of pathogenic genes were amplified with PCR and were directly sequenced for genomic DNA. And we reviewed the reports of 252 cases.
RESULT: (1) The proband was a 6 years plus 7 months old boy. He presented with severe developmental delay and abnormal posture mainly as torsion of limbs. By physical examination he was found to have some chilblain-like skin lesions at the end of limbs and microcephaly. The CT scan of his head displayed multiple calcification, especially in the basal ganglia. The MRI of his head displayed a hypointense signal in T1-weighted (T1W) images and a hyperintense signal in T2-weighted (T2W) in cerebral white matter and cystic lesions in temporal white matter. The younger sister of the proband presented with chilblain-like skin lesions on her face and the end of limbs had no developmental delay. The CT of her head showed multiple calcification, especially in the basal ganglia. (2) Two mutations were identified in TREX1, one was a novel nonsense mutation (c.294_295insA), and the other was a known pathogenic mutation (c.868_885del). (3) The common performances of AGS included mental retardation [92% (231/252) ], dystonia [75% (189/252)], microcephaly [63% (159/252) ], chilblain [42% (106/252) ], basal ganglia calcification [100% (252/252)], brain atrophy[88% (222/252)] and cerebral white matter lesions [86% (217/252)]. TREX1 [38% (96/252) ] and RNASEH2B [23% (58/252)]are the most common pathogenic genes.

25517357,Familial chilblain lupus due to a novel mutation in the exonuclease III domain of 3' repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1).,"IMPORTANCE: Familial chilblain lupus is a rare, autosomal dominant form of lupus erythematosus characterized by cold-induced inflammatory lesions at acral locations presenting in early childhood. Familial chilblain lupus is usually caused by a mutation in TREX1 (3' repair exonuclease 1).
OBSERVATIONS: We report on a family with dominant chilblain lupus segregating a novel TREX1 mutation (c.585C>G; H195Q) within the highly conserved exonuclease (Exo) III domain. Affected family members experienced cold-induced chilblain lesions of varying degrees, ranging from bluish-red infiltrations to mutilating necrotic ulcerations. In addition, all patients showed signs of systemic disease, such as arthritis, lymphopenia, or antinuclear antibodies. An increased expression of myxovirus resistance protein A in the skin and induction of interferon-stimulated genes in peripheral blood cells demonstrated activation of type I interferon.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case further implicates type I interferon-dependent innate immune activation in the pathogenesis of TREX1-associated familial chilblain lupus. Unlike previously reported TREX1 mutations, which affect the Exo I or Exo II domains, the mutation presented here alters the Exo III domain, suggesting a particular role of mutations within the catalytic Exo domains in the pathogenesis of familial chilblain lupus. The high prevalence of extracutaneous manifestations, along with activation of type I interferon, underlines the systemic nature of familial chilblain lupus.","['Günther C', 'Berndt N', 'Wolf C', 'Lee-Kirsch MA']",2015,151,4,JAMA Dermatol,"Günther C, et al.

25448505,"Ethnomedicinal plants used to treat skin diseases by Tharu community of district Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand, India.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tharu community is the largest primitive indigenous community of the Uttarakhand, India. In this article we have scientifically enumerated medicinal plants and herbal preparations used by the Tharu community to treat various skin diseases, and discussed dermatological properties of these plants in the light of previous ethnomedicinal, microbiological, pharmacological, toxicological, phytochemical and clinical studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethnomedicinal survey was conducted in different villages of Tharu community located in district Udham Singh Nagar, Uttarakhand, India. Ethnomedicinal information on plants used to treat various skin diseases was collected from 122 individuals (93 males and 29 females), including 35 experienced herbal practitioners and 87 local villagers. For each of the recorded plant species the use value (UV) and fidelity level (FL) was calculated. The informant consensus factor (Fic) was also calculated to find out the homogeneity in the information given by the informants.
RESULTS: A total of 90 plant species belonging to 86 genera and 48 families were used by the Tharu community to treat various skin diseases viz., wounds (38 spp.), boils (32 spp.), cuts (18 spp.), leprosy (11 spp.), eczema (10 spp.), itching (7 spp.), ringworm (5 spp.), burns (4 spp.), leucoderma (4 spp.), cracked heels (2 spp.), dandruff (3 spp.), body infection (2 spp.), chilblains (2 spp.), hair fall (2 spp.) and toes infection (2 spp.). Information on botanical name, family, vernacular name, ailments treated, mode and dose of herbal preparations, UV and FL values are provided for each of the recorded species. According to UV value most preferred plant species used to treat skin diseases by Tharu community was Ricinus communis L. followed by Tridax procumbens (L.) L., Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Ageratum conyzoides and Allium cepa L.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study has revealed significant information on various medicinal plants used to treat skin diseases by Tharu community. Literature review has confirmed most of the claims made by the Tharu community regarding treatment of various skin diseases by the reported plants. The literature review has also revealed that products from very few of the reported plants are available in market, while most of the reported plants are still under preclinical or clinical trials. There are various known phytochemicals, and antibiotic, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal agents present in these plants which may be synthesized or transformed to make pharmaceuticals. Some of the reported plants have shown promising results in preclinical trails and there is a need of clinical trials to see their safety and efficacy in treating various skin diseases. These plants may be targeted for development of new medicines, ointments or drugs for the treatment of skin diseases.

25416648,Chilblains in Southern California: two case reports and a review of the literature.,"INTRODUCTION: Chilblains or perniosis is an acrally located cutaneous eruption that occurs with exposure to cold. Chilblains can be classified into primary and secondary forms. The primary or idiopathic form is not associated with an underlying disease and is clinically indistinguishable from the secondary form. The secondary form is associated with an underlying condition such as connective tissue disease, monoclonal gammopathy, cryoglobulinemia, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Histopathology cannot accurately help distinguish the primary from secondary forms of chilblains. This article will raise the awareness of chilblains by presenting two unusual case reports of chilblains in men from Southern California with discussion of the appropriate evaluation and treatment of this condition.
CASE PRESENTATIONS: Case 1: A 56-year-old Caucasian man presented in January to a Southern California primary care clinic with a report of tingling and burning in both feet, followed by bluish discoloration and swelling as well as blistering. He had no unusual cold exposure prior to the onset of his symptoms. He had a history of ""white attacks"" in his hands consistent with Raynaud's phenomenon. His symptoms gradually resolved over a 3-week period. Case 2: A 53-year-old Caucasian man also presented to a Southern California clinic in January with a 3-week history of painful tingling in his toes, and subsequent purplish-black discoloration of the toes in both feet. His symptoms occurred 1 week after a skiing trip. He had partial improvement with warming measures. His symptoms resolved 2 weeks after his initial presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: Chilblains is a relatively uncommon entity in warmer climates but can present during the winter months. Primary care providers in warmer climates such as Southern California in the USA may be unfamiliar with its presentation. It can be diagnosed clinically by the appearance of typical lesions during the cold damp season. Through a thorough history, physical examination and selected laboratory evaluation, underlying connective tissue disease or a mimic such as vasculitis or cutaneous leukemia can be excluded.","['Gordon R', 'Arikian AM', 'Pakula AS']",2014,8,,J Med Case Rep,"Gordon R, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that severe cold exposure not mounting to frostbite may be associated with acroosteolysis.
METHODS: A 16-year-old girl with acroosteolysis presenting with brachyonychia was fully investigated for possible cause of her nail and bone deformity.
RESULTS: Lab investigations including Parathormone levels, Anti Scl 70, ANA, Anti-CCP and RF levels were all normal. X-ray imaging revealed resorption of the tufts of the terminal phalanges bilaterally. Disruption of nail fold capillaries with sluggish flow in capillary loops was evident on capillaroscopy.
CONCLUSION: It had been repeatedly reported that frostbite, Raynaud's disease and diseases associated with repeated chilblains may be associated with secondary cold-induced acroosteolysis.

It typically presents a triphasic colour change from white (palor; vasoconstriction) to blue (cyanosis) and red (reactive hyperaemia). The symptoms are based on a primary RP in 90 %. Secondary RP is a symptom of an underlying disease. RP has to be distinguished from other colour changes of the distal extremities like acrocyanosis, erythromelalgia, perniosis and Chilblain-Lupus. Patients history, clinical examination, ANA, ESR/CRP and nailfold capillaroscopy are essential for the early diagnosis of an underlying disease. The initiation of angiologic tests is important in patients with digital ulcers, necrosis or gangrene. Important differential diagnoses in secondary RP are autoimmune rheumatic diseases like systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematodes as well as vascular diseases like arterial occlusions and compression syndromes or concomitant medication (i. e. beta-blocker).","['Ahrazoglu M', 'Moinzadeh P', 'Hunzelmann N']",2014,139,20,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,"Ahrazoglu M, et al.

24626647,Chilblains in Turkey: a case-control study.,"BACKGROUND: Chilblains are rather common in winter months in our country.
OBJECTIVES: Determination of demographical and clinical characteristics of patients presenting with chilblains in Diyarbakir, Turkey. Evaluation of body mass index (BMI) as risk factor for development of chilblains.
METHODS: Sixty-nine patients who were diagnosed as chilblains at our outpatient clinics were included in this study. No exclusion criteria were sought. Demographical data including height and weight and answers to questions related to personal history were recorded. A control group consisting of 108 controls were chosen from among patients presenting with complaints of hair loss. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 17.0.
RESULTS: Of the 69 patients with chilblains, 45 (65.2%) were females and 24 (34.8%) were males. Mean age (± SD) of the patients was 21 ± 9. 71.2% of the patients complained of itching, 51.6% of pain, 31.3% of burning in the lesions. 61.3% of the patients reported recurrence of the lesions every winter season. Mean BMI of the patients was 20.5 ± 2.9. Mean BMI of the controls was 22.4 ± 3.7 and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Low BMI may be a risk factor contributing to development of chilblains in persons exposed to cold weather conditions. Apart from external factors, there seems to be a personal tendency to develop lesions, as many patients report recurrences every year. Diagnosis of chilblains requires wariness, as history of cold exposure may not be evident.","['Akkurt ZM', 'Ucmak D', 'Yildiz K', 'Yürüker SK', 'Celik HÖ']",2014,89,1,An Bras Dermatol,"Akkurt ZM, et al.

24616097,The Arg-62 residues of the TREX1 exonuclease act across the dimer interface contributing to catalysis in the opposing protomers.,"TREX1 is a 3'-deoxyribonuclease that degrades single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA) to prevent inappropriate nucleic acid-mediated immune activation. More than 40 different disease-causing TREX1 mutations have been identified exhibiting dominant and recessive genetic phenotypes in a spectrum of autoimmune disorders. Mutations in TREX1 at positions Asp-18 and Asp-200 to His and Asn exhibit dominant autoimmune phenotypes associated with the clinical disorders familial chilblain lupus and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Our previous biochemical studies showed that the TREX1 dominant autoimmune disease phenotype depends upon an intact DNA-binding process coupled with dysfunctional active site chemistry. Studies here show that the TREX1 Arg-62 residues extend across the dimer interface into the active site of the opposing protomer to coordinate substrate DNA and to affect catalysis in the opposing protomer. The TREX1(R62A/R62A) homodimer exhibits ∼50-fold reduced ssDNA and dsDNA degradation activities relative to TREX1(WT). The TREX1 D18H, D18N, D200H, and D200N dominant mutant enzymes were prepared as compound heterodimers with the TREX1 R62A substitution in the opposing protomer. The TREX1(D18H/R62A), TREX1(D18N/R62A), TREX1(D200H/R62A), and TREX1(D200N/R62A) compound heterodimers exhibit higher levels of ss- and dsDNA degradation activities than the homodimers demonstrating the requirement for TREX1 Arg-62 residues to provide necessary structural elements for full catalytic activity in the opposing TREX1 protomer. This concept is further supported by the loss of dominant negative effects in the TREX1 D18H, D18N, D200H, and D200N compound heterodimers. These data provide compelling evidence for the required TREX1 dimeric structure for full catalytic function.","['Fye JM', 'Coffin SR', 'Orebaugh CD', 'Hollis T', 'Perrino FW']",2014,289,16,J Biol Chem,"Fye JM, et al.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients with pernio seen at our institution between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011.
RESULTS: Of 104 patients with pernio (mean age at diagnosis, 38.3 years), 82 (79%) were women. Pernio affected the toes in 85 patients (82%) and the fingers in 31 (30%). Thirty-eight patients (37%) had at least 1 abnormal laboratory test result, and test results were positive for cold agglutinins in 11 (55%) of 20 tested patients. Results were negative for cryoglobulins in all tested patients (n=53). Four patients (4%) had connective tissue disease (nonlupus) associated with pernio; 3 patients (3%) had an associated hematologic malignant disease. Conservative treatments (eg, warming, drying, and smoking cessation) provided complete response in 23 (82%) of 28 patients with follow-up data.

24300241,A nationwide survey of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome patients identifies a strong association between dominant TREX1 mutations and chilblain lesions: Japanese cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare, genetically determined, early onset progressive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune manifestations. AGS is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The disease is rare, therefore the clinical manifestations and genotype-phenotype correlations, particularly with regard to autoimmune diseases, are still unclear. Here we performed a nationwide survey of AGS patients in Japan and analysed the genetic and clinical data.
METHODS: Patients were recruited via questionnaires sent to paediatric or adult neurologists in Japanese hospitals and institutions. Genetic analysis was performed and clinical data were collected.
RESULTS: Fourteen AGS patients were identified from 13 families; 10 harboured genetic mutations. Three patients harboured dominant-type TREX1 mutations. These included two de novo cases: one caused by a novel heterozygous p.His195Tyr mutation and the other by a novel somatic mosaicism resulting in a p.Asp200Asn mutation. Chilblain lesions were observed in all patients harbouring dominant-type TREX1 mutations. All three patients harbouring SAMHD1 mutations were diagnosed with autoimmune diseases, two with SLE and one with SS. The latter is the first reported case.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report a nationwide AGS survey, which identified more patients with sporadic AGS carrying de novo dominant-type TREX1 mutations than expected. There was a strong association between the dominant-type TREX1 mutations and chilblain lesions, and between SAMHD1 mutations and autoimmunity. These findings suggest that rheumatologists should pay attention to possible sporadic AGS cases presenting with neurological disorders and autoimmune manifestations.","['Abe J', 'Nakamura K', 'Nishikomori R', 'Kato M', 'Mitsuiki N', 'Izawa K', 'Awaya T', 'Kawai T', 'Yasumi T', 'Toyoshima I', 'Hasegawa K', 'Ohshima Y', 'Hiragi T', 'Sasahara Y', 'Suzuki Y', 'Kikuchi M', 'Osaka H', 'Ohya T', 'Ninomiya S', 'Fujikawa S', 'Akasaka M', 'Iwata N', 'Kawakita A', 'Funatsuka M', 'Shintaku H', 'Ohara O', 'Ichinose H', 'Heike T']",2014,53,3,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Abe J, et al.

Cutaneous lupus is divided into several sub-types, including acute CLE (ACLE), sub-acute CLE (SCLE) and chronic CLE (CCLE). CCLE includes discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), LE profundus (LEP), chilblain cutaneous lupus and lupus tumidus. The diagnosis of these diseases requires proper classification of the sub-type, through a combination of physical examination, laboratory studies, histology, antibody serology and occasionally direct immunofluorescence, while ensuring to exclude systemic disease. The treatment of cutaneous lupus consists of patient education on proper sun protection along with appropriate topical and systemic agents. Systemic agents are indicated in cases of widespread, scarring or treatment-refractory disease. In this chapter, we discuss issues in classification and diagnosis of the various sub-types of CLE, as well as provide an update on therapeutic management.","['Okon LG', 'Werth VP']",2013,27,3,Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,Okon LG and Werth VP.

Recently, a variant involving the lateral thighs of equestrians has been described. Since the original report of this variant, some confusion has arisen in the literature in which the terms equestrian cold panniculitis and equestrian perniosis are both used. Outside of this presentation, cold panniculitis in adults is exceedingly rare.
OBSERVATIONS: We describe 2 adult patients using ice-pack therapy for chronic back pain who developed erythematous, purpuric plaques at the site of ice-pack application. Histopathologic findings from both patients were similar and showed overlapping features of perniosis and cold panniculitis that closely resembled the pattern seen in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ice-pack dermatosis is an uncommon cold-induced process that occurs in adults using long-term ice-pack therapy. The clinical manifestations include erythematous to purpuric plaques with a livedolike appearance and superficial ulceration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in patients visiting the lone dermatology department in Ladakh between July 2009 and June 2010. The aim was to identify the common environmental dermatoses in high altitudes so that they can be treated easily or prevented. The patients were divided into three demographic groups, namely, lowlanders, Ladakhis (native highlanders), and tourists. Data was analyzed in a tabulated fashion.
RESULTS: A total of 1,567 patients with skin ailments were seen, of whom 965 were lowlanders, 512 native Ladakhis, and 90 were tourists. The skin disorders due to UV rays, dry skin, and papular urticaria were common among all groups. The frequency of melasma (n = 42; 49.4%), chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) (n = 18; 81.81% of total CAD cases), and actinic cheilitis (n = 3; 100%) was much higher among the native Ladakhis.

23622384,Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a genetically determined encephalopathy demonstrating phenotypic overlap both with the sequelae of congenital infection and with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent molecular advances have revealed that AGS can be caused by mutations in any one of five genes, most commonly on a recessive basis but occasionally as a dominant trait. Like AGS, SLE is associated with a perturbation of type I interferon metabolism. Interestingly then, heterozygous mutations in the AGS1 gene TREX1, and the AGS5 gene SAMHD1, underlie a cutaneous subtype of SLE called familial chilblain lupus, and mutations in TREX1 represent the single most common cause of monogenic SLE identified to date. Evidence is emerging to show that the nucleases defective in AGS are involved in removing endogenously produced nucleic acid species, and that a failure of this removal results in activation of the immune system. This hypothesis explains the phenotypic overlap of AGS with congenital infection and some aspects of SLE, where an equivalent type I interferon-mediated innate immune response is triggered by viral and self nucleic acids respectively. These studies beg urgent questions about the development and use of immunosuppressive therapies in AGS and related phenotypes.",['Crow YJ'],2013,113,,Handb Clin Neurol,Crow YJ.

The first, a 23-year-old healthy female horse trainer, presented with burning nodular swelling on her lateral thighs. The second was a 34-year-old healthy woman with recurrent nodular eruption on the lateral thighs after horseback riding in the winter. Physical examination of both patients revealed erythematous to violaceous nodules with eczema craquelé-like changes. Laboratory workup for systemic and autoimmune connective tissue disease was negative. Punch biopsies from both patients showed a superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate with focal extension into the subcutaneous fat. Parakeratosis, subtle spongiosis and increased pandermal interstitial mucin were also present. Previously reported cases generally showed a similar clinical course and similar histopathologic findings. In contrast, our cases revealed increased pandermal interstitial mucin, resembling tumid lupus erythematosus. We aim to better characterize the histopathologic findings of equestrian chilblain and discuss its relationship to other cold-induced skin injuries and autoimmune connective tissue disease, namely lupus erythematosus.","['Yang AY', 'Schwartz L', 'Divers AK', 'Sternberg L', 'Lee JB']",2013,40,5,J Cutan Pathol,"Yang AY, et al.

23414913,Chronic chilblains: the clinical presentation and disease course in a large paediatric series.,"OBJECTIVES: Children often present during winter with painful, red-purple swollen fingers and/or toes, usually misdiagnosed as Raynaud's phenomenon. Pernio, or chronic chilblains, is a localised inflammatory lesion of the skin resulting from an abnormal response to cold. The aim of this study was to better characterise the clinical presentation of chronic chilblains in children.
METHODS: This is a single-centre retrospective study of patients referred to our paediatric rheumatology clinic with cold, purple, and painful hands. Patients were identified from the paediatric rheumatology clinic database, at the Safra Children Hospital, Israel. Data of the clinical presentation, physical findings, laboratory investigations and the course of the disease were extracted from the patients' charts and analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (27 females, sex ratio 4.5:1) were identified. Patients age at presentation was 13.5±2.1, and disease duration was 2.0±1.0 winters. Patients presented with prolonged capillary refill time (100%) and abnormal modified Allen test (75.6%). Fingers swelling was the most common finding (81.8%), followed by proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPs) swelling (63.6%), skin ulceration (54.5%), and dry, irritated skin (45.5%). Nailfold capillary microscopy was normal in all patients. The only abnormal laboratory test was the test for anti-nuclear factor (ANA) in 25%.

23356736,Major cluster of chilblain cases in a cold dry Western Australian winter.,"AIM: Primary chilblains are an idiopathic cold-induced vasculopathy affecting the soft tissues of the hands and feet. Secondary chilblains occur in different forms of vasculitis and chronic autoimmune connective tissue disorders. Idiopathic chilblains are rarely reported in children and may generate significant anxiety to doctors and patients. We describe a cluster of idiopathic chilblains encountered over the winter of 2010 in Perth, Western Australia.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients identified from a prospectively compiled database of all new cases seen in our department. Data on history, examination, investigations, prescribed treatments and outcomes were collected.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with isolated idiopathic chilblains were included, including 20 females and 12 males with a median age at onset of 13.5 years. Lesions were papular with signs of peripheral vasoconstriction causing acrocyanosis, and uncomfortable due to pain and/or pruritis in most. Thickening of the small joints was common where lesions involved these areas. Ulceration of lesions also occurred in some. One patient required hospitalisation for secondary bacterial infection. Most received some form of treatment including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, prednisolone or nifedipine. Most patients improved spontaneously with warmer weather or responded to cold protection advice. All had resolved completely by late spring (November).
CONCLUSION: Our cluster of chilblains was associated with an unusually cold winter in Perth 2010. It is the largest series reported in the literature, suggesting that chilblains may be more common than previously thought. Chilblains are almost always benign in nature and patients are systemically well and usually need no further investigation and only symptomatic treatment. Prompt recognition can avoid excessive investigation and anxiety, allowing appropriate simple advice and treatment.","['Larkins N', 'Murray KJ']",2013,49,2,J Paediatr Child Health,Larkins N and Murray KJ.

23322642,Striking intrafamilial phenotypic variability in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome associated with the recurrent Asian founder mutation in RNASEH2C.,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an encephalopathy of early childhood which is most commonly inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The disorder demonstrates significant genetic heterogeneity with causative mutations in five genes identified to date. Although most patients with AGS experience a severe neonatal or infantile presentation, poor neurodevelopmental outcome and reduced survival, clinical variability in the onset and severity of the condition is being increasingly recognized. A later presentation with a more variable effect on development, morbidity and mortality has been particularly observed in association with mutations in SAMHD1 and RNASEH2B. In contrast, the recurrent c.205C > T (p.R69W) RNASEH2C Asian founder mutation has previously only been identified in children with a severe AGS phenotype. Here, to our knowledge, we present the first report of marked phenotypic variability in siblings both harboring this founder mutation in the homozygous state. In this family, one female child had a severe AGS phenotype with an onset in infancy and profound developmental delay, whilst an older sister was of completely normal intellect with a normal head circumference and was only diagnosed because of the presence of chilblains and a mild hemiplegia. An appreciation of intrafamilial phenotypic expression is important in the counseling of families considering prenatal diagnosis, and may also be relevant to the assessment of efficacy in future clinical trials. In addition, marked phenotypic variation raises the possibility that more mildly affected patients are not currently identified.","['Vogt J', 'Agrawal S', 'Ibrahim Z', 'Southwood TR', 'Philip S', 'Macpherson L', 'Bhole MV', 'Crow YJ', 'Oley C']",2013,161A,2,Am J Med Genet A,"Vogt J, et al.

23290784,Innate immune processes in lupus erythematosus.,"The innate immune system is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or dermatomyositis. The important role of complement factors of the classical pathway and of Toll like receptors (TLRs) is well established, based on genetic and clinical evidence. Immune complexes activate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in myeloid cells and interferon-α (IFNα) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The latter initiates a positive feedback loop that drives autoimmunity. More recently, mutations in genes encoding intracellular enzymes involved in RNA and DNA handling, which likewise lead to increased IFNα, have been found to cause familial chilblain lupus and to be associated with SLE. Within the immunological disease continuum, these disorders can be placed between autoinflammation and autoimmunity, and we would propose the term autoadjuvant for this group, since the activation of the innate immune system in these diseases appears to lower the threshold for (auto)immune reactions.","['Aringer M', 'Günther C', 'Lee-Kirsch MA']",2013,147,3,Clin Immunol,"Aringer M, et al.

23082992,"Epidemiological patterns of perniosis, and its association with systemic disorder.","BACKGROUND: There are few studies exploring the epidemiological properties of perniosis (chilblains) and its association with systemic disorders.
AIM: To collect epidemiological data for perniosis, to investigate any association with systemic disorders, and to identify markers for the differential diagnosis of idiopathic and secondary perniosis.
METHODS: This was a prospective study of 51 patients with perniosis [female : male ratio 2.64 : 1, mean ± SD age 24.6 ± 14.7 years, with 25 patients (49%) aged 0-18 years]. Each patient was interviewed, and signs suggestive of connective-tissue disorders were recorded. Detailed laboratory investigations including autoimmune parameters were performed.
RESULTS: Significant proportions of the patients had both chronic and idiopathic perniosis (P < 0.001 for both). The mean age of the group with secondary perniosis was significantly higher than that of the idiopathic group (P < 0.01). There was no significant gender difference in the secondary perniosis group (P = 0.71). Clerking work was the most common occupation (37%, P = 0.01). Persistence beyond the cold seasons, and presence of photosensitivity, hypergammaglobulinaemia and rheumatoid factor were significant findings in the secondary group (P = 0.02, P = 0.02, P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Perniosis is not rare in children, but patients with secondary perniosis are more likely to be older. In terms of underlying systemic disorder, advanced age and male gender may be important demographic features. Measurement of cryoglobulin levels in the initial laboratory investigations of patients with perniosis is not necessary. Persistence beyond the cold seasons, and presence of photosensitivity, hypergammaglobulinaemia and rheumatoid factor may be useful in differentiating between idiopathic and secondary perniosis.","['Takci Z', 'Vahaboglu G', 'Eksioglu H']",2012,37,8,Clin Exp Dermatol,"Takci Z, et al.

23001749,The capillaroscopic findings in idiopathic pernio: is it a microvascular disease?,"OBJECTIVES: Pernio is a disorder that affects the unprotected skin regions of individuals who are exposed to nonfreezing, damp cold. We aimed to examine nailfold capillaries by video capillaroscopy and evaluate the vascular involvement in patients with idiopathic pernio.
METHODS: Fifty-three patients with idiopathic pernio (male/female ratio 35:18, mean age 25 ± 9 years) and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (male/female ratio 30:8, mean age 24 ± 4 years) were included in the study. Forty-seven of the 53 patients and all the healthy volunteers were evaluated by nailfold video capillaroscopy.
RESULTS: In the patient group, the mean capillary diameter and the mean apical capillary diameter were 56 ± 15 and 24 ± 7 μm, respectively. In the control group, the mean capillary diameter and the mean apical capillary diameter were 37 ± 8 and 15 ± 4 μm, respectively (both p < 0.001). Both of these differences were independent of the disease activity, smoking, and the number of pernio episodes. There were no architectural derangements, avascular areas, or hemorrhages.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, increased nailfold capillary diameter and increased apical capillary diameter were found in patients with pernio regardless of the disease activity. These findings suggest organic damage of the microcirculation.","['Ozmen M', 'Kurtoglu V', 'Can G', 'Tarhan EF', 'Soysal D', 'Aslan SL']",2013,23,5,Mod Rheumatol,"Ozmen M, et al.

RESULTS: The study included 300 patients with discoid lupus erythematosus (n = 160), subacute CLE (n = 86), lupus erythematosus tumidus (n = 52), chilblain lupus (n = 26), and lupus panniculitis (n = 16); 38 of these patients had 2 or more associated forms. Median blood hydroxychloroquine concentration was significantly higher in patients with complete remission (910 [range, <50 to 3057] ng/mL) compared with partial remission (692 [<50 to 2843] ng/mL) and treatment failure (569 [<50 to 2242] ng/mL) (P = .007). In the multivariate analysis, complete remission was associated with higher blood hydroxychloroquine concentrations (P = .005) and the absence of discoid lesions (P = .004). Thirty patients (10.0%) had very low blood hydroxychloroquine concentrations (<200 ng/mL) and may be considered nonadherent to the treatment regimen.
CONCLUSION: Monitoring hydroxychloroquine blood concentrations might improve the management of refractory CLE.","['Francès C', 'Cosnes A', 'Duhaut P', 'Zahr N', 'Soutou B', 'Ingen-Housz-Oro S', 'Bessis D', 'Chevrant-Breton J', 'Cordel N', 'Lipsker D', 'Costedoat-Chalumeau N']",2012,148,4,Arch Dermatol,"Francès C, et al.

22441638,Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome: an autoinflammatory disorder showing pernio-like rashes and progressive partial lipodystrophy.,"Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome (ORPHA2615; also registered as Nakajo syndrome in OMIM#256040) is a distinct inherited inflammatory and wasting disease, originally reported from Japan. This disease usually begins in early infancy with a pernio-like rash, especially in winter. The patients develop periodic high fever and nodular erythema-like eruptions, and gradually progress lipomuscular atrophy in the upper body, mainly the face and the upper extremities, to show the characteristic thin facial appearance and long clubbed fingers with joint contractures. So far about 30 cases have been reported from Kansai, especially Wakayama and Osaka, Tohoku and Kanto areas. At present, about 10 cases are confirmed to be alive only in the Kansai area, including one infant case in Wakayama. However, more cases are expected to be added in the near future. Although cause of the disease has long been undefined, a homozygous mutation of the PSMB8 gene, which encodes the β5i subunit of immunoproteasome, has been identified to be responsible in 2011. By analyses of the patients-derived cells and tissues, it has been suggested that accumulation of ubiquitinated and oxidated proteins due to immunoproteasome dysfunction causes hyperactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and interleukin-6 overproduction. Since similar diseases with PSMB8 mutations have recently been reported from Europe and the United States, it is becoming clear that Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome and related disorders form proteasome disability syndromes, a new category of autoinflammatory diseases distributed globally.",['Kanazawa N'],2012,61,2,Allergol Int,Kanazawa N.

Although it was initially mistaken for intrauterine viral infections, AGS has now been genetically attributed to a lack of adequate processing of cellular nucleic acid debris, which culminates in the perpetual trigger of the innate and acquired immune responses. Although the exact mechanisms governing AGS are not fully understood, significant strides have been recently achieved in better characterizing the disorder and the molecular functions of the five known proteins found mutated in AGS. Studies have now uncovered that AGS is tightly linked with the predisposition to other autoimmune disorders such as familial chilblain lupus and systemic lupus erythematosus. Moreover, at least two of the proteins mutated in AGS, namely TREX1 and SAMHD1, also seem to have antagonistic roles in safeguarding humans from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. We hereby synthesize the current developments into the greater framework of AGS and suggest that a better understanding of AGS might help usher a better treatment not only for some autoimmune disorders but also possibly for patients suffering from HIV infections, too.","['Chahwan C', 'Chahwan R']",2012,81,5,Clin Genet,Chahwan C and Chahwan R.

22071149,Defects in DNA degradation revealed in crystal structures of TREX1 exonuclease mutations linked to autoimmune disease.,"Mutations within the human TREX1 3' exonuclease are associated with Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS) and familial chilblain lupus (FCL). Both AGS and FCL are autoimmune diseases that result in increased levels of interferon alpha and circulating antibodies to DNA. TREX1 is a member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated SET complex and participates in granzyme A-mediated cell death to degrade nicked genomic DNA. The loss of TREX1 activity may result in the accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) degradation intermediates that trigger autoimmune activation. The X-ray crystal structures of the TREX1 wt apoprotein, the dominant D200H, D200N and D18N homodimer mutants derived from AGS and FCL patients, as well as the recessive V201D homodimer mutant have been determined. The structures of the D200H and D200N mutant proteins reveal the enzyme has lost coordination of one of the active site metals, and the catalytic histidine (H195) is trapped in a conformation pointing away from the active site. The TREX1 D18N and V201D mutants are able to bind both metals in the active site, but with inter-metal distances that are larger than optimal for catalysis. Additionally, all of the mutant structures reveal a reduced mobility in the catalytic histidine, providing further explanation for the loss of catalytic activity. The structures of the mutant TREX1 proteins provide insight into the dysfunction relating to human disease. Additionally, the TREX1 apoprotein structure together with the previously determined wild type substrate and product structures allow us to propose a distinct mechanism for the TREX1 exonuclease.","['Bailey SL', 'Harvey S', 'Perrino FW', 'Hollis T']",2012,11,1,DNA Repair (Amst),"Bailey SL, et al.

21985216,"Skin conditions in figure skaters, ice-hockey players and speed skaters: part II - cold-induced, infectious and inflammatory dermatoses.","Participation in ice-skating sports, particularly figure skating, ice hockey and speed skating, has increased in recent years. Competitive athletes in these sports experience a range of dermatological injuries related to mechanical factors: exposure to cold temperatures, infectious agents and inflammation. Part I of this two part review discussed the mechanical dermatoses affecting ice-skating athletes that result from friction, pressure, and chronic irritation related to athletic equipment and contact with surfaces. Here, in Part II, we review the cold-induced, infectious and inflammatory skin conditions observed in ice-skating athletes. Cold-induced dermatoses experienced by ice-skating athletes result from specific physiological effects of cold exposure on the skin. These conditions include physiological livedo reticularis, chilblains (pernio), Raynaud phenomenon, cold panniculitis, frostnip and frostbite. Frostbite, that is the literal freezing of tissue, occurs with specific symptoms that progress in a stepwise fashion, starting with frostnip. Treatment involves gradual forms of rewarming and the use of friction massages and pain medications as needed. Calcium channel blockers, including nifedipine, are the mainstay of pharmacological therapy for the major nonfreezing cold-induced dermatoses including chilblains and Raynaud phenomenon. Raynaud phenomenon, a vasculopathy involving recurrent vasospasm of the fingers and toes in response to cold, is especially common in figure skaters. Protective clothing and insulation, avoidance of smoking and vasoconstrictive medications, maintaining a dry environment around the skin, cold avoidance when possible as well as certain physical manoeuvres that promote vasodilation are useful preventative measures. Infectious conditions most often seen in ice-skating athletes include tinea pedis, onychomycosis, pitted keratolysis, warts and folliculitis. Awareness, prompt treatment and the use of preventative measures are particularly important in managing such dermatoses that are easily spread from person to person in training facilities. The use of well ventilated footgear and synthetic substances to keep feet dry, as well as wearing sandals in shared facilities and maintaining good personal hygiene are very helpful in preventing transmission. Inflammatory conditions that may be seen in ice-skating athletes include allergic contact dermatitis, palmoplantar eccrine hidradenitis, exercise-induced purpuric eruptions and urticaria. Several materials commonly used in ice hockey and figure skating cause contact dermatitis. Identification of the allergen is essential and patch testing may be required. Exercise-induced purpuric eruptions often occur after exercise, are rarely indicative of a chronic venous disorder or other haematological abnormality and the lesions typically resolve spontaneously. The subtypes of urticaria most commonly seen in athletes are acute forms induced by physical stimuli, such as exercise, temperature, sunlight, water or particular levels of external pressure. Cholinergic urticaria is the most common type of physical urticaria seen in athletes aged 30 years and under. Occasionally, skaters may develop eating disorders and other related behaviours some of which have skin manifestations that are discussed herein. We hope that this comprehensive review will aid sports medicine practitioners, dermatologists and other physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of these dermatoses.","['Tlougan BE', 'Mancini AJ', 'Mandell JA', 'Cohen DE', 'Sanchez MR']",2011,41,11,Sports Med,"Tlougan BE, et al.

21808053,Dominant mutation of the TREX1 exonuclease gene in lupus and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.,"TREX1 is a potent 3' → 5' exonuclease that degrades single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA). TREX1 mutations at amino acid positions Asp-18 and Asp-200 in familial chilblain lupus and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome elicit dominant immune dysfunction phenotypes. Failure to appropriately disassemble genomic DNA during normal cell death processes could lead to persistent DNA signals that trigger the innate immune response and autoimmunity. We tested this concept using dsDNA plasmid and chromatin and show that the TREX1 exonuclease locates 3' termini generated by endonucleases and degrades the nicked DNA polynucleotide. A competition assay was designed using TREX1 dominant mutants and variants to demonstrate that an intact DNA binding process, coupled with dysfunctional chemistry in the active sites, explains the dominant phenotypes in TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H alleles. The TREX1 residues Arg-174 and Lys-175 positioned adjacent to the active sites act with the Arg-128 residues positioned in the catalytic cores to facilitate melting of dsDNA and generate ssDNA for entry into the active sites. Metal-dependent ssDNA binding in the active sites of the catalytically inactive dominant TREX1 mutants contributes to DNA retention and precludes access to DNA 3' termini by active TREX1 enzyme. Thus, the dominant disease genetics exhibited by the TREX1 D18N, D200N, and D200H alleles parallel precisely the biochemical properties of these TREX1 dimers during dsDNA degradation of plasmid and chromatin DNA in vitro. These results support the concept that failure to degrade genomic dsDNA is a principal pathway of immune activation in TREX1-mediated autoimmune disease.","['Fye JM', 'Orebaugh CD', 'Coffin SR', 'Hollis T', 'Perrino FW']",2011,286,37,J Biol Chem,"Fye JM, et al.

21487290,Maladaptive plasticity: imprinting of past experiences onto phantom limb schemata.,"OBJECTIVES: Phantom limb perception is common following amputation, and is sometimes characterised by pain that resembles the characteristics, intensity or location of past pain. We tested Flor's model that phantom pain results from memory for long-lasting znoxious input.
METHODS: We report a questionnaire study of 283 amputees, that explored the experience of painful, non-painful and postural somatosensory memories in the phantom. We explore the impact of pre-amputation pain and impairment duration, and complications in the limb (eg, infection, gangrene, surgery, and vascular disease). Differences in mood, coping and adjustment to amputation are also explored in those with somatosensory pain memories.
RESULTS: Our findings support Flor's model, as amputation-related and non-amputation-related pain memories, and non-painful memories comprised pains or sensations that were either enduring/recurring pains or sensations (eg, ingrown toenail, corns, chilblains, arthritis-type pain in winter, night-cramps, or holding a tennis racquet), or resulted from a painful event with a ""core-trauma"" element (eg, fracture, crushing/penetration injury). Pain memories related to amputation were more common following functional impairment before amputation; infection or surgery prior to amputation; or having diabetic or vascular amputations-which are associated with multiple complications, including neuropathic changes, infection and prior surgery. Furthermore, participants with amputation-related pain memories exhibited higher sensory pain ratings, as well as poorer mood and adjustment to the limitations of amputation.
DISCUSSION: We propose that somatosensory pain memories likely relate to the generation and maintenance of limb representations upon which intense or emotionally powerful past experiences have been imprinted.","['Giummarra MJ', 'Georgiou-Karistianis N', 'Nicholls ME', 'Gibson SJ', 'Chou M', 'Bradshaw JL']",2011,27,8,Clin J Pain,"Giummarra MJ, et al.

Sixty-eight cases were followed up for up to 12 years, 58 cases were healthy, 5 cases improved and 3 died. Two cases still had grade III AVB without pacemaker.
CONCLUSION: NLE is a rare acquired autoimmune disease. Although nearly half of the mothers were asymptomatic before pregnancy, more than half of them developed LE or other symptoms. The clinical presentations in Chinese cases include a transient rash, cardiac lesion while grade III AVB was rare, hematological changes and liver impairments which were common but not serious. Anti-SSA and/or anti-SSB were the most related autoantibody. Most patients with NLE have relatively good prognosis.","['Li L', 'Dong GF', 'Han FZ', 'Cui Y', 'Shi YZ', 'Zhang X']",2011,49,2,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,"Li L, et al.

21402907,Homozygous mutation in SAMHD1 gene causes cerebral vasculopathy and early onset stroke.,"We describe an autosomal recessive condition characterized with cerebral vasculopathy and early onset of stroke in 14 individuals in Old Order Amish. The phenotype of the condition was highly heterogeneous, ranging from severe developmental disability to normal schooling. Cerebral vasculopathy was a major hallmark of the condition with a common theme of multifocal stenoses and aneurysms in large arteries, accompanied by chronic ischemic changes, moyamoya morphology, and evidence of prior acute infarction and hemorrhage. Early signs of the disease included mild intrauterine growth restriction, infantile hypotonia, and irritability, followed by failure to thrive and short stature. Acrocyanosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, chilblain lesions, low-pitch hoarse voice, glaucoma, migraine headache, and arthritis were frequently observed. The early onset or recurrence of strokes secondary to cerebral vasculopathy seems to always be associated with poor outcomes. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), IgG, neopterin, and TNF-α found in these patients suggested an immune disorder. Through genomewide homozygosity mapping, we localized the disease gene to chromosome (Chr) 20q11.22-q12. Candidate gene sequencing identified a homozygous mutation, c.1411-2A > G, in the SAMHD1 gene, being associated with this condition. The mutation appeared at the splice-acceptor site of intron 12, resulted in the skipping of exon 13, and gave rise to an aberrant protein with in-frame deletion of 31 amino acids. Immunoblotting analysis showed lack of mutant SAMHD1 protein expression in affected cell lines. The function of SAMHD1 remains unclear, but the inflammatory vasculopathies of the brain found in the patients with SAMHD1 mutation indicate its important roles in immunoregulation and cerebral vascular hemeostasis.","['Xin B', 'Jones S', 'Puffenberger EG', 'Hinze C', 'Bright A', 'Tan H', 'Zhou A', 'Wu G', 'Vargus-Adams J', 'Agamanolis D', 'Wang H']",2011,108,13,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Xin B, et al.

OBJECTIVE: To determine outcomes of patients with perniosis treated with hydroxychloroquine.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with a diagnosis of perniosis treated with hydroxychloroquine were analyzed for dosage required, subjective improvement in signs and symptoms, and adverse drug reactions.
RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine resulted in improvement of symptoms in four of five patients. Review of the literature has revealed 12 out of 51 cases have responded to hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other therapies.
CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine is a relatively safe, well tolerated alternative therapy for the treatment of perniosis and should be considered as part of the initial management.

20842748,Cerebral arterial stenoses and stroke: novel features of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome caused by the Arg164X mutation in SAMHD1 are associated with altered cytokine expression.,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare inborn multisystemic disease, resembling intrauterine viral infection and resulting in psychomotor retardation, spasticity and chilblain-likeskin lesions. Diagnostic criteria include intracerebral calcifications and elevated interferon-alpha and pterin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We report on four adult siblings with unknown neurodegenerative disease presenting with cerebrovascular stenoses, stroke and glaucoma in childhood, two of whom died at the age of 40 and 29 years. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping identified 170 candidate genes embedded in a common haplotype of 8Mb on chromosome 20q11-13. Next generation sequencing of the entire region identified the c.490C>T (p.Arg164X) mutationin SAMHD1, a gene most recently described in AGS, on both alleles in all affected siblings.Clinical diagnosis of AGS was then confirmed by demonstrating intracerebral calcifications on cranial computed tomography in all siblings and elevated pterin levels in CSF in three of them. Inpatient fibroblasts, lack of SAMHD1 protein expression was associated with increased basal expression of IL8, while stimulated expression of IFNB1 was reduced. We conclude that cerebrovascular stenoses and stroke associated with the Arg164X mutation in SAMHD1 extend the phenotypic spectrum of AGS. The observed vascular changes most likely reflect a vasculitis caused by dysregulated inflammatory stress response.","['Thiele H', 'du Moulin M', 'Barczyk K', 'George C', 'Schwindt W', 'Nürnberg G', 'Frosch M', 'Kurlemann G', 'Roth J', 'Nürnberg P', 'Rutsch F']",2010,31,11,Hum Mutat,"Thiele H, et al.

20693199,"Overview of common, rare and atypical manifestations of cutaneous lupus erythematosus and histopathological correlates.","The skin is the second most frequently affected organ system in lupus erythematosus. Although only very rarely life threatening--an example is lupus erythematosus-associated toxic epidermal necrolysis--skin disease contributes disproportionally to disease burden in terms of personal and psychosocial wellbeing, vocational disability, and hence in medical and social costs. Since several manifestations are closely associated with the presence and activity of systemic lupus erythematosus, prompt and accurate diagnosis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus is essential. This review aims to cover common, rare, and atypical manifestations of lupus erythematosus-associated skin disease with a detailed discussion of histopathological correlates. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus covers a wide morphological spectrum well beyond acute, subacute and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, which are commonly classified as lupus-specific skin disease. Other uncommon or less well-known manifestations include lupus erythematosus tumidus, lupus profundus, chilblain lupus, mucosal lupus erythematosus, and bullous lupus erythematosus. Vascular manifestations include leukocytoclastic and urticarial vasculitis, livedoid vasculopathy and livedo reticularis/ racemosa. Finally, we discuss rare presentations such as lupus erythematosus-related erythema exsudativum multiforme (Rowell syndrome), Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, extravascular necrotizing palisaded granulomatous dermatitis (Winkelmann granuloma), and neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis.","['Obermoser G', 'Sontheimer RD', 'Zelger B']",2010,19,9,Lupus,"Obermoser G, et al.

METHOD: We used clinical and radiological description and molecular analysis.
RESULTS: Five individuals (three males, two females) were identified as having biallelic mutations in SAMHD1 and a cerebral arteriopathy in association with peripheral vessel involvement resulting in chilblains and ischaemic ulceration. The cerebral vasculopathy was primarily occlusive in three patients (with terminal carotid occlusion and basal collaterals reminiscent of moyamoya syndrome) and aneurysmal in two. Three of the five patients experienced intracerebral haemorrhage, which was fatal in two individuals. Post-mortem examination of one patient suggested that the arteriopathy was inflammatory in origin.
INTERPRETATION: Mutations in SAMHD1 are associated with a cerebral vasculopathy which is likely to have an inflammatory aetiology. A similar disease has not been observed in patients with mutations in AGS1 to AGS4, suggesting a particular role for SAMHD1 in vascular homeostasis. Our report raises important questions about the management of patients with mutations in SAMHD1.","['Ramesh V', 'Bernardi B', 'Stafa A', 'Garone C', 'Franzoni E', 'Abinun M', 'Mitchell P', 'Mitra D', 'Friswell M', 'Nelson J', 'Shalev SA', 'Rice GI', 'Gornall H', 'Szynkiewicz M', 'Aymard F', 'Ganesan V', 'Prendiville J', 'Livingston JH', 'Crow YJ']",2010,52,8,Dev Med Child Neurol,"Ramesh V, et al.

20644481,Endogenous retroviral pathogenesis in lupus.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Genetic and environmental factors influence the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are proposed as a molecular link between the human genome and environmental factors, such as viruses, in lupus pathogenesis.
RECENT FINDINGS: The HRES-1 human ERV encodes a 28-kD nuclear autoantigen and a 24-kD small GTP-ase, termed HRES-1/Rab4. HRES-1/p28 is a target of cross-reactive antiviral antibodies, whereas HRES-1/Rab4 regulates the surface expression of CD4 via endosome recycling. The tat gene of HIV-1 induces the expression of HRES-1/Rab4, which in turn downregulates expression of CD4 and susceptibility to reinfection by HIV-1. HRES-1/Rab4 is overexpressed in lupus T cells where it correlates with increased recycling of CD4 and CD3 and contributes to downregulation of CD3/TCRzeta via lysosomal degradation. Chilblain lupus has been linked to the deficiency of 3'-5' repair exonuclease Trex1 that metabolizes DNA reverse-transcribed from ERV. Trex1 deficiency or blocked integration of ERV-encoded DNA also promotes lupus in murine models.
SUMMARY: ERV proteins may trigger lupus through structural and functional molecular mimicry, whereas the accumulation of ERV-derived nucleic acids stimulates interferon and anti-DNA antibody production in SLE.","['Perl A', 'Fernandez D', 'Telarico T', 'Phillips PE']",2010,22,5,Curr Opin Rheumatol,"Perl A, et al.

20591349,Constitutional and behavioral risk factors for chilblains: a case-control study from Pakistan.,"OBJECTIVES: To study constitutional and behavioral risk factors for chilblains in patients at Abbottabad and Sialkot, Pakistan.
METHODS: One hundred patients and matched controls completed a single-page, close-ended questionnaire which included demographic data and questions related to possible constitutional and behavioral risk factors for chilblains. Computer program SPSS-10 was used to manage and analyze the data. Risk factors were identified statistically by determining odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: There were an equal number of male and female respondents in each group. Age of the patients and controls ranged from 2 to 80 years with a mean of 24.51 +/- 16.02. Twenty-six patients and 3 controls had a positive family history for chilblains (odds ratio = 9.33); 42 patients and 14 controls reported a history of constipation (odds ratio = 2.69); 32 patients and 8 controls had a history of either numbness or tingling of fingers or toes (odds ratio = 2.93); 55 patients and 45 controls led sedentary lifestyles (odds ratio = 1.27); 85 patients and 58 controls consumed a low number of cups of tea daily (odds ratio = 3.20); 65 patients and 29 controls frequently washed their hands and/or feet (odds ratio = 4.93); and 56 patients and 33 controls had occasional sun exposure during winter months (odds ratio = 2.08).
CONCLUSION: Significant risk factors for the development of chilblains for people at Abbottabad and Sialkot included a history of chilblains in first-degree relatives, numbness and tingling sensations of fingers or toes, frequent hand or feet washing, and lower tea consumption during winter months.","['Raza N', 'Habib A', 'Razvi SK', 'Dar NR']",2010,21,1,Wilderness Environ Med,"Raza N, et al.

The older female child showed mild intellectual disability with microcephaly. Her brother demonstrated a significant spastic paraparesis with normal intellect and head size. Both children had an unclassified chronic inflammatory skin condition with chilblains, and recurrent mouth ulcers. One child had a chronic progressive deforming arthropathy of the small and large joints, with secondary contractures. This family illustrate the remarkable phenotypic diversity accruing from mutations in genes associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). The association of arthropathy with SAMHD1 mutations highlights a phenotypic overlap of AGS with familial autoinflammatory disorders such as chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA). This family therefore illustrate the need to consider mutation analysis of SAMHD1 in non-specific inflammatory phenotypes of childhood.

20098080,Perniosis: clinical and histopathological analysis.,"Perniosis are inflammatory cutaneous lesions, located on acral skin, which present in association with cold exposure. They can appear as an idiopathic dermatosis or with an underlying autoimmune disease. The use of cutaneous biopsy to distinguish between both types is controversial. We analyze the histological findings in 9 cases of idiopathic perniosis (IP) and compare them with those obtained from 11 cases of perniosis associated with an autoimmune disease (autoimmune perniosis). The most frequent histopathological features observed in cases of IP were a lymphocytic infiltrate with perivascular (8 cases, 89%) and perieccrine distribution (6 cases, 66%), dermal edema (5 cases, 55%), and necrotic keratinocytes (5 cases, 55%), whereas those found in perniosis associated with an autoimmune disease were lymphocytic infiltrate with perivascular distribution (11 cases, 100%) but without perieccrine distribution (3 cases, 27%), vacuolation of the basal layer (7 cases, 63%), and necrotic keratinocytes (5 cases, 45%). The only significant difference between both groups was the perieccrine distribution of the lymphocytic infiltrate in cases of IP, which, as mentioned in previous studies, could be considered a histopathological clue to differentiate both types of perniosis.","['Boada A', 'Bielsa I', 'Fernández-Figueras MT', 'Ferrándiz C']",2010,32,1,Am J Dermatopathol,"Boada A, et al.

However, few reports on cutaneous lupus erythematous (CLE) have identified gender differences.
AIM: To analyse and compare the prevalence and characteristics of the main clinical and immunological features of male and female patients with CLE.
METHODS: The medical records of 103 (33.4%) male and 205 (66.6%) female patients with CLE who were treated as inpatients or outpatients between January 1985 and December 2000 were retrospectively studied. All patients were reviewed in detail stratified by a predefined protocol.
RESULTS: Female patients had a higher prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon (P < 0.01), chilblain lupus (P = 0.005), arthralgias (P = 0.001) and SLE (P < 0.01).

19958897,Idiopathic chilblains.,"BACKGROUND: Chilblains is a benign condition infrequently encountered in clinical practice; its resemblance to vasculitis or peripheral thromboemboli can often result in an extensive and unnecessary diagnostic work-up.
METHOD: Three cases of chilblains seen by our Rheumatology service, along with 113 documented cases, were reviewed.
RESULTS: Chilblains is characterized by painful red-to-purple papular lesions involving the acral surface of fingers or toes that resolves with symptomatic treatment. Female sex and low body mass index are risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Distinct clinical features of chilblains can be used for early recognition and management, thus avoiding unnecessary diagnostic testing and delays in patient care.","['Prakash S', 'Weisman MH']",2009,122,12,Am J Med,Prakash S and Weisman MH.

19828096,Anti-inflammatory properties of the plant Verbascum mallophorum.,"Verbascum mallophorum is part of a large family of Scrophulariaceae consisting of more than 360 species. Verbascum mallophorums contains diverse polysaccharides, iroid glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, volatile oils and phenylentanoids. Verbascum has been used in popular medicine for treating wounds, chilblains, respiratory ailments, acne and arthritic disturbances. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) represents one of the three isoforms that produce nitric oxide using L-arginine as a substrate in response to an increase in superoxide anion activated by NF-kappaB. It is implicated in different pathophysiological events and its expression increases greatly during an inflammatory process due to oxidative stress. In our study we reproduced an inflammatory state by treating THP-1 cells (human myelomonocytic leukaemia) with pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS and IFN-gamma, obtaining an up-regulation both in the expression and in the activity of iNOS. The aim of our work is to investigate the possible antiinflammatory action of verbascoside extract from Verbascum mallophorum using a concentration of 100 muM. Our results show a significant decrease in the expression and activity of iNOS and extracellular O2- when cells were treated with verbascoside. Based on these results we hypothesize that verbascoside extract from Verbascum mallophorum has anti-inflammatory properties since it reduces the production of superoxide radicals and consequently reduces the activity of iNOS.","['Speranza L', 'Franceschelli S', 'Pesce M', 'Menghini L', 'Patruno A', 'Vinciguerra I', 'De Lutiis MA', 'Felaco M', 'Felaco P', 'Grilli A']",2009,23,3,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,"Speranza L, et al.

19824738,Cutaneous lupus erythematosus: issues in diagnosis and treatment.,"Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) may present in a variety of clinical forms. Three recognized subtypes of cutaneous LE are acute cutaneous LE (ACLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), and chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE). ACLE may be localized (most often as a malar or 'butterfly' rash) or generalized. Multisystem involvement as a component of systemic LE (SLE) is common, with prominent musculoskeletal symptoms. SCLE is highly photosensitive, with predominant distribution on the upper back, shoulders, neck, and anterior chest. SCLE is frequently associated with positive anti-Ro antibodies and may be induced by a variety of medications. Classic discoid LE is the most common form of CCLE, with indurated scaly plaques on the scalp, face, and ears, with characteristic scarring and pigmentary change. Less common forms of CCLE include hyperkeratotic LE, lupus tumidus, lupus profundus, and chilblain lupus. Common cutaneous disease associated with, but not specific for, LE includes vasculitis, livedo reticularis, alopecia, digital manifestations such as periungual telangiectasia and Raynaud phenomenon, photosensitivity, and bullous lesions. The clinical presentation of each of these forms, their diagnosis, and the inter-relationships between cutaneous LE and SLE are discussed. Common systemic findings in SLE are reviewed, as are diagnostic strategies, including histopathology, immunopathology, serology, and other laboratory findings. Treatments for cutaneous LE initially include preventive (e.g. photoprotective) strategies and topical therapies (corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors). For skin disease not controlled with these interventions, oral antimalarial agents (most commonly hydroxychloroquine) are often beneficial. Additional systemic therapies may be subdivided into conventional treatments (including corticosteroids, methotrexate, thalidomide, retinoids, dapsone, and azathioprine) and newer immunomodulatory therapies (including efalizumab, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab). We review evidence for the use of these medications in the treatment of cutaneous LE.","['Walling HW', 'Sontheimer RD']",2009,10,6,Am J Clin Dermatol,Walling HW and Sontheimer RD.

19817680,Properties of autonomous 3'-->5' exonucleases.,"Autonomous 3'-->5' exonucleases (AE) are not bound covalently to DNA polymerases, but they are often included into the replicative complexes. Intracellular AE overproduction in bacteria results in sharp suppression of mutagenesis, whereas inactivation of these enzymes in bacteria and fungi leads to an increase in mutagenesis frequency by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Correction of DNA polymerase errors in vitro occurs after addition of AE to the incubation medium. This correction is clearly manifested under conditions of mutational stress (during induced but not spontaneous mutagenesis), for instance, with an imbalance of dNTPs--error-prone conditions. At equimolar dNTP (error-free conditions), the correction is relatively weak. The gene knockout of both alleles of the major AE gene in mice does not influence spontaneous mutagenesis though a substantial increase could be expected. The frequency of induced mutagenesis has not been yet measured, though the inactivation of AE could increase the frequency of mutagenesis. Complete inactivation of the major AE leads to inflammatory myocarditis and a 5-fold reduction of life span of mice. Dominant heterozygous mutations were found in various loci of the AE gene, which caused the development of Aicardi-Goutieres (autosomal recessive encephalopathy) syndrome, familial chilblain lupus, systemic lupus erythematosus, retinal vasculopathy, and cerebral leukodystrophy. In the nucleus, AE have a corrective function, but after transition into cytoplasm these enzymes destroy aberrant DNA that appears during replication and thereby save the cells from autoimmune diseases. Depending on their intracellular localization, AE carry out various biological functions but employ the same mechanism of the catalyzed reactions.",['Krutyakov VM'],2009,74,8,Biochemistry (Mosc),Krutyakov VM.

19817081,Retrospective analysis of the ethnic origins of male British army soldiers with peripheral cold weather injury.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if African Americans, Pacific Islanders and Gurkhas have a different incidence and severity of peripheral cold injury when compared to Caucasians in the British Army.
METHOD: The design was a retrospective analysis of those British male army personnel aged over 18 assessed at the Institute of Naval Medicine Cold Injury Clinic. The participants were 311 patients assessed on first attendance at the UK Institute of Naval Medicine.
RESULTS: After excluding those classed as normal, African Americans had a relative incidence of 30.36 (95% CI 25.82 -35.70) when compared to Caucasians; Pacific Islanders a relative incidence of 2.58 (CI 1.24 - 5.38), again against Caucasians. Being of Gurkha ethnicity proved protective, with no abnormal cases found on assessment. The African Americans were more severely affected than Caucasians, with mean scores of 5.39 (SD 1.767) against 4.24 (SD 1.994) for Caucasians. The severity of Pacific Islanders were similar to Caucasians. The ages of African Americans, Pacific Islander and Caucasians had similar means of 26.05, 26.30 and 26.68 respectively, but with a broader age range for Caucasians; SDs 3.428, 2.958 and 7.735.
CONCLUSION: Young male African Americans in the British Army are at 30 times greater chance of developing peripheral cold injury and are more severely affected than their Caucasian counterparts following similar climatic exposure, using similar clothing and equipment. Pacific Islanders are at a 2.6 times increased risk, while being a Gurkha is protective.","['Burgess JE', 'Macfarlane F']",2009,155,1,J R Army Med Corps,Burgess JE and Macfarlane F.

19808788,Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and related phenotypes: linking nucleic acid metabolism with autoimmunity.,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a genetically determined encephalopathy demonstrating phenotypic overlap both with the sequelae of congenital infection and with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent molecular advances have revealed that AGS can be caused by mutations in any one of five genes, most commonly on a recessive basis but occasionally as a dominant trait. Like AGS, SLE is associated with a perturbation of type I interferon metabolism. Interestingly then, heterozygous mutations in the AGS1 gene TREX1 underlie a cutaneous subtype of SLE-called familial chilblain lupus, and mutations in TREX1 represent the single most common cause of monogenic SLE identified to date. Evidence is emerging to show that the nucleases defective in AGS are involved in removing endogenously produced nucleic acid (NA) species, and that a failure of this removal results in activation of the immune system. This hypothesis explains the phenotypic overlap of AGS with congenital infection and some aspects of SLE, where an equivalent type I interferon-mediated innate immune response is triggered by viral and self NAs, respectively. The combined efforts of clinicians, geneticists, immunologists and cell biologists are producing rapid progress in the understanding of AGS and overlapping autoimmune disorders. These studies provide important insights into the pathogenesis of SLE and beg urgent questions about the development and use of immunosuppressive therapies in AGS and related phenotypes.","['Crow YJ', 'Rehwinkel J']",2009,18,R2,Hum Mol Genet,Crow YJ and Rehwinkel J.

We recently described a familial form of chilblain lupus manifesting in early childhood caused by a heterozygous mutation in the TREX1 gene, which encodes a 3'-5' DNA exonuclease. Thus, familial chilblain lupus represents the first monogenic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

The human enzyme is encoded by a single exon and, like many 3' exonucleases, exists as a homodimer. TREX1 degrades ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) more efficiently than dsDNA (double-stranded DNA), and its catalytic properties are similar to those of Escherichia coli exonuclease X. However, TREX1 is only found in mammals and has an extended C-terminal domain containing a leucine-rich sequence required for its association with the endoplasmic reticulum. In normal S-phase and also in response to genotoxic stress, TREX1 at least partly redistributes to the cell nucleus. In a collaborative project, we have demonstrated TREX1 enzyme deficiency in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Subsequently, we have shown that AGS1 cells exhibit chronic ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-dependent checkpoint activation, and these TREX1-deficient cells accumulate ssDNA fragments of a distinct size generated during DNA replication. Other groups have shown that the syndromes of familial chilblain lupus as well as systemic lupus erythematosus, and the distinct neurovascular disorder retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy, can be caused by dominant mutations at different sites within the TREX1 gene.","['Lindahl T', 'Barnes DE', 'Yang YG', 'Robins P']",2009,37,Pt 3,Biochem Soc Trans,"Lindahl T, et al.

19385449,Onset of chilblains in relation with weather conditions.,"BACKGROUND: Chilblains or perniosis is a moderately severe form of cold injury, localized to peripheral parts of the body, which occurs after exposure to non-freezing temperatures and damp conditions. Although inter-individual variations exist with respect to susceptibility to develop chilblains, no study has been carried out in this region to determine the role of different weather conditions either alone or in combination, in predisposing the susceptible individuals to chilblains. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between weather conditions and onset of chilblains at a moderately cold weather station.
METHODS: This study was conducted at the Department of Dermatology, Combined Military Hospital, Abbottabad, from Dec 2004 to Mar 2005. All patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for diagnosis of chilblains were included in the study. These patients were interviewed and examined thoroughly. A specially designed proforma was filled for each patient separately. Meteorological department was contacted for record of weather conditions. Onset of chilblains in each patient was related with weather conditions of that particular month. Computer programme SPSS 10 was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Out of 111 patients, 67 (60.4%) were males and 44 (39.6%) were females. Eighty nine (80.2%), 90 (81.1%) and 90 (81.1%) patients had onset in relation with lower temperature (< 10 degrees C), relatively low atmospheric pressure (< 1500 kpa) and higher relative humidity (> 60%) respectively. There was statistically significant relationship of weather conditions with onset of chilblains when different groups, i.e., elderly and young, males and females, locals and non locals, outdoor workers and those remaining inside most of the time and those having disease of longer or shorter duration were compared.
CONCLUSION: The cold weather conditions that can be endured by humans depend on combination of the duration and the extent of the exposure, in addition to physiological adaptive changes. However, susceptibility to chilblains increases when ambient temperature is less than 10 degrees C and relative humidity is more than 60%. Elderly, females, outdoor workers and those having chronic or recurrent episodes of chilblains are less tolerant to cold weather and develop the disease under lesser ambient cold.","['Raza N', 'Sajid Mu', 'Suhail M', 'Haroon-ur-Rashid']",2008,20,2,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Raza N, et al.

19361698,[Treatment of connective tissue disorder-related acral syndromes using UVA-1 phototherapy. An open study of 11 cases].,"BACKGROUND: UVA-1 phototherapy is used to treat various connective tissues disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SS). We conducted an open study to investigate the efficacy of this therapy on connective tissue disorder-related acrosyndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eleven patients with Raynaud's phenomenon refractory to the standard therapy (six SLE and five SS) were treated with UVA-1 in an open study. Whole-body phototherapy was given in seven cases but was restricted to the hands in four cases. The results were evaluated by comparing status before and after treatment using semi-quantitative tools in terms of daily frequency and intensity of spastic phenomena, pain, overall patient satisfaction, improvement of cutaneous lesions, trophic disorders and distal cutaneous flexibility for patients with ScS.
RESULTS: After treatment, Raynaud's phenomenon improved in terms of both frequency and severity in 9/11 patients (82%: 4/6 SS and 5/5 SLE). Likewise, pain decreased in 8/11 cases (73%: 3/6 SS and 5/5 SLE). 7/12 patients felt their condition had improved (64%: 3/6 SS and 4/5 SLE). Cutaneous lesions improved in 5/11 patients (45%: 2/6 SS and 3/5 SLE), especially for lupus-related lesions including chilblains and in idiopathic chilblains that totally subsided within one month. Digital ulcers improved in all cases, with complete healing in 3/4 patients (75%). In SS, cutaneous flexibility significantly improved in 2/6 cases (33%). No major adverse effects were seen in patients treated with hand-only phototherapy but a slight and spontaneously reversible cutaneous rash, reminiscent of lupus lesions, occurred in one female patient receiving whole-body phototherapy.
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to provide a precise evaluation of the efficiency of UVA-1 phototherapy on connective tissue disorder-related acrosyndrome. This therapeutic effect is not necessarily restricted to the laboratory effects of UVA-1 since the favourable impact of infrared radiation and a placebo effect cannot be ruled out. Although its methodological limitations are obvious, our study also confirms dare data in the recent literature data by demonstrating significant improvement in cutaneous lesions, trophic ulcers and Raynaud's phenomenon in patients presenting connective tissue disorders, including SS, without any major adverse effects.
CONCLUSION: Although these preliminary results remain to be confirmed by large-scale, randomized studies, UVA-1 phototherapy clearly offers a new and valuable therapeutic option in connective tissue disorders associated with acral manifestations and/or lesions, including SLE and SS.","['Comte C', 'Bessis D', 'Picot E', 'Peyron JL', 'Guillot B', 'Dereure O']",2009,136,4,Ann Dermatol Venereol,"Comte C, et al.

19162243,Histologic features of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.,"Histologic examination of lesions plays a key role in the diagnostics of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE). LE has a broad spectrum of histopathological signs, which are related to the stages of the lesions. In addition to the main subtypes of LE, we report on special manifestations like Rowell's-syndrome and Chilblain LE, and give an account of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis), which may be associated with systemic LE. Furthermore the most considerable histopathologic differential diagnoses are discussed.","['Baltaci M', 'Fritsch P']",2009,8,6,Autoimmun Rev,Baltaci M and Fritsch P.

19129251,Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.,"INTRODUCTION: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal recessive encephalopathy characterized by acquired microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, leukodystrophy, cerebral atrophy and cerebrospinal fluid findings of chronic lymphocytosis and raised interferon-alpha (INF-alpha). The main extraneurological symptoms are chilblain-like skin lesions, usually on the fingers, toes and ears.
SOURCES OF DATA: This review is based on a search of the published literature on AGS from 1984 onwards (particularly the most recent papers) and on knowledge and experience gained through the authors' work with the International Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome Association (IAGSA).
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: It is accepted that AGS can be mistaken for a congenital infection and that the diagnostic significance of its cardinal signs (raised INF-alpha levels, basal ganglia calcifications) is different in different stages of the disease. Currently, we know of four genes that, if mutated, can give rise to AGS, but at least one other gene is believed to exist. These genes are involved in the DNA damage response, a defect of which could provoke an inappropriate innate immune response, triggering increased secretion of INF-alpha, ultimately responsible for the main features of the disease.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The natural history of AGS has not yet been definitively described given the lack of extensive, long-term neuroradiological follow-up studies. Furthermore, it is not yet clearly understood how the innate immune system is activated, what triggers the onset of the disease or why it tends to 'burn out' after several months. Immunosuppressive therapy in the active stage of the disease does not seem to produce any real change in the clinical course, but more data are needed.
GROWING POINTS AND AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Current studies aim to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AGS and to establish the exact pathway by which retained nucleic acids activate the immune system. This knowledge could allow the development of therapeutic strategies.","['Orcesi S', 'La Piana R', 'Fazzi E']",2009,89,,Br Med Bull,"Orcesi S, et al. Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.

METHODS: This is an open comparative therapeutic trial conducted in the Department of Dermatology, Baghdad Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq between January and March 2008. Forty patients with perniosis were enrolled in this study, and divided randomly into 2 equal groups, according to the sort of treatment. Group A comprised patients who received oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg in 2 divided doses, and topical clobetasol ointment for 2 weeks. Group B comprised patients who received pentoxyfylline tablet 1200 mg/day in 3 divided doses for 2 weeks. Detailed history and full clinical examination were carried out for each case, regarding all relevant points related to the disease.
RESULTS: The age of patients ranged from 5-60 mean+/-SD 22+/-6.2 years, with 31 females and 9 males with a female to male ratio of 3.5:1. All patients did not receive any treatment before the study. In group A, 11 patients completed the treatment course, and only 3 27.2% patients showed good improvement and complete cure after 2 weeks. In group B, 9 patients completed the regime, and 5 55.5% patients showed good improvement, in which symptoms disappeared and lesions resolved after 2 weeks.

19056919,Cold exposure injuries to the extremities.,"Cold exposure injuries comprise nonfreezing injuries that include chilblain (aka pernio) and trench, or immersion, foot, as well as freezing injuries that affect core body tissues resulting in hypothermia of peripheral tissues, causing frostnip or frostbite. Frostbite, the most serious peripheral injury, results in tissue necrosis from direct cellular damage and indirect damage secondary to vasospasm and arterial thromboses. The risk of frostbite is influenced by host factors, particularly alcohol use and smoking, and environmental factors, including ambient temperature, duration of exposure, altitude, and wind speed. Rewarming for frostbite should not begin until definitive medical care can be provided to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, as these cause additional tissue necrosis. Rewarming should be rapid and for an affected limb should be performed by submersion in warm water at 104 degrees to 107.6 degrees F (40 degrees to 42 degrees C) for 15 to 30 minutes. Débridement of necrotic tissues is generally delayed until there is a clear demarcation from viable tissues, a process that usually takes from 1 to 3 months from the time of initial exposure. Immediate escharotomy and/or fasciotomy is necessary when circulation is compromised. In addition to the acute injury, frostbite is associated with late sequelae that include altered vasomotor function, neuropathies, joint articular cartilage changes, and, in children, growth defects caused by epiphyseal plate damage.","['Golant A', 'Nord RM', 'Paksima N', 'Posner MA']",2008,16,12,J Am Acad Orthop Surg,"Golant A, et al.

18805785,The TREX1 double-stranded DNA degradation activity is defective in dominant mutations associated with autoimmune disease.,"Mutations in TREX1 have been linked to a spectrum of human autoimmune diseases including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), familial chilblain lupus (FCL), systemic lupus erythematosus, and retinal vasculopathy and cerebral leukodystrophy. A common feature in these conditions is the frequent detection of antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). TREX1 participates in a cell death process implicating this major 3' --> 5' exonuclease in genomic DNA degradation to minimize potential immune activation by persistent self DNA. The TREX1 D200N and D18N dominant heterozygous mutations were identified in AGS and FCL, respectively. TREX1 enzymes containing the D200N and D18N mutations were compared using nicked dsDNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) degradation assays. The TREX1WT/D200N and TREX1WT/D18N heterodimers are completely deficient at degrading dsDNA and degrade ssDNA at an expected approximately 2-fold lower rate than TREX1WT enzyme. Further, the D200N- and D18N-containing TREX1 homo- and heterodimers inhibit the dsDNA degradation activity of TREX1WT enzyme, providing a likely explanation for the dominant phenotype of these TREX1 mutant alleles in AGS and FCL. By comparison, the TREX1 R114H homozygous mutation causes AGS and is found as a heterozygous mutation in systemic lupus erythematosus. The TREX1R114H/R114H homodimer has dysfunctional dsDNA and ssDNA degradation activities and does not detectibly inhibit the TREX1WT enzyme, whereas the TREX1WT/R114H heterodimer has a functional dsDNA degradation activity, supporting the recessive genetics of TREX1 R114H in AGS. The dysfunctional dsDNA degradation activities of these disease-related TREX1 mutants could account for persistent dsDNA from dying cells leading to an aberrant immune response in these clinically related disorders.","['Lehtinen DA', 'Harvey S', 'Mulcahy MJ', 'Hollis T', 'Perrino FW']",2008,283,46,J Biol Chem,"Lehtinen DA, et al.

METHODS: The prevalent investigation was used to investigate the health status of on-the-job traffic policemen and the effect of the occupation on the health of traffic policemen was studied.
RESULTS: Among 4486 traffic policemen, 1604 working outside. The average time of working outside was (12.0 +/- 7.9) years and the average time of standing was (7.0 +/- 1.7) hours/day. The incidence of naso-pharyngitis, arthropathy, photosensitive dermatitis, heat stroke and chilblain, noise-induced deafness in the outside-traffic policemen were higher than that of the policemen working indoors. Eye diseases were higher in those who worked outside for 20-25 years. The varicosis of the lower extremity was higher in those who stood outside over 4 hours every day. The average period of onset of disease was 7-8 years.
CONCLUSION: The occupational stress of outside-traffic policemen was bigger in the city. The environmental pollution and the bad condition are the risky factors of 8 kinds of diseases among traffic policemen.

18724932,Trex1 prevents cell-intrinsic initiation of autoimmunity.,"Detection of nucleic acids and induction of type I interferons (IFNs) are principal elements of antiviral defense but can cause autoimmunity if misregulated. Cytosolic DNA detection activates a potent, cell-intrinsic antiviral response through a poorly defined pathway. In a screen for proteins relevant to this IFN-stimulatory DNA (ISD) response, we identify 3' repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1). Mutations in the human trex1 gene cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) and chilblain lupus, but the molecular basis of these diseases is unknown. We define Trex1 as an essential negative regulator of the ISD response and delineate the genetic pathway linking Trex1 deficiency to lethal autoimmunity. We show that single-stranded DNA derived from endogenous retroelements accumulates in Trex1-deficient cells, and that Trex1 can metabolize reverse-transcribed DNA. These findings reveal a cell-intrinsic mechanism for initiation of autoimmunity, implicate the ISD pathway as the cause of AGS, and suggest an unanticipated contribution of endogenous retroelements to autoimmunity.","['Stetson DB', 'Ko JS', 'Heidmann T', 'Medzhitov R']",2008,134,4,Cell,"Stetson DB, et al.

METHODS: We tested the serum of patients for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-DNA antibodies and C4 complement at baseline, and for each infusion for infliximab, and at month 3, 6 and 12 for etanercept. We looked for all signs suggesting a drug-induced lupus. We tried to correlate ANA and anti-DNA development with various clinical data, especially the response to treatment.
RESULTS: 229 patients were included in the study. 159 were treated with infliximab (98 RA and 61 AS) and 125 with etanercept (116 RA and 9 AS). In the infliximab group, 43.6% of RA patients and 27.1% of AS had significant levels of ANA at baseline. This proportion increased during the follow up to 73% in RA patients and 52% in AS patients. The proportion of patients positive for anti-DNA antibodies increased from 0% to 9.5% in RA group, and from 0% to 2% in AS group. In the etanercept group, 58.5% of these patients had significant levels of ANA at baseline; this proportion raised to 63.3% in patients previously treated with infliximab, and fell to 20.6% in the patients who never received TNF-alpha blockers. No significant variation of ANA, anti-DNA and C4 levels was observed in the etanercept group. Only three patients developed clinical manifestations (chilblain lupus) possibly related to these auto-antibodies, two with infliximab and one with etanercept.
CONCLUSION: The ANA induction was only observed under infliximab therapy. Thus, ANA induction seems not to be a therapeutic class effect. This difference between infliximab and etanercept treatment may be the consequence of differential capacity of a monoclonal antibody and a soluble receptor in inducing apoptotic cell death of the cells expressing TNF on their membrane.","['Gonnet-Gracia C', 'Barnetche T', 'Richez C', 'Blanco P', 'Dehais J', 'Schaeverbeke T']",2008,26,3,Clin Exp Rheumatol,"Gonnet-Gracia C, et al.

Lupus lesions are most frequently characterized by a dermoepidermal dermatitis. Other lesions, vascular or nonvascular, are essentially present in association with systemic lupus erythematosus. Acute, subacute and chronic lupus erythematosus are distinguishable according to their clinical aspects, pathological features and their evolution. Acute lesions are either localized to the midface or widespread. Subacute lesions may be annular or psoriasiform. Chronic lupus erythematosus includes localized or widespread discoid lupus, lupus tumidus, chilblain lupus and panniculitis. Therapy of cutaneous lupus is mainly based on antimalarials and avoidance of sun exposure. In refractory cutaneous lupus, no universal guidelines are available. Except for acrosyndromes and urticaria-like lesions, vascular lesions may be due to vasculitis or thrombosis. An accurate diagnosis is necessary, since therapeutic management is quite different in these two conditions.

18525086,A cluster of chilblains in Hong Kong.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a recent clustering of chilblain cases in Hong Kong.
DESIGN: Case series.
SETTING: A regional hospital and a social hygiene clinic in the New Territories West, Hong Kong.
PATIENTS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of chilblains in February 2008.
RESULTS: Eleven patients with chilblains were identified; seven (64%) gave an antecedent history of prolonged exposure to cold. They all presented with erythematous or dusky erythematous skin lesions affecting the distal extremities, especially fingers and toes. Laboratory tests revealed elevated antinuclear antibodies titres in two, positive rheumatoid factor in two, presence of cold agglutinins in one, and a raised anti-DNA titre (>300 IU/mL) in one. Skin biopsies were performed in six patients, four of them showed typical histopathological features of chilblains. In the patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, features of vasculitis were suspected, and in the one with pre-existing juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, there were features of livedo vasculitis. In 10 (91%) of the patients, the skin lesions had resolved when they were last assessed (at the end of March 2008), but had persisted in the patient who had pre-existing systemic lupus erythematosus.
CONCLUSION: The recent clustering of chilblains was possibly related temporally to the prolonged cold weather at the end of January to mid-February.

18422690,"Cutaneous histopathological findings of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, overlap with chilblain lupus.","We report a 2-year-old girl with developmental delay who, from the age of 1 year, developed perniotic lesions of the hands and feet initially diagnosed as chilblain lupus. Histological examination showed features of epidermal necrosis with intraepidermal bulla formation, interface dermatitis, lymphocytic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis and thrombi formation, both superficial and deep dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, lymphocytic eccrine hidradenitis and absence of marked dermal edema. Subsequent investigations suggested a clinical diagnosis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a rare genetic leukoencephalopathy. Recently, both AGS and familial chilblain lupus, an autosomal dominant form of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), have been shown to be allelic thus suggesting a common pathogenic basis. In addition, a phenotypic overlap is apparent between SLE and AGS. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive dermatopathological report of the cutaneous lesions seen in AGS, and our paper highlights the importance of considering AGS in the differential diagnosis of perniosis and chilblain lupus.","['Kolivras A', 'Aeby A', 'Crow YJ', 'Rice GI', 'Sass U', 'André J']",2008,35,8,J Cutan Pathol,"Kolivras A, et al.

Herein, we present another case that was clinically suspected to be unilateral plantar pompholyx. A 47-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of persistent, reticulated, asymptomatic, nonblanching erythematous and brawny macules, and scattered, slightly scaly papules over the plantar instep of his left foot. Two punch biopsies extending to the subcutis revealed healed arteritis (endarteritis obliterans with fragmented elastic lamina) in the subcutis in one biopsy and purpura and hemosiderin deposition surrounding small subcutaneous arterioles and venules in the second. Additional histologic features included lymphocytic eccrine hidradenitis and chronic spongiotic dermatitis. Extensive laboratory work did not reveal evidence of systemic disease. Despite topical corticosteroid therapy, he has had persistent, asymptomatic disease after 6 months follow-up. The differential diagnoses considered included pigmented purpuric dermatitis, perniosis (chilblains), plantar eccrine hidradenitis, Buerger disease, livedo vasculopathy, and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa also runs a benign course and is denoted by muscular vessel vasculitis, which can resolve with retiform hyperpigmentation. Based on these overlapping clinical-pathologic features, macular arteritis might represent a latent, non-nodule forming chronic variant of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.","['Al-Daraji W', 'Gregory AN', 'Carlson JA']",2008,30,2,Am J Dermatopathol,"Al-Daraji W, et al.

18343173,Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS).,"In 1984, Jean Aicardi and Françoise Goutières described 8 children showing both severe brain atrophy and chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis, with basal ganglia calcification in at least one member of each affected family. The course was rapid to death or a vegetative outcome. Aicardi and Goutières correctly predicted that the disorder would be genetic, but emphasised that ""some features, especially the pleocytosis, may erroneously suggest an inflammatory condition"". The increased interferon-alpha in affected children (Pierre Lebon, Paris) mimicked congenital viral infection, but the associated chilblains (pernio) pointed to lupus erythematosus and an autoimmune mechanism. Genetic research led by Yanick Crow has clarified these puzzling relationships in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a syndrome that now includes conditions previously known as microcephaly-intracranial calcification syndrome, pseudo-TORCH and Cree encephalitis. At the time of writing, Crow's team has discovered that over 80% of families with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome have mutations in one of four nuclease genes, the exonuclease TREX1 and the genes for all three subunits of the ribonuclease H2 enzyme complex. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is both genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, with a range of severity from life-threatening perinatal illness to mild late infancy onset. All infants of whatever genotype have increased interferon-alpha in the first year of life and this appears to be the final common pathway that links Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, congenital virus infection and systemic lupus erythematosus.",['Stephenson JB'],2008,12,5,Eur J Paediatr Neurol,Stephenson JB.

18334029,Ethnophytotherapeutical research in the high Molise region (Central-Southern Italy).,"BACKGROUND: In the years 2003-2005 research was carried out concerning ethno-medicine in the high Molise (central- southern Italy), a region that has been the object of very little investigation from the ethnobotanical point of view. Upper Molise is a continuation of the mountain profiles of the Abruzzi Appenines: a series of hills, steep slopes and deep fluvial valleys making communications difficult. Primordial traditions (e.g. harvest feasts) are typical of the region.
METHODS: Field data were collected through open interviews in the field. These were conducted on both an individual and group level, fresh plants gathered from surrounding areas being displayed. In other cases, individual interviews were conducted by accompanying the person involved to the places where they perform their activities (for example, in the woods with woodcutters, kitchen gardens and fields with housewives, pastures with shepherds, etc.). In total 54 individuals were interviewed.
RESULTS: Data of 70 taxa belonging to 39 families were gathered. Among the species, 64 are used in human therapy, 5 as insect repellents, 11 in veterinary medicine, 1 to keep eggs and cheeses and 4 for magic purposes. The most important findings in ethno-medicine relate to the lichen Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. (wounds) and to some vascular plant species: Asplenium trichomanes L. and Ceterach officinarum Willd. (to regularize menstruation), Cyclamen hederifolium (chilblains), Centaurium erythraea Rafn. and Pulmonaria apennina Cristof. & Puppi (bruises), while in the ethno-veterinary field, we have Valeriana officinalis L. (wounds sustained by mules). Also worthy of note, given the isolation of the area, is the number of plants used to protect foodstuffs from parasites, among which Allium sativum L. and Capsicum frutescens L.
CONCLUSION: The research revealed a deep-rooted and widespread habit of husbanding the family's resources. Whilst isolation and snowfalls contributed to the widespread knowledge of means of conserving foodstuffs, they also led to the use of products easily available within each home. The values of E.I. (ethnobotanicity index) for the upper Molise region are considered amongst the highest in Italian areas. Nevertheless, like the values for other areas of Italy, they are lower than those of many Spanish areas, perhaps (and not only) because of the more rapid cultural erosion experienced in Italy.","['Guarrera PM', 'Lucchese F', 'Medori S']",2008,4,,J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,"Guarrera PM, et al.

It may be idiopathic or associated with other systemic diseases, particularly cryopathies and lupus erythematosus. Acute pernio manifests several hours following exposure, whereas chronic pernio may persist even after the cold season has long ended. The pathophysiology is complex and related to patient and environmental factors. Pernio is diagnosed by clinical features. There are no characteristic histopathologic features that confirm the diagnosis, but biopsy of affected areas may exclude the presence of other disorders. Sequelae include superinfection, depigmentation, and scarring. Treatment involves rewarming of the whole body and avoidance of further exposure to cold.

17846997,Clinical and molecular phenotype of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.,"Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) is a genetic encephalopathy whose clinical features mimic those of acquired in utero viral infection. AGS exhibits locus heterogeneity, with mutations identified in genes encoding the 3'-->5' exonuclease TREX1 and the three subunits of the RNASEH2 endonuclease complex. To define the molecular spectrum of AGS, we performed mutation screening in patients, from 127 pedigrees, with a clinical diagnosis of the disease. Biallelic mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C were observed in 31, 3, 47, and 18 families, respectively. In five families, we identified an RNASEH2A or RNASEH2B mutation on one allele only. In one child, the disease occurred because of a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation. In 22 families, no mutations were found. Null mutations were common in TREX1, although a specific missense mutation was observed frequently in patients from northern Europe. Almost all mutations in RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C were missense. We identified an RNASEH2C founder mutation in 13 Pakistani families. We also collected clinical data from 123 mutation-positive patients. Two clinical presentations could be delineated: an early-onset neonatal form, highly reminiscent of congenital infection seen particularly with TREX1 mutations, and a later-onset presentation, sometimes occurring after several months of normal development and occasionally associated with remarkably preserved neurological function, most frequently due to RNASEH2B mutations. Mortality was correlated with genotype; 34.3% of patients with TREX1, RNASEH2A, and RNASEH2C mutations versus 8.0% RNASEH2B mutation-positive patients were known to have died (P=.001). Our analysis defines the phenotypic spectrum of AGS and suggests a coherent mutation-screening strategy in this heterogeneous disorder. Additionally, our data indicate that at least one further AGS-causing gene remains to be identified.","['Rice G', 'Patrick T', 'Parmar R', 'Taylor CF', 'Aeby A', 'Aicardi J', 'Artuch R', 'Montalto SA', 'Bacino CA', 'Barroso B', 'Baxter P', 'Benko WS', 'Bergmann C', 'Bertini E', 'Biancheri R', 'Blair EM', 'Blau N', 'Bonthron DT', 'Briggs T', 'Brueton LA', 'Brunner HG', 'Burke CJ', 'Carr IM', 'Carvalho DR', 'Chandler KE', 'Christen HJ', 'Corry PC', 'Cowan FM', 'Cox H', ""D'Arrigo S"", 'Dean J', 'De Laet C', 'De Praeter C', 'Dery C', 'Ferrie CD', 'Flintoff K', 'Frints SG', 'Garcia-Cazorla A', 'Gener B', 'Goizet C', 'Goutieres F', 'Green AJ', 'Guet A', 'Hamel BC', 'Hayward BE', 'Heiberg A', 'Hennekam RC', 'Husson M', 'Jackson AP', 'Jayatunga R', 'Jiang YH', 'Kant SG', 'Kao A', 'King MD', 'Kingston HM', 'Klepper J', 'van der Knaap MS', 'Kornberg AJ', 'Kotzot D', 'Kratzer W', 'Lacombe D', 'Lagae L', 'Landrieu PG', 'Lanzi G', 'Leitch A', 'Lim MJ', 'Livingston JH', 'Lourenco CM', 'Lyall EG', 'Lynch SA', 'Lyons MJ', 'Marom D', 'McClure JP', 'McWilliam R', 'Melancon SB', 'Mewasingh LD', 'Moutard ML', 'Nischal KK', 'Ostergaard JR', 'Prendiville J', 'Rasmussen M', 'Rogers RC', 'Roland D', 'Rosser EM', 'Rostasy K', 'Roubertie A', 'Sanchis A', 'Schiffmann R', 'Scholl-Burgi S', 'Seal S', 'Shalev SA', 'Corcoles CS', 'Sinha GP', 'Soler D', 'Spiegel R', 'Stephenson JB', 'Tacke U', 'Tan TY', 'Till M', 'Tolmie JL', 'Tomlin P', 'Vagnarelli F', 'Valente EM', 'Van Coster RN', 'Van der Aa N', 'Vanderver A', 'Vles JS', 'Voit T', 'Wassmer E', 'Weschke B', 'Whiteford ML', 'Willemsen MA', 'Zankl A', 'Zuberi SM', 'Orcesi S', 'Fazzi E', 'Lebon P', 'Crow YJ']",2007,81,4,Am J Hum Genet,"Rice G, et al.

17650550,"Pseudosclerodermatous triad of perniosis, pulp atrophy and 'parrot-beaked' clawing of the nails--a newly recognized syndrome of chronic crack cocaine use.","The number of people dependent on crack-cocaine in the UK has increased substantially in recent years. Some crack-cocaine users develop coarsening changes in the appearance of their hands after prolonged use of the drug. These changes have most often been recognized in females and include: (i) Perniosis with cold, numb hands, sometimes with perniotic hyperkeratosis over the knuckles.(ii) Finger pulp atrophy of the distal part of the pulps of some digits, especially the thumbs and index fingers.(iii) Claw-like curvature of the nails. As the distal pulp is lost, it can no longer splint the nail straight and so the nail curves, claw-like, and reminiscent of a parrot's beak as it clings to the new contour. As the pulp atrophy progresses, the nail eventually also becomes smaller.This triad may be due to ischemia consequent upon peripheral vasoconstriction induced by crack-cocaine. Early changes may resolve with abstinence. In the patients described the syndrome does not appear to be to related to intravenous drug usage. It may occur without concomitant use of heroin, whether smoked or via the intravenous route. The syndrome does not occur in all crack-cocaine users. It is hypothesized that those with a vasoreactive circulation (i.e., those with vasomotor instability/perniosis) are more susceptible to this reaction pattern. The syndrome consisting of the triad of perniosis, pulp atrophy and parrot-beaked clawing of the nails should alert the clinician to the possibility of prolonged crack-cocaine misuse.","['Payne-James JJ', 'Munro MH', 'Rowland Payne CM']",2007,14,2,J Forensic Leg Med,"Payne-James JJ, et al.

17440703,A mutation in TREX1 that impairs susceptibility to granzyme A-mediated cell death underlies familial chilblain lupus.,"We recently described a novel autosomal-dominant genodermatosis, termed familial chilblain lupus, and mapped its genetic locus to chromosome 3p21. Familial chilblain lupus manifests in early childhood with ulcerating acral skin lesions and is associated with arthralgias and circulating antinuclear antibodies. In this study, we report the identification of a heterozygous missense mutation (D18N) in TREX1 encoding the 3'-5'repair exonuclease 1 in affected individuals of the family with chilblain lupus. The homodimeric TREX1 is the most abundant intracellular DNase in mammalian cells. We have recently shown that TREX1 plays a role in apoptotic single-stranded DNA damage induced by the killer lymphocyte protease granzyme A. D18N affects a highly conserved amino acid residue critical for catalytic activity. Recombinant mutant TREX1 homodimers are enzymatically inactive, while wild type/mutant heterodimers show residual exonucleolytic activity, suggesting a heterozygous loss of function. Lymphoblastoid cells carrying the D18N mutation are significantly less sensitive to granzyme A-mediated cell death, suggesting a novel role for this caspase-independent form of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of familial chilblain lupus. Our findings also warrant further investigation of TREX1 in common forms of lupus erythematosus.","['Lee-Kirsch MA', 'Chowdhury D', 'Harvey S', 'Gong M', 'Senenko L', 'Engel K', 'Pfeiffer C', 'Hollis T', 'Gahr M', 'Perrino FW', 'Lieberman J', 'Hubner N']",2007,85,5,J Mol Med (Berl),"Lee-Kirsch MA, et al.

17432100,Cutaneous lesions of the digits in systemic lupus erythematosus: 50 cases.,"The objective of this study was to observe the clinical and pathologic features of digital lesions in a cohort of 50 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Biopsy and pictures of digital lesions were performed in 50 consecutive patients with SLE and digital lesions. A clinical diagnosis of vasculitis was previously suggested in 36% of cases. Pictures were reviewed by three dermatologists and all the tissue sections were analysed by the same pathologist. Files of patients were reviewed retrospectively. Activity of SLE was established according to the lupus activity index (LAI). Digital lesions in SLE were frequently painful (60%) with a finger-pulp inflammation (70%). According to clinical and pathological correlation, five patients had acute cutaneous lupus, five subacute cutaneous lupus, 21 discoid lupus and 15 chilblain lupus. Two patients presented vasculitis: one had an urticarial vasculitis concomitantly to a lupus flare, the other had an erythema elevatum diutinum, independent of SLE evolution. Thrombosis of dermal vessels was present in two patients with SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome and in two patients with chilblain lupus. LAI was >1.5 in only seven patients. These results highlight the tendency to clinically overestimate the prevalence of cutaneous vasculitis of the fingers in patients without active SLE. Clinical features of cutaneous lupus of the digits are polymorphous.

17348308,"Chilblains at Abbottabad, a moderately cold weather station.","BACKGROUND: Chilblains are quite often seen in various parts, in particular cold weather areas of Pakistan. Unfortunately, no studies have so far been carried out in Pakistan, to determine epidemiological aspects of chilblains. The objective of this study was to see the epidemiological patterns of chilblains at a moderately cold weather station.
METHODS: The study was conducted at Dermatology out patient department of Combined Military Hospital, Abbottabad from 1 Dec 2004 to 31 Mar 2005. All the patients fulfilling clinical criteria for the diagnosis of chilblains were registered. Every patient was interviewed in detail followed by thorough physical examination. Complete Blood Count, Urine Routine Examination and Anti Nuclear Factor were carried out in only those patients, having the disease of more than 3 years duration. A pre-designed proforma was filled separately for each patient.
RESULTS: Out of 111 patients, 67 (60.4%) males and 44 (39.6%) females were registered with the diagnosis of chilblains. Fifty nine (53.2%) patients were locals and 52 (46.8%) were non locals. Out door workers were 75 (67.6%). Onset in majority of the patients (42.3%) was in the age group 11-20 years. Family history of chilblains was present in 25 (22.5%) patients and 8 patients (7.2%) were smokers. The disease of longer duration was more common in females and locals.
CONCLUSION: At moderately cold weather areas, out door workers and young adolescents are more likely to develop Chilblains. The disease of longer duration is more common among females and local residents. On the other hand, first episode or the disease of shorter duration is more common among non locals at moderately cold weather stations because of poor acclimatization and inadequate protection.","['Raza N', 'Sajid Mu', 'Ejaz A']",2006,18,3,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Raza N, et al.

17127088,Vasculitides induced by TNFalpha antagonists: a study in 39 patients in France.,"UNLABELLED: TNFalpha antagonists are effective in the treatment of chronic inflammatory joint disease. Despite a good overall safety profile, they can induce a number of adverse effects, including autoimmunity and infections. A link between TNFalpha antagonists and vasculitides has been suggested.
METHODS: Between December 2004 and January 2005, a nationwide survey was conducted among 1200 hospital-based rheumatologists and internists in France, who were asked to report cases of vasculitis in patients taking TNFalpha antagonists.
RESULTS: The survey identified 39 cases (32 women) of vasculitis during TNFalpha antagonist therapy. The joint disease was rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 34 patients (including four without rheumatoid factor), juvenile idiopathic arthritis in two patients, ankylosing spondylitis in two patients, and psoriatic arthritis in one patient. Mean disease duration was 14.1+/-8.7 years. The TNFalpha antagonist was etanercept in 21 patients, infliximab in 15, adalimumab in 2, and another drug in 1; mean treatment duration was 9.6 months. The manifestations of vasculitis involved the skin (n=32); peripheral nervous system (n=9); kidney (n=7); central nervous system (n=3); pleura (n=2), pericardium (n=2); and the lung, gallbladder, and heart (n=1 each). Antinuclear factor (ANF) was present in 22 patients, hypocomplementemia in 6, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody in 5. Histology (30 biopsies from 27 patients) showed nonnecrotizing vasculitis in 12 patients, necrotizing vasculitis in 7, an inflammatory dermal infiltrate without vasculitis in 3, extravascular necrotic granulomas in 2, chilblain lupus in 1, and cicatricial fibro-inflammatory changes in 1. Renal biopsy in three patients showed extracapillary glomerulonephritis with IgA deposits (n=2) or active floccular necrosis against a background of glomerular sclerosis (n=1). TNFalpha antagonist therapy was stopped in 33 patients, among whom 18 recovered without further treatment and 14 required high-dose glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressant therapy, which ensured symptom resolution within a few weeks. The remaining patient died with multiple organ failures.
DISCUSSION: The relative contributions of TNFalpha antagonist therapy and of the underlying disease to the development of vasculitis cannot be determined. Features that suggest a causal link between TNFalpha antagonists and vasculitis include the short time from TNFalpha antagonist initiation to vasculitis onset; the favorable response to discontinuation of TNFalpha antagonist therapy; and the development of systemic vasculitis in patients with rheumatoid factor-negative RA, in adults with juvenile-onset arthritis, and in patients with spondyloarthropathies.","['Saint Marcoux B', 'De Bandt M', 'CRI (Club Rhumatismes et Inflammation)']",2006,73,6,Joint Bone Spine,"Saint Marcoux B, et al.

16960810,"Familial chilblain lupus, a monogenic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, maps to chromosome 3p.","Systemic lupus erythematosus is a prototypic autoimmune disease. Apart from rare monogenic deficiencies of complement factors, where lupuslike disease may occur in association with other autoimmune diseases or high susceptibility to bacterial infections, its etiology is multifactorial in nature. Cutaneous findings are a hallmark of the disease and manifest either alone or in association with internal-organ disease. We describe a novel genodermatosis characterized by painful bluish-red inflammatory papular or nodular lesions in acral locations such as fingers, toes, nose, cheeks, and ears. The lesions sometimes appear plaquelike and tend to ulcerate. Manifestation usually begins in early childhood and is precipitated by cold and wet exposure. Apart from arthralgias, there is no evidence for internal-organ disease or an increased susceptibility to infection. Histological findings include a deep inflammatory infiltrate with perivascular distribution and granular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement along the basement membrane. Some affected individuals show antinuclear antibodies or immune complex formation, whereas cryoglobulins or cold agglutinins are absent. Thus, the findings are consistent with chilblain lupus, a rare form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Investigation of a large German kindred with 18 affected members suggests a highly penetrant trait with autosomal dominant inheritance. By single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based genomewide linkage analysis, the locus was mapped to chromosome 3p. Haplotype analysis defined the locus to a 13.8-cM interval with a LOD score of 5.04. This is the first description of a monogenic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

16150216,Calcium antagonists in dermatology: a review of the evidence and research-based studies.,"Calcium antagonists (CAs) or calcium-channel blockers are a common group of antihypertensive medications. These drugs have the property of blocking the calcium channels of vascular and cardiac smooth muscle fibers. Some of these drugs may inhibit the growth and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, and inhibit the synthesis of extracellular-matrix proteins (collagen, fibronectin, proteoglycans). Other CAs also have immunomodulatory or dysregulatory effects on lymphocytes and can suppress superoxide generation and phagocytic action of neutrophils. Moreover mast cell degranulation and platelet aggregation may also be impaired. On account of these properties, calcium antagonists have also been used for the prevention and treatment of various dermatologic diseases such as erythromelalgia, idiopathic- or CREST-related calcinosis cutis, primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon, chilblains, chronic anal fissures, keloids, and burn scars. They are also used for prevention of skin flap necrosis in experimental models. Calcium antagonists, apart from their well known and established antihypertensive action, should also be considered as possible therapy for several dermatologic diseases.","['Palamaras I', 'Kyriakis K']",2005,11,2,Dermatol Online J,Palamaras I and Kyriakis K.

16140694,Pernio in pediatrics.,"Pernio, or chilblains, is a localized inflammatory lesion of the skin resulting from an abnormal response to cold. Five cases were seen among adolescent female patients who presented to our rheumatology service in a pediatric tertiary care center in the winter of 2003 to 2004. All 5 patients were thin (BMI of <25th percentile) and had either toes or fingers that were affected. For each, laboratory evaluation results were unremarkable, including negative antinuclear antibody profile results. Symptomatic treatment, with or without medication, was recommended. Pernio most commonly occurs among young women but may occur among older individuals or among children. Because pernio develops among susceptible individuals who are exposed to nonfreezing cold, the lesions usually begin in the fall or winter and disappear in the spring or early summer. Acute pernio may develop 12 to 24 hours after exposure to the cold. Single or multiple erythematous, purplish, edematous lesions appear, accompanied by intense pain, itching, or burning. Chronic pernio occurs with repeated exposure to the cold and the persistence of lesions. In an acute exacerbation, the major differential diagnosis alternative would be Raynaud's phenomenon, which consists of sharply demarcated cutaneous pallor and cyanosis, followed by erythema, of far shorter duration (hours rather than days). Frostbite is freezing of tissue, with resultant tissue necrosis. Several conditions have been described as predisposing subjects to pernio, including the presence of cryoproteins, excessive cold exposure, and anorexia nervosa among children and systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibodies among adults. It is important, therefore, when evaluating a patient with pernio, both to exclude an underlying diagnosis and to determine whether additional testing is necessary. The lesions of acute pernio are usually self-limited but may lead to recurrent disease. The involved limb should be cleaned and dried, and rewarming should occur. Prevention is the best form of therapy, and cold exposure should be minimized after an initial insult. The prognosis for properly treated pernio is excellent. Nifedipine, which produces vasodilation, has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing pain, facilitating healing, and preventing new lesions of pernio. We think that the 5 cases seen in our rheumatology clinic represent an increase, compared with prior years; the dermatology clinic at the University of Colorado reported a series of 8 children treated during a 10-year period. The reasons for the possible increase are likely multifactorial, with cold climate, a vulnerable population with thin body habitus, and cold exposure all being contributing causes. Of note, the quality of cold in Colorado is quite dry; however, the winter of 2003 to 2004 was not particularly colder or drier than prior years. All patients were very thin, and thin body habitus may be associated with increased cutaneous vasoreactivity. It is also unclear how these cases of pernio may reflect that winter's fashion trends (2 patients reported wearing sandals in winter). General pediatricians, particularly those who practice in colder climates, should be aware of the presentation and treatment of pernio in childhood.","['Simon TD', 'Soep JB', 'Hollister JR']",2005,116,3,Pediatrics,"Simon TD, et al.

15971430,Skin manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus refractory to multiple treatment modalities: poor results with mycophenolate mofetil.,"OBJECTIVE: Skin disease can be one of the most refractory clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The standard therapy consists of sunscreens, topical corticosteroids and antimalarials. However in difficult cases a variety of other drugs have been tried. Here we describe our clinical experience with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with cutaneous manifestations of SLE.
METHODS: Seven patients with SLE and skin involvement (including acute cutaneous lupus, subacute cutaneous lupus, discoid lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, urticarial rash and chilblain lupus) who had received treatment with MMF were included. The clinical characteristics, serologicalfindings and response to treatment were recalledfrom retrospective review of the files.
RESULTS: Our results showed no response in 5 patients, partial response in 1 patient and initial response but skin flare whilst on MMF in 1 patient. The median dose of MMF was 2 g (range 2-3 g). Adverse events on MMF were mild, mainly gastrointestinal and occurred in 5 patients. No patients discontinued MMF due to adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: MMF appears not to be particularly effective in the treatment of skin disease in SLE. It should be noted that our group of patients had previously failed to respond to a median of 4 (range 2-10) different drugs used to treat SLE skin disease. Thus, the patients in the study could be considered at the severe end of skin disease spectrum.","['Pisoni CN', 'Obermoser G', 'Cuadrado MJ', 'Sanchez FJ', 'Karim Y', 'Sepp NT', 'Khamashta MA', 'Hughes GR']",2005,23,3,Clin Exp Rheumatol,"Pisoni CN, et al.

15889594,[Influence of manufacturing procedure on stability of Unguentum contra perniones preparations].,"BACKGROUND: Application of various technological procedures for the manufacture of officinal preparation ointment against chilblains (Unguentum contra perniones) produce essential variations in the quality and stability of the final product. Changing the sequence of admixing active substances into the ointment base indicated the presence of incompatibility between the active substances, as well as between the active substances and the ointment base components. The aim was to examine the influence of various technological manufacturing procedures on quality and stability of the preparation.
METHODS: Changes in the samples of ointments and aqueous solutions of active substances were analysed microscopically.
RESULTS: Microscopic analysis of hydrosoluble active substance solutions demonstrated destruction of ichthammol, induced by an acidic medium due to the dissolution of tannin and resorcinol, which is well known from the literature. It also demonstrated the destruction of tannin and resorcinol in aqueous solution, which had not been described in the literature. Application of the prescribed procedure for the manufacturing of ointment against chilblains, conceals the incompatibility reactions due to a slow dissolution of the tannin suspended in the officinal ointment base Unguentum cera lanae. Admixture of an ready-made aqueous solution of tannin caused an instant contact between ichthammol and the acidic medium, which caused the destruction or the complete absence of the formation of emulsion droplets. The problem of incompatibility reactions between lanolin alcohols in the ointment base and ichthammol and resorcinol, as well as the reaction between Peruvian balsam and sulfur from the ichthammol sulfate ion was observed. Numerous incompatibility reactions of ointment against chilblains, components indicated that it was necessary to introduce alterations in both the qualitative and quantitative composition of the preparation.
CONCLUSION: Excipient preparation procedure, as well as the technological procedure for incorporation of active ingredients can cause the incompatibilities and therefore the formulation stability problems.","['Bosković M', 'Toskić-Radojicić M']",2005,62,4,Vojnosanit Pregl,Bosković M and Toskić-Radojicić M.

15715518,Cold injuries.,"Exposure to cold can produce a variety of injuries that occur as a result of man's inability to adapt to cold. These injuries can be divided into localized injury to a body part, systemic hypothermia, or a combination of both. Body temperature may fall as a result of heat loss by radiation, evaporation, conduction, and convection. Hypothermia or systemic cold injury occurs when the core body temperature has decreased to 35 degrees C (95 degrees F) or less. The causes of hypothermia are either primary or secondary. Primary, or accidental, hypothermia occurs in healthy individuals inadequately clothed and exposed to severe cooling. In secondary hypothermia, another illness predisposes the individual to accidental hypothermia. Hypothermia affects multiple organs with symptoms of hypothermia that vary according to the severity of cold injury. The diagnosis of hypothermia is easy if the patient is a mountaineer who is stranded in cold weather. However, it may be more difficult in an elderly patient who has been exposed to a cold environment. In either case, the rectal temperature should be checked with a low-reading thermometer. The general principals of prehospital management are to (1) prevent further heat loss, (2) rewarm the body core temperature in advance of the shell, and (3) avoid precipitating ventricular fibrillation. There are two general techniques of rewarming--passive and active. The mechanisms of peripheral cold injury can be divided into phenomena that affect cells and extracellular fluids (direct effects) and those that disrupt the function of the organized tissue and the integrity of the circulation (indirect effects). Generally, no serious damage is seen until tissue freezing occurs. The mildest form of peripheral cold injury is frostnip. Chilblains represent a more severe form of cold injury than frostnip and occur after exposure to nonfreezing temperatures and damp conditions. Immersion (trench) foot, a disease of the sympathetic nerves and blood vessels in the feet, is observed in shipwreck survivors or in soldiers whose feet have been wet, but not freezing, for long periods. Patients with frostbite frequently present with multisystem injuries (e.g., systemic hypothermia, blunt trauma, substance abuse). The freezing of the corneas has been reported to occur in individuals who keep their eyes open in high wind-chill situations without protective goggles (e.g., snowmobilers, cross-country skiers).","['Long WB', 'Edlich RF', 'Winters KL', 'Britt LD']",2005,15,1,J Long Term Eff Med Implants,"Long WB, et al.

Primary urolithiasis morbidity for this period of time was provided by regional health department. The data were processed by methods of medical mapping and paired correlation analysis. In the Territory, mapping revealed the same location of the zones with high frequency of discomfortable weather of class V and VI causing chilblain in positive air temperatures and zones with elevated primary urolithiasis morbidity in children and adults. Correlation analysis confirmed mapping results and determined significant negative correlations between frequency of relatively comfortable moment weather classes II-IV and morbidity of children and adults, positive correlation between frequency of discomfortable class VI and adult morbidity. Thus, high frequency of days per year with discomfortable classes of moment weather in low positive air temperatures may be one of the factors of urolithiasis risk in population of the Primorsky Territory.

14738261,Cutaneous manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in Pakistani patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune process in which cutaneous lesions occur in majority of patients. This study from Karachi, Pakistan was conducted to determine the pattern and prevalence of such lesions in SLE in Pakistani patients.
METHODS: One hundred ninety eight patients with SLE fulfilling the clinical and laboratory criteria of the American Rheumatology Association were examined between 1986 and 2001 for the presence of cutaneous manifestations.
RESULTS: Skin changes noted were: noncicatricial diffuse alopecia (22%), malar rash (31%), mucosal lesions (20%), discoid eruptions (15%), photosensitivity (33%), vascular lesions (20%), pruritus (17%), and pigmentary changes (22%). Peripheral gangrene, chronic ulcers, Raynauds phenomenon, urticaria, chilblains, thrombophlebitis, palmar erythema, and erythema multiform were rare. Anti ANA and anti dsDNA were positive in 93% and 83% patients respectively.
CONCLUSION: A different clinical pattern was noted in our patients than reported previously.","['Rabbani MA', 'Shah SM', 'Ahmed A']",2003,53,11,J Pak Med Assoc,"Rabbani MA, et al.

14726865,The chilblain-like eruption as a diagnostic clue to the blast crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia.,"A 70-year-old Japanese man visited our clinic with the chief complaint of chilblain-like eruptions on the toes of both feet. His toes were bluish, erythematous, and swollen. Neither oral administration of vitamin E for 2 weeks nor wearing insulated socks improved the clinical manifestations. Peripheral blood examination revealed the presence of a large number of monocytic atypical cells and myeloblasts, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In the bone marrow, monocytic cells were elevated, and myelocytic atypical cells were observed. Chromosomal analysis demonstrated Philadelphia chromosome. We diagnosed him as having a blast crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). A biopsy specimen of the skin from the chilblain-like eruption showed infiltration of large, atypical, mononuclear cells; most of them were positive for CD68, and some of them were positive for CD14. Therefore, we concluded that the chilblain-like eruptions on his toes were specific skin lesions of a blast crisis in CML.","['Yazawa H', 'Saga K', 'Omori F', 'Jimbow K', 'Sasagawa Y']",2004,50,2 Suppl,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Yazawa H, et al.

The patient was not associated with any other systemic diseases and had suffered from chilblains at the same site for ten years before the ulcer appeared. The ulcer followed the development of a purpuric exudative lesion and had neither an undermined nor a surpiginous border in the early lesion. It gradually increased in size after various conservative treatments, recurred within a month after being excised and became aggravated after the administration of potassium iodide. Repeated histopathology of the ulcer revealed a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate with abscesses and an extravasation of red blood cells in the whole dermis, without showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A culture of the excised tissue yielded no growth. Laboratory tests were not specific and c-ANCA was also negative. The ulcer of the ear did dramatically respond to systemic predonisolone of 40 mg/day. The auricular and periauricular area are quite rare anatomical sites of this disease and the difference between pyoderma gangrenosum and cutaneous Wegener's granulomatosis is also discussed.","['Iijima S', 'Ogawa T', 'Nanno Y', 'Tsunoda T', 'Kudoh K']",2003,13,6,Eur J Dermatol,"Iijima S, et al.

12751587,"Epidemiology of U.S. Army cold weather injuries, 1980-1999.","BACKGROUND: Cold weather injuries (CWI) are of great military concern due to their wide-ranging impact on military readiness. Previous short-term studies have identified CWI to be more prevalent in African-Americans, infantrymen, and lower-ranking soldiers. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the occurrence of CWI hospitalizations in the U.S. Army from 1980 to 1999, and to identify possible trends, high-risk groups and/or activities.
METHODS: The U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine Total Army Injury and Health Outcomes Database was searched for hospitalizations with ICD-9-CM codes for frostbite, hypothermia, immersion foot, chilblains, and other. Information concerning each soldier included: gender, age, ethnicity, rank, occupation, type of injury, home of record, duty station, principle diagnosis, trauma code, and cause of injury. Data was available on the demographic composition of the Army, by year, and was used as the denominator when calculating the frequency of occurrence.
RESULTS: During the study period there were 2143 hospitalizations due to CWI. African-American men and women were injured approximately 4 times and 2.2 times as often as their Caucasian counterparts, respectively. Trauma and cause of injury codes indicate that about 80% of all CWI hospitalizations result on-duty and during organized training. The yearly rate of CWI hospitalization has declined from 38.2/100,000 in 1985 to 0.2/100,000 in 1999.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data are consistent with previous research concerning the increased rate of CWI among African-Americans though further investigation appears warranted. The occurrence of most CWI during on-duty training suggests preventability. The decline in the overall rate of CWI hospitalizations is multifactorial.","['DeGroot DW', 'Castellani JW', 'Williams JO', 'Amoroso PJ']",2003,74,5,Aviat Space Environ Med,"DeGroot DW, et al.

12746657,[Classification of dermatologic manifestations in lupus erythematosus].,"Various dermatologic manifestations are observed in the different lupus subsets. Lupus lesions are characterized by a dermo-epidermal dermatitis. Other lesions, vascular or non vascular, are essentially present in association with systemic lupus erythematosus. Acute, subacute and chronic lupus erythematosus are distinguishable according to their clinical aspects, pathological features and evolution. Acute lesions are either localized to the midface or widespread. Subacute lesions may be annular or psoriasiform. Chronic lupus erythematosus includes localized or widespread discoid lupus, lupus tumidus, chilblain lupus and panniculitis. Therapy of cutaneous lupus is mainly based on antimalarials and avoidance of sun irradiation. In refractory cutaneous lupus, no universal guidelines are currently available. Except for acrosyndromes and urticaria-like lesions, vascular lesions may be due to vasculitis or thrombosis. An accurate diagnosis is absolutely necessary since therapy is different in thrombosis and vasculitis. Non vascular and non lupus lesions are numerous, some of them require special treatment such as dapsone for bullous lupus.","['Francès C', 'Barete S', 'Ayoub N', 'Piette JC']",2003,154,1,Ann Med Interne (Paris),"Francès C, et al.

11763388,Verrucous form of chilblain lupus erythematosus.,"A 45-year-old woman had symmetrical livid plaques with yellowish hyperkeratoses for 5 years, which progressed on to the fingers and toes and on the soles of the feet. Two years later creamy, whitish areas and maceration appeared on the buccal mucosa and the lips. A skin biopsy revealed massive collagen hyaline degeneration in the perivascular area, hyperkeratosis and hypergranulosis, small lymphocyte infiltrates with several melanophages and extravasates of erythrocytes in the upper corium in perivascular areas and hydropic degeneration of basal keratinocytes. The findings using direct immunofluorescence were compatible with lupus erythematosus (LE). Laboratory investigation showed a slight leucopenia and thrombopenia, a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypocomplementaemia C3 and C4, a high titre of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies positivity of extractable nuclear antigen. The results reflected probably the development of a systemic form of the disease. The patient was successfully managed by methylprednisolone and hydroxychloroquine. After 1 year of therapy, a new skin biopsy revealed a substantial reduction of hyperkeratosis and hyaline degeneration of collagen tissue in the perivascular areas. The combination of the extensive hyperkeratosis and hyalinization thus seems to be features of the long-lasting, untreated lesions in chilblain LE.","['Pock L', 'Petrovská P', 'Becvár R', 'Mandys V', 'Hercogová J']",2001,15,5,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,"Pock L, et al.

11712041,A histologic and immunohistochemical study of chilblains.,"BACKGROUND: The histopathologic diagnosis of chilblains is controversial and the histologic changes are often considered nonspecific, mainly because they are poorly documented. Although a dermal inflammation in chilblains has been noticed, the infiltrate has not yet been characterized.
OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to analyze microscopic and immunohistochemical findings in a large series of chilblains and to compare the results with those of lupus erythematosus (LE).
METHODS: We included 36 cases of clinically typical chilblains of the hands, of which 17 were thoroughly investigated to rule out cryopathy or LE. Ten biopsy specimens of hand lesions from patients with proven LE were included as controls. All slides were analyzed by conventional microscopy and by immunohistochemistry with anti-CD3, anti-CD20, and anti-CD68 antibodies.
RESULTS: The most characteristic finding in chilblains (47% of cases) was the association of edema and reticular dermis infiltrate that showed a perieccrine reinforcement. Such a combination of changes was not observed in LE. Epidermal changes in chilblains consisted mainly in necrotic keratinocytes in 52% of cases. The comparison of 17 idiopathic chilblains with LE showed significant differences in spongiosis (58% vs 0% respectively), vacuolation of basal layer (6% vs 60%), edema of the dermis (70% vs 20%), and deep perieccrine inflammation (76% vs 0%). Immunohistochemistry showed that the infiltrate was composed of a majority of T cells associated with macrophages and a few B lymphocytes. The same pattern was observed in both chilblains and LE.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that a predominantly T-cell papillary and deep infiltrate with a perieccrine reinforcement, associated with dermal edema and necrotic keratinocytes, are the hallmarks of chilblains of the hands. These changes can help differentiate idiopathic perniosis from LE; immunohistochemistry is of no use in differentiation.","['Cribier B', 'Djeridi N', 'Peltre B', 'Grosshans E']",2001,45,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Cribier B, et al.

A study of the relationship to lupus erythematosus.,"We investigated 33 patients affected with chilblain lesions following a persisting course of more than 1 month. We focused on the incidence of an underlying connective tissue disease, mostly lupus erythematosus (LE), and we analyzed features of idiopathic chilblains compared with those of chilblain lesions associated with connective tissue disease. We also carried out a prospective follow-up of patients. Eleven patients included in the study were free of any clinical and/or laboratory abnormality suggestive of connective tissue disease, while 22 of 33 patients showed 1 or several abnormalities raising suspicion for connective tissue disease, and among them 8 had a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) established at initial evaluation based on the American College of Rheumatology revised criteria. The comparative analysis of patients with idiopathic chilblains and patients with chilblains associated with LE showed that female sex and persistence of lesions beyond cold seasons were significantly associated with chilblain LE. Histopathologic studies of chilblain lesions did not reveal features typical of LE in any case, but revealed a higher incidence of a deep perisudoral infiltrate in idiopathic chilblains. In patients showing signs of connective tissue disease, positive cutaneous immunofluorescence was correlated with the presence of circulating antinuclear antibodies. Two patients had an ascertained diagnosis of SLE with severe manifestations during prospective follow-up, requiring treatment with oral steroids in both cases. Chilblains following a chronic course may reveal connective tissue disease, and patients affected with chilblains associated with autoimmune abnormalities may develop severe SLE. Accordingly, long-term follow-up of these patients is warranted.","['Viguier M', 'Pinquier L', 'Cavelier-Balloy B', 'de la Salmonière P', 'Cordoliani F', 'Flageul B', 'Morel P', 'Dubertret L', 'Bachelez H']",2001,80,3,Medicine (Baltimore),"Viguier M, et al.

OBJECTIVE: We describe 4 cases of SCLE, one associated with chilblain lupus, which occurred during therapy with oral terbinafine for onychomycosis.
METHODS: Of 21 consecutive patients with SCLE attending the outpatient dermatology department at Muenster University clinic during a 1-year period, 4 patients with terbinafine-induced SCLE were seen. Patients were examined fully and photographed; histologic findings as well as serologic and follow-up data were evaluated.
RESULTS: In addition to high titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) with a homogeneous pattern, anti-Ro(SS-A) antibodies were present; in 3 of 4 women, anti-La(SS-B) antibodies were also found. All patients had anti-histone antibodies as in drug-induced lupus and showed the characteristic genetic association of SCLE with the HLA-B8,DR3 haplotype; moreover, in 2 cases, HLA-DR2 was also present. After discontinuation of terbinafine, ANA titers decreased; anti-histone antibodies also became undetectable within 4(1/2) months in 3 patients concomitant with subsidence of the SCLE eruption in all patients.
CONCLUSION: Terbinafine is a drug that appears to infrequently induce SCLE with high titers of ANAs and anti-histone antibodies in genetically susceptible persons.","['Bonsmann G', 'Schiller M', 'Luger TA', 'Ständer S']",2001,44,6,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Bonsmann G, et al.

A clinical overview].,"Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a disease with a wide spectrum of cutaneous and systemic manifestations and has been the subject of many studies over several decades. Clinical features of patients with LE show a great variation, and for this reason it is difficult to develop a unifying concept of this disease. Consequently, this has led to the identification of subsets which have been defined by constellations of clinical and photobiological features, histological changes as well as laboratory abnormalities. Besides the characteristic classical forms such as systemic LE (SLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), and discoid LE (DLE), there are uncommon variants of LE which often lead to diagnostic difficulties. Bullous LE (BLE) and urticarial vasculitis are listed as characteristic but non-specific manifestations of systemic LE. LE tumidus (LET), LE hypertrophic/verrucous (LEHV), chilblain LE, and LE profundus (LEP) are uncommon subtypes of chronic cutaneous LE. Annular erythema and papulonodular mucinosis are further uncommon cutaneous manifestations of LE.

CL lesions developed and were aggravated by the cold during autumn and winter, they improved during summer. Skin biopsy performed in 5 patients from the lesions showed, on histology, a typical pattern of alterations with granular deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction on direct immunofluorescence. Laboratory findings showed: ANA and anti-SSA/Ro were detected in all the patients, anti-SSA/Ro were isolated in 4 patients and associated with anti-Sm in one case, anti-U1 RNP in one case and with anti-Sm and anti-RNP in a third case. Complement consumption was observed in 5 patients, anti-dsDNA in the six patients with SLE, hypergammaglobulinemia in 4 and rheumatoid factor in one. The fine specificity of anti-SSA/Ro as determined by immunoblotting using a human spleen extract as a substrate, showed: anti-60kD and anti-52 kD in two sera, anti-60kD isolated in 2 sera, anti-52kD isolated in one serum (from the patient without SLE) while 2 sera did not blotted. In conclusion, our study confirms the previous report of anti-SSA/Ro antibodies in association with CL. This clinical and serologic association widens the spectrum of cutaneous disease that is associated with antibodies to SSA/Ro to include conditions such as to SCLE, hypergammaglobulinemic purpura and neonatal lupus.","['Franceschini F', 'Calzavara-Pinton P', 'Valsecchi L', 'Quinzanini M', 'Zane C', 'Facchetti F', 'Airò P', 'Cattaneo R']",1999,455,,Adv Exp Med Biol,"Franceschini F, et al.

10459116,Lupus erythematosus-associated red lunula.,"BACKGROUND: Red lunulae have only rarely been described in patients with lupus erythematosus.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the frequency and classified the type of red lunulae in patients with definite lupus erythematosus seen in an interdisciplinary dermatorheumatologic outpatient clinic.
METHODS: We studied 56 patients with either systemic or cutaneous lupus erythematosus for the presence of red lunulae.
RESULTS: Eleven of 56 patients (19.6%) with lupus erythematosus had red lunulae. All of them showed a complete type of red lunulae, which was seen on all finger nails in 10 patients and on a single finger nail in 1 patient. Seven patients suffered from systemic lupus, the other from subacute cutaneous (n = 2) or chronic discoid cutaneous lupus (n = 2). There was no statistically significant difference in autoantibody expression or treatment regimen between patients with or without red lunulae. However, symptomatic patients had a shorter disease interval, and all but 1 showed either periungual erythema or chilblain lupus. Periungual erythema was not observed in any patient without red lunulae.
CONCLUSION: Red lunulae, although rarely described in the literature, are not an uncommon symptom of patients with lupus erythematosus. They seem to be associated with periungual erythema or chilblain lupus. Red lunulae should be considered in the clinical spectrum of lupus disease.","['Wollina U', 'Barta U', 'Uhlemann C', 'Oelzner P']",1999,41,3 Pt 1,J Am Acad Dermatol,"Wollina U, et al.

10342714,Chilblain lupus erythematosus is associated with antibodies to SSA/Ro.,"Chilblain lupus erythematosus (CL) of Hutchinson is a subtype of lupus erythematosus (LE) characterized by erythematous lesions induced by cold, damp climates. A number of patients affected by CL eventually develop features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report here 9 patients with chilblain cutaneous lesions, 6 of them were affected by SLE and 2 by SCLE. The onset of CL preceded the diagnosis of LE, from 1 to 10 years in 3 cases, it was concurrent in one case and was subsequent in the remaining 4 cases. Raynaud's phenomenon and photosensitivity were other prominent clinical features in patients with CL. Nailfold capillaroscopy revealed pathological changes in every patient examined. ANA and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies were detected in all nine patients. Anti-SSB/La were detected in 2 cases, anti-Sm in one case, and anti-Sm and anti-RNP in a one case. Antibodies to dsDNA and complement consumption were found in the six patients with SLE. The fine specificity of anti-SSA/Ro was determined by immunoblotting: anti-60kD and anti-52 kD were detected in three sera, anti-60kD alone in 5 sera, while one serum did not blot. In conclusion, the present study suggests that chilblain LE is associated with SSA/Ro autoantibodies, as is SCLE, hypergammaglobulinemic purpura and neonatal lupus erythematosus.","['Franceschini F', 'Calzavara-Pinton P', 'Quinzanini M', 'Cavazzana I', 'Bettoni L', 'Zane C', 'Facchetti F', 'Airò P', 'McCauliffe DP', 'Cattaneo R']",1999,8,3,Lupus,"Franceschini F, et al.

9865869,Drugs causing fixed eruptions: a study of 450 cases.,"BACKGROUND: Drug eruptions are among the most common cutaneous disorders encountered by the dermatologist. Some drug eruptions, although trivial, may cause cosmetic embarrassment and fixed drug eruption (FDE) is one of them. The diagnostic hallmark is its recurrence at previously affected sites.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated 450 FDE patients to determine the causative drugs.
RESULTS: The ratio of men to women was 1:1.1. The main presentation of FDE was circular hyperpigmented lesion. Less commonly FDE presented as: nonpigmenting erythema, urticaria, dermatitis, periorbital or generalized hypermelanosis. Occasionally FDE mimicked lichen planus, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, paronychia, cheilitis, psoriasis, housewife's dermatitis, melasma, lichen planus actinicus, discoid lupus erythematosus, erythema annulare centrifugum, pemphigus vulgaris, chilblains, pityriasis rosea and vulval or perianal hypermelanosis. Cotrimoxazole was the most common cause of FDE. Other drugs incriminated were tetracycline, metamizole, phenylbutazone, paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, mefenamic acid, metronidazole, tinidazole, chlormezanone, amoxycillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, belladonna, griseofulvin, phenobarbitone, diclofenac sodium, indomethacin, ibuprofen, diflunisal, pyrantel pamoate, clindamycin, allopurinol, orphenadrine, and albendazole.

Their exact mechanisms remain unknown, but epidemiological data favour disturbances of thermoregulation: cold climate, outdoor occupation and low body mass index are significant risk factors for most of them. Acrosyndromes with vasoconstriction are highly prevalent in France: 10 to 15% for Raynaud's phenomenon and acrocyanosis; 2 to 6% for chilblains. Acrosyndromes with vasodilatation (acrocholose, erythermalgia) are much rare. There is no link between Raynaud's phenomenon and tobacco use, alcohol consumption, oestrogen treatment, carpal tunnel syndrome or thoracic outlet syndrome.

They are associated with purpura fulminans and coumarin-induced skin necrosis. Recently, necrotic livedo of the extremities, severe chilblains and severe frostbite have been observed in protein C or S deficient patients. Our study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of cold-induced acral manifestations in patients with protein C or S deficiency. One-hundred-and-six patients with protein C or S deficiency and controls matched for sex and age were studied by questionnaire. Data included any history of acral manifestation possibly related to cold exposure, i.e. chilblains, Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis and possible associated factors. Assessment of the diagnosis by a dermatologist was recorded. No difference was found in the prevalence of acral manifestations between patients and controls. This study suggests that protein C and S deficiencies are not risk factors for cold-induced acral manifestations.","['Benchikhi H', 'Roujeau JC', 'Levent M', 'Gouault-Heilmann M', 'Revuz J', 'Cosnes A']",1998,78,5,Acta Derm Venereol,"Benchikhi H, et al.

9733453,Clinical significance of immunoglobulin A antiphospholipid antibodies: possible association with skin manifestations and small vessel vasculitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether immunoglobulin A (IgA) antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are an independent risk factor for specific manifestations of collagen vascular diseases.
METHODS: We determined IgG, IgM, and IgA anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) in 77 patients with various collagen diseases. Fifty-four patients who had positive results for either or both antibody classes were compared to 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who had none of these antibodies. The association between the antibodies and clinical manifestations (thrombosis, fetal loss, thrombocytopenia, biological false positive test for syphilis, cutaneous manifestations, central nervous system involvement, and renal involvement) was analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 54 patients with aPL, 33 showed significantly high levels of IgA aCL. Among them, IgA aCL coexisted with other aCL isotypes or LAC in 24 patients. The 9 patients with IgA aCL alone frequently had vasculitis associated manifestations, although thrombotic events and recurrent fetal loss were rare. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that IgA aCL were independently associated with thrombocytopenia, skin ulcers, chilblain lupus, and vasculitis. There was also an association between IgM aCL and skin ulcers or chilblain lupus.
CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations of patients with IgA aCL differ from those of patients with IgG aCL. Determination of all 3 aCL isotypes and LAC is important to assess the risk of specific clinical manifestations in patients with aPL.","['Tajima C', 'Suzuki Y', 'Mizushima Y', 'Ichikawa Y']",1998,25,9,J Rheumatol,"Tajima C, et al.

Any recrudescence of serological abnormalities or clinical symptoms was not observed until now, although chilblain lupus still persisted. Originally SLE is frequent in young female and often attended with renal disease, central nerve disease and serositis.

9628980,[Multiple Fordyce-type angiokeratomas of the scrotum. An iatrogenic case].,"BACKGROUND: Angiokeratoma is a wart-like vascular lesion of the skin. There are five types of angiokeratoma: the Mibelli-type, the Fordyce-type, the solitary and multiple (papular) types, the angiokeratoma circumscriptum, and the angiokeratoma corporis diffusum. The ""Mibelli-type"" occurs on the acral sites, mainly digits, of young people affected by repeated attacks of chilblain, which result in a deleterious effects on vessel walls. The ""Fordyce-type"" occurs on the scrotal skin of young and adults as a secondary effect to an increased blood pressure in scrotal veins. An equivalent form affecting adult females and occurring analogously on the skin of the vulva is also on record. The ""solitary and multiple papular types"" of young individuals affect the lower extremities and is considered a consequence of a congenital deficiency of elastic tissue in regional veins. We suggest the term ""acquired angiokeratomas"" for these three above mentioned clinical forms of angiokeratomas, leaving apart the other two types which are essentially congenital. In fact the ""angiokeratoma circumscriptum"" is a nevoid hamartomatous lesion arising early in life during infancy or childhood, sometimes in association with other congenital malformation of other sites, while the ""angiokeratoma corporis diffusum"" almost always occurs in association with enzyme disorders, usually alpha-galactosidase A enzyme deficiency (Anderson-Fabry disease), an X-linked recessive disorder affecting homozigous male patients in their adulthood.
CASE REPORT: A case of multiple angiokeratomas of the scrotum (Fordyce-type) arisen in a 62-year old male patient following surgical amputation of the penis and bilateral inguino-crural lymphadenectomy for carcinoma of the penis is reported on.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Although they are well on record cases of angiokeratomas of the scrotum arising after surgical injuries to the outer vein pudenda (mainly following inguinocrural hernioplasty), based on a computerized search of the literature on theme this case represents the first iatrogenic example of such an occurrence. The pathogenetic mechanism leading to the the rise of angiokeratomas mediated by the increase of the blood pressure in the superficial scrotal veins is discussed. This example represents an additional case report of inevitable and sometimes unsuspected iatrogenic pathology in medicine.","['Bisceglia M', 'Carosi I', 'Castelvetere M', 'Murgo R']",1998,90,1,Pathologica,"Bisceglia M, et al.

For the standard regimen, Cardiocrome was first injected daily, usually for 4 weeks, and later by means of intermittent injections for maintenance treatment. Clinical improvement was obtained in eight of the patients. Improvement was observed in the muscle symptoms of easy fatigability, motor disability and severity of stroke-like episodes, as well as in various other symptoms such as phosphate, tinnitus, headache, corneal edema, chilblains, thalamic pain, respiratory failure, and nystagmus. This clinical improvement was maintained for more than 1 year by additional intermittent injections.

We examined 39 skin biopsies from 38 patients who presented with acral purpuric lesions, suggesting a diagnosis of perniosis clinically or pathologically. The presence of a systemic or extracutaneous disease was established in 17 patients, including 5 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 3 with antiphospholipid antibodies, in 1 in whom there was underlying HIV disease, 2 with viral hepatitis, 2 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 2 with cryofibrinogenemia, 1 with hypergammaglobulinemia, 1 with iritis, and 1 with Crohn's disease. In the other 21 patients, the clinical presentations prompted further studies in 12, which showed a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) in 10. A diagnosis of idiopathic perniosis (IP) was rendered in all 21 of these patients including those in whom a positive ANA was discovered, based on the absence of any other serological markers, signs, or symptoms indicative of a specific systemic disease complex; many had Raynaud's phenomenon, small joint arthralgias, atopy, or a family history of either connective tissue disease or Raynaud's disease. The histopathology of IP comprised a superficial and deep angiocentric lymphocytic infiltrate with papillary dermal edema and lymphocytic exocytosis directed to retia and acrosyringia. A few cases showed a mild vacuolopathic or lichenoid interface dermatitis, adventitial dermal mucinosis, lymphocytic eccrine hidradenitis, vascular ectasia, and thrombosis confined to dermal papillae capillaries. The biopsies from patients with iritis, RA, and Crohn's disease showed a granulomatous vasculitis and a granuloma annulare-like tissue reaction. The biopsies from the patients with SLE, cryofibrinogenemia, primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and hypergammaglobulinemia shared a similar histopathology comprising an interface dermatitis, superficial and deep angiocentric and eccrinotropic lymphocytic infiltrates, vascular ectasia, and dermal mucinosis with prominent involvement of the eccrine coil. Many cases did not show features of IP, namely papillary dermal edema, thrombosis of dermal papillary capillaries, and lymphocytic exocytosis into the retia and acrosyringia. There was frequent vascular fibrin deposition involving reticular dermal vessels. The latter two variables were statistically significant discriminators between IP and in perniotic lesions observed in the setting of underlying systemic disease. With respect to the latter, some cases occurred in the setting of cold exposure and were designated by us as ""secondary perniosis"" (SP), whereas others showed no specific association with cold exposure and were designated as perniotic mimics (PMs) based exclusively on the gross and microscopic morphology of the lesions.","['Crowson AN', 'Magro CM']",1997,28,4,Hum Pathol,Crowson AN and Magro CM.

9031789,Nailfold capillary microscopy in patients with anticardiolipin antibodies: a case-control study.,"BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: This case-control study was undertaken to determine whether anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) are responsible for particular abnormalities in nailfold capillary microscopy (NCM). Cases comprised 33 consecutive patients positive for ACA (24 women and 7 men). Controls comprised the same number of ACA-negative patients, with the same sex ratio, the same diagnosis and the most similar duration of disease possible. Clinical data, serum samples and NCM recordings were obtained from all patients and controls.
RESULTS: In each group, 22 patients had connective-tissue-related disorders and 11 various other diseases. In ACA-positive patients, the mean IgG ACA titre was 39 +/- 58 IgG phospholipid units. Cases and controls displayed various cutaneous manifestations. In ACA-positive patients, there were Raynaud's phenomenon (54%), cutaneous vasculitis (24%), scleroderma changes (18%), photosensitivity (9%), a history of digital gangrene (6%), malar rash (6%), acrocyanosis (6%), chilblains (3%), livedo reticularis (3%) and purpura (3%). Cases and controls exhibited numerous NCM abnormalities. In ACA-positive patients, they included haemorrhages (54%), oedema (24%), bushy capillaries (21%), disordered capillaries (18%), capillary bed disorganization (12%), capillary rarefaction (9%), giant capillaries (6%) and 'desert areas' (3%). There were no correlations between the ACA titres on the one hand and the number of cutaneous manifestations or NCM abnormalities on the other.
CONCLUSIONS: ACA-positive patients frequently exhibit clinical skin lesions and abnormal NCM.

8949425,Cutaneous manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus.,"We have assessed the cutaneous signs in 73 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), seen during a 5-year period in an English hospital. Most previous information about the cutaneous manifestations of SLE has been obtained from studies performed in the U.S.A. We classified lesions as specific cutaneous and mucosal LE (acute, subacute and chronic) or non-specific LE-related, e.g. photosensitivity, urticaria, erythema, Raynaud's phenomenon or vasculitis. Acute cutaneous LE lesions included a butterfly rash with erythematous macules, telangiectasia or papulosquamous lesions, seen in 37 patients (51%) and facial oedema seen in four patients (5%). Five patients (7%) had psoriasiform subacute cutaneous LE. Chronic cutaneous LE was common: 18 patients (25%) had chronic discoid lesions (DLE) and, in 12 (15%), these had preceded systemic disease. One patient had facial lupus profundus. Ten patients (14%) had scarring alopecia secondary to DLE. Fifteen patients (20.5%) had chronic chilblain lupus. Twenty-three patients (31.5%) had a history of mouth ulceration. Of these, 11 (15%) gave a history of ulcers at the onset of their disease. Three (4%) had erythema and superficial ulceration of the palate, not typical of aphthous ulcers, and three (4%) had chronic buccal plaques. Cheilitis due to DLE was seen in three (4%), episcleritis in three (4%), five (7%) had nasal disease, six (8%) bullous skin eruptions, one 'the bullous eruption of SLE', four bullae associated with cutaneous vasculitis, and one bullae associated with ultraviolet radiation. Forty-six (63%) observed photosensitivity. A non-scarring alopecia occurred in 29 (40%). Vascular phenomena were common: three patients (4%) had chronic palmar erythema, Raynaud's phenomenon occurred in 44 patients (60%), chronic urticaria, worsened by sun exposure, was noted by 32 (44%) (in whom the lesions often lasted more than 36 h), eight (11%) had cutaneous vasculitis and three (4%) livedo reticularis. Skin changes play a prominent part in SLE and may provide helpful diagnostic information. In this British population, chilblains and urticaria were particularly common. Lesions of subacute cutaneous LE were relatively unusual in this group of patients with SLE.","['Yell JA', 'Mbuagbaw J', 'Burge SM']",1996,135,3,Br J Dermatol,"Yell JA, et al.

One of them was a 72-year-old woman (case 1), and the other a 62-year-old man (case 2). We attempted to treat these patients by excising the lesions and subsequently performing full-thickness free skin grafting, using skin from the abdominal region. No recurrence was seen in the operated area 7 years (case 1) and 3 years (case 2) after surgery. However, lesions persisted in the areas not operated upon, and in the areas where lesions had not been adequately excised. These results suggest that surgical removal of local factors reduces the rash in these cases. In addition, both patients were serologically positive for the anti-Ro/SS-A antibody suggesting that local expression of the Ro/SS-A antigen may be involved in the pathogenesis of the skin lesions. To our knowledge, full thickness free skin grafting has not been used previously to treat CL-associated skin lesions, and is promising as a treatment for patients who do not respond to conventional means.","['Aoki T', 'Ishizawa T', 'Hozumi Y', 'Aso K', 'Kondo S']",1996,134,3,Br J Dermatol,"Aoki T, et al.

7655105,"Classification of lupus erythematosus based upon cutaneous manifestations. Dermatological, systemic and laboratory findings in 191 patients.","BACKGROUND: Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a multi-organ-system disease, the characteristics of which are reflected in the 1982 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). From a dermatological point of view, only the presence of LE-specific histopathology is necessary and sufficient for the diagnosis of LE. The association between the type of LE-specific skin lesion and the severity of extracutaneous manifestations of LE has not yet been investigated systematically.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate, according to the type of LE skin lesions, the prevalence of the 1982 criteria for SLE.
METHODS: We selected 191 patients whose skin lesions were histologically diagnosed as LE specific. Patients were classified on the basis of skin disease, and their clinical and laboratory data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 191 patients, 130 (68%) exhibited only one type of LE-specific skin lesion (monomorphic), 55 (29%) had two types (bimorphic) and the remaining 6 (3%) displayed three types (trimorphic). Nineteen of 22 (86%) patients who presented discoid lupus skin lesions above the neck without other eruptions were classified in the cutaneous-limited LE spectrum. Of 116 patients with acute lupus skin lesions (malar rash), 83 (72%) clearly fulfilled the 1982 ARA criteria for SLE. In skin lesions of LE profundus, chilblain lupus, subacute lupus (annular-polycyclic erythema and the papulosquamous variant), there were no significant correlations between the type of eruption and the severity of extracutaneous manifestations.
CONCLUSION: Patients with acute lupus skin lesions could usually be classified as suffering from SLE, whereas monomorphic patients with localized discoid lesions rarely exhibited extracutaneous manifestations. This tendency was less distinct in bimorphic patients. Almost all patients with subacute skin lesions were bimorphic or trimorphic, which might be due to genetic or racial differences between Japanese and other populations.","['Watanabe T', 'Tsuchida T']",1995,190,4,Dermatology,"Watanabe T and Tsuchida T.

7867381,Chilblain lupus erythematosus (lupus pernio): clinical review of the Mayo Clinic experience and proposal of diagnostic criteria.,"Five cases of chilblain lupus erythematosus were retrospectively reviewed regarding their clinical, histopathologic, serologic, and immunofluorescence findings. Ages at onset of chilblain lupus erythematosus varied from 26 to 73 years, with a female-to-male ratio of 3:2. Since other entities can be confused with this disorder, we propose the following diagnostic criteria. The two major criteria are skin lesions in acral locations induced by exposure to cold or a drop in temperature, and evidence of lupus erythematosus in the skin lesions by results of histopathologic examination or direct immunofluorescence study. The three minor criteria are coexistence of systemic lupus erythematosus or other skin lesions of discoid lupus erythematosus, response to anti-lupus erythematosus therapy, and negative results of cryoglobulin and cold agglutinin studies. We conclude that chilblain lupus erythematosus can be diagnosed and treated. Discoid lupus erythematosus lesions respond more quickly to treatment than chilblain lupus erythematosus lesions. Treatment with antimalarial agents, prednisone, pentoxifylline, or dapsone was of benefit to our patients.","['Su WP', 'Perniciaro C', 'Rogers RS', 'White JW']",1994,54,6,Cutis,"Su WP, et al.

METHODS: Between 1990 and 1992, 426 agricultural workers, authorized to use pesticides, were examined. The control group consisted of 100 nonagriculture workers, who were age and sex matched.
RESULTS: Some common dermatological diseases, such as vitiligo, psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, had an incidence overlapping with that found in the controls. Irritant plant dermatoses (2.5%), episodes of acute systemic intoxication from pesticides (6.8%), onychopathies due to chronic trauma (16%), contact dermatitis of the hands (12%), chilblains (7%) and Favre-Racouchot syndrome (2.5%) showed a higher prevalence in the study group.

8474715,Milkers' chilblains.,"AIM: To report on the clinical features, causative factors, management and preventive measures for chilblains of the hands occurring in milkers in the Waikato area of New Zealand.
METHODS: A review was made of the case notes of all patients with milkers' chilblains seen in dermatological practice in Hamilton over a ten year period ending in 1991 and follow up interviews were made.
RESULTS: Eleven milkers were seen with distinctive, at times disabling, seasonally-recurring chilblains of the hands. In most patients the chilblains had developed early in their milking careers. Difficulty was experienced by both the patients and their doctors in recognising the nature of their skin condition. Sunlight aggravation of the lesions was a feature. In most patients treatment of the presenting episode required time off work and in several patients significant scarring resulted. Three patients left dairying because of the chilblains. Those who continued received preventive advice but four patients had further lesions in subsequent years although these were mild.
CONCLUSIONS: Milkers' chilblains are uncommon but some cases are misdiagnosed and milder cases may not present for medical attention. Morbidity can be significant. Preventive measures are helpful but their effect may be limited by the difficulty of wearing gloves for milking. The vasodilator nifedipine is suggested as a prophylactic therapy for these patients.",['Duffill MB'],1993,106,952,N Z Med J,Duffill MB. Milkers' chilblains.

1519939,Possible Werner syndrome. A unique association with spontaneous digital gangrene in infancy and decreased life span of cultured skin fibroblasts.,"BACKGROUND: Werner syndrome is a hereditary disease characterized by several features generally associated with aging. However, the differences between Werner syndrome and the normal aging process are clear. Werner syndrome is usually diagnosed through the clinical signs and symptoms it presents. In recent years, however, the cultured skin fibroblasts of patients have grown slowly and patients have a short life span; these characteristics provide a useful diagnostic aid.
OBSERVATIONS: We recently examined a 42-year-old single man who had short fingers, marked facial scars resulting from chilblain-like eruption in infancy, glaucoma caused by uveitis developed in his middle age, callosities on the soles, and immaturation of sexual glands. Repeated peripheral blood examinations showed a positive result for antinuclear factor, slight elevation of immunoglobulin levels, and a low leukocyte count. His family had repeated consanguineous marriages and his parents were cousins. We cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient's forearm and compared them with those of four normal control male subjects. The patient's skin fibroblasts showed a remarkably low population growth rate and a total replicative life span.
CONCLUSION: The patients presented unique clinical features for Werner syndrome such as chilblain-like eruption in infancy and glaucoma caused by uveitis. Cell culture studies revealed cellular abnormalities compatible with Werner syndrome. We thus diagnosed the patients as possibly having Werner syndrome.","['Iijima S', 'Arinami T', 'Otsuka F']",1992,128,9,Arch Dermatol,"Iijima S, et al. Possible Werner syndrome.

1522352,Chronic pernio: another cause of blue toes.,"It is the purpose of this report to focus attention on the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of chronic pernio. Thirty-nine patients meeting our strict criteria for a diagnosis of chronic pernio were seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1976 and 1988 and form the basis for this report. Persons with upper extremity lesions only were excluded. Twenty-eight of the patients were female, 11 were male. Age at onset of symptoms ranged from 13 to 68 years of age, with symptoms appearing from 1 to 37 years following cold injury. The lesions were bilateral in 35 (90%) of patients and symmetric in 28 (71%). Nine patients who underwent skin temperature studies following cold water immersion, showed a vasospastic response. Chronic pernio is characterized by recurring erythematous, vesicular or ulcerative lesions of the lower extremities and toes, but may present with only digital cyanosis, usually bilateral and commonly symmetrical. The diagnosis is suggested by eliciting a temporal relation between cool weather and symptom onset, particularly if there is no associated occlusive peripheral arterial disease. Treatment consists of avoidance of cold and other vasoconstrictive influences. Prazosin has been effective in the acute management and as prophylaxis against recurrences.","['Spittell JA', 'Spittell PC']",1992,11,1,Int Angiol,Spittell JA and Spittell PC.

Twenty-one cold injuries were classified as first degree, 15 as second degree and 13 as third degree. No difference in ambient temperature at the time of injury was observed between the three categories of injuries, but the duration of cold exposure was significantly longer in those suffering third degree injury. Thirty-eight of the 40 soldiers experienced sequelae. The trend was that the severity of sequelae was most pronounced in third degree injuries. However, soldiers with first degree injury may suffer from significant sequelae, while those with third degree injury may exhibit a more benign clinical course. Overall degree of distress from sequelae was mild to moderate with exacerbation of symptoms and signs upon cold exposure. Although the influence on civilian occupational activity was minor, a substantial negative impact on performance in the field or combat setting may be anticipated.

Although the percentage of cases who had revealed chilblain frequently (40.0%) and the age of chilblain onset (mean: 10.8 years old) in SLE group were not significantly different from those of control (28.4% and 12.4 years old, respectively), the chilblain which SLE patients developed had some characteristics compared to that of control, (1) higher incidence of chilblain episodes, (2) longer duration until cure, (3) more liability that chilblain leads to erosion or ulceration and (4) frequent occurrence of chilblain in the other seasons than winter. Especially SLE patients with the characteristic of (4) had higher association rates of Raynaud's phenomena, chilblain LE and livedo, suggesting disorder of peripheral circulation. It was also revealed that females are generally more liable to develop chilblain than males (females: 40.0%, males: 13.1%). Those results suggest some important relationship between chilblain and LE lesions. It is supposed that chilblain with the characteristics described above may possibly be transformed into LE lesions.","['Morioka N', 'Tsuchida T', 'Ueda Y', 'Ishibashi Y']",1991,101,6,Nihon Hifuka Gakkai Zasshi,"Morioka N, et al.

4092382,Classification of urticaria and the reactive inflammatory vascular dermatoses.,"The common feature of all the conditions discussed in this article is that they are inflammatory vascular dermatoses that may occur as reactive processes in association with other diseases. The histopathologic characteristics of the lesions range from mild, perivascular dermal infiltration with inflammatory cells and vasodilation to various degrees of vessel damage (endothelial swelling to fibrinoid necrosis). The vessel damage is reflected in varying degrees of secondary changes including extravasation of edema fluid, extravasation of erythrocytes, epidermal necrosis, separation of the dermal-epidermal junction zone, and widespread tissue necrosis. The etiology of most of these conditions is still unknown, although strong evidence indicates that type III (circulating immune-complex-mediated) pathogenesis may be responsible for necrotizing venulitis (leukocytoclastic vasculitis) and that a type I (IgE-mediated) pathogenesis may be involved in some types of urticaria. For many of the reactions described, the patients have serum sickness-like systemic signs and symptoms in addition to cutaneous lesions, and a circulating immune-complex-mediated pathogenesis has been considered. Future investigations must address the types of antigens and antibodies present in the circulating immune complexes, the detection of specific antigen in cutaneous blood vessels, the reproduction of lesions in experimental animals, and the mechanisms responsible for the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions produced, with special attention to the possibility that vessel damage results from circulating immune complex-induced lymphocytic rather than only leukocytoclastic vasculitis.",['Jorizzo JL'],1985,3,1,Dermatol Clin,Jorizzo JL.

6707531,[Capillaroscopy and Raynaud's phenomenon].,"Nailfold capillary microscopy is a simple and noninvasive screening test for the etiological diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon: --dilating capillary dystrophia, with its large capillary loops (megacapillaries), it is a very specific sign of connective tissue disorders, especially systemic sclerosis; --meshed or branched-tree shaped capillaries are neocapillaries, the meaning of which is very often a dermal vasculitis (S. L. E., rheumatoid arthritis, paraneoplastic Raynaud's phenomenon, or even chilblains); --when numerous abnormal capillary loops and hemorrhages are seen without any special pattern, the diagnosis of idiopathic Raynaud's disease is very unlikely and an extensive biological investigation is needed; --nailfold capillaries look like normal in idiopathic Raynaud's disease and, in this case, only a sharp physical examination and a few biological tests are required. Conjunctival angioscopy is a useful complementary test in some cases when nailfold capillaroscopy is unreliable. Capillary video microscopy is an interesting method for further investigations about the physiopathology of Raynaud's phenomenon.","['Carpentier P', 'Franco A']",1984,9,1,J Mal Vasc,Carpentier P and Franco A.

All patients reported that exposure to cold had preceded their symptoms. Histologic study demonstrated a lymphocytic vasculitis, characterized by lymphocytes infiltrating the walls of blood vessels in eight (88%) of nine lesions. This pattern of inflammation is different from the perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate that is common to lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme, lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (Jessner), and drug eruptions. It also serves to distinguish the disorder from other clinical conditions resembling it, such as cellulitis, herpes simplex infection, and disseminated gonococcemia. To the best of our knowledge, this lymphocytic vasculitis has not been previously described as occurring in pernio. We believe the unique disorder that we are reporting is a common, but infrequently recognized, variant of pernio.","['Herman EW', 'Kezis JS', 'Silvers DN']",1981,117,1,Arch Dermatol,"Herman EW, et al.

It occurs commonly on the digits, calves and heels. Nasal lesions are rare. Chronic facial discoid LE usually appears before the chilblain form but, in most instances, resolves even though the chilblain lesions persists. Transformation to systemic LE occurs more often in those who develop both forms of cutaneous LE simultaneously and in the erythema multiforme syndrome. The chilblain lesions are the result of microvascular injury secondary to exposure to cold and possibly hyperviscosity from immunological abnormalities, Elevated serum gammaglobulins, positive latex factor and speckled pattern antinuclear factor are common. None of the usual treatments for cutaneous LE is effective for the chilblain lesions, probably because none is directed towards prevention and treatment of the microvascular stasis.","['Millard LG', 'Rowell NR']",1978,98,5,Br J Dermatol,Millard LG and Rowell NR.

19989148,The Place of Operations upon the Sympathetic System in the Treatment of Poliomyelitis.,"Revived interest in sympathetic surgery originated in orthopaedics. Royle's theories and operations. Their trial, failure and final abandonment. Value of sympathetic operations widely investigated; while finality has not been reached they have proved effective for three main purposes: (1) Relief of pain especially in bladder diseases. (2) Removal of inhibition and sphincteric spasm in alimentary, anal and bladder diseases.

(2) The limb with considerable and rapidly increasing shortening. Sometimes these limbs show a fair return of power, and were it not for the heavy boot made necessary by the shortening, the patient could be made to walk well.Method of attack.-(1) Periarterial sympathectomy; (2) ramisectomy; (3) ganglionectomy. Physiological basis of each. Criticism of (1) and (2).Details of the operation for ganglionectomy.-Alternative approaches and their advantages.

19986503,Note on Idiosyncrasies and Abnormalities in Human Beings.,"Idiosyncrasies are the expression of abnormal mental or physical reaction towards ""agents."" An attempt is made to indicate the position of idiosyncrasies in a classified scheme of all abnormalities; but bodily idiosyncrasies due to an ""allergic"" or hypersensitive response to agents are mainly considered in the present paper. Migraine and mucous colic (""colitis mucosa"") are discussed in connexion with Freeman's view of food idiosyncrasies, hay fever, asthma, urticaria, angioneurotic oedema, &c., as manifestations of an ""immunological abnormality or defect.""The hypothesis that idiosyncratic hypersensitiveness towards physical agents, such as light, heat, cold and mechanical trauma, may in reality be the expression of reaction towards a histamine-like body, or protein of some kind (virtually a ""foreign protein"") liberated in the tissues by the physical agent in question, is referred to, according to the works of W. W. Duke and Sir Thomas Lewis and his co-workers, and the writings of Sir Humphry Rolleston on the subject. A somewhat analogous explanation is suggested for the following conditions: an abnormally hypersensitive (eczema-like) reaction towards formalin lotions; epidermolysis bullosa; constitutional factitious urticaria in otherwise healthy individuals not suffering from ordinary urticaria; excessive liability to chilblains; so-called ""erythrocyanosis"" of the lower parts of the legs in girls and young women, and some cases of Raynaud's disease.The significance of eosinophilia in cases of dermatitis herpetiformis and pemphigus is also alluded to.",['Weber FP'],1928,21,7,Proc R Soc Med,Weber FP.
